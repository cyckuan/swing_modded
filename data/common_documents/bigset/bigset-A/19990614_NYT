MARRIAGES MADE IN HEAVEN, AND OTHERS

<P>
   If the institution of marriage is to thrive into the coming
century, it will need a more articulate defender and a more careful
chronicler than Garry Marshall. He is proud that he and Barbara
have been married for 36 years. May they have 36 more. But just
because you've been socializing for decades, that doesn't make you
a sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, the creator of winning television shows (``Happy
Days'') and movies (``Pretty Woman'') and an appealing comic actor
(``Murphy Brown''), is trying out a new role on Monday night. He is
the host-narrator-interviewer-director of a Showtime documentary,
``Marriage in the 20th Century: In Search of the Happy Ending.'' He
and his film are never less than engaging, but a seasoned pro like
Marshall ought to know that you can't hold an audience for two
hours with good intentions and pallid shtick: ``My wife was a
nurse,'' Marshall says. ``I was a hypochondriac. It was a marriage
made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   This film is the first in a monthly series of documentaries by
directors who are famous, but not for making documentaries. Each
installment is supposed to sum up some aspect of life in the
century. The next three are to be Robert Townsend on sex, Barry
Levinson on the future and Robert Zemeckis on ``smoking, drinking
and drugging.'' Things could get more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's program offers some overlong, under-edited
interviews with people who married (or entered other kinds of
committed relationships) at various points in the century. Most
lived happily ever after. The others split up. They all seem like
likable people, full of the wisdom that comes with experience. But
they don't have anything very interesting to say. And as an
interviewer, Marshall is no Murphy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The best sequence focuses on commercial wedding chapels in Las
Vegas. After paying $35 for a marriage license, you can get hitched
at a drive-in window for $30. A ceremony inside the chapel starts
at $45. Elvis can give the bride away, but that costs extra.
</P>
<P>
   As for historical perspective, there isn't much to be gained
from the film's endless snippets of grainy old home movies,
newsreels and film comedies. Nor is there much insight in
Marshall's apparently ad-libbed lectures: ``I think the pioneers
had not a big choice. There was one farm, one girl, one daughter,
one son. If those two didn't get married, you didn't have much of a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   OK You're not supposed to take all this seriously. But if the
filmmaker is just going to throw the thing together, why should you
take it at all?

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros were a stunned group as they left the Astrodome after
Sunday's game, halted frighteningly when manager Larry Dierker
suffered a grand mal seizure during the bottom of the eighth
inning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I saw the same kind of thing happen to my grandmother in the
Dominican (Republic),'' pitcher Jose Lima said about 90 minutes
later after a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Word had come while Dierker, 52, was en route to Methodist
Hospital that the manager was deemed out of danger and the problem
was not a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started crying,'' Lima said. ``I walked away because I
couldn't stand to see it again. They were trying to hold his legs
down because all you can think about when something like that
happens is to get as much air as you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Dierker always has a smile on his face and is like a
father to us. To see him like that, laying in the dugout, it was
such a shock. We didn't know what it was. It was just scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a great city like this, not in the Third World, and
we're probably three minutes away from a great hospital, and it
seemed like forever before the ambulance came. You can die in 20
minutes. That's how long it must have taken the ambulance to get in
there. It seemed like forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we will all say our prayers for him and carry on as best
as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mitch Meluskey, one of the numerous injury victims this
season among Astros players and coaches, figured the game itself
was meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought something home,'' Meluskey said after the game,
which was suspended with the Astros ahead 4-1, to be resumed when
the Padres return to Houston on July 23-25. ``Thirty-eight thousand
people got to witness it with us, and it was profound testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something really bad like this, when things are really bad,
shows that it's only a baseball game. That's real life, what Larry
Dierker is going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before game time, Dierker was following his routine,
signing autographs for fans standing behind the dugout, then
answering a reporter's questions about the upcoming Braves series,
which begins tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But the routine changed in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible to see something like that happen,'' said
starting pitcher Shane Reynolds. ``We said a team prayer on the
field, and we will continue to pray for him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Billy Wagner, outfielder Glen Barker and infielder
Ricky Gutierrez agreed on the shock of the scene that unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrible thing to see,'' Barker said. ``You realize how
short life can be at a time like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said: ``The game is insignificant. Real life is what
Dierker is going through now. The thing to do is stay positive and
keep praying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to see our skipper like that, and I had never seen
anything like that before,'' Gutierrez said. ``It seemed to take
hours before the ambulance got there.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego manager Bruce Bochy played for the Astros when Dierker
worked for the organization after retiring as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him (Dierker) on Friday, and he said he was
working out,'' Bochy said. ``I had heard he'd had a seizure before
(three years ago in San Diego while working on the Astros' radio
crew). There's no way anyone wanted to continue the game.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego pitching coach Dave Smith, a former Astros pitcher,
said: ``I talked to him on Saturday before the game. I was
concerned that something was not quite right. He wasn't as upbeat
and laughing as he usually is but kind of quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego pitcher Woody Williams, a Houstonian, said: ``I met
him for the first time (during the teams' latest series). I had
come to the Dome to watch him pitch and had listened to him on the
radio. To meet him was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it shows how quickly things can change.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The unsettling images that unfolded in the Astros' dugout during
the eighth inning of Sunday's suspended game won't go away any time
soon _ certainly not for Astros bench coach Matt Galante, who was
seated next to Larry Dierker when the Astros manager's grand mal
seizure began.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the Astros must find a way to move on _ somehow, some way.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be Galante's job to restore some semblance of
normalcy over the next several days. General manager Gerry
Hunsicker tabbed Galante as the natural choice to serve as interim
manager during Dierker's indefinite absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to take over under these circumstances,'' said
Galante, who has been a coach in the Astros organization since 1980
and was considered for the manager's job when the club hired Terry
Collins in November 1993 and Dierker in October 1996. ``I really
don't feel like I'm taking over, because this is Larry's team and
things are going to be done the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante, 49, has been Dierker's right-hand man since the
beginning of last season, when he was named bench coach after Bill
Virdon retired. Galante consults with Dierker on in-game decisions
and has been as involved as any coach on the staff when it comes to
game management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry and Matt work very closely on a day-to-day basis, and
Matt has extensive experience,'' Hunsicker said. ``He knows the
ballclub as well as anyone. I have all the confidence in the world
in him as a replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the impact Dierker's absence will have on the Astros
is almost impossible at this point because it is uncertain how long
he will be out of the dugout. Dierker underwent a series of tests
beginning Sunday night, and the Astros should have a better idea
regarding a timetable once the results are known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know where this is headed,'' Hunsicker said.
``Until they finish running the tests, we won't know where we
stand. I think they'll keep him (in the hospital) for observation
for at least a couple of days. He's certainly not going to come
walking out of there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was in stable condition Sunday night, and Hunsicker said
he was coherent and even cracked a few jokes.
</P>
<P>
   As far as game management is concerned, expect Galante's style
to be similar to Dierker's. Both are popular in the clubhouse and
uphold the theory of letting the players play the game without
excessive interference from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play the game the way we've always played it,''
said Galante, who will be in charge beginning tonight when the
Atlanta Braves visit the Astrodome for a four-game series.
``Hopefully, Larry will be back shortly; until then, we're just
going to try to win them one by one for Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is the third member of the coaching staff to be
sidelined because of illness this season. First-base coach Jose
Cruz is expected to return Friday after receiving treatment for an
irregular heartbeat, and hitting instructor Tom McCraw has been out
since May 17 while undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McCraw was replaced on an interim basis by Harry Spilman, but
Cruz's void was not filled. Until Friday, the Astros will operate
two coaches short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be OK there,'' Galante said. ``I think I can
handle my bench job as well as run the team until Larry gets back.
Cheo (Cruz) will be back (Friday), so that will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the time is right, Galante said he will seek input from
Dierker, who has guided the Astros to back-to-back National League
Central Division titles and has a 223-161 record since replacing
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait a couple of days, and we'll listen to the doctors
and let them tell us when it's OK for that,'' Galante said. ``I
don't want to talk to him about the club until the doctors say it's
OK to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the players were shaken by Sunday's events, and the
clubhouse was uncharacteristically off-limits to the media
following the game. Hunsicker huddled with the team to update the
players on Dierker's status, and he believes the team will move
forward without its leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly testing everyone's emotional strength,''
Hunsicker said. ``We've had more than our share of difficulties
this year. This is not to be taken lightly; it's another big blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (returning to the ballpark today) will seem strange,
but I think everyone will feel better when the test results are in
and we know where we're headed with this. We just need to get to
the point where we know where we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, everyone was stunned and shocked to a certain
extent. This team has bounced back from adversity a number of
times, and it seems to never end. But I have all the confidence in
the world that we will continue to move forward. He'll be in all of
our prayers.''

 By DAVID BARRON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Astros manager Larry Dierker was struck by a violent series of
full-body seizures as he watched the Astros-San Diego Padres game
Sunday afternoon from the Astrodome dugout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dierker was treated by medical personnel for more than 20
minutes before being taken by ambulance from the stadium floor to
Methodist Hospital, where he was reported in stable condition
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Astros spokesman Rob Matwick said tests were under way Sunday
night in an effort to determine the source of the grand mal seizure
that struck Dierker, 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there was no heart or cardiac damage,''
said Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker. ``This could be one of
those strange and inexplicable instances where the body reacts and
then it (the reaction) just goes away. He was conscious, and when
he was on the way to the hospital his condition stabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking to Dierker at the hospital, Hunsicker said the
manager ``was alert, coherent and joking around. He was in good
spirits. He's still going to have a battery of tests, so we're
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams agreed to suspend the game, which the Astros led 4-1
in the bottom of the eighth inning, until the Padres' next trip to
Houston July 23-25.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was stricken in the dugout along the first-base line,
out of view of most of the 39,773 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sitting in his regular spot, and Matty (Astros coach
Matt Galante) was next to him and looked over,'' Hunsicker said.
``He said Larry was looking up and didn't seem like he was himself.
He asked him if he was OK, and the next thing he was seizing.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jeff Bagwell at the plate, a police officer stationed in
the Astros' dugout ran onto the field and motioned toward
paramedics that help was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics and Astros trainer Rex Jones rushed to the home-plate
end of the dugout where Dierker lay. Witnesses said Astros
outfielder Derek Bell tried to stabilize Dierker's body, but the
force of the seizures was such that Bell was nearly thrown clear of
the stricken manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convulsions were pretty much constantly going on,''
Bagwell said. ``It was everything you've heard about seizures. It
was just horrible to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros players huddled around the dugout as fans, who were not
told what was taking place on the field, watched silently from the
stands. Judy Dierker was taken from the stands to be with her
husband, who was administered intravenous fluids and then loaded
into the ambulance for the trip to Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As the ambulance left the Astrodome floor, Astros players
gathered on the field with team chaplain Gene Pemberton for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked the Lord for a miracle to stabilize him,'' Pemberton
said. ``His word says that if we ask anything in the name of Jesus,
he'll give it to us. We just asked him, `Lord, will you do it? Will
you do it for your glory?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he did. He (Dierker) stabilized in five minutes where for
20 minutes he had been having seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   After Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. talked with Padres owner
John Moores, a former Houston resident, the game was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the San Diego players as well as our players, their heart
just wasn't into finishing this game, and the umpires felt the same
way,'' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros officials said the incident began at 3:55 p.m. A Houston
Fire Department spokesman said a 911 call was received at 4:02 p.m.
and an engine, ambulance and medic were dispatched a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   The engine arrived at 4:07 p.m. but was unable to gain access to
the Dome, forcing medical personnel to run from the center-field
gate to the dugout. The ambulance arrived at 4:13 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a response team on the benches, so we are ready to go
at any moment,'' McLane said. ``The fire department does not keep
an ambulance at the Astrodome, but normally the response time is
very good. Response time was not an issue. We had (medical) people
there who are on the bench for every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Payne, Mayor Lee Brown's communications director, expressed
concern that the fire truck was not able to enter the Dome field
and that there was no outside telephone line from the dugout that
would have allowed a more timely 911 call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those issues will be addressed as far as Enron Field (the new
stadium that opens in 2000) is concerned,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros announcer Milo Hamilton, Dierker's broadcast partner for
more than a decade with the team, said Dierker suffered a mild
seizure in June 1996 in San Diego and was hospitalized overnight
for observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been on a lot of medication for an infection,''
Hamilton said. ``In fact, he used to give himself IVs on the plane.
We all thought then that it was just an outgrowth of the medication
he was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters said Dierker appeared to be in good spirits before the
game, playing catch with his son, Ryan. But Padres pitching coach
Dave Smith, a former Astros pitcher, spoke with Dierker on Saturday
and ``something was not quite right. He wasn't as upbeat and
laughing as he usually is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was hospitalized in May 1996 after having fluid drained
from the perocardial sac surrounding his heart. He also suffered
torn ligaments in his thumb as a result of a skiing accident and
twice underwent surgery, the second time in July 1996 as a result
of an infection.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has been with the Astros organization with only brief
interruptions since 1964 and is one of the most popular figures in
the history of Houston baseball. He won 20 games in 1969, pitched a
no-hitter in 1976 and still holds team records for starts, complete
games, shutouts and innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade in the Astros' broadcast booth, he was
named manager in October 1996. He had led the Astros to
back-to-back National League Central Division titles and was named
last year as the league's Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's most grim coincidence was that Dierker was stricken on
the same day that former Astros pitcher J.R. Richard threw out the
ceremonial first pitch. Richard's promising career was cut short
when he suffered a stroke while working out in the Astrodome on
July 30, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Medical problems also have affected the Astros' coaching staff
this year. Hitting coach Tom McCraw is on medical leave while
undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, and first-base coach Jose
Cruz is on leave undergoing treatment for an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ````It has just been one of those very difficult years to get
through,'' Hunsicker said. ``Somehow we are going to get through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante will serve as interim manager beginning tonight, when
the Astros host the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone you care about goes through something like that,
all you can do is pray,'' Bagwell said. ``This puts baseball into
perspective. Obviously we are here to play baseball, but this is
more important than playing a game out there.''

GOP CONTINGENT GETS READY TO FIGHT GUN CONTROL IN HOUSE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ A trio of House Republicans who managed the
effort to impeach President Clinton predicted they will
successfully defend gun owners' rights in a House fight this week
over proposed gun safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is using the National Rifle
Association as a ``red herring'' in an effort to slap more controls
on gun-ownng Americans, said the GOP congressmen during a weekend
visit here.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee Republicans predicted Saturday
that Democrats living in rural areas will join them in trying to
block gun restrictions passed by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is expected to spark verbal fire in the House this
week when the House takes up the Senate-passed juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the votes: You are going to see a coalition of
Republicans and Democrats fight for Second Amendment rights: They
will vote against extreme measures and defend the right to bear
arms,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle's Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott countered that
recent school shootings have turned public opinion in favor of gun
safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans used to accept that there were shootings in our
cities,'' McDermott said. ``They felt that, if you moved to a
suburban area, you would be protected from gun violence. The
Colorado and Georgia shootings show that you are not protected.
Your children are not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he expects Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
longest-serving House Democrat and former board member of the NRA,
to lead the fight for a softer gun-show provision than the one
passed by the Senate last month on a dramatic 51-50 vote. Vice
President Al Gore, as the Senate's presiding officer, broke the
tie.
</P>
<P>
   The three GOP impeachment managers _ Graham, Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. _ visited the
Puget Sound area Saturday to speak at a rally and fund-raising
dinner for the King County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carried with them our strong belief that this president
should be impeached,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., in a fiery
warmup speech for her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn voiced hope that after the 2000 election, ``representatives
like Jim Rogan and Asa Hutchinson will populate the Republican side
of the House of Representatives.'' (Graham was not at the rally,
but spoke at the dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   While looking back proudly at the impeachment effort, the House
Republicans' main focus was the upcoming House firefight over gun
restrictions. Hutchinson later took a ``redeye'' flight to
Washington, D.C., so he could appear Sunday on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert voiced hope last month that the
House would go along with provisions of the Senate bill. But he has
since retreated under fire from GOP troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert comes from ``an anti-gun state'' _ Illinois _ and took
his initial position without consulting Republicans from the South
and West, traditional strongholds of the NRA, Hutchinson said at a
GOP reception here.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Rules Committee have drafted a bill
that includes several Senate-passed provisions _ mandatory child
safety locks and a juvenile Brady law provision barring for life
gun ownership by anyone convicted as a juvenile of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans left out other Senate provisions. Gone is
a ban on the import of ammunition clips holding 10 or more bullets.
Another omitted amendment would direct the Federal Trade Commission
to look into marketing of guns to children.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require background checks on all purchases
at gun shows where 50 or more guns are available. The House bill
exempts gun shows with fewer than 10 vendors, no matter how many
guns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would delay transfer of a gun to a buyer for up
to three business days so a federal tracking system can check for
any felony convictions. The House bill would give the system 72
hours _ even on holiday weekends when records might not be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will sign the bill as passed by the Senate
even though it does not contain all the gun control measures he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens should not be prevented from making ``legal gun
purchases'' when technical means are available to quickly check for
any criminal background, Graham said in arguing for the House
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., took a different view. Inslee lost his
central Washington House seat in 1994 after backing a ban on
semi-automatic assault rifles. He was elected last year to a
suburban Seattle seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic purpose of the Senate bill was to close a
loophole,'' Inslee said. ``Background checks work. They have kept
firearms out of the hands of thousands of convicted criminals. The
question is, do we let people avoid the safety net by walking
around the corner to a show where there are a hundred guns sitting
on a table for sale?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a former judge and gang-crime prosecutor, rejected
Democrats' contention that the Littleton, Colo., killings and other
school shootings make the case for tighter gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 20,000 gun laws on the books in this country that did
not stop what happened at Columbine High School,'' Rogan said in a
weekend interview.
</P>
<P>
   The California Republican charged the Clinton administration
with ``scapegoating,'' and added: ``Taking deaths in schools, and
blaming it on the NRA, is unfortunate and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson drew prolonged applause at Saturday's rally as he put
the issue in stark terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constitutional liberty that gives citizens of this
country the right to bear arms. We should not make it impossible
for citizens, men or women, to defend their family, home and
property,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   A private poll, conducted last month for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, found 80 percent support for expanded
background checks on gun purchases. In results leaked to the press,
it also found 45 percent of all voters less inclined to support a
member of Congress linked to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't place much stock in those polls,'' Rogan said. ``I
know a poll can be skewered by how you word the questions. I know
this: If you ask if people believe in the right to defend
themselves and their families, the answer is an overwhelming yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inslee, by contrast, said he detects that public opinion is
``moving away from ideology'' on gun safety issues. He described
measures pending in Congress as ``modest'' compared with the 1994
assault weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons are many, but basic to it is the steady
accumulation of victims,'' he added. ``Since 1994, more than 1,000
little kids have died in accidental shootings. Those are as much a
part of the carnage as mass homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Littleton so much as one tragedy at a time driving
people toward common sense,'' said Inslee.
</P>
<P>
   The House gun debate this week is likely to be a free-for-all.
``Denny Hastert is just throwing it out to the House to let it go
any way,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will have their eyes on suburban Republicans,
including those who have voted with the NRA. ``Jennifer Dunn is a
perfect example: She is a person who represents a district with
towns like Littleton, Colorado,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Behrens-Benedict, a Democrat who took 40 percent of the
vote against Dunn in 1998, said last week that she is running again
on a gun control platform.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Republicans will join in passing mandatory trigger
locks, and barring lifetime gun ownership for any juvenile who
commits a violent crime. He predicted that the NRA will score
victories as well as suffer defeats on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when this is over, the Democrats will join us in
addressing the media culture of violence that is more responsible
(than guns) for this problem,'' he added.

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ This is an outrage! Laredo, Texas,
was the most consistently hot city in the U.S. last year, eeking
out a win over Lake Havasu City by one day. Laredo and Lake Havasu
folks say what this means (with a little wisdom from the coldest

   RIOT (Phoenix) _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio blames Saturday night's tent
city riot on a flare up of inmate hostilities over smuggled
cigarettes and matches that were used to light mattresses and
toilet paper to set fire to seven tents. Arpaio stood among the
ashes Sunday and watched as a crew of inmates replaced the damaged
tents. He praised guards and deputies for ending what he called a
``bedtime disturbance'' without injury to anyone. Story will move
in ``A'' category. By GRACIELA SEVILLA.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
SLEEP (Phoenix) _ When jurors in the Scott Falater murder trial
begin deliberations later this month, they will wrestle with a
defense scenario that defies common sense: A man stabs his wife 44
times in his sleep, and, still sleeping, drags her into the pool
and holds her head under water. The bloody, protracted mayhem of
Falater's admitted attack weighs heavily against the defense. But
before jurors can reach a verdict on Falater, they must reach a
verdict on Dr. Roger Broughton, a heavyweight in the study of
sleepwalking. Is Broughton a credible scientist or an errant
egghead? &QL;

BICYCLIST OVERCOMES HORRIFIC CRASH, JUMPS ON A BIKE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The sound of her jaw pounding into the pavement
sounded like a potato chip crunching underneath someone's foot.
Carrianne Pullar still remembers the morning rush-hour traffic
whizzing by as she and her mangled bicycle lay helpless on the side
of the road, her jaw shattered.
</P>
<P>
   It's a horrific, full-sensory experience that has understandably
taken a long time for the 29-year-old Pullar to push out of her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this week _ three years after Pullar crashed while riding
her bicycle to work in West Seattle _ she is competing for the
Saturn of Bellevue, Wash., team against some of the world's top
cyclists in the HP LaserJet Women's Challenge in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrianne has a lot of spirit,'' said Pullar's aunt Ann
Fonken, who raised her.
</P>
<P>
   That is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   On her way to work at a downtown Seattle bicycle messenger
service in February 1996, the front wheel of Pullar's bike suddenly
came off as she pedaled downhill on a freeway on-ramp. Pullar
tumbled head first, face down into the road. She wasn't wearing a
helmet and the impact shattered her jaw so severely a titanium
plate was inserted and her mouth wired shut. Her teeth were so
badly damaged she couldn't chew for 18 months; during that time she
lost 23 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part for Pullar was dealing with the massive doses of
morphine being pumped into her body to relieve the intense pain
during her weeklong hospital stay. For this self-proclaimed
``health nut,'' candy bars were foreign to her body _ forget
prescription narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs I was on made me depressed and nauseous and I kept
thinking that I was going to vomit through my wires and choke to
death like Jimi Hendrix,'' Pullar said. ``The more I worried about
it, the worse the nausea got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely ready to hang up the bike. I had decided God
was trying to tell me something _ that maybe I needed to take up
golf or tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Pullar's uncle, Lance Fonken, stepped in. As hard as
it was for the family to see Pullar depressed and in pain, Fonken
firmly reminded his young niece that she never had quit on anything
in her life. She was an accomplished soccer player and equestrian
and had been a good high school track athlete while growing up in
Renton, about 10 miles southwest of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Like being thrown from a horse, Pullar knew she had to get right
back in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for her rehabilitation, the summer of 1996 was
beautiful and she summoned the courage to not only start riding a
bike again but to take a job as a bicycle messenger in downtown
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Her first day on the job, Pullar had to deliver a package from
the company's office on First Hill to a shop at Pike Place Market,
meaning she had to travel down one of the city's steepest streets,
Columbia Street.
</P>
<P>
   It was a daunting assignment not only because Pullar had to
repress memories of her crash, but also because of her fear of
heights. Her aunt remembers taking the family to the Green River
Gorge when her niece was a youngster and Pullar was so terrified
she wouldn't come near the bridge's scenic overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working as a messenger forced me to ride knowing I had to make
a living,'' said Pullar. ``It also helped force me to ride again
without reliving the accident every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got on the bike, I had a death grip on the handle
bars and I wouldn't let up on the brakes. I had to learn not to be
intimidated. After all this was the one thing _ riding a bicycle _
that I had always enjoyed doing my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of deliveries and hundreds of casual rides later,
Pullar's competitive urges returned. Her first big test came in the
1997 Messenger World Championships in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   While running in the middle of the pack, Pullar was caught in a
chain-reaction accident that started in front of her. She injured
her hand in the pileup but her psyche got through it unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   She got back up and nothing's kept her down since.
</P>
<P>
   Pullar normally rides 250-350 miles a week through mountainous
terrain when training for a road race, such as the one this week in
Idaho. Her effort on the local road racing circuit during the past
two years caught the attention of noted Seattle rider Leigh
Fulwood, who invited her to ride for the highly regarded Saturn
team.
</P>
<P>
   Pullar has responded with seven wins in 10 races this season for
Saturn of Bellevue. A good showing in Idaho would help advance her
into a more competitive category on the North American Road Racing
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Challenge is a 12-day event that covers 693 miles
and 13,870 vertical feet. It has 13 stages that feature eight road
races _ one with a climb of more than 3,000 feet through the
mountains of southwest Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   (As of Stage 6 Sunday, Pullar was in 87th place after riding the
25-mile Massacre Rock State Park course.)
</P>
<P>
   Normally this kind of grueling event would intimidate the best
of competitors, but not Pullar, not after what she's been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with faith in yourself and faith in God,''
Pullar said. ``He never throws anything your way that you can't
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I realize I don't want to be 80 years old, looking
back at the what-ifs. Women of our generation have so much going
for us and I want to take advantage of that, not take it for
granted.''

LAREDO'S HOTTER? HOLY HAVASU! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a red-hot outrage. It is an affront that we should not
take lying down in the shade. The entire state should be up in arms
_ sweaty, sunburned arms.
</P>
<P>
   Any Arizonan knows that Lake Havasu City, with triple-digit
temperatures as common as blown saves by the Diamondbacks' bullpen,
is the hottest place in the country, right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Weatherwise'' magazine, Lake Havasu City was only
the second-most consistently hot city last year. The hottest?
</P>
<P>
   Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo was the hottest place in the 48 contiguous states on 34
days in 1998, while Lake Havasu City _ No. 1 a year earlier _
topped the nation on 33 days. Close but no sunburn. Talk about a
matter of degrees . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Happily, Lake Havasu enjoys the lead in the long-term
competition, scoring the top temperature 511 days in the '90s.
Bullhead City is second at 202.)
</P>
<P>
   So what are we going to do about it? Is Lake Havasu going to
cook the books? Place the official thermometer on a molten strip of
asphalt?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's all in God's hands,'' said Bonnie Barsness,
director of the Lake Havasu Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say she wouldn't welcome a little divine
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like notoriety here in Lake Havasu,'' Barsness said,
laughing. ``It's actually all part of our marketing plan. It gets
us on the national weather all across the nation. It keeps Lake
Havasu on the forefront of people's mind as a hot tourism
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what an attraction searing heat can be. To
suntan-lotion magnates anyway.
</P>
<P>
   `NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT'
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it doesn't sound as if Laredo is all that excited
over the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of first place can be good news if treated the right
way,'' said Miguel Conchas, president of the Laredo Chamber of
Commerce, ``(but) certainly it's nothing to brag about when you're
trying to attract business to the city. I don't think anybody's
going to want to keep the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Please. He's just sandbagging. Why else would the Laredo Chamber
incorporate jalapeno peppers into its logo?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that the city was hot in more ways than one,''
Conchas said. ``We take advantage of the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Busted.
</P>
<P>
   Barsness noted that the weather didn't really heat up in Lake
Havasu until July last year. The opposite effect in Laredo may have
let that city wrest away the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been hot here, but _ maybe it had something to do
with El Nino _ last year it was unusually hot,'' Conchas said.
``This year, it's turning out to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   You see? Already he's angling for next year's crown. And this in
a place that is usually between a paltry 105 and 110 degrees in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you go over 110, it tends to be unusual,'' Conchas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Any time it's 110 in Lake Havasu, it tends to be unusual as well
_ people wonder why it's so frigid.
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER EXTREME
</P>
<P>
   Offensive as it may be for an Arizonan to do so, I had to ask
Conchas the Question: Is it a dry heat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, I think things have changed over the last few
years,'' he said. ``South Texas used to be a very dry heat, but
humidity has been on the rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Good. At least they're suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so are we. Even if Arizona is no longer home to the
absolute hottest spot, it's still brain-scramblingly hot here. Ah,
to be in Stanley, Idaho, the coldest spot in the contiguous United
States last year. A call last week to the city offices found
Connie-Roze Burr, city clerk, who issued this weather report:
``It's snowing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's June.
</P>
<P>
   Then again the low that day was only 29 degrees. In the winter,
Burr said, temperatures range ``from 32 to 49 below.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry about Burr. She uttered a familiar refrain when
talking about the cold in Stanley: ``It's not the same kind of
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dry one, no doubt. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
YOU lean against the wall in his office or maybe stand next to him
behind the cage at Astros batting practice. And you just talk.
</P>
<P>
   About nothing. About everything.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to like being around Larry Dierker. You
listen to what he has to say, and you take it all in. It's not
always about baseball; most often it's not.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the weather, his beloved Rockets, the food at a
restaurant, a good bottle of wine, the headlines in the day's paper
and whatever it is that happens to be behind that sly, crooked
smile of his.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has been around the Astros for what seems like forever _
ever since he took the mound as an 18-year-old and struck out
Willie Mays in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to like the man _ the amble, the hands on
the hips, the head tilted to one side as if he's trying to figure
it all out.
</P>
<P>
   If Nolan Ryan, Jose Cruz, Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell are the
greatest stars in the history of this franchise, then Dierker
epitomizes it. He has embroidered himself across the fabric of this
club. He was an Astro then, an Astro now, and he'll be an Astro
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The priceless news we received Sunday evening, only moments
after things could not have appeared more grim, was that, yes,
Dierker should be around for quite a while more. Thank God. And
thank God for Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   In this job, you always try to be objective, to walk the middle
of the road. But Dierker is one of those rare ones who makes it
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   You're always on his side. You always want him to win games,
because he deserves to win. He deserves to hop across the floor of
the Dome on some October night, flashing that smile, hugging
players and jumping around like a kid because he just won the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But this is about Dierker's winning a game none of us even knew
he was playing _ the one for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was sitting next to bench coach Matt Galante a little
before 4 p.m. Sunday afternoon, no doubt loving what he saw only
minutes earlier _ a grand slam by Derek Bell that gave the Astros a
4-1 lead over the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   He suddenly pitched his head backward as his face turned flush.
Galante asked Dierker if he felt all right. Dierker raised both his
arms over his head and hunched his shoulders as if to take a deep
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dierker was on the floor, convulsing uncontrollably in a
violent seizure. His body contorted. His limbs flailed wildly. He
bounced on the floor of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer sprinted to the field and waved for medical
personnel to come help. Players rushed around the dugout to see
what was happening and could not believe what Dierker was
experiencing. His mouth was salivating, his body shaking.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure was classified as a grand mal seizure, the most
violent known. It can be fatal. It can be caused by anything from a
serious neurological disturbance to simple sleep deprivation. It
lasted five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. Just call it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not something you would ever want to see,'' Bagwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   It shocked nearly 40,000 fans into total silence. Biggio
crouched in front of the dugout and clenched his St. Christopher
medal between his teeth. Jose Lima ran to the opposite corner of
the dugout and cried, bowing his head and praying.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett covered his eyes with his hands and shook his head.
Judy Dierker rushed from the stands and stood by her husband's
side. Glen Barker kissed the cross on his necklace. Mike Hampton
took off his cap and began waving it above Dierker, trying to get
him some air.
</P>
<P>
   And there were heroes in the middle of it all _ real heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to reach Dierker, Bell did everything he could
to help, grabbing his manager's arms and legs as he convulsed and
not leaving Dierker's side until more paramedics arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Jones, the Astros' trainer, jumped to the scene and acted
admirably in every way. Jones wrapped his arms around Dierker, kept
him from swallowing his tongue and barked instructions throughout.
</P>
<P>
   When the ambulances finally arrived, Judy Dierker jumped into
the front seat as her husband was carted into the back. Biggio
patted the side of the ambulance as it drove off.
</P>
<P>
   The team gathered around chaplain Gene Pemberton, their arms
around one another, and prayed. Umpire Brian Runge crossed himself,
then suspended the game. The crowd walked away silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is insignificant,'' Astros pitcher Billy Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't about baseball. It was about a guy you love to be
around. It was about hoping that the next few days will provide
some sort of answer or medication that can control Dierker's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   And then this game can be picked up July 23 when the Padres come
back to town. See you there, Dierk.

INTERLEAGUE FORMAT HAS WORN THIN IN NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You can come out now. Yes, you. The real baseball fan.
The purist.
</P>
<P>
   The siege _ or should we say the scourge? _ of interleague play
is over. For now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, for some of us _ myself, for instance _ a week of root
canals stood in the way of really caring that the Mariners were
playing pointless games against National League West teams.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some baseball purists might even suggest a serious bout
of dentistry is preferable to devoting precious time and attention
to interleague action _ unless you're in New York, where Mets vs.
Yankees is perfect fodder for the over-the-top fans in the Bronx
and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of in-city subway series or cross-state rivalry
(Cleveland-Reds) is the only thing interleague is good for. And
it's good for only one, two-game series a season.
</P>
<P>
   Back here at home, however, where there is no natural NL rival,
the urge is to insist that games against the Yankees or Rangers
would have provided real whiffs of history, meaning, bad blood,
delicious rivalry, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But no, the ruse continued. Instead of more Derek Jeter and Tino
Martinez, instead of Rafael Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez, the
Mariners spent the last nine games toiling at this failing
marketing ploy called interleague.
</P>
<P>
   The M's were first sent to San Diego on their Bud Selig-enforced
march on the dark side of their baseball moon, as if seeing
Sterling Hitchcock again was anything Mariner fans cared a hoot
about.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it was off to Colorado for a thin-air, thinner plot-line
battle against the Rockies. Just because Denver has a nutty
ballyard built for NFL-sized scores doesn't mean innocent teams
from the AL West have to serve time there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Giants were in town this weekend, giving Seattle
baseball fans the rare chance to see three-time National League MVP
Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mariners fan yesterday relished witnessing Bonds come
up as a pinch hitter with the bases loaded in an eighth inning when
the Giants would come back to score five runs and swipe the 8-4
victory?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Bonds at-bat, even though he walked, was the flash of
gratification interleague is geared to provide. But even Bonds
might be the first one to say something's got to give with this
whole interleague affair. During Saturday night's game, with the
M's trailing but making a charge in the sixth inning, Bonds watched
as a routine fly ball off the bat of Ken Griffey Jr. dropped right
next to him in short left center.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds was charged with an error, although the trickery of
interleague is that it challenges even the best players to get real
comfy, real quick, in unfamiliar stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bonds, though, baseball in general deserves an ``E'' for
this already worn out ``novelty'' called interleague.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: you can buy a T-shirt at Target that
holds its shape and color longer than this interleague thing. And
apparently almost everyone outside of the marketing gurus in
baseball agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Three years into this unnecessary experiment, interleague is old
and tired.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillies and Orioles are locked into two series, it's
overkill. When the Cardinals and Tigers are suddenly scheduled to
play each other six times, you would have to say something is
seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is so disappointed with interleague overkill even
he said interleague play ``doesn't do anything for the game'' and
went so far as to say ``we should go back to the way baseball
should be played.''
</P>
<P>
   However, instead of an outright order for interleague to cease
and desist _ as some purists would justifiably insist _ there is a
growing groundswell for, at the very least, some sort of
interleague modification.
</P>
<P>
   The hope that AL West and NL West teams would stir up rivalries
over time is not happening, so something else is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't everybody get to play everybody?'' Mariner first
baseman David Segui said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alex Rodriguez, a self-proclaimed baseball purist who has
maintained his allegiance to the old-fashioned schedule, said teams
should not be locked into an unalterable home-and-home schedule
against the same teams every season. ``We should adjust the
schedule to play different teams every season,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, A-Rod is a natural to root for a chance to play not
only against the Giants, Rockies, Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Padres,
but against the Mets and the Marlins. Born in New York and raised
in Miami, those were the first two teams A-Rod picked as his top
choices for new interleague series for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a way to spice things up,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the lords of baseball get the message, interleague isn't
toast, it's just bland as oatmeal, which is a good food substitute
for dental patients but pablum for baseball.

MARINER DEFENSE THROWS ONE AWAY TO GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Kingdome has two weeks of baseball life left in
it, but Sunday everyone acted as if they already had moved across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   For the first game this season, the local ballyard did not
permit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   For one of those rare occasions over the past two decades, a
Dome encounter was decided strictly by defense.
</P>
<P>
   And in one brief, excitable instance, the Mariners threw it all
away, losing 8-4 to the San Francisco Giants before a crowd of
33,500.
</P>
<P>
   Three and a half hours of finesse baseball came down to one Jose
Paniagua lob to second.
</P>
<P>
   In his hands, the reliever had a two-run, eighth-inning lead and
a rally-killing, double-play ball. When he let it go, everything
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua threw high and inside to Alex Rodriguez, pulling the
shortstop off base and bringing the first round of interleague play
to a demoralizing end for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Home for just three games against the Giants, the M's head to
Detroit and Cleveland for eight games, starting the first of four
against the Tigers on Monday. Then it's home for the final six
games at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Put to waste Sunday was another superb effort by rookie pitcher
John Halama. Ruined was an unusually patient hitting approach
against Giants ace Russ Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a downer Manager Lou Piniella refused to speak about
it afterward, as did Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Halama said, remembering a Class AAA playoff
game he botched with an errant throw. ``Paniagua is going to keep
getting called back out there. Hopefully, he can stay mentally
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama and Ortiz had no problems there. They matched each other
pitch for pitch. Both starters got through six innings, allowed
just five hits and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, the M's played on San Francisco's terms
and seemed to revel in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely what a National League game feels like,''
said Butch Huskey, the Mariners' NL import in right field. ``It was
low scoring. It had a quick pace to it. Whoever gets the edge,
wins. They made the plays when they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants felt lucky to leave town with two victories in three
tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not sad leaving this place, but any time you
come in here and win two from this club in this building, you've
done a good job,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 4-2 lead into the eighth inning, but quickly
got in trouble when Paniagua was touched for singles by Bill
Mueller and Armando Rios, the first two hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The reliever regrouped himself and got Jeff Kent on a called
strike. Against the next hitter, Stan Javier, Paniagua made the
pitch, but not thethrow.
</P>
<P>
   Javier bounced one right back to the mound, Paniagua wheeled to
second base and misfired. E-one.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez caught the ball, but couldn't drag his foot across the
bag. His timing off, the shortstop's throw couldn't nab Javier at
first either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out and talked to him, and it seemed like everything
was fine,'' catcher Tom Lampkin said of his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, however, walked a pinch-hitting Barry Bonds on five
pitches to force in a run and draw the hook from Piniella. The
Mariners were still on top, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jose Mesa entered. He also made the right pitch. This
time, the catch didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   On his second offering, Mesa got J.T. Snow to send a foul ball
sailing toward the Seattle bullpen. Third baseman John Mabry gave
chase, as did left fielder Brian Hunter and Rodriguez, all
converging at the same time. Reliever Jordan Zimmerman, serving as
a bullpen sentry, scrambled to get out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   As Mabry reached for the ball, Rodriguez bumped him. Mabry's hat
was knocked off. The ball fell untouched. The official scorer ruled
no play. Another missed opportunity and more agony.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Snow grounded one between first and second to
drive in the tying and go-ahead runs, and the Mariners had given it
all away. The Giants would put together a five-run burst before all
the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the visitors got six outs in the inning. In any
ballpark, and especially in the Kingdome, that's nearly impossible
to overcome.

INTERLEAGUE FORMAT HAS WORN THIN IN NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for previous to charify yeserday as Sunday.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You can come out now. Yes, you. The real baseball fan.
The purist.
</P>
<P>
   The siege _ or should we say the scourge? _ of interleague play
is over. For now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, for some of us _ myself, for instance _ a week of root
canals stood in the way of really caring that the Mariners were
playing pointless games against National League West teams.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some baseball purists might even suggest a serious bout
of dentistry is preferable to devoting precious time and attention
to interleague action _ unless you're in New York, where Mets vs.
Yankees is perfect fodder for the over-the-top fans in the Bronx
and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of in-city subway series or cross-state rivalry
(Cleveland-Reds) is the only thing interleague is good for. And
it's good for only one, two-game series a season.
</P>
<P>
   Back here at home, however, where there is no natural NL rival,
the urge is to insist that games against the Yankees or Rangers
would have provided real whiffs of history, meaning, bad blood,
delicious rivalry, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But no, the ruse continued. Instead of more Derek Jeter and Tino
Martinez, instead of Rafael Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez, the
Mariners spent the last nine games toiling at this failing
marketing ploy called interleague.

CIGARETTES LIT RIOT AT SHERIFF ARPAIO'S TENT CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio blames Saturday night's Tent City
riot on a flare-up of inmate hostilities over smuggled cigarettes
and matches, which were then used to light mattresses and toilet
paper to set fire to seven tents.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio stood among the ashes Sunday and watched as a crew of
inmates replaced the damaged tents. He praised guards and deputies
for ending what he called a ``bedtime disturbance'' without injury
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he suspected the inmates obtained the cigarettes
from visitors who smuggled them in or while they were outside the
jail yard working on the chain gang.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the sheriff noted, ``there's a contraband problem.''
He said security measures for visits would be tightened.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising of about 200 inmates started about 9 p.m. Saturday
as a ``Star Wars'' bedtime story was being broadcast to the inmates
over the jail-yard loudspeakers. Bedtime Story Hour, the sheriff's
latest inmate program, kicked off this month and is designed to
increase literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said it took guards and deputies ``five minutes'' to
quiet the uproar by using patrol dogs and pepper spray to gain
control of the convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials and inmates reported that guards brought
the melee under control in about an hour. Despite the difference in
time lines, Saturday's riot ended quickly compared with the first
Tent City riot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, more than 300 inmates battled guards in a fiery riot
that left two guards and three prisoners injured. That uprising
lasted more than four hours and was finally stopped after an armed
National Guard squad tore down barricades inmates had made from
their bunks.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said his department learned from that experience and was
better prepared to respond to Saturday's crisis. He credited extra
training for the guards, new equipment and ``good intelligence''
about brewing tensions with helping to bring a safe, quick end to
latest flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   Tent City guards reportedly had noticed tensions among inmates
Friday. Arpaio said one theory was that gang differences may have
sparked the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other is that they don't like my bedtime stories,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Pool, jailed because of parole violations and a member
of Tent City's maintenance crew, said he was just relieved no one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's fire, there's a possibility somebody could
get hurt or die,'' Pool said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the second Tent City riot in less than three
years, Arpaio said he intended to continue the highly criticized
open-air housing, where inmates sat sweltering Saturday as
temperatures reached 105 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tents will always be here. They're not going anywhere,''
he said. ``This is only the second little disturbance in the whole
jail system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a group of 35 inmates suspected of leading
the uprising were moved to the Towers Jail. Arpaio said deputies
were still working on identifying the culprits, most of whom
covered their faces with towels as the fires were started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try and identify them,'' Arpaio said. ``They
will be charged with arson and starting a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional 100 inmates were displaced by the fire and moved
to other jail facilities. Tent City visits have been temporarily
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   As for the damage, Arpaio said there was little cost associated
with replacing the burned tents because he had other military
surplus tents in storage and was using inmate labor. &QL;

SCHEFFER NINTH ROOKIE PITCHER TO JOIN MARINERS STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mixed among the plastic-coated name plates lining the
Mariner clubhouse Sunday was a piece of white tape fastened atop a
once spare cubicle, a name hastily scribbled on it with black felt
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer, 57.
</P>
<P>
   This would be Aaron Scheffer, the ninth rookie pitcher to join
the Mariner staff this season, a roster replacement for Rafael
Carmona and a sign of how rapidly things turn over in the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Carmona was injured Saturday night, suffering a triceps strain
to his throwing arm while working in late-inning relief during a
15-11 defeat to the San Francisco Giants. He was placed on the
15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer, a hard-throwing right-hander was recalled from Class
AAA Tacoma and joined the club midway through Sunday's contest
after traveling from Las Vegas. He pitched the ninth inning against
the Giants only hours after landing in Seattle and gave up a run on
two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Carmona felt ``a shock'' in the back of his right elbow on his
32nd pitch Saturday night and immediately was taken to the Mariner
training room. Sunday, he said his arm still ached, even when he
walked.
</P>
<P>
   The arm trouble was particularly disheartening for the Puerto
Rico native, who had rejoined the Mariners a month ago after a
one-year absence. He spent that time recovering from injuries,
including a broken right arm, suffered in a 1998 auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give up,'' Carmona said. ``I have to keep working,
keep trying and get healthy again, and try to get back throwing the
way I was when I came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer, 23, started the season with Class AA New Haven. He
comes to the Mariners with a reputation as a control pitcher,
striking out 26 hitters and walking just five in 251/3 innings at
Tacoma. He was 1-2 with a 1.42 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws strikes,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``He keeps the
ball down. Good sinker. Good changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE FIFTH: Frankie Rodriguez will make his second start
for the Mariners tomorrow at Detroit, even after pitching in relief
Saturday night. Luckily for him, his two-thirds of an inning
against the Giants required only three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez (1-0) came to the Mariners as a reliever, claimed off
waivers May 26 from the Minnesota Twins' Class AAA entry, Salt Lake
City. He picked up a victory as a starter in Colorado last week,
allowing seven hits and three runs during a five-inning stint.
</P>
<P>
   In four big league seasons, Rodriguez has been predominantly a
starter, drawing 77 opening assignments. In 1996, he made 33 starts
for the Twins, going 13-14 with a 5.05 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to contribute,'' he said. ``Every day to be in the
big leagues is a plus. My heart is still saying I'm a starter, but
if their plans are to make me a reliever, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, however, hasn't had much success against Detroit. In
10 games, his ERA is 7.99. Only the Texas Rangers have hit him
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stink in Detroit,'' he said. ``I was checking the numbers.
I'll see if I can turn that around.''
</P>
<P>
   TIGER TALE: Six weeks after leaving the Motor City, Mariner left
fielder Brian Hunter returns to face his old club Monday. No
problem, says the former Tiger of two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left on great terms,'' Hunter said. ``Both times I've been
traded, I left on good terms. I'm a pretty easy person.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he doesn't miss is Tiger Stadium, scheduled for
demolition once Detroit's new ballpark opens next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst playing surface in baseball,'' Hunter said.
``The grass is so old. The drainage system is old. I wish they
could have strictly replaced the playing surface and kept the
stadium, because it's so traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINT: Addressing Mariners at team chapel service Sunday
was Seahawk place-kicker Todd Peterson, a spiritually minded
individual who for five seasons has made this an annual outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique situation because guys who come and speak to
them are not usually athletes,'' the kicker said. ``I can tell them
maybe I know what they're going through. It's a neat deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson also questions his fellow pro athletes on their
commitment as role models. Are they speaking to school kids and
others because they want to, or because they have to?
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask them to consider, `Am I really trying to make a
difference?''' he said. ``That's a huge thing for us as athletes.
We have a platform. Other than politicians, we're listened to more
than anyone else in the country. I hope we are.''
</P>
<P>
   SICK LIST: M's catcher Dan Wilson was a late scratch Saturday
because of the flu. He showed up at the ballpark Sunday, but didn't
play for the second straight day, giving way to backup Tom Lampkin.
Wilson was on the flight for Detroit last night, and he's expected
to return to the lineup.

   PHOENIX _ When jurors in the Scott Falater murder trial begin
deliberations later this month, they will wrestle with a defense
scenario that defies common sense:
</P>
<P>
   A man stabs his wife 44 times in his sleep, and, still sleeping,
drags her into the pool and holds her head under water.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody, protracted mayhem of Falater's admitted attack
weighs heavily against the defense. But before jurors can reach a
verdict on Falater, they must reach a verdict on Dr. Roger
Broughton, a heavyweight in the study of sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Is Broughton a credible scientist or an errant egghead?
</P>
<P>
   Broughton is the Canadian physician, neurology professor and
sleep-disorders researcher who last week testified that
sleepwalking ``is by far the most probable'' explanation of
Falater's admitted killing of his wife in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, who came to the trial with the resume of an academic
superstar and an easygoing manner, is the star witness for the
defense against the state's charge that Falater committed
premeditated murder.
</P>
<P>
   As Judge Ronald Reinstein told the jury, the prosecution's duty
to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt means the jury can
convict Falater only if they are ``firmly convinced'' he
deliberately killed his wife of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Broughton based his opinion partially on a scientific
analysis of Falater's sleeping patterns and brain waves, he also
relied on a chain of subjective conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said Falater had no motive, acted with typical
sleepwalker illogic, was ``obviously very distressed and confused''
after police arrested him, and had complete amnesia about the
events on that bloody night in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, who is expected to testify this week, must persuade the
jury that he did not con the amiable Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Former defense attorney Michael Perlin said Falater's defense
``almost has to put his guy (Falater) on the stand, because the
defense is so contrary to what jurors think of as common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a defense attorney, you need to give the jury a sense of
who he truly is,'' said Perlin, whose criminal-law classes at New
York University often discuss mental condition as a defense.
``Juries are incredibly suspicious of anything they think can be
feigned.''
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed facts are that Scott Falater stabbed Yarmila
Falater 44 times with a hunting knife, dragged her into the pool at
their home and pushed her head under water.
</P>
<P>
   How could it be, prosecutor Juan Martinez has repeatedly asked _
sometimes with sarcasm and always with righteous outrage _ that
Falater was not jarred back to consciousness by the gory mayhem,
the screams of his wife, the cold water of the pool, the need to
put a bandage on his cut right hand?
</P>
<P>
   Falater, a former Motorola engineer who holds several patents on
electric devices, admits he's a killer. But he says that under the
law he did not commit murder because he didn't know what he was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case about who did it or how it was done,''
defense attorney Michael Kimerer told the jury in his opening
statement. ``What we're going to prove to you in this case is that
knowing consciousness was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer has told the jury that his client was in ``an
automatistic, somnambulistic state'' as he arose from bed, went
downstairs to the garage to change into work clothes, took a knife
to pry out a defective O-ring from the pool pump, then went into a
frenzy when his wife interrupted him.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's movements after the stabbing were described by a
neighbor, who saw Falater walk through his upstairs bedroom, come
back downstairs, make a calming motion to one of the family dogs,
return to the body and re-enter the house. The neighbor said
Falater emerged from the garage, putting on a pair of gloves,
dragged Yarmila to the pool deck, rolled her into the pool and held
her head under.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton estimates that Falater was sleepwalking for 45
minutes, a period that he acknowledges is unusually long.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, whose academic writing about violence by sleepwalkers
includes an article titled ``Dangerous Behaviours by Night,'' said
that until recently researchers thought violent outbursts were
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are much more common than we used to think,'' he
said. He added that violence can be triggered by someone who
interferes with a sleepwalker.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer, who guided Broughton through a slide-show seminar about
sleepwalking, is attempting to convince jurors that Falater's
defense, however improbable it may seem, is enough to create
reasonable doubt about his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   He is presenting the attack as a wild, unconscious eruption in
the placid sea of the Falater home, where there was no history of
violence or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In laying out his case, Kimerer has offered answers to some
nagging prosecution questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Why would Falater use a hunting knife to work on the pool pump?
</P>
<P>
   Because Falater needed a pointed object to pry a defective
O-ring out of the leaking pump, Kimerer says.
</P>
<P>
   _Isn't the fact that Falater threw his wife into the pool proof
that he was trying to finish her off?
</P>
<P>
   No, Kimerer says. In fact, leaving the body floating in the
crimson water is exactly the sort of bizarre, illogical act that is
characteristic of sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   _If he's innocent, why would Falater hide his bloody clothes in
a Tupperware container that he placed inside a plastic bag and
stashed in the wheel well of his car?
</P>
<P>
   Falater wasn't hiding anything, Kimerer says. He was simply
returning the work clothes to where he always kept them.
</P>
<P>
   When Broughton came to the witness stand last week, Kimerer
walked him through a lengthy list of credentials intended to show
that Broughton is not an opportunistic pseudoscientist offering
tailor-made testimony for a fat check.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Broughton is an internationally respected authority on
sleepwalking. He is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Canada, a professor of neurology at the University of
Ottawa and the director of a sleep disorders center. He has
received an award for lifetime achievement from the American Sleep
Disorders Association.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said his work for Falater marked only his second
experience in a case where sleepwalking was the defense. The first
involved a Canadian man who was acquitted of murder, he said, and
he once turned down a lawyer whose client he believed to have been
lying.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded, bald, bespectacled Broughton matched the Hollywood
image of an expert witness. He maintained his professorial demeanor
even as Martinez asked incredulously if Broughton truly believed
that Falater was unaware of the mayhem he was causing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe that's possible,'' he said. ``I believe that's
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Broughton acknowledged that some aspects of Falater's story had
made him ``pause'' on the way to his conclusion. But he said he
overcame those reservations after a complete review.
</P>
<P>
   If Falater is to walk out of the courtroom a free man, the
jurors _ only one of whom has been to college _ will also have to
put skepticism aside.
</P>
<P>
   That skepticism was apparent in some jurors' questions,
including one asking if the study of sleep disorders relied heavily
on speculation rather than science. Broughton responded that he and
his colleagues have ``very detailed knowledge about a large variety
of sleep disorders.'' &QL;

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels took one on the chin Sunday, their
3-1, 13-inning loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks just another in a
long line of setbacks due to a lack of offense. But it was nothing
like the blow rookie outfielder Mike Colangelo took in his
major-league debut before 29,176 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo, who joined the team Sunday after being called up from
Triple-A Edmonton the night before, was carried off the field after
a frightening collision with teammate Reggie Williams in
left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the looks of it, Colangelo was OK and back in the
clubhouse after a visit to UCI Medical Center. He was diagnosed
with a mild concussion and a sprained left thumb. X-rays on his
cervical spine and left hand were normal.
</P>
<P>
   The play took place in the top of the seventh inning when Steve
Finley hit a liner into the left-center field gap. Both Colangelo
and Williams raced for the ball and collided just as Williams made
the catch. Colangelo's head snapped back on impact and he lay
motionless on the grass until Angels trainers Rick Smith and Ned
Bergert arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he said, `You got it,' but he said `I got it,'''
Colangelo said. ``By that time I tried to get out of the way, but
it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day Colangelo said he'll never forget. He singled in
his first major-league at-bat, drew a walk and also threw out a
baserunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my first hit, my first assist and I got knocked out,''
he said. ``It was an exciting day.... Reggie's a big guy. Running
full speed, it was like getting hit by a free safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me there should be some NFL scouts looking for me
now,'' Williams said. ``But when I play center field, what I do is
I go for the ball until I hear somebody call it. He said he didn't
think I could get to the ball. It was scary. I thought I heard
something snap.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing snapped. Including the Angels' hitting slump. They
scored only one run on nine hits in 13 innings, wasting a solid
start by starter Omar Olivares (81/3 innings, 1 run, 6 hits).
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to start executing the offense,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``We did some things, we moved some guys
around. We just have got to get some hits.... We did the little
things, but we've got to get them in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks started their winning rally with one out in the
13th with Kelly Stinnett's single off losing pitcher Mark Petkovsek
(5-2). Tony Womack got the big hit, driving a pitch into the
left-center field gap, scoring pinch-runner Hanley Frias from
first. Womack took third when shortstop Andy Sheets' relay throw
went all the way to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   It cost the Angels a run, because Jay Bell followed with a
sacrifice fly to make it 3-1. It turned out it didn't matter,
because Gregg Olson set the Angels down in order in the bottom of
the 13th to earn his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Neither starting pitcher allowed a run through six innings, and
both were helped by the double-play ball. Olivares got double plays
in four of the first six innings and Diamondbacks starter Omar Daal
got three. By the end of the game, there were eight double plays in
the game, the most in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares tied a major-league record of hitting four batters in a
game. Angels teammate Steve Sparks also did it May 22. But Olivares
said it as a result of the Diamondbacks hitters' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pitching inside because most of them were looking for my
sinker and diving out over the plate,'' Olivares said. ``The balls
were not really that far inside, but it's hard to get out of the
way when you're diving over the plate.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
OMAHA, Neb. _ Early on, it looked like it would be 0-2 and barbecue
for the Rice Owls.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the College World Series, a team that loses two games is
eliminated and goes home, usually to a team barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   But you can hold the sauce for now.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a shaky start from pitcher Kenny Baugh, the Owls beat
Oklahoma State 7-2 at Rosenblatt Stadium on Sunday night, surviving
to play another day.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's doubleheader _ Miami beat Alabama 8-1 in a
winners-bracket opener _ drew 24,859, setting a CWS session
attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   With its win, Rice upped its school-record victory total to 59 _
against 14 losses _ and moved on to another elimination game
against Alabama at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday. Oklahoma State finished
46-21.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh struggled with his location until the fourth inning, then
settled in and systematically cut the Cowboys down. In the first
two innings, he overcame a pair of bases-loaded, none-out
predicaments, allowing no runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of innings, I had a little adrenaline going _
maybe a little too much,'' Baugh said. ``I was short-arming
everything. But once I settled down, I was OK. I basically settled
down after I got out of those jams. I was more in the zone and
challenged the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh (12-2) lasted 7 innings, allowing nine hits and two earned
runs while walking four and striking out five. He threw 130
pitches, his last deposited as a solo homer by Toby Rhodes to draw
OSU within 6-2. Jeff Nichols threw 1 scoreless innings of relief to
close the Cowboys out.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh gave up back-to-back singles and a walk to start the game.
But he struck out Josh Holliday and Lamont Matthews before Jay
McCullough grounded out to end the OSU first.
</P>
<P>
   Rice catcher Zane Curry said Baugh was throwing better than it
looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``His pitches weren't that far off,'' Curry said. ``I thought it
showed his courage to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the heart of their order coming up. The bases were
loaded, and those guys were wanting to hit a two-run double or a
grand slam. So Kenny realized that if he could throw a good
changeup, they weren't going to sniff it. So with the two hitters
he struck out, he probably threw about 80 percent changeups. They
didn't adjust. I thought that showed Kenny's mental toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh ran into more trouble in the second, however. This time, a
walk preceded back-to-back singles that filled the bases again. But
third baseman Matt Fox, atoning for Friday's three-error
performance in an 8-4 loss to Miami, turned in a superb defensive
play.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gautreaux slapped a grounder to Fox, who stepped on third
base for a forceout, then threw a perfect strike home to Curry for
a double play. Baugh then induced Kevin Lucas to fly out to center
to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Wayne Graham had considered not starting Fox but was glad
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put his heart back in the game,'' Graham said. ``I believe
in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh's good fortune continued in the third when OSU's Billy
Gasparino made full contact with a fastball for an apparent home
run to left field. But the ball was hit into a driving wind, which
held it up at the warning track, and with his back against the wall
Charles Williams made the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Curry started the Owls' scoring by doubling home Justin Berg in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   OSU tied the game at 1 in the fourth. Chris Becerra slugged a
one-out double and scored three batters later on a bad-hop single
by Gautreuax that bounced over the head of Rice second baseman
Brett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the Cowboys would get another run in the inning
when Lucas hit a grounder deep in the hole at shortstop. But Damon
Thames made a major-league stab of the ball, then twisted and threw
out Gautreaux at second for an inning-ending force play. Thames'
effort drew a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls regained the lead with two unearned runs in the fifth,
which started with Gasparino booting Fox's grounder to short.
Williams tripled Fox home, and two outs later, a Will Ford bunt
scored Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Rice added three more runs in the seventh to break the game
open, and Jason Gray hit his team-leading 20th homer, a solo shot,
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Thames was just happy the Owls didn't repeat their 0-2 CWS
performance of 1997, the year they made their only previous trip
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start 0-4 in Omaha, some people will begin to wonder
how good you are,'' Thames said. ``Now we just have to keep this
thing going because if you lose, you go home. We can still win this
thing.''

BUSY DEBUT FOR ANGELS ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ During batting practice Sunday afternoon, a group of
Little Leaguers chanted the names of their favorite Angels players
as they took their turns in the cage. When new Angel Mike Colangelo
stepped in, there was a pause.
</P>
<P>
   Then they yelled: ``No.10! No.10! No.10!''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the crowd weren't the only ones who didn't know
Colangelo, who was called up after Saturday's game and was in the
starting lineup Sunday, hitting leadoff and playing left field.
</P>
<P>
   Many Angels players and coaches met Colangelo, 22, for the first
time Sunday. After spending most of the 1998 season at Single-A
Lake Elsinore, he spent spring training in minor-league camp and
opened the season at Double-A Erie.
</P>
<P>
   In 28 games at Erie, he hit .339 and was promoted to Triple-A
Edmonton on May 12. He hit .362 there in 26 games, and the next
thing he knew he was in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be here this fast,'' he said. ``I hope
everything works out. I came here today and the first day I'm in
there hitting leadoff. That's fine. I'm excited to be in the
lineup. I have to get on base so the big guys can drive me in.''
</P>
<P>
   He did his job Sunday, hitting a line-drive single to center in
his first major league at-bat, then drawing a walk his second time
up. He also got an assist when Andy Fox tried to tag up from first
on a fly ball to Colangelo, who threw Fox out at second.
</P>
<P>
   The game, though, ended abruptly for Colangelo after a collision
with center fielder Reggie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo played 112 minor-league games before his promotion to
the majors. By comparison, Troy Glaus played in 109 and Darin
Erstad played in 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in myself,'' Colangelo said before
the game. ``I just put some good numbers together and they moved me
up quickly. Hopefully, I'll keep hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being injured, Colangelo, a right-handed hitter, was
slated to platoon in left field with left-handed hitting Orlando
Palmeiro. With a lefty (Omar Daal) pitching for Arizona on Sunday,
Colangelo didn't have time to blend in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's been swinging the bat good,'' said manager Terry
Collins. ``We might as well have him in there while he's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   The power's with Luke: Matt Luke also joined the club Sunday,
being called up from Edmonton after just six games there, where he
hit .429 (9 for 21) with five homers and 15 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He started the spring with the Angels, but a back strain _
suffered during offseason weight-lifting _ forced him to the
disabled list for 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to be patient about it,'' Luke said. ``It was a
situation where it didn't heal as fast as I wanted it do. But
finally my activity increased, I got some games at extended spring
and each day it felt a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke wasted no time showing the Angels he was ready for the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was surprised, but I was pleased with how my
body responded on a day-to-day basis,'' Luke said. ``It's something
I haven't done in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Luke will get a start in right field Wednesday in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Garret Anderson, who had started all 61 games this season
in center field, was not in the starting lineup. Williams started
in place of Anderson, who is hitless in his past 16 at-bats.
Anderson, though, entered the game in the eighth inning as a pinch
runner and stayed in the game.... Arizona's Steve Finley singled
with one out in the ninth inning, his 1,500th major-league hit...
The Angels are off today and on Tuesday begin a nine-game road trip
to Toronto, New York and Seattle.

   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-FUNDFRAISING _ As campaign finance legislation
languishes, Congress has gone on an all-out fund-raising binge
driven by the battle for control of the House. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-GUN-POLITICS _ A troika of New York area Democrats _ Nita
Lowey, Rosa De Lauro and Carolyn McCarthy _ have been leading the
Democratic charge in the House for gun control, and it's no
accident that they're all women. It is a strategy, blessed by party
leaders, that reflects an attempt to change the gun debate into an
issue of child safety and the belief that gun control advocacy will
sew up support for Democrats among women in the crucial elections
of 2000. Internal party polls show that women are caring more and
more about gun safety; this at a time when Al Gore's numbers among
women are not great. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   DEECEE-POLITICS _ The pragmatic and cautious mayor of
Washington, Anthony Williams, is a stark contrast to the legacy of
ethical blunders from the previous administration here; but new
campaign finance charges may tarnish his squeaky-clean image.
</P>
<P>
   ICKES-POLITICS-PROFILE _ A look at the first lady's campaign
honcho, Harold Ickes.

   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTERS-BIOLOGY (San Francisco) _ In a world where computers
were once casual and isolated tools, but are today increasingly the
very fabric of modern business life, computer researchers say they
are detecting an ominous trend toward programs that mimic viruses
and pestilence in the physical world. Like biological diseases,
which exploit the most basic mechanism of life: the power of DNA to
replicate itself, the subculture of modern virus writing is now
manipulating that same power within the world of interconnected
computers. By John Markoff.

   FALLING-TV-STARS (Undated) _ Where Have All the Big Stars Gone?
The great national television star of the past _ Milton Berle,
Lucille Ball, Ed Sullivan, Mary Tyler Moore, Bill Cosby, Jerry
Seinfeld _ has given way to clusters of little, lesser stars. Why?
By Bill Carter.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic showing stars' peak share of TV audience has
been sent to NYT graphics clients.)
</P>
<P>
   SUBSCRIPTIONS-SWEEPSTAKES (Undated) _ The crackdown on phony
sweepstakes mailings is a great blow for justice but it's lousy for
the magazine industry. The mailings were a key way to sell
subscriptions. Now a slew of magazines are reporting sharp declines
in renewals. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY-LAWSUIT (Washington) _ A Federal Trade Commission
lawsuit against a James J. Rapp, a private investigator, is being
billed by both sides as a landmark case, and Rapp is receiving
significant support from a coalition of other information brokers
and debt collectors, who see the government's action as a huge
threat to their livelihood. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   POWERS-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Austin Powers, the ludicrously
lascivious film character played by the comedian Mike Meyers in
``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' has turned up in all sorts of
advertisements lately. Why are so many marketers so willing to go
along with such an overtly risque premise? By Patricia Winters
Lauro.

   METROWERKS-GALANOS (Undated) _ Profile of Greg Galanos and
Metrowerks, a company in the software ``tools'' business that has

ways of alleviating the often interminable wait for a Web page to
show up on a computer screen. By Bob Tedeschi.

WILLIAMS CAN'T MANAGE TO FIND RED SOX ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's tried just about everything. Sunday Boston
manager Jimy Williams rested his best player for eight innings, but
still the Sox could not win. And Jimy couldn't even get himself
thrown out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The sad Sunday score was Mets, 5-4, giving Boston seven losses
in eight games, eight in 11 games, and a 2-7 record against the
National League East. A 1-5 trip through Montreal and New York saw
the Sox fall from first, probably for good. En route, they lost a
couple of quality pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a whole lot else Jimy can do. He can recommend no
beach volleyball parties at the homes of Pedro Martinez or Nomar
Garciaparra, but he can't be expected to keep winning with the
present roster.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's time for Dan Duquette to make a call to the New
York City water meter inspection department.
</P>
<P>
   The manager won't complain, but when he's behind closed doors _
crooning in that Fenway shower he so loves _ Jimy's got to be
singing, ``Please Mr. Statman, look and see. Is there a hitter for
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait for Williams to say anything in public regarding his
anemic lineup. Not his way. In his Rainman/Dana Carvey-as-George
Bushspeak, he'll keep saying all the positive things that Duquette
and some of the fans want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good, we're just not winning . . . Need a few
more balls to fall in . . . A few more hits with two outs . . . Not
a panic situation . . . 2-7, but in every one of 'em to my
recollection, except for late in Montreal . . . Play the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say it's pitching and defense . . . Sometimes you just
hit a bump in the road. Maybe we just had our bump in the road
against National League teams . . . Go home and get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes to Wapner.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the schedule calls for the Triple-A-in-disguise
Minnesota Twins at Fenway Monday night. And Pedro Tuesday.
Meanwhile, it would be nice if the Duke could give his manager some
help in the form of an outfielder who can hit. If Mike Gimbel can't
come up with another Dwayne Hosey, maybe it's time to try one of
the Pawtucket flashes. Michael Coleman is the hot name of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimy was asked if it was time to ``go get somebody,'' he
answered, ``I haven't really thought about that. I think we have
good hitters here, I really do. If anything, they're probably
trying too hard (hello, Trot Nixon). But they can hit. They're
gonna hit.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's loss, Jimy said, ``What can I do? Hell, I
couldn't hit when I played. I'm not going to hit the pitcher
eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he rested Nomar until the eighth. He hit Jason Varitek
second and Brian Daubach cleanup. He double-switched and tried a
raft of pinch hitters and relievers. He even made a noble effort to
get tossed.
</P>
<P>
   Williams bolted from the dugout in the eighth when Damon Buford
was called out for running into his own bunted ball. Jimy argued
long and hard with plate umpire Greg Bonin. He gave us the
arms-folded routine. He gestured. He started to leave, turned
around, and came back. But Bonin was patient and never tossed the
Sox manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``National League umpires make quick calls,'' said Jimy. ``There
really isn't a batter's box there. It's gone. The guy called a good
game and he's a good umpire, but I thought he might ask the third
base umpire if he saw it. I always thought that was the bottom
line. If somebody has an angle you make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Third base ump Ed Rapuano never arrived to give his version of
events, but crew chief Frank Pulli came in from second base to tell
Jimy to go back to his dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams was asked, ``Did Pulli give you anything?'' the
manager replied, ``About 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a joke, folks. Jimy has a birchbark-dry sense of humor,
and it's nice to see he could still have a little fun after such an
arduous road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Had Williams been thrown out of the game, he could have mimed
the nitwit antics of Mets manager Bobby Valentine and come back to
the dugout with a phony mustache and glasses. But Jimy's not a
slapstick guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' he answered when the
Valentine Groucho getup was suggested. ``I'm just trying to win a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Red Sox managers who could have used a disguise when
they worked in Boston. Life certainly would have been easier for
Don Zimmer if he'd been behind an iron mask in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   Not Jimy. Wouldn't be prudent.

RED SOX AT LOSS FOR REASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Crisis? Mark Portugal, who was ready to turn in his
uniform for good just a couple of weeks ago, can tell you about a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And this, he said after the Red Sox lost, 5-4, Sunday to the New
York Mets for their seventh loss in their last eight games, doesn't
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's wondering why we're not playing that well,'' said
Portugal, thrown back in the rotation Sunday because Bret
Saberhagen cut his foot open on broken glass. ``You can't worry
about a two-week stretch in the middle of June in a 162-game
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a 10-day span against National League opponents in
which the Sox resembled strangers in a strange land, it wouldn't be
surprising to see them greet the Minnesota Twins with flowers and
chocolates Monday night on Yawkey Way. Familiarity may breed
contempt, but the Sox are hoping that returning home for a visit
from some American League cousins might brew a few wins, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to push the panic button,'' said Nomar
Garciaparra, who was given the day off until he entered the game in
the eighth as part of a double-switch, leading to his leadoff
double in the ninth that was wasted when the next three hitters
went down in order to Mets reliever Turk Wendell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still playing good baseball,'' Garciaparra said. ``The
thing that hurt us was last weekend, when we played Atlanta and
easily could have won all three of those games, but they came back
to beat us (twice). And here, we came back and won in extra innings
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pitching well, we're fielding well. We're just not
clicking. We've got to bring it back together, the way we did when
we were winning.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Sox are not doing is hitting. In the nine games against
the Braves, Expos, and Mets, who won Sunday behind 40-year-old Orel
Hershiser, the Sox batted just .209 and hit just five home runs,
including Troy O'Leary's 12th of the season Sunday. They've scored
just 15 runs in their last six games, with Sunday's four their
high-water mark in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Trot Nixon struck out three times Sunday _ the last time
with two on and two out in the eighth _ after fanning just once in
his last nine games. Nixon also made an off-target throw to the
plate in the fifth when he had a chance to make a play on Hershiser
as he scored the Mets' third run of the inning. Nixon singled in
the seventh and scored the Sox' final run on Jason Varitek's
sacrifice fly, but he's hitting .125 (3 for 24) in his last eight
games, with one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to say today,'' he commented as he made his
departure from the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly alone, of course. Veteran Mike Stanley, who walked
as a pinch hitter in the seventh, is hitless in his last 21
at-bats. Jose Offerman, who hit a two-out triple in the fifth but
was stranded, had two hits in 12 at-bats here. Garciaparra was 2
for 11, Brian Daubach 2 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position Sunday _
O'Leary's fourth-inning RBI double was the only hit _ and they were
just 5 for 36 (.139) in the three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, spotted the Sox a 1-0 lead before five
straight hits with two out in the fifth produced three runs off
Portugal. The string began with a home run by the Hawaiian hammer,
Benny Agbayani, who was as obscure as the Belleville Basher,
Daubach, with whom he played in the Mets' system. Agbayani already
has 10 home runs, nine in his last 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was lifted after a leadoff double in the sixth by Mike
Piazza, who scored ahead of Brian McRae's two-run home run off Jim
Corsi. The Mets have hit 80 home runs this season, 51 in their last
34 games. The Sox, by contrast, have 58 home runs total.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of team that thrives on momentum,'' Portugal
said. ``One hit gets it going for them, and it tends to snowball.
I've got to shut them down and avoid the big inning, and I didn't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who loaded the bases with no out in the seventh, scored
twice on a fielder's choice and Varitek's sacrifice fly before Mets
reliever Dennis Cook struck out John Valentin to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox put the tying run on with one out in the eighth when
O'Leary singled for his third hit of the game. But Damon Buford,
trying to bunt for a hit, was called out when the ball bounced up
and hit him. Plate umpire Greg Bonin ruled Buford out on
interference, and he refused to listen to Jimy Williams's
entreaties to ask third base umpire Ed Rapuano whether Buford was
indeed out of the batter's box when the ball hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yes, I was in the box,'' Buford said after watching TV
replays. ``Find out how many times a year that play is called. Find
out how many times it's called right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big play at a big time of the game. I was bunting for
a hit, but even if he threw me out, I knew we'd get a runner to
second. But that's the way things are going for us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams as he prepared for the trip home, ``Hang with
us.''

BUFFALO NOT TAKING BEST SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ If they're going to win the Cup, the Sabres have to
hope that Saturday night was just a hicCup.
</P>
<P>
   If it proves to be worse than that, then everyone here on the
shores of Lake Erie knows the drill. Disappointment is a cottage
industry in this town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you were here through the days when the Bills
reached the Super Bowl,'' mused Rob Ray, the Sabres' resident tough
guy who is now finishing up his 10th season, ``there was a lot of
excitement built into it. When they were unsuccessful, it was a
major letdown for the city. So you feel the pressure of winning for
yourselves, but also for everyone else as you walk down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you can't avoid, because they won't let you
avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres looked and played Game 3 of the Stanely Cup final as
if they were skating through the shards of so many million
shattered souls. In the end, the scoreboard showed a 2-1 loss to
the Dallas Stars, but it was one of the most lopsided one-goal
games in Stanley Cup history. Buffalo managed only 12 shots _ one
every five minutes _ equaling the dirty dozen the Bruins so feebly
cobbled together in their 4-2 loss to the Oilers in Game 2 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the better team,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said
Sunday, less than 24 hours after the crushing defeat that dropped
his club into a 2-1 deficit in the best-of-seven series. ``I'm not
going to sugarcoat it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars weren't so dominating as they were suffocating. In
fact, if not for Joe Nieuwendyk's dynamic touch around the net, the
Stars, as near-perfect as they were over two-thirds of the ice,
still could have lost. That, of course, is what happens when you're
up against Dominik Hasek in the Buffalo net.
</P>
<P>
   But there were factors that contributed to Dallas's own
goal-scoring deficiencies: (1) Mike Modano playing with an
impaired, braced wrist, which was injected with a painkiller before
the game, and (2) the loss of Brett Hull, who left after three
shifts in the first period, sidelined by a nagging groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the 32-year-old Nieuwendyk stands with one skate
up on the Conn Smythe podium. He came up with the 1-1 equalizer
late in the second period, sweeping home a backhander as he was
knocked down in the slot after first being turned back by Hasek on
a forehander. For the winner, set up perfectly by a Jamie
Langenbrunner pirouette and feed, he painted the top right corner
with a nasty roof shot.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's winner makes you wonder why coaches spend so much
time on 2-on-1 and 3-on-2 shooting drills. Clear shots off the rush
are so rarely available in today's game. But there are thousands
(no exaggeration) of opportunities from in tight, shots that
develop from the grit it takes to get the puck in the middle, or
come off rebounds, off mistakes. So few forwards can convert from
tight quarters, especially now that netminders, Hasek the best of
them all, are so adept at taking away the bottom half of the net.
Park a guy at the top of the crease, put a defenseman on his back,
and don't let him leave the ice until he pops home at least one
backhander and one forehander. Top-of-the-crease roof shots, sadly,
have gone the way of the hip check and the hoop game's two-handed
set shot.
</P>
<P>
   By periods, the Sabres' shot total read 3-6-3. While landing
only 12 on net, they saw 12 other attempts go wide and 19 get
blocked by Dallas forwards or defensemen. Derian Hatcher and Guy
Carbonneau led all Dallas shot blockers with three apiece. By
contrast, 29 Dallas shots reached the net, while four more were off
the mark and 14 were blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's attack _ a stretch of the word at best _ fell apart in
two places: (1) in the neutral zone, where the Stars continually
cut off passes or rubbed out puckcarriers, and (2) across the blue
line, where the Sabres, even on power plays, often wildly missed
the net. They never got around to testing Eddie Belfour in the
Dallas net.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres simply played too much like a team that was scared to
lose, their game timid and unsure _ not at all like the club that
confidently mashed its way through the likes of Ottawa, Boston, and
Toronto in the first three rounds. Where was their trademark speed?
Where was the irrepressible youth that was going to run rings
around the aging oak trees in the Dallas lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped youth and speed would be on our side,'' said Ruff,
who continually changed his line combinations, looking for a spark
that never developed. ``But maybe cagey veterans know how to
conserve energy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sabres who looked tired and out of synch. The Dallas
attack lacked flow, too, but showed far better stamina and
strength. Modano's shooting was off? So what. Hull checked out
early? Gee. The Stars just kept rolling, patiently and with
purpose. The Sabres, meanwhile, turned into the corkscrew that
couldn't shake itself from the cork.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is another day of rest before Game 4. The Sabres will use
their practice time to rearrange their parts, try to breath new
life into their power play (0 for 8 in Game 3), and regain that
enthusiasm that has been their trademark for almost two months now.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, the wise and low-key graybeards, will stretch and
limber up, conserve their energy, dance around the questions about
Modano's wrist and Hull's groin. Even without their best guns, and
even with age allegedly conspiring against them, the Stars had what
it took to be a better defensive club than the Sabres. Here in a
city where the leading industries are worry and disappointment,
that could be a sign that the warehouse of woe (Scott Norwood is
the night watchman) is about to throw open its doors once more.

WILLIAMS CAN'T MANAGE TO FIND RED SOX ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's tried just about everything. Sunday Boston
manager Jimy Williams rested his best player for eight innings, but
still the Sox could not win. And Jimy couldn't even get himself
thrown out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The sad Sunday score was Mets, 5-4, giving Boston seven losses
in eight games, eight in 11 games, and a 2-7 record against the
National League East. A 1-5 trip through Montreal and New York saw
the Sox fall from first, probably for good. En route, they lost a
couple of quality pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a whole lot else Jimy can do. He can recommend no
beach volleyball parties at the homes of Pedro Martinez or Nomar
Garciaparra, but he can't be expected to keep winning with the
present roster.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's time for Dan Duquette to make a call to the New
York City water meter inspection department.
</P>
<P>
   The manager won't complain, but when he's behind closed doors _
crooning in that Fenway shower he so loves _ Jimy's got to be
singing, ``Please Mr. Statman, look and see. Is there a hitter for
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait for Williams to say anything in public regarding his
anemic lineup. Not his way. In his Rainman/Dana Carvey-as-George
Bushspeak, he'll keep saying all the positive things that Duquette
and some of the fans want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good, we're just not winning . . . Need a few
more balls to fall in . . . A few more hits with two outs . . . Not
a panic situation . . . 2-7, but in every one of 'em to my
recollection, except for late in Montreal . . . Play the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say it's pitching and defense . . . Sometimes you just
hit a bump in the road. Maybe we just had our bump in the road
against National League teams . . . Go home and get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes to Wapner.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the schedule calls for the Triple-A-in-disguise
Minnesota Twins at Fenway Monday night. And Pedro Tuesday.
Meanwhile, it would be nice if the Duke could give his manager some
help in the form of an outfielder who can hit. If Mike Gimbel can't
come up with another Dwayne Hosey, maybe it's time to try one of
the Pawtucket flashes. Michael Coleman is the hot name of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimy was asked if it was time to ``go get somebody,'' he
answered, ``I haven't really thought about that. I think we have
good hitters here, I really do. If anything, they're probably
trying too hard (hello, Trot Nixon). But they can hit. They're
gonna hit.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's loss, Jimy said, ``What can I do? Hell, I
couldn't hit when I played. I'm not going to hit the pitcher
eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he rested Nomar until the eighth. He hit Jason Varitek
second and Brian Daubach cleanup. He double-switched and tried a
raft of pinch hitters and relievers. He even made a noble effort to
get tossed.
</P>
<P>
   Williams bolted from the dugout in the eighth when Damon Buford
was called out for running into his own bunted ball. Jimy argued
long and hard with plate umpire Greg Bonin. He gave us the
arms-folded routine. He gestured. He started to leave, turned
around, and came back. But Bonin was patient and never tossed the
Sox manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``National League umpires make quick calls,'' said Jimy. ``There
really isn't a batter's box there. It's gone. The guy called a good
game and he's a good umpire, but I thought he might ask the third
base umpire if he saw it. I always thought that was the bottom
line. If somebody has an angle you make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Third base ump Ed Rapuano never arrived to give his version of
events, but crew chief Frank Pulli came in from second base to tell
Jimy to go back to his dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams was asked, ``Did Pulli give you anything?'' the
manager replied, ``About 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a joke, folks. Jimy has a birchbark-dry sense of humor,
and it's nice to see he could still have a little fun after such an
arduous road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Had Williams been thrown out of the game, he could have mimed
the nitwit antics of Mets manager Bobby Valentine and come back to
the dugout with a phony mustache and glasses. But Jimy's not a
slapstick guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' he answered when the
Valentine Groucho getup was suggested. ``I'm just trying to win a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Red Sox managers who could have used a disguise when
they worked in Boston. Life certainly would have been easier for
Don Zimmer if he'd been behind an iron mask in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   Not Jimy. Wouldn't be prudent.

AMERICANS UPLIFTED BY FRIENDLY FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Yanquis said they weren't going to make a big
thing of it. This was just a Sunday afternoon friendly between two
teams on the build. And yet US 1, Argentina 0 _ anytime, anywhere _
is certainly worth popping open a jeroboam of Dom Perignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's a great win,'' US men's soccer coach Bruce Arena
declared Sunday, after the Revolution's Joe-Max Moore stunned the
world's seventh-ranked squad with a goal two minutes from time
before 40,119 at RFK Stadium. ``Does this mean we're back in the
right direction? Yes. But it doesn't say a whole lot more than
that. We're not going to blow it out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   What they'll do with it down in Buenos Aires is another matter.
Argentina had waited four years to avenge the humiliating 3-0
whipsong that the Americans laid on them at the Copa America at
Paysandu in next-door Uruguay. And even though they were playing
with only three of their World Cup regulars (Diego Simeone, Roberto
Ayala, and Javier Zanetti), the Pale Blues figured they could
handle a US squad that finished 32d out of 32 in France last summer
and is under reconstruction itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wears a jersey for Argentina is a great player,''
said Arena, who is still looking for 20 good men to bring to next
month's FIFA Confederations Cup in Mexico, where the US must face
Brazil and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans are 4-1-2 since he took over for Steve
Sampson last October, Arena concedes that they're nowhere near a
world-class side and won't be until the millennium. ``We are a year
away from being a pretty good national team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the men who started the World Cup match with
Germany were in uniform Sunday. Some have moved on, some weren't
available, and some may never be called again. Arena's mission is
to run as many fresh faces through the revolving door as he can
before Cup qualifying starts anew in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He's already seen 40 players since November and has plugged a
bunch of them, ready or not, into the lineup for friendlies. Sunday
the US, which hadn't played in three months, had four starters
(midfielders Tony Sanneh, Chris Armas, and Eddie Lewis and defender
C.J. Brown) with seven or fewer caps.
</P>
<P>
   That made for some harrowing moments in the American half and
required acrobatic heroics by keeper Kasey Keller, who blocked a
penalty kick by Gustavo Lopez five minutes before intermission and
later swatted away point-blankers by Hugo Ibarra and Christian
Gonzalez to keep his mates alive. ``What can you say?'' shrugged
Arena. ``He doesn't stop that penalty kick, we don't end up winning
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on and the Pale Blues kept dashing into the
American kitchen, nil-nil was looking like a lovely result for the
hosts. ``There were some very obvious missed opportunities,''
moaned Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, whose side yielded a
77th-minute goal to Mexico on Wednesday and had to settle for a 2-2
draw in Chicago. ``We did not capitalize on the 13 goals we could
have had. The way we played, we deserved this result.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Yanks were master finishers themselves. Cobi Jones
put a ball inches wide in the 13th minute, Stewart missed a Sanneh
cross in the 37th, Claudio Reyna misfired from dead-on in the 43d,
and Sanneh bopped a header off the crossbar in the 63d.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Arena had sent in Moore, who had a hall pass to skip
Sunday's Revolution-Miami match at Foxborough. ``Go in and make a
difference,'' Arena told him.
</P>
<P>
   Moore waited until the 88th minute, when both sides seemed
resigned to a scoreless draw. Then he darted into the area and
collected a lovely backheel pass from Stewart. ``He played it right
into my stride,'' said Moore. ``I just struck the ball hard and
hoped it was on goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was decidedly more than that _ the ball was rifled and roofed
beyond keeper German Burgos's outstretched right hand, and
Argentina was too stunned to answer before time ran out. ``Very
timely,'' Moore said. ``Very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it wasn't as big as Paysandu, which has become a curse
word across the pampas. And the US will be facing a buzz saw when
they play the return match down there next winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' said Simeone, ``we have to play at the level
Argentina is capable of playing.'' But this time, the Yanquis will
take the W and move on _ and maybe crack open a bottle of bubbly on
the way.

REVOLUTION PROVE GOOD TO LAST SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution made things difficult for
both themselves and the Miami Fusion Sunday. But they survived a
frantic finish that produced a 3-3 tie in regulation time, then won
the shootout to move into a tie for third place with Tampa Bay in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game in which some of the Revolution's most
dependable players struggled and reserves such as Jamar Beasley,
Jeff Causey, Edwin Gorter, Paul Keegan, and Johnny Torres rallied
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Even player-coach Walter Zenga faltered, scuffing a clearance
which set up a Diego Serna goal to give Miami a 3-2 lead. But the
Revolution displayed resiliency, tying the score when Edwin Gorter
converted a Torres cross with three minutes left in a 52-minute
second half. The Revolution have 12 points in 12 games, and the
Fusion remain in last place with 8 points in 15 games. It was New
England's third straight win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shooting ourselves in the foot too many times, giving
other teams tap-in goals from 6 to 8 yards in front of the goal,''
Revolution midfielder John Harkes said. ``We made some sloppy
mistakes, committed some silly fouls on top of the box, and our
passing was not as good as it was against Chicago (a 2-0 win).
We're happy with the win, even though it came in a shootout. Deep
down, we know we lost 2 points, but the main thing is we have a
winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed a lot of character, and that is important. You have
to be able to fight through some games. We've been talking about
how Manchester United won the Champions League when their
substitutes came in and changed the game within three or four
minutes. And that is what our substitutes did in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, starting only because Joe-Max Moore was playing for the
US national team, had his most productive game since joining the
Revolution last year. He placed a left-footed shot off the inside
of the far post after Giovanni Savarese had headed on a Zenga punt
in the 20th minute. Torres converted a penalty kick after Beasley
had been fouled by Arley Palacios to tie the score, 2-2, in the
85th minute. And, after Keegan had battled to retain possession,
Torres assisted on Gorter's goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution failed to click for long periods of time and
seemed destined to lose after Henry Gutierrez converted a free kick
in the 24th minute, and Tyrone Marshall gave Miami a 2-1 advantage
in the 64th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion seemed more athletic, more resourceful, and more
dangerous in attack with Diego Serna and Welton. The Revolution,
though, retained their composure even after committing crucial
errors and while being out of synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   After Marshall's goal, the Revolution became desperate. They
pressed forward in an attempt to tie the score, leaving Zenga
stranded twice against Serna. But Zenga stopped Serna both times.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion paid for those failures as Gorter lofted a long lead
pass to Beasley on the left. Beasley, at 19 the team's youngest
player, faked past Arley Palacios, went to the end line and started
toward goal. Palacios took him down from behind and referee Alberto
Giordano called the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Mike Burns, Gorter, and Harkes designated Torres for the
kick. And Torres, who had scored only three goals in 30 previous
MLS games, sent the shot past goalkeeper Jeff Cassar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great the veterans had confidence in me to step up and
take the penalty kick,'' Torres said. ``I had retrieved the ball
and was going to give it to one of the veterans to take.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torres will likely return to the bench when Moore returns
for the game at Columbus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether I'm playing or not, I'll go out and work
in practice and show heart and fight every time I go in the game,''
Torres said. ``I'm a new player but I'm not new to soccer. I know
there are times when you score and times when you don't, but you
have to keep plugging away.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was nearly decided in the final seconds, when former
Revolution striker Tony Kuhn made an excellent turn and fired a
shot just under the bar from 18 yards. But Causey, who had replaced
Zenga only seconds before, tipped the shot over the bar to preserve
the tie.

GORTER SHOWS HE'S FINISHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Edwin Gorter proved he was the master of
perfect timing Sunday for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:51 remaining in the match, Gorter took a feed from Johnny
Torres and smacked the ball into the goal to lift New England into
a 3-3 tie with the Miami Fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the shootout, Gorter took the Revolution's fourth shot
and once again beat Fusion netminder Jeff Cassar, giving New
England an insurmountable 3-1 shootout edge and a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Given his production, why isn't Gorter starting more
consistently? After missing two games while serving a suspension
and three others with injuries, he has been in the lineup for five
of the Revolution's last seven games. But Gorter didn't get into
Sunday's game until the 61st minute, subbing for Jair.
</P>
<P>
   Coach-goalkeeper Walter Zenga doesn't talk to the media about an
individual's playing time, but Gorter has his opinion. ``If I was
the coach, I would be on the field, but I'm not the coach,'' said
the 35-year-old, who had seven goals and seven assists last season
when he started every game but one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' added Gorter. ``It's not easy at all. You want to
be a part of the team, especially the starting 11. That's all you
work for during the week. I'm ready for that, but I guess they
don't believe in me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Gorter's first goal, Torres was on the left side and sent a
crossing pass to Gorter. The kick went into the left side of the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it OK but it wasn't an unbelievable goal,'' said Gorter.
``Who knows, in two or three weeks, you don't remember the goal. I
don't believe in ugly goals. A goal is a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Gorter had been 0 for 4 in shootout attempts this
season. ``I always miss, normally,'' he said. ``I should go to the
church and light a candle. That's the first of four; that's bad for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Having seen Cassar guard the previous three shootout attempts,
Gorter had some idea what the Fusion goalkeeper might try. ``That's
good when you're the fourth or the fifth shooter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been six weeks, Gorter said, since he's attempted a
shootout-type shot in practice. ``It's different in practice,'' he
said. ``There's nobody there, no 20,000 in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Six goals in regulation weren't a bad treat for the spectators.
``You look at the whole 90 minutes and you see that you're lucky to
get a couple in the second half _ a tie was the best result,''
Gorter said. ``For the people in the stands, they saw a great game.
It was in the afternoon, the sun was shining, there's 20,000, and
they see six goals. That's excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exciting enough to make Gorter temporarily forget the
frustration of not starting. ``When you're sitting on the bench,
you're not happy with yourself,'' he said. ``But if the game ends
like this, it's something special.''

RESEARCHER'S CREDIBILITY KEY IN MURDER DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When jurors in the Scott Falater murder trial begin
deliberations later this month, they will wrestle with a defense
scenario that defies common sense:
</P>
<P>
   A man stabs his wife 44 times in his sleep, and, still sleeping,
drags her into the pool and holds her head under water.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody, protracted mayhem of Falater's admitted attack
weighs heavily against the defense. But before jurors can reach a
verdict on Falater, they must reach a verdict on Dr. Roger
Broughton, a heavyweight in the study of sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Is Broughton a credible scientist or an errant egghead?
</P>
<P>
   Broughton is the Canadian physician, neurology professor and
sleep-disorders researcher who last week testified that
sleepwalking ``is by far the most probable'' explanation of
Falater's admitted killing of his wife in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, who came to the trial with the resume of an academic
superstar and an easygoing manner, is the star witness for the
defense against the state's charge that Falater committed
premeditated murder.
</P>
<P>
   As Judge Ronald Reinstein told the jury, the prosecution's duty
to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt means the jury can
convict Falater only if they are ``firmly convinced'' he
deliberately killed his wife of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Broughton based his opinion partially on a scientific
analysis of Falater's sleeping patterns and brain waves, he also
relied on a chain of subjective conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said Falater had no motive, acted with typical
sleepwalker illogic, was ``obviously very distressed and confused''
after police arrested him, and had complete amnesia about the
events on that bloody night in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, who is expected to testify this week, must persuade the
jury that he did not con the amiable Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Former defense attorney Michael Perlin said Falater's defense
``almost has to put his guy (Falater) on the stand, because the
defense is so contrary to what jurors think of as common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a defense attorney, you need to give the jury a sense of
who he truly is,'' said Perlin, whose criminal-law classes at New
York University often discuss mental condition as a defense.
``Juries are incredibly suspicious of anything they think can be
feigned.''
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed facts are that Scott Falater stabbed Yarmila
Falater 44 times with a hunting knife, dragged her into the pool at
their home and pushed her head under water.
</P>
<P>
   How could it be, prosecutor Juan Martinez has repeatedly asked _
sometimes with sarcasm and always with righteous outrage _ that
Falater was not jarred back to consciousness by the gory mayhem,
the screams of his wife, the cold water of the pool, the need to
put a bandage on his cut right hand?
</P>
<P>
   Falater, a former Motorola engineer who holds several patents on
electric devices, admits he's a killer. But he says that under the
law he did not commit murder because he didn't know what he was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case about who did it or how it was done,''
defense attorney Michael Kimerer told the jury in his opening
statement. ``What we're going to prove to you in this case is that
knowing consciousness was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer has told the jury that his client was in ``an
automatistic, somnambulistic state'' as he arose from bed, went
downstairs to the garage to change into work clothes, took a knife
to pry out a defective O-ring from the pool pump, then went into a
frenzy when his wife interrupted him.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's movements after the stabbing were described by a
neighbor, who saw Falater walk through his upstairs bedroom, come
back downstairs, make a calming motion to one of the family dogs,
return to the body and re-enter the house. The neighbor said
Falater emerged from the garage, putting on a pair of gloves,
dragged Yarmila to the pool deck, rolled her into the pool and held
her head under.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton estimates that Falater was sleepwalking for 45
minutes, a period that he acknowledges is unusually long.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, whose academic writing about violence by sleepwalkers
includes an article titled ``Dangerous Behaviours by Night,'' said
that until recently researchers thought violent outbursts were
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are much more common than we used to think,'' he
said. He added that violence can be triggered by someone who
interferes with a sleepwalker.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer, who guided Broughton through a slide-show seminar about
sleepwalking, is attempting to convince jurors that Falater's
defense, however improbable it may seem, is enough to create
reasonable doubt about his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   He is presenting the attack as a wild, unconscious eruption in
the placid sea of the Falater home, where there was no history of
violence or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In laying out his case, Kimerer has offered answers to some
nagging prosecution questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Why would Falater use a hunting knife to work on the pool pump?
</P>
<P>
   Because Falater needed a pointed object to pry a defective
O-ring out of the leaking pump, Kimerer says.
</P>
<P>
   _Isn't the fact that Falater threw his wife into the pool proof
that he was trying to finish her off?
</P>
<P>
   No, Kimerer says. In fact, leaving the body floating in the
crimson water is exactly the sort of bizarre, illogical act that is
characteristic of sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   _If he's innocent, why would Falater hide his bloody clothes in
a Tupperware container that he placed inside a plastic bag and
stashed in the wheel well of his car?
</P>
<P>
   Falater wasn't hiding anything, Kimerer says. He was simply
returning the work clothes to where he always kept them.
</P>
<P>
   When Broughton came to the witness stand last week, Kimerer
walked him through a lengthy list of credentials intended to show
that Broughton is not an opportunistic pseudoscientist offering
tailor-made testimony for a fat check.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Broughton is an internationally respected authority on
sleepwalking. He is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Canada, a professor of neurology at the University of
Ottawa and the director of a sleep disorders center. He has
received an award for lifetime achievement from the American Sleep
Disorders Association.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said his work for Falater marked only his second
experience in a case where sleepwalking was the defense. The first
involved a Canadian man who was acquitted of murder, he said, and
he once turned down a lawyer whose client he believed to have been
lying.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded, bald, bespectacled Broughton matched the Hollywood
image of an expert witness. He maintained his professorial demeanor
even as Martinez asked incredulously if Broughton truly believed
that Falater was unaware of the mayhem he was causing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe that's possible,'' he said. ``I believe that's
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Broughton acknowledged that some aspects of Falater's story had
made him ``pause'' on the way to his conclusion. But he said he
overcame those reservations after a complete review.
</P>
<P>
   If Falater is to walk out of the courtroom a free man, the
jurors _ only one of whom has been to college _ will also have to
put skepticism aside.
</P>
<P>
   That skepticism was apparent in some jurors' questions,
including one asking if the study of sleep disorders relied heavily
on speculation rather than science. Broughton responded that he and
his colleagues have ``very detailed knowledge about a large variety
of sleep disorders.'' &QL;

LAREDO'S HOTTER? HOLY HAVASU! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a red-hot outrage. It is an affront that we should not
take lying down in the shade. The entire state should be up in arms
_ sweaty, sunburned arms.
</P>
<P>
   Any Arizonan knows that Lake Havasu City, with triple-digit
temperatures as common as blown saves by the Diamondbacks' bullpen,
is the hottest place in the country, right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Weatherwise'' magazine, Lake Havasu City was only
the second-most consistently hot city last year. The hottest?
</P>
<P>
   Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo was the hottest place in the 48 contiguous states on 34
days in 1998, while Lake Havasu City _ No. 1 a year earlier _
topped the nation on 33 days. Close but no sunburn. Talk about a
matter of degrees . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Happily, Lake Havasu enjoys the lead in the long-term
competition, scoring the top temperature 511 days in the '90s.
Bullhead City is second at 202.)
</P>
<P>
   So what are we going to do about it? Is Lake Havasu going to
cook the books? Place the official thermometer on a molten strip of
asphalt?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's all in God's hands,'' said Bonnie Barsness,
director of the Lake Havasu Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say she wouldn't welcome a little divine
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like notoriety here in Lake Havasu,'' Barsness said,
laughing. ``It's actually all part of our marketing plan. It gets
us on the national weather all across the nation. It keeps Lake
Havasu on the forefront of people's mind as a hot tourism
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what an attraction searing heat can be. To
suntan-lotion magnates anyway.
</P>
<P>
   `NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT'
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it doesn't sound as if Laredo is all that excited
over the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of first place can be good news if treated the right
way,'' said Miguel Conchas, president of the Laredo Chamber of
Commerce, ``(but) certainly it's nothing to brag about when you're
trying to attract business to the city. I don't think anybody's
going to want to keep the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Please. He's just sandbagging. Why else would the Laredo Chamber
incorporate jalapeno peppers into its logo?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that the city was hot in more ways than one,''
Conchas said. ``We take advantage of the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Busted.
</P>
<P>
   Barsness noted that the weather didn't really heat up in Lake
Havasu until July last year. The opposite effect in Laredo may have
let that city wrest away the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been hot here, but _ maybe it had something to do
with El Nino _ last year it was unusually hot,'' Conchas said.
``This year, it's turning out to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   You see? Already he's angling for next year's crown. And this in
a place that is usually between a paltry 105 and 110 degrees in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you go over 110, it tends to be unusual,'' Conchas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Any time it's 110 in Lake Havasu, it tends to be unusual as well
_ people wonder why it's so frigid.
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER EXTREME
</P>
<P>
   Offensive as it may be for an Arizonan to do so, I had to ask
Conchas the Question: Is it a dry heat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, I think things have changed over the last few
years,'' he said. ``South Texas used to be a very dry heat, but
humidity has been on the rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Good. At least they're suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so are we. Even if Arizona is no longer home to the
absolute hottest spot, it's still brain-scramblingly hot here. Ah,
to be in Stanley, Idaho, the coldest spot in the contiguous United
States last year. A call last week to the city offices found
Connie-Roze Burr, city clerk, who issued this weather report:
``It's snowing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's June.
</P>
<P>
   Then again the low that day was only 29 degrees. In the winter,
Burr said, temperatures range ``from 32 to 49 below.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry about Burr. She uttered a familiar refrain when
talking about the cold in Stanley: ``It's not the same kind of
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dry one, no doubt. &QL;

CIGARETTES LIT RIOT AT SHERIFF ARPAIO'S TENT CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio blames Saturday night's Tent City
riot on a flare-up of inmate hostilities over smuggled cigarettes
and matches, which were then used to light mattresses and toilet
paper to set fire to seven tents.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio stood among the ashes Sunday and watched as a crew of
inmates replaced the damaged tents. He praised guards and deputies
for ending what he called a ``bedtime disturbance'' without injury
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he suspected the inmates obtained the cigarettes
from visitors who smuggled them in or while they were outside the
jail yard working on the chain gang.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the sheriff noted, ``there's a contraband problem.''
He said security measures for visits would be tightened.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising of about 200 inmates started about 9 p.m. Saturday
as a ``Star Wars'' bedtime story was being broadcast to the inmates
over the jail-yard loudspeakers. Bedtime Story Hour, the sheriff's
latest inmate program, kicked off this month and is designed to
increase literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said it took guards and deputies ``five minutes'' to
quiet the uproar by using patrol dogs and pepper spray to gain
control of the convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials and inmates reported that guards brought
the melee under control in about an hour. Despite the difference in
time lines, Saturday's riot ended quickly compared with the first
Tent City riot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, more than 300 inmates battled guards in a fiery riot
that left two guards and three prisoners injured. That uprising
lasted more than four hours and was finally stopped after an armed
National Guard squad tore down barricades inmates had made from
their bunks.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said his department learned from that experience and was
better prepared to respond to Saturday's crisis. He credited extra
training for the guards, new equipment and ``good intelligence''
about brewing tensions with helping to bring a safe, quick end to
latest flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   Tent City guards reportedly had noticed tensions among inmates
Friday. Arpaio said one theory was that gang differences may have
sparked the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other is that they don't like my bedtime stories,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Pool, jailed because of parole violations and a member
of Tent City's maintenance crew, said he was just relieved no one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's fire, there's a possibility somebody could
get hurt or die,'' Pool said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the second Tent City riot in less than three
years, Arpaio said he intended to continue the highly criticized
open-air housing, where inmates sat sweltering Saturday as
temperatures reached 105 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tents will always be here. They're not going anywhere,''
he said. ``This is only the second little disturbance in the whole
jail system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a group of 35 inmates suspected of leading
the uprising were moved to the Towers Jail. Arpaio said deputies
were still working on identifying the culprits, most of whom
covered their faces with towels as the fires were started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try and identify them,'' Arpaio said. ``They
will be charged with arson and starting a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional 100 inmates were displaced by the fire and moved
to other jail facilities. Tent City visits have been temporarily
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   As for the damage, Arpaio said there was little cost associated
with replacing the burned tents because he had other military
surplus tents in storage and was using inmate labor. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The 17-hour cushion from Y2K
 &HT;    For release June 16, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way I figure it, I've got 17 hours to see what Y2K is doing
to the rest of the world before it gets to me; that's more
preparation time than you get for a hurricane, a lot more than you
get for an earthquake. You might even be able to get in an entire
cricket match in that amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   I think I will make it through Y2K and all its imagined and real
fears, as 17 hours is a lot of time for me.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the calendar will turn to 2000 somewhere out in the middle
of the Pacific 17 hours before it turns in New York, Washington,
D.C., or Walt Disney World. If computers are going to crash, if ATM
machines are going to fail, if airplanes are going to fall, I'll
know in plenty of time and can adjust _ or panic, if that is
preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K gets to New Zealand 17 hours before it gets to the Eastern
United States. Sydney, Australia, is 15 hours ahead of us; Tokyo 14
hours. We'll get a pretty good idea of what's going to happen, if
anything, by watching them. (Likely, it will be just a bunch of New
Year's Eve drunks crashing on expressways.)
</P>
<P>
   All of Europe will be into 2000 well before any part of the
U.S., and in fact, Californians will have three more hours than us
in the East. So we've got time to sit back and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, we have been getting assurances from our banking
institutions and federal government that all is well, that we are
prepared. But banks and federal agencies do not always play it
square with us, so I'd rather wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, I began to concern myself about Y2K, especially when
finding ads in magazines such as the one selling 200-gallon
waterbags for $79; two for $149 _ water not included. There were
those who were telling me to hoard money, but I could not figure
out why. If everything came crashing down that moment, what good is
money? What can you buy with it?
</P>
<P>
   Posthaste book advisers are suggesting we get copies of our
family records, keep First Aid kits stocked, take courses in
computer stuff, get Zip disks, be kinder to the dog, make your
peace with God, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, I am receiving assurances, such as when I read that
Quicken financial software, which I have in my computer, is ``Y2K
compliant and will work smoothly at least until 2027.'' Having been
born just 17 days before Franklin Delano Roosevelt was first
elected president, I cannot help but wonder if I will be around
until 2027 to see if this is correct. And even if I am, and Quicken
is working smoothly, will I be?
</P>
<P>
   Having already stocked my South Florida home for this 1999
hurricane season _ Migod, there's something out there already! _ I
am well on my way to being secure for whatever Y2K brings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 7 a.m., Dec. 31, I will arise to the clamor of an alarm
clock, turn to CNN and see if Auckland is still functioning. If it
is, I will roll over and go back to sleep. If it isn't, or if CNN
isn't, then I've got 17 hours to get the batteries out of the old
refrigerator in the garage and into the flashlights, portable
radios, laptop computer and TVs, yank the remaining grapefruit and
oranges from the trees and bring the canned goods down from the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of hurricanes, I've done that before. Inexplicably,
I always forget where I put the manual can opener. Yes, that is
what I will do. I will devote the rest of this year to finding the

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: House crime bills would cause more harm than help
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With GOP leadership _ pardon the oxymoron _ bypassing committee
hearings and going straight to the floor, the House this week will
debate and vote on fake gun control and throwback juvenile crime
measures. With luck, the whole mess will politically self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is being rewritten on the fly, a moving target,
but as last glimpsed it tendered a muddle of crudely punitive
measures and versions of Senate-passed gun controls that have been
weakened to pointlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Senate, for instance, corked the huge loophole that
allows firearm sales at gun shows without background checks, House
Republicans have redefined ``gun show'' so that it no longer covers
_ well, gun shows. The GOP is giving sound value to the National
Rifle Association for the $740,000 the lobby spent on a mail
campaign and the $300,000 it spent on phone banks to queer the
Senate gun provisions.
</P>
<P>
   (And as a bonbon, House Republicans would let dealers in some
situations go back to shipping guns interstate, illegal for the
past 30 years.)
</P>
<P>
   The gun games are being played out in the context of supposed
juvenile justice legislation that would do more to create adult
career criminals than to curb juvenile crime, snubbing effective
interventions for a return to brutish practices that we know from
experience _ and from endless studies, if you want to get academic
about it _ produce repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as
adults for a broadened array of crimes and would let federal
prosecutors, without judicial review, make those decisions. It
would establish mandatory sentences for youths, some longer than
those for adults committing the same crimes. It would open juvenile
records.
</P>
<P>
   And it would lower the barriers against confining juveniles in
adult facilities, a practice that we know increases youth suicides,
rapes and beatings many times over.
</P>
<P>
   A neat if coincidental 100 years after creation of the juvenile
court system ended the worst abuses of young offenders, Congress,
in bipartisan hysteria, is trying to drag the nation back toward
the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this, mind you, while juvenile crime is plunging. The
juvenile homicide rate has dropped by almost half since 1993. The
juvenile arrest rate for all violence is down 37 percent in the
past five years, a larger decline than the adult rate. The
percentage of violent crimes attributed to juveniles is at its
lowest point since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse _ and it is only that _ for this legislative
malpractice is the horrid spate of schoolhouse shootings. (All
committed by suburban and small-town white boys. Guaranteed: Most
of the kids charged and jailed by the new ``justice'' would be city
minority kids. To hide that, the Senate has voted to gut a law
requiring states to study the gross racial disproportions in youth
arrests and incarceration.)
</P>
<P>
   A wise Congress would adopt the Senate gun controls, skip
regressive excesses and save youth crime prevention features. This
is not that Congress.

   1. BENEATH THE FALLING BOMBS ``In a moral universe full of
shadows and grief, I have been an American correspondent working in
a country at war with America. My most searing memory is not of
physical horror - of the charred corpses from a bombed passenger
train, or the severed head near a rocketed column of Albanian
refugees. All that comes with war in the Balkans, when history and
high explosives collide. What will stay with me longest is the
memory of two large bearded Serbian men, hours apart, weeping
uncontrollably in my arms, the arms of the aggressor, over the
deaths of their friends from an American missile.'' By Steven
Erlanger. From The New York Times Magazine. 1,000 words.

THE FEATHER : MIRACLE OF NATURE (AND EVOLUTION) The feather, which
is now understood to have evolved from scales on the backs of
dinosaurs, is a multi-functional device of almost unimaginable
diversity. Not only did it allow earthly creatures millions of

across oceans, it also helps them stand out or blend in, providing
camouflage and defence. Birds, it turns out, even renew and repair
their feathers in flight. By Uwe George. From GEO magazine. 2,500

`DADDY'S' GIRL: JOEY LAUREN ADAMS ENTERS THE GOOFY WORLD OF ADAM
SANDLER

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Joey Lauren Adams with Adam Sandler in a
scene from ``Big Daddy.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The face is sort of familiar, but people can't quite place it.
Wasn't she ... no, no ... but still ...
 &HT;    And then she speaks, and everyone recognizes Joey Lauren Adams.
 &HT;    Hard to mistake that memorable little-girl voice, one part
Minnie Mouse mixed with one part Melanie Griffith.
 &HT;    ``I am one of the few actresses who isn't recognized by the way
she looks,'' Adams says. ``I'm recognized by the way I talk.''
 &HT;    The other day, she recalls during a breakfast conversation at
the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, she was in a hardware
store when a guy came up and told her, ``You sound awfully
familiar.''
 &HT;    Adams, who earned raves in the critically acclaimed independent
film ``Chasing Amy'' (1997), smiled.
 &HT;    Alas, he hadn't seen ``Chasing Amy.'' Or ``Michael'' (1996). Or
any of her nearly a dozen films.
 &HT;    ``I started listing my resume to this guy,'' Adams says. ``If
they're totally stumped, I will slowly admit, ```Married With
Children'' _ I'm the girl who took Bud Bundy's virginity.'''
 &HT;    She rolls her eyes.
 &HT;    ``I swear, lightbulbs go off when I mention that one.''
 &HT;    In not too long, chances are the lightbulbs will be popping for
something more recent, if not noticeably more sophisticated. On
June 25, she's opening in ``Big Daddy,'' opposite Adam Sandler.
 &HT;    It's her highest-profile role yet, and Adams _ pretty in a
down-to-earth way with brown, bobbed hair, khaki pants and a black
sweater _ says she has no reservations about undertaking so
commercial a project.
 &HT;    ``It was definitely my plan to do a movie that would be big at
the box office,'' the 31-year-old actress says. ``I think I was a
little naive after `Chasing Amy.' I thought I would be able to do
anything I wanted to do, and that wasn't the case.
 &HT;    ``At this point, I realize I have to do a few commercial films
that make money at the box office to do the projects I want,'' she
says. ``Plus I just don't have the patience to hold out for great
art each time.''
 &HT;    And besides, there's that voice.
 &HT;    ``I read scripts that I really, really like, but then my voice
can be a problem at the audition,'' she says. ``There have been
several times when a director has said, `Change it. It's grating.'
I'm even thinking I should change it and maybe talk a little
deeper.
 &HT;    ``But then I don't sound like me, and that freaks me out.''
 &HT;    The voice wasn't a problem for ``Big Daddy'' _ Sandler will
never pass for James Mason or James Earl Jones, either _ but there
were other considerations. For example, doing a love scene with the
genially inept Sandler, whose doofus-fest films have rarely
featured romantic interludes.
 &HT;    ``The kissing was no big deal for me _ I've done full-out love
scenes,'' Adams says. ``Adam was a little bit nervous. He was a
movie-kissing rookie. But soon he became very conscious of not
pushing my head out of the frame. And he was very sweet about it.
 &HT;    ``Never once did I think, `I'm kissing The Waterboy.'''
 &HT;    Waterboy or not, it's only the latest step in a career which
began in Arkansas 29 years ago, when the 2-year-old daughter of a
lumberyard worker and a housewife started performing in church
plays.
 &HT;    ``I was always the little angel,'' she says. ``My mom says that
if there was applause, I would really eat it up.''
 &HT;    Much as she enjoyed performing, however, the Arkansas native
never envisioned herself a movie star.
 &HT;    ``As a young girl, I didn't think a career as an actress was
really an option,'' Adams says. ``I just loved movies. And the
movies made me realize there was no culture in Arkansas _ I was
literally living in a vacuum.''
 &HT;    At 19, Adams packed her bags and headed out.
 &HT;    ``I didn't leave to become an actress,'' she says. ``I just
wanted to expose myself to life. For instance, I had never met
anyone from another culture. I never met a Hindu, I didn't know
what that meant. I was such a sheltered infant.''
 &HT;    She headed for San Diego and then to Los Angeles, where she got
her break in show business. Sort of.
 &HT;    ``I got a job singing backup with a country-western singer,''
she recalls, ``and we toured China.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``Well, we were supposed to tour China,'' she says. ``But we got
kicked out. Our singer would mean to take an upper and he would
take a downer. He would sing the same verse over and over again
until people were sick of it. It was just a nightmare, and we were
actually asked to leave the country.''
 &HT;    By that point, she adds, it was almost a relief.
 &HT;    ``The worst part is that I would have to stand there swinging my
hips, and the lead singer would come up and try to rub on us
girls,'' she recalls. ``And since we were onstage, you couldn't do
anything about it.''
 &HT;    Not long afterward, however, she began to find movie work,
beginning with a small role in Richard Linklater's cult classic
``Dazed and Confused'' (1993). She teamed with Parker Posey as a
singing duo in ``Sleep With Me'' (1994), and played a pie-eating
waitress who seduces John Travolta in ``Michael.''
 &HT;    Her other film credits include ``Coneheads'' (1993), ``The
Program'' (1993), ``Mallrats'' (1995), ``Bio-Dome'' (1996) and ``A
Cool Dry Place'' (1998).
 &HT;    But it was Kevin Smith's ``Chasing Amy,'' and her role as a
lesbian comic-book artist in love with a straight man (Ben
Affleck), that really caught people's eye. And it's no accident,
Adams says.
 &HT;    ``I've learned to be more comfortable as an actress, which makes
me more present,'' she says. ``Years ago, if I had an emotional
scene, I used to sit in my trailer and listen to really depressing
music and think about really awful, sad things.
 &HT;    ``I've learned that doesn't work,'' Adams says. ``It has to come
from inside.''
 &HT;    Adams just wrapped ``Bruno,'' Shirley MacLaine's directorial
debut, and has her eye on ``Tuesday's Child,'' a romance which
would co-star James Garner.
 &HT;    On the personal side, she says, things aren't going as well.
Relationships with Smith and then with her ``Cool Dry Place''
co-star Vince Vaughn didn't work out, which Adams says is as much
about her as about the relationships themselves.
 &HT;    Yes, she's in therapy.
 &HT;    ``I've just started dealing with a lot of father issues,'' she
says. ``It's liberating when you realize what effect your
upbringing has on you. I wanted to look at my relationship with my
father in a very honest way, and not in a 6-year-old-little-girl
way of looking up to your Daddy.''
 &HT;    She shakes her head.
 &HT;    ``You kind of sit there and feel like an idiot in therapy,'' she
says. ``I'm going, `Duh, my father didn't talk to me, so I don't
feel men understand me.'''
 &HT;    And no, being young, beautiful and near the top of the studio
hot lists doesn't mean that handsome Hollywood hunks are fighting
for her telephone number.
 &HT;    ``Where are they?'' Adams says, laughing. ``And just because
they're big stars doesn't mean they're great guys.''
 &HT;    Most of them can't even measure up to Adam ``Big Daddy''
Sandler, she adds with that little-girl laugh.
 &HT;    ``Try big duddies!''

`ALIEN'-ATION: SCI-FI'S LANDMARK HORROR FLICK, 20 YEARS LATER  
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Ian Holm, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt
and John Hurt in a scene from ``Alien.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The year was 1979.
 &HT;    Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin signed the Camp
David peace accords, and Ayatollah Khomeini replaced the Shah as
ruler of Iran. William Styron penned ``Sophie's Choice,'' and John
Wayne moseyed on into the next world.
 &HT;    And in space no one could hear you scream.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, it's been 20 years since Ridley Scott's
``Alien'' scared moviegoers silly with its moody atmosphere, nasty
mother alien, oodles of goop and, of course, John Hurt's notorious
chest-burster sequence, one of the most viscerally frightening
scenes ever filmed.
 &HT;    To commemorate the film's 20th anniversary, Twentieth Century
Fox has released video and DVD versions of ``Alien,'' ``Aliens''
(1986), ``Alien 3'' (1992) and ``Alien Resurrection'' (1997) that
include deleted sequences, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews
with most of the key players, onscreen and off.
 &HT;    To date, the sci-fi/horror series has generated more than $500
million at the box office. But it all began with a
down-at-the-heels starfreighter called the Nostromo, and a volatile
crew of space truckers _ Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt,
Veronica Cartwright, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton
_ facing off against fierce, sleek and deadly alien creatures.
 &HT;    ``You don't realize that something will become a classic in its
own vein,'' Hurt says. ``You don't think like that.''
 &HT;    Despite an impressive resume that includes ``Chariots of Fire''
(1981), ``The Madness of King George'' (1994) and ``The Sweet
Hereafter'' (1997), Holm is still most often recognized for
``Alien.''
 &HT;    ``Actually, `recognized' may not be the right word,'' he says.
``I've had people say, `Have you seen that movie, ``Alien?'''
 &HT;    ``I say, `Yes, I have. I'm in it.' They'll say, `You're in it?
What do you play?'
 &HT;    ``I'll explain I played the robot, and they'll say, `The robot?
Oh, my God!'''
 &HT;    Holm laughs.
 &HT;    ``It was hell to make,'' he says. ``It was not a comfortable
movie. Ridley was a real one-man band and real tough _ he tends not
to tolerate fools.
 &HT;    ``It was an extraordinary experience.''
 &HT;    The film's piece de resistance, of course, occurs about halfway
through, when a baby alien burrows its way out of Hurt's chest,
splattering blood over the other characters, then growls and darts
off.
 &HT;    ``I remember shooting that scene, vividly,'' Hurt says. ``I was
doubled over on the table. Then they cut away, and when they cut
away I went through a hole in the table and legs were built on, so
the prop guys could fiddle around with the little creature. It was
very low-tech.
 &HT;    ``A lot has been said about the other actors not knowing what
would happen,'' he adds. ``Of course they knew _ but they didn't
know there would be caps to splatter the blood around.
 &HT;    ``Ridley had four or five cameras on everybody to capture the
moment in closeups and two-shots. So a lot of it was done in one
shot.''
 &HT;    Cartwright, whose long career has included such other ventures
into the bizarre as ``The Birds'' (1963) and several episodes of
``The X-Files,'' has her own memories of the scene.
 &HT;    ``We were up in the dressing room for four or five hours while
they got John ready,'' she says. ``Harry Dean had brought his
guitar and was playing wonderful Mexican music in the hallways. We
all just wandered around, trying to figure out what the hell was
going on.
 &HT;    ``By the time they got us down to the set, everybody there was
wearing raincoats and everything was covered in plastic,'' she
continues. ``They had several cameras set up and had buckets of
`awful' _ all the guts and stuff _ soaking in formaldehyde. Ugh,
the stench! It was unbelievable.''
 &HT;    Scott told the other actors to bend over and stare at Hurt's
chest as the creature cracked through. He thoughtfully warned
Cartwright that she'd get a little blood on her.
 &HT;    ``A little blood,'' she says, snickering. ``I had a blood jet
pointed at my face!
 &HT;    ``The anticipation built because they had to fix John's shirt,''
she recalls. ``Then the creature punched through, and what you saw
was the first reaction on everybody's face.
 &HT;    ``When it burst all the way through, the blood jet went off in
my face,'' she concludes. ``I backed up, my knees hit the back of
the couch and I flipped upside down. The dailies were hysterical.
But I got up and ran back into the shot.
 &HT;    ``Ridley had his cameras trained on what he wanted, and that was
it. We did it once.''
 &HT;    Actually, it was almost someone else on that table. Hurt had
been Scott's first choice to play Kane, but the British actor had
already committed to another film about to be shot in South Africa.
 &HT;    At the last minute, however, he learned that he wouldn't be
allowed into South Africa, while at the same time hearing that the
actor playing Kane had fallen ill.
 &HT;    ``They'd already started shooting `Alien,''' Hurt recalls.
``Ridley rang me up and said, `Look, can I come around and talk to
you this evening?' He arrived around 10 p.m. and didn't leave until
midnight. He went through exactly what he wanted to do with the
film.
 &HT;    ``In a sense, I suppose he was pitching it to me, because he
really needed an actor for that part,'' Hurt says. ``Everything he
said that night was in the film _ everything.''
 &HT;    Cartwright had a less pleasant casting discovery, however. She
had auditioned for the role of Ripley, which ultimately made Weaver
a star. When she was called to make the film, she assumed she'd won
the part.
 &HT;    ``Originally I thought I had Ripley, as did my agent,'' she
recalls. ``I'd not even read the script from the point of view of
Lambert.
 &HT;    ``When they called to set up the wardrobe fittings, I was over
in England. They told me I'd be going in to try on costumes for
Lambert and I said, `Oh, no, there's a mistake. I think I'm
supposed to be Ripley.'''
 &HT;    Instead of having a tantrum, Cartwright threw herself into her
new role.
 &HT;    ``I reread it from her point of view,'' she says. ``I didn't
want her to be this whiny person. If you're a trucker in space,
you've obviously had a lot of experience.''
 &HT;    Lambert became the film's voice of practicality.
 &HT;    ``She wants to get the f--k off that ship,'' Cartwright says.
``She wants to use that capsule and she says, `Listen, a--holes,
let's get going!'
 &HT;    ``Always in those movies you go, `Oh, please, don't go back in
there! How stupid _ you're going to get it,''' she says. ``The
audience is saying, `Just get out of there!'
 &HT;    ``So that's what I did.''
 &HT;    Scott didn't tell Cartwright why she ended up playing Lambert.
 &HT;    ``He never said anything,'' she says. ``It was just a
miscommunication or something. I have no idea.''
 &HT;    Crucial to the film's success was its innovative design, as
conceived by H.R. Giger. The look of its much-imitated, buglike
monsters may have been the movie's most influential element.
 &HT;    ``I think it is a classic,'' Cartwright says. ``Every movie you
saw after it had an alien and it looked like our alien. Even
Godzilla looked like our alien.
 &HT;    ``All of these movies seem to have some part of `Alien' in
them,'' she says. ``Obviously, what Ridley created was horrifying.
 &HT;    ``It's pretty amazing, isn't it?''

R.E.M-PHATIC: ROCK'S QUIRKIEST BAND REINVENTS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of the three members of R.E.M.: Michael
Stipe, Mike Mills and Peter Buck.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Hi. We're R.E.M., and we're glad to be here,'' Michael Stipe
told the crowd at a San Francisco benefit concert last fall.
 &HT;    He might have added that R.E.M. was glad to be, period.
 &HT;    Prior to releasing its latest album, ``Up'' _ which the Athens,
Ga.-based group is promoting with a summer-long world tour that
kicked off on June 17 in Lisbon, Portugal _ R.E.M. wasn't sure it
would play again or release any more music.
 &HT;    After having redefined what was considered ``modern'' and
``alternative'' rock since 1983, the members of R.E.M. were afraid
it might be time to put their group to sleep.
 &HT;    Winding down a band that had sold millions of records might seem
extreme, but not to R.E.M. _ not after the 1997 retirement of Bill
Berry, the first personnel change in the band's history. The
drummer had suffered a near-fatal double brain aneurysm early in
the group's 1995 world tour, and though he fully recovered and
spent the rest of the year on the road, he found he no longer had
the enthusiasm for the rock 'n' roll lifestyle that he once had
felt.
 &HT;    His bandmates understood and respected his decision, but that
didn't make his leaving any easier for them to deal with.
 &HT;    ``Bill leaving R.E.M. is different from a drummer leaving a
regular band,'' Stipe explains. ``Each member had so much to do
with the music that we made and how we presented ourselves in
everything. It was a real blow.''
 &HT;    Berry's announcement didn't come out of the blue, however.
 &HT;    ``He told me that `I can't see doing this a whole lot longer,
probably three more records,''' guitarist Peter Buck recalls.
``That was two weeks before he quit.''
 &HT;    ``I knew he wasn't happy,'' bassist/keyboardist Mike Mills adds.
``We all knew he wasn't happy, but I knew that he was really
unhappy and wanting to get out. I didn't know when he would do it
or if he would do it, but to Peter and Michael it was a big
shock.''
 &HT;    In other words, it was the end of the world as they knew it. But
these days R.E.M. feels fine.
 &HT;    That's because the remaining trio is justifiably psyched about
``Up.'' Despite its disappointing sales, the record is a brave
departure, different from anything the group has ever released _
not to mention a daring way to start what's reported to be an $80
million new contract with Warner Bros. Records.
 &HT;    As it turns out, R.E.M. used Berry's departure as the occasion
for a radical rethinking of the way it makes music. Many of the
group's trademarks _ particularly Buck's stinging guitar _ are
gone, displaced by a lusher kind of ambience. Keyboards and strings
dominate the arrangements, with rhythm machines or drums played by
Buck and Mills providing color and texture rather than propulsion.
 &HT;    The musicians themselves changed their roles as much as they
changed the music. Mills relinquished his bass duties to Buck, for
instance, and the group employed instruments such as vibraphone and
tubular bells. Stipe even took a guitar solo on the song ``Why Not
Smile'' _ though he later explains that ``I drank way too much wine
that night.''
 &HT;    ``Having kind of brazenly decided we'd continue, we kind of had
two options,'' Stipe explains.
 &HT;    One was to hire a journeyman drummer _ ``a fake Bill Berry,''
Stipe says _ to carry on as usual. The other choice was simply to
accept and adapt to the circumstances.
 &HT;    ``It was really liberating to have things shook up that much,''
he says. ``We took every process and every way that we've ever had
of recording and just chucked it out the window and started with a
completely blank slate _ the sky's the limit, we can do anything,
we can go anywhere with this. Let's embrace it.
 &HT;    ``And we did _ not to say that it was easy or fun, because it
wasn't.''
 &HT;    All three members acknowledge that the making of ``Up'' was
turbulent.
 &HT;    ``It shook up enough stuff that it made us have to re-examine
everything,'' Buck says. ``Like how we work together, how we write
songs.''
 &HT;    Stipe even expected the group to break up while making the
album, he says.
 &HT;    But Buck believes that their exercise in drastic change actually
strengthened the band more than it weakened it.
 &HT;    ``We're extremely stubborn people,'' he explains. ``We just did
it. We didn't talk about it, like `Is this difficult? Is this hard?
Is this the right thing to do?' We ended up finishing the record
under a lot of stress, then sat down and talked about the
experiences.
 &HT;    ``Having done all that, we just realized we made a great
record,'' he concludes. ``And that we're still good friends. We
kind of walked through fire on this one.''
 &HT;    R.E.M.'s decision to tour is a testimony to that realization.
When the album was initially released, the group announced that it
was going to forgo a tour. The subtle material on ``Up'' seemed so
different that it wouldn't necessarily fit comfortably next to the
group's older material, they said.
 &HT;    But a series of promotional dates in the United States and
Europe, with three sidemen fleshing out the group's sound, helped
to change their minds.
 &HT;    And there's no denying that ``Up,'' which despite its name did a
quick slide down the charts after its release, could use the
additional push.
 &HT;    But while Stipe, Buck and Mills admit to being disappointed by
the album's weak sales, all three claim to be unfazed. The truth
is, they say, that change is sometimes harder for the audience than
it is for the performer, and ``Up'' is most definitely a radical
change from what their fans had been used to.
 &HT;    ``I feel like this is the first album of the new band,'' Buck
says. ``We're pretty much called R.E.M. because that's who signed
the contract. The three of us are a different band now.
 &HT;    ``Inventing something and compromising something is not as
easy,'' he says. ``But we've done this for a million years, and we
think we know what we're doing.''

 (Includes a color slide of Keri Russell, Scott Speedman and Scott
Foley in a scene from ``Felicity.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, ``Felicity'' was being hailed by critics as
1998/99's only can't-miss new show _ and also suffering the
customary bashing that comes with front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had an opinion about ``Felicity,'' including plenty of
people who'd never seen a second of it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the WB drama about a pert California teen (Keri
Russell) who moves to New York to attend college _ and pursue her
handsome high-school classmate, Ben (Scott Speedman) _ has
established itself as a solid hit, not to mention making stars of
Russell, Speedman and Scott Foley, who plays the third leg of their
triangle, the thoroughly decent Noel.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Felicity,'' Russell's biggest credit was a gig on ``The
New Mickey Mouse Club.'' Speedman had virtually no acting
experience, having been cast purely on the basis of a killer
audition tape.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Russell says, getting used to the show has been much
like the adjustments their characters have gone through as
first-year college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a parallel there,'' she says. ``None of us
knew what to expect when this all started. This show was a lot
different from anything I had ever worked on before, and it took
some adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when I first signed onto the show, I was so
excited, but I was also so scared,'' she recalls. ``It was
completely overwhelming. Now I feel like I know what's going on,
and I know how to handle all the publicity and craziness. I have a
better sense of awareness, and I know how to pace myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman says he never felt overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept telling me what a crazy year it was going to
be,'' he says, ``but it wasn't. I mean, it was crazy at times, but
that was mostly because of the workload and long hours. It was
pretty weird, but not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, Russell naturally got a more
concentrated version of the hype. She's become used to seeing her
character dissected as a role model _ and faring better than such
past victims as Murphy Brown or Ally McBeal _ and says she's been
delighted by the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tons of letters,'' she says, ``and everyone is just
completely cool. It's the same thing with the way people respond in
public _ they're pretty laid back: They don't come up screaming,
`There's Felicity!' They usually just come up and say, `We think
your show is so cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to be a little calmer, I guess, compared to fans
of other shows,'' she adds. ``But those are the type of people the
show attracts. Our viewers are really intelligent. They're not
screaming, unless it's a pack of 12-year-old boys or something.
They always have positive things to say about the show, so for the
most part it's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman adds that the difference is more noticeable when they
get away from Los Angeles, which he says prides itself on letting
celebrities alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many actors down there, they can't tell one from
the next,'' he says. ``It's when you go to a small town that it
gets kind of strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans seem to be really polite,'' he says. ``They're not
overwhelming. We've got a small, really hardcore audience. Those
people who've come up to me are just really polite.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the fans do get excited about, however, is Felicity's
vacillating between her longstanding crush on the often-arrogant
Ben and her new interest in the lower-key Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the neighborhood I live in, there's an all-girl school,''
Russell says. ``I would be riding my bike to the post office or
whatever, and these girls would always come up to me and ask who I
liked better, Ben or Noel. Then they would chant, `Noel! Noel!
You've got to choose Noel!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the occasional few of them liked Ben,'' she says with a
joking sneer at Speedman. ``But I really liked the idea that girls
like Noel best, because he's definitely more of a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period for about a month last season where Ben
just got hit with one thing after another,'' Speedman says
defensively. ``He had a gambling problem, and so on. There was no
good news for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the writers make Noel a really pleasant guy, so there's
not much comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The series began as a star turn for Russell, but seems to be
evolving into an ensemble show _ a development which she says suits
her just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea that we've become an ensemble cast,'' the
actress says. ``And it did make things a bit easier on me. I'm
still working a lot, but it's a lot easier than those first few
episodes, when I was in almost every scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also some really talented people in our cast,''
Speedman adds. ``They deserve their chance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' fans rave about the show's music, which offers a
much wider range than most teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love the music on our show,'' Russell says,
beaming. ``Our music supervisor, Amanda Demme, is fabulous. Look at
our soundtrack album that was just released _ it has people like
Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just teenybopper little songs,'' she says. ``It's the
same kind of music that I like listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   The series seems likely to continue indefinitely, but Speedman
doubts that it will rack up anything like the nine-year run of
``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all, like, 40 years old now,'' he groans. ``That show
is like a factory, just pushing out product. I'd leave the show if
we ever got like that _ which isn't likely to happen. Our show is
so different. We have great writers, and the quality control is
right there.''

Nothing closer-range _ such as how they'll resolve last season's
teaser ending, which left Felicity torn between going to Europe
with Noel or driving home to California with Ben.

``So many people have been asking me that question. And they're
just writing the new season right now, so it's still up in the air.

   ``I kind of know what's going to happen,'' she says teasingly,

 (Includes a color slide of Joey Lauren Adams with Adam Sandler in a
scene from ``Big Daddy.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The face is sort of familiar, but people can't quite place it.
Wasn't she ... no, no ... but still ...
 &HT;    And then she speaks, and everyone recognizes Joey Lauren Adams.
 &HT;    Hard to mistake that memorable little-girl voice, one part
Minnie Mouse mixed with one part Melanie Griffith.
 &HT;    ``I am one of the few actresses who isn't recognized by the way
she looks,'' Adams says. ``I'm recognized by the way I talk.''
 &HT;    The other day, she recalls during a breakfast conversation at
the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, she was in a hardware
store when a guy came up and told her, ``You sound awfully
familiar.''
 &HT;    Adams, who earned raves in the critically acclaimed independent
film ``Chasing Amy'' (1997), smiled.
 &HT;    Alas, he hadn't seen ``Chasing Amy.'' Or ``Michael'' (1996). Or
any of her nearly a dozen films.
 &HT;    ``I started listing my resume to this guy,'' Adams says. ``If
they're totally stumped, I will slowly admit, ```Married With
Children'' _ I'm the girl who took Bud Bundy's virginity.'''
 &HT;    She rolls her eyes.
 &HT;    ``I swear, lightbulbs go off when I mention that one.''
 &HT;    In not too long, chances are the lightbulbs will be popping for
something more recent, if not noticeably more sophisticated. On
June 25, she's opening in ``Big Daddy,'' opposite Adam Sandler.
 &HT;    It's her highest-profile role yet, and Adams _ pretty in a
down-to-earth way with brown, bobbed hair, khaki pants and a black
sweater _ says she has no reservations about undertaking so
commercial a project.
 &HT;    ``It was definitely my plan to do a movie that would be big at
the box office,'' the 31-year-old actress says. ``I think I was a
little naive after `Chasing Amy.' I thought I would be able to do
anything I wanted to do, and that wasn't the case.
 &HT;    ``At this point, I realize I have to do a few commercial films
that make money at the box office to do the projects I want,'' she
says. ``Plus I just don't have the patience to hold out for great
art each time.''
 &HT;    And besides, there's that voice.
 &HT;    ``I read scripts that I really, really like, but then my voice
can be a problem at the audition,'' she says. ``There have been
several times when a director has said, `Change it. It's grating.'
I'm even thinking I should change it and maybe talk a little
deeper.
 &HT;    ``But then I don't sound like me, and that freaks me out.''
 &HT;    The voice wasn't a problem for ``Big Daddy'' _ Sandler will
never pass for James Mason or James Earl Jones, either _ but there
were other considerations. For example, doing a love scene with the
genially inept Sandler, whose doofus-fest films have rarely
featured romantic interludes.
 &HT;    ``The kissing was no big deal for me _ I've done full-out love
scenes,'' Adams says. ``Adam was a little bit nervous. He was a
movie-kissing rookie. But soon he became very conscious of not
pushing my head out of the frame. And he was very sweet about it.
 &HT;    ``Never once did I think, `I'm kissing The Waterboy.'''
 &HT;    Waterboy or not, it's only the latest step in a career which
began in Arkansas 29 years ago, when the 2-year-old daughter of a
lumberyard worker and a housewife started performing in church
plays.
 &HT;    ``I was always the little angel,'' she says. ``My mom says that
if there was applause, I would really eat it up.''
 &HT;    Much as she enjoyed performing, however, the Arkansas native
never envisioned herself a movie star.
 &HT;    ``As a young girl, I didn't think a career as an actress was
really an option,'' Adams says. ``I just loved movies. And the
movies made me realize there was no culture in Arkansas _ I was
literally living in a vacuum.''
 &HT;    At 19, Adams packed her bags and headed out.
 &HT;    ``I didn't leave to become an actress,'' she says. ``I just
wanted to expose myself to life. For instance, I had never met
anyone from another culture. I never met a Hindu, I didn't know
what that meant. I was such a sheltered infant.''
 &HT;    She headed for San Diego and then to Los Angeles, where she got
her break in show business. Sort of.
 &HT;    ``I got a job singing backup with a country-western singer,''
she recalls, ``and we toured China.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``Well, we were supposed to tour China,'' she says. ``But we got
kicked out. Our singer would mean to take an upper and he would
take a downer. He would sing the same verse over and over again
until people were sick of it. It was just a nightmare, and we were
actually asked to leave the country.''
 &HT;    By that point, she adds, it was almost a relief.
 &HT;    ``The worst part is that I would have to stand there swinging my
hips, and the lead singer would come up and try to rub on us
girls,'' she recalls. ``And since we were onstage, you couldn't do
anything about it.''
 &HT;    Not long afterward, however, she began to find movie work,
beginning with a small role in Richard Linklater's cult classic
``Dazed and Confused'' (1993). She teamed with Parker Posey as a
singing duo in ``Sleep With Me'' (1994), and played a pie-eating
waitress who seduces John Travolta in ``Michael.''
 &HT;    Her other film credits include ``Coneheads'' (1993), ``The
Program'' (1993), ``Mallrats'' (1995), ``Bio-Dome'' (1996) and ``A
Cool Dry Place'' (1998).
 &HT;    But it was Kevin Smith's ``Chasing Amy,'' and her role as a
lesbian comic-book artist in love with a straight man (Ben
Affleck), that really caught people's eye. And it's no accident,
Adams says.
 &HT;    ``I've learned to be more comfortable as an actress, which makes
me more present,'' she says. ``Years ago, if I had an emotional
scene, I used to sit in my trailer and listen to really depressing
music and think about really awful, sad things.
 &HT;    ``I've learned that doesn't work,'' Adams says. ``It has to come
from inside.''
 &HT;    Adams just wrapped ``Bruno,'' Shirley MacLaine's directorial
debut, and has her eye on ``Tuesday's Child,'' a romance which
would co-star James Garner.
 &HT;    On the personal side, she says, things aren't going as well.
Relationships with Smith and then with her ``Cool Dry Place''
co-star Vince Vaughn didn't work out, which Adams says is as much
about her as about the relationships themselves.
 &HT;    Yes, she's in therapy.
 &HT;    ``I've just started dealing with a lot of father issues,'' she
says. ``It's liberating when you realize what effect your
upbringing has on you. I wanted to look at my relationship with my
father in a very honest way, and not in a 6-year-old-little-girl
way of looking up to your Daddy.''
 &HT;    She shakes her head.
 &HT;    ``You kind of sit there and feel like an idiot in therapy,'' she
says. ``I'm going, `Duh, my father didn't talk to me, so I don't
feel men understand me.'''
 &HT;    And no, being young, beautiful and near the top of the studio
hot lists doesn't mean that handsome Hollywood hunks are fighting
for her telephone number.
 &HT;    ``Where are they?'' Adams says, laughing. ``And just because
they're big stars doesn't mean they're great guys.''
 &HT;    Most of them can't even measure up to Adam ``Big Daddy''
Sandler, she adds with that little-girl laugh.
 &HT;    ``Try big duddies!''

`ALIEN'-ATION: SCI-FI'S LANDMARK HORROR FLICK, 20 YEARS LATER  
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Ian Holm, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt
and John Hurt in a scene from ``Alien.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The year was 1979.
 &HT;    Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin signed the Camp
David peace accords, and Ayatollah Khomeini replaced the Shah as
ruler of Iran. William Styron penned ``Sophie's Choice,'' and John
Wayne moseyed on into the next world.
 &HT;    And in space no one could hear you scream.
 &HT;    Believe it or not, it's been 20 years since Ridley Scott's
``Alien'' scared moviegoers silly with its moody atmosphere, nasty
mother alien, oodles of goop and, of course, John Hurt's notorious
chest-burster sequence, one of the most viscerally frightening
scenes ever filmed.
 &HT;    To commemorate the film's 20th anniversary, Twentieth Century
Fox has released video and DVD versions of ``Alien,'' ``Aliens''
(1986), ``Alien 3'' (1992) and ``Alien Resurrection'' (1997) that
include deleted sequences, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews
with most of the key players, onscreen and off.
 &HT;    To date, the sci-fi/horror series has generated more than $500
million at the box office. But it all began with a
down-at-the-heels starfreighter called the Nostromo, and a volatile
crew of space truckers _ Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt,
Veronica Cartwright, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton
_ facing off against fierce, sleek and deadly alien creatures.
 &HT;    ``You don't realize that something will become a classic in its
own vein,'' Hurt says. ``You don't think like that.''
 &HT;    Despite an impressive resume that includes ``Chariots of Fire''
(1981), ``The Madness of King George'' (1994) and ``The Sweet
Hereafter'' (1997), Holm is still most often recognized for
``Alien.''
 &HT;    ``Actually, `recognized' may not be the right word,'' he says.
``I've had people say, `Have you seen that movie, ``Alien?'''
 &HT;    ``I say, `Yes, I have. I'm in it.' They'll say, `You're in it?
What do you play?'
 &HT;    ``I'll explain I played the robot, and they'll say, `The robot?
Oh, my God!'''
 &HT;    Holm laughs.
 &HT;    ``It was hell to make,'' he says. ``It was not a comfortable
movie. Ridley was a real one-man band and real tough _ he tends not
to tolerate fools.
 &HT;    ``It was an extraordinary experience.''
 &HT;    The film's piece de resistance, of course, occurs about halfway
through, when a baby alien burrows its way out of Hurt's chest,
splattering blood over the other characters, then growls and darts
off.
 &HT;    ``I remember shooting that scene, vividly,'' Hurt says. ``I was
doubled over on the table. Then they cut away, and when they cut
away I went through a hole in the table and legs were built on, so
the prop guys could fiddle around with the little creature. It was
very low-tech.
 &HT;    ``A lot has been said about the other actors not knowing what
would happen,'' he adds. ``Of course they knew _ but they didn't
know there would be caps to splatter the blood around.
 &HT;    ``Ridley had four or five cameras on everybody to capture the
moment in closeups and two-shots. So a lot of it was done in one
shot.''
 &HT;    Cartwright, whose long career has included such other ventures
into the bizarre as ``The Birds'' (1963) and several episodes of
``The X-Files,'' has her own memories of the scene.
 &HT;    ``We were up in the dressing room for four or five hours while
they got John ready,'' she says. ``Harry Dean had brought his
guitar and was playing wonderful Mexican music in the hallways. We
all just wandered around, trying to figure out what the hell was
going on.
 &HT;    ``By the time they got us down to the set, everybody there was
wearing raincoats and everything was covered in plastic,'' she
continues. ``They had several cameras set up and had buckets of
`awful' _ all the guts and stuff _ soaking in formaldehyde. Ugh,
the stench! It was unbelievable.''
 &HT;    Scott told the other actors to bend over and stare at Hurt's
chest as the creature cracked through. He thoughtfully warned
Cartwright that she'd get a little blood on her.
 &HT;    ``A little blood,'' she says, snickering. ``I had a blood jet
pointed at my face!
 &HT;    ``The anticipation built because they had to fix John's shirt,''
she recalls. ``Then the creature punched through, and what you saw
was the first reaction on everybody's face.
 &HT;    ``When it burst all the way through, the blood jet went off in
my face,'' she concludes. ``I backed up, my knees hit the back of
the couch and I flipped upside down. The dailies were hysterical.
But I got up and ran back into the shot.
 &HT;    ``Ridley had his cameras trained on what he wanted, and that was
it. We did it once.''
 &HT;    Actually, it was almost someone else on that table. Hurt had
been Scott's first choice to play Kane, but the British actor had
already committed to another film about to be shot in South Africa.
 &HT;    At the last minute, however, he learned that he wouldn't be
allowed into South Africa, while at the same time hearing that the
actor playing Kane had fallen ill.
 &HT;    ``They'd already started shooting `Alien,''' Hurt recalls.
``Ridley rang me up and said, `Look, can I come around and talk to
you this evening?' He arrived around 10 p.m. and didn't leave until
midnight. He went through exactly what he wanted to do with the
film.
 &HT;    ``In a sense, I suppose he was pitching it to me, because he
really needed an actor for that part,'' Hurt says. ``Everything he
said that night was in the film _ everything.''
 &HT;    Cartwright had a less pleasant casting discovery, however. She
had auditioned for the role of Ripley, which ultimately made Weaver
a star. When she was called to make the film, she assumed she'd won
the part.
 &HT;    ``Originally I thought I had Ripley, as did my agent,'' she
recalls. ``I'd not even read the script from the point of view of
Lambert.
 &HT;    ``When they called to set up the wardrobe fittings, I was over
in England. They told me I'd be going in to try on costumes for
Lambert and I said, `Oh, no, there's a mistake. I think I'm
supposed to be Ripley.'''
 &HT;    Instead of having a tantrum, Cartwright threw herself into her
new role.
 &HT;    ``I reread it from her point of view,'' she says. ``I didn't
want her to be this whiny person. If you're a trucker in space,
you've obviously had a lot of experience.''
 &HT;    Lambert became the film's voice of practicality.
 &HT;    ``She wants to get the f--k off that ship,'' Cartwright says.
``She wants to use that capsule and she says, `Listen, a--holes,
let's get going!'
 &HT;    ``Always in those movies you go, `Oh, please, don't go back in
there! How stupid _ you're going to get it,''' she says. ``The
audience is saying, `Just get out of there!'
 &HT;    ``So that's what I did.''
 &HT;    Scott didn't tell Cartwright why she ended up playing Lambert.
 &HT;    ``He never said anything,'' she says. ``It was just a
miscommunication or something. I have no idea.''
 &HT;    Crucial to the film's success was its innovative design, as
conceived by H.R. Giger. The look of its much-imitated, buglike
monsters may have been the movie's most influential element.
 &HT;    ``I think it is a classic,'' Cartwright says. ``Every movie you
saw after it had an alien and it looked like our alien. Even
Godzilla looked like our alien.
 &HT;    ``All of these movies seem to have some part of `Alien' in
them,'' she says. ``Obviously, what Ridley created was horrifying.
 &HT;    ``It's pretty amazing, isn't it?''

R.E.M-PHATIC: ROCK'S QUIRKIEST BAND REINVENTS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of the three members of R.E.M.: Michael
Stipe, Mike Mills and Peter Buck.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Hi. We're R.E.M., and we're glad to be here,'' Michael Stipe
told the crowd at a San Francisco benefit concert last fall.
 &HT;    He might have added that R.E.M. was glad to be, period.
 &HT;    Prior to releasing its latest album, ``Up'' _ which the Athens,
Ga.-based group is promoting with a summer-long world tour that
kicked off on June 17 in Lisbon, Portugal _ R.E.M. wasn't sure it
would play again or release any more music.
 &HT;    After having redefined what was considered ``modern'' and
``alternative'' rock since 1983, the members of R.E.M. were afraid
it might be time to put their group to sleep.
 &HT;    Winding down a band that had sold millions of records might seem
extreme, but not to R.E.M. _ not after the 1997 retirement of Bill
Berry, the first personnel change in the band's history. The
drummer had suffered a near-fatal double brain aneurysm early in
the group's 1995 world tour, and though he fully recovered and
spent the rest of the year on the road, he found he no longer had
the enthusiasm for the rock 'n' roll lifestyle that he once had
felt.
 &HT;    His bandmates understood and respected his decision, but that
didn't make his leaving any easier for them to deal with.
 &HT;    ``Bill leaving R.E.M. is different from a drummer leaving a
regular band,'' Stipe explains. ``Each member had so much to do
with the music that we made and how we presented ourselves in
everything. It was a real blow.''
 &HT;    Berry's announcement didn't come out of the blue, however.
 &HT;    ``He told me that `I can't see doing this a whole lot longer,
probably three more records,''' guitarist Peter Buck recalls.
``That was two weeks before he quit.''
 &HT;    ``I knew he wasn't happy,'' bassist/keyboardist Mike Mills adds.
``We all knew he wasn't happy, but I knew that he was really
unhappy and wanting to get out. I didn't know when he would do it
or if he would do it, but to Peter and Michael it was a big
shock.''
 &HT;    In other words, it was the end of the world as they knew it. But
these days R.E.M. feels fine.
 &HT;    That's because the remaining trio is justifiably psyched about
``Up.'' Despite its disappointing sales, the record is a brave
departure, different from anything the group has ever released _
not to mention a daring way to start what's reported to be an $80
million new contract with Warner Bros. Records.
 &HT;    As it turns out, R.E.M. used Berry's departure as the occasion
for a radical rethinking of the way it makes music. Many of the
group's trademarks _ particularly Buck's stinging guitar _ are
gone, displaced by a lusher kind of ambience. Keyboards and strings
dominate the arrangements, with rhythm machines or drums played by
Buck and Mills providing color and texture rather than propulsion.
 &HT;    The musicians themselves changed their roles as much as they
changed the music. Mills relinquished his bass duties to Buck, for
instance, and the group employed instruments such as vibraphone and
tubular bells. Stipe even took a guitar solo on the song ``Why Not
Smile'' _ though he later explains that ``I drank way too much wine
that night.''
 &HT;    ``Having kind of brazenly decided we'd continue, we kind of had
two options,'' Stipe explains.
 &HT;    One was to hire a journeyman drummer _ ``a fake Bill Berry,''
Stipe says _ to carry on as usual. The other choice was simply to
accept and adapt to the circumstances.
 &HT;    ``It was really liberating to have things shook up that much,''
he says. ``We took every process and every way that we've ever had
of recording and just chucked it out the window and started with a
completely blank slate _ the sky's the limit, we can do anything,
we can go anywhere with this. Let's embrace it.
 &HT;    ``And we did _ not to say that it was easy or fun, because it
wasn't.''
 &HT;    All three members acknowledge that the making of ``Up'' was
turbulent.
 &HT;    ``It shook up enough stuff that it made us have to re-examine
everything,'' Buck says. ``Like how we work together, how we write
songs.''
 &HT;    Stipe even expected the group to break up while making the
album, he says.
 &HT;    But Buck believes that their exercise in drastic change actually
strengthened the band more than it weakened it.
 &HT;    ``We're extremely stubborn people,'' he explains. ``We just did
it. We didn't talk about it, like `Is this difficult? Is this hard?
Is this the right thing to do?' We ended up finishing the record
under a lot of stress, then sat down and talked about the
experiences.
 &HT;    ``Having done all that, we just realized we made a great
record,'' he concludes. ``And that we're still good friends. We
kind of walked through fire on this one.''
 &HT;    R.E.M.'s decision to tour is a testimony to that realization.
When the album was initially released, the group announced that it
was going to forgo a tour. The subtle material on ``Up'' seemed so
different that it wouldn't necessarily fit comfortably next to the
group's older material, they said.
 &HT;    But a series of promotional dates in the United States and
Europe, with three sidemen fleshing out the group's sound, helped
to change their minds.
 &HT;    And there's no denying that ``Up,'' which despite its name did a
quick slide down the charts after its release, could use the
additional push.
 &HT;    But while Stipe, Buck and Mills admit to being disappointed by
the album's weak sales, all three claim to be unfazed. The truth
is, they say, that change is sometimes harder for the audience than
it is for the performer, and ``Up'' is most definitely a radical
change from what their fans had been used to.
 &HT;    ``I feel like this is the first album of the new band,'' Buck
says. ``We're pretty much called R.E.M. because that's who signed
the contract. The three of us are a different band now.
 &HT;    ``Inventing something and compromising something is not as
easy,'' he says. ``But we've done this for a million years, and we
think we know what we're doing.''

 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, ``Felicity'' was being hailed by critics as
1998/99's only can't-miss new show _ and also suffering the
customary bashing that comes with front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had an opinion about ``Felicity,'' including plenty of
people who'd never seen a second of it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the WB drama about a pert California teen (Keri
Russell) who moves to New York to attend college _ and pursue her
handsome high-school classmate, Ben (Scott Speedman) _ has
established itself as a solid hit, not to mention making stars of
Russell, Speedman and Scott Foley, who plays the third leg of their
triangle, the thoroughly decent Noel.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Felicity,'' Russell's biggest credit was a gig on ``The
New Mickey Mouse Club.'' Speedman had virtually no acting
experience, having been cast purely on the basis of a killer
audition tape.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Russell says, getting used to the show has been much
like the adjustments their characters have gone through as
first-year college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a parallel there,'' she says. ``None of us
knew what to expect when this all started. This show was a lot
different from anything I had ever worked on before, and it took
some adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when I first signed onto the show, I was so
excited, but I was also so scared,'' she recalls. ``It was
completely overwhelming. Now I feel like I know what's going on,
and I know how to handle all the publicity and craziness. I have a
better sense of awareness, and I know how to pace myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman says he never felt overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept telling me what a crazy year it was going to
be,'' he says, ``but it wasn't. I mean, it was crazy at times, but
that was mostly because of the workload and long hours. It was
pretty weird, but not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, Russell naturally got a more
concentrated version of the hype. She's become used to seeing her
character dissected as a role model _ and faring better than such
past victims as Murphy Brown or Ally McBeal _ and says she's been
delighted by the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tons of letters,'' she says, ``and everyone is just
completely cool. It's the same thing with the way people respond in
public _ they're pretty laid back: They don't come up screaming,
`There's Felicity!' They usually just come up and say, `We think
your show is so cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to be a little calmer, I guess, compared to fans
of other shows,'' she adds. ``But those are the type of people the
show attracts. Our viewers are really intelligent. They're not
screaming, unless it's a pack of 12-year-old boys or something.
They always have positive things to say about the show, so for the
most part it's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman adds that the difference is more noticeable when they
get away from Los Angeles, which he says prides itself on letting
celebrities alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many actors down there, they can't tell one from
the next,'' he says. ``It's when you go to a small town that it
gets kind of strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans seem to be really polite,'' he says. ``They're not
overwhelming. We've got a small, really hardcore audience. Those
people who've come up to me are just really polite.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the fans do get excited about, however, is Felicity's
vacillating between her longstanding crush on the often-arrogant
Ben and her new interest in the lower-key Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the neighborhood I live in, there's an all-girl school,''
Russell says. ``I would be riding my bike to the post office or
whatever, and these girls would always come up to me and ask who I
liked better, Ben or Noel. Then they would chant, `Noel! Noel!
You've got to choose Noel!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the occasional few of them liked Ben,'' she says with a
joking sneer at Speedman. ``But I really liked the idea that girls
like Noel best, because he's definitely more of a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period for about a month last season where Ben
just got hit with one thing after another,'' Speedman says
defensively. ``He had a gambling problem, and so on. There was no
good news for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the writers make Noel a really pleasant guy, so there's
not much comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The series began as a star turn for Russell, but seems to be
evolving into an ensemble show _ a development which she says suits
her just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea that we've become an ensemble cast,'' the
actress says. ``And it did make things a bit easier on me. I'm
still working a lot, but it's a lot easier than those first few
episodes, when I was in almost every scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also some really talented people in our cast,''
Speedman adds. ``They deserve their chance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' fans rave about the show's music, which offers a
much wider range than most teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love the music on our show,'' Russell says,
beaming. ``Our music supervisor, Amanda Demme, is fabulous. Look at
our soundtrack album that was just released _ it has people like
Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just teenybopper little songs,'' she says. ``It's the
same kind of music that I like listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   The series seems likely to continue indefinitely, but Speedman
doubts that it will rack up anything like the nine-year run of
``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all, like, 40 years old now,'' he groans. ``That show
is like a factory, just pushing out product. I'd leave the show if
we ever got like that _ which isn't likely to happen. Our show is
so different. We have great writers, and the quality control is
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as much as either is willing to say about the future.
Nothing closer-range _ such as how they'll resolve last season's
teaser ending, which left Felicity torn between going to Europe
with Noel or driving home to California with Ben.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know what happens,'' Russell says, laughing.
``So many people have been asking me that question. And they're
just writing the new season right now, so it's still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of know what's going to happen,'' she says teasingly,
``but I have to keep quiet.''

 &HT;    Good advice comes from small book
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In an attempt to be all things to all
readers, I've taken to giving advice on everything from table
etiquette to curing bunions. Since I am dismally unqualified to
advise on anything, I have found another source for this timeless
information I offer so freely. It is a tattered little tome titled,
The Standard Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge. It was published by
F.M. Lupton, New York, in 1896. I found it in a box of stuff nobody
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column I promised a cure for the common cold, and
being a woman of my word, here it is: ``A cold in the head can be
cured at once if taken care of at the very beginning. Dissolve a
tablespoonful of borax in a pint of hot water; let it stand until
it becomes tepid; snuff some up the nostrils two or three times
during the day, or use the dry, powdered borax like snuff, taking a
pinch as often as required. At night have a handkerchief saturated
with spirits of camphor, place it near the nostrils so as to inhale
the fumes while sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   For folks who'd rather swallow than snuff: ``Put five cents'
worth of pine pitch into a pint of water. Let it simmer until the
water is well impregnated with the flavor. Dip out the gum which
remains undissolved and add honey enough to sweeten and make a
thick syrup. Strain this and bottle. Dose, a teaspoonful four or
five times a day, according to the severity of the cough. It will
afford speedy relief.''
</P>
<P>
   A paragraph in the Home Physician section of this handy little
book explains, ``How People Get Sick'' and offers suggestions for
preventing a variety of illnesses. ``Eating too much and too fast;
swallowing imperfectly masticated food; using too much fluid at
meals; drinking poisonous whiskey and other intoxicating drinks;
repeatedly using poison as medicines; keeping late hours at night
and sleeping late in the morning; wearing clothing too tight;
wearing thin shoes; neglecting to wash the body sufficiently to
keep the pores open; exchanging the warm clothes worn in a warm
room during the day for costumes
</P>
<P>
   and exposure incident to evening parties; compressing the
stomach to gratify a vain and foolish passion for dress; keeping up
constant excitement; fretting the mind with borrowed troubles;
swallowing quack nostrums for every imaginary ill; taking meals at
irregular intervals, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow! It's a wonder any of us have survived.
</P>
<P>
   There's another section called: ``What an Old Housekeeper Has
Learned.'' I love it! It suggests that: ``People who chew plenty of
good beef and eschew pork are sensible.'' There's also a reminder
that ``If we wish to prolong our lives we should always put one day
between washing and ironing.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone bills have you down? Try the Cyclopaedia's alternative
to Ma Bell: ``To make a cheap telephone, take a wooden tooth-powder
box and make a hole of about the size of a half crown in the lid
and the bottom. Take a disk of tinned iron, such as can be had from
a preserved meat tin, and place it on the outside of the bottom of
the box, and fix the cover on the other side of it. Then take a
small bar-magnet, place on one end a small cotton or silk reel, and
round the reel wind some iron wire, leaving the ends loose. Fix one
end of the magnet near, as near as possible without touching, to
the disk, and then one part of the telephone is complete. A similar
arrangement is needed for the other end. With this one can converse
at a distance of about one hundred yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a heck of a lot has changed in the last one hundred
years, one bit of advice offered under the heading: ``Dangers of
Childhood'' seems timeless: ``Childhood is the period during which
the foundations are laid. It is characterized by almost absolute
dependence on the parents, and therefore the responsibility rests
upon them whether the foundations of the superstructure shall be
good or bad, and indeed whether there shall be any superstructure
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclopaedia's cover is worn, its pages brown and brittle,
but its advice nonetheless valid.

 &HT;    Ruling key to Coke trial
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In filings last week, lawyers for the plaintiffs in
the discrimination case against Coca-Cola zeroed in on their
objective to prove that the company's personnel system works
against black employees.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hanging in the air is an argument over
procedure, whether the plaintiffs brought their complaint in the
right way. There's the assertion by the company that because the
complaint may be framed incorrectly, the judge should, in effect,
drop the case as a class action.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts expect that in the next month Judge Richard Story,
the expeditious federal judge hearing the case, may make a
definitive decision about whether to move forward at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Before that occurs, he could ask for more written arguments, or
he could announce oral agruments, when lawyers from both sides
appear before him to debate whether the case should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in its motion to dismiss the complaint as a class
action, emphasized that the four plaintiffs differed in ways that
did not add up to a class problem. But lawyers for the four _
Motisola Malikha Abdallah, Gregory Allen Clark, Linda Ingram and
Kimberly Gray Orton _ argued that their information shows a
discriminatory pattern that is generally unfair to
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In its papers opposing the Coca-Cola motion to dismiss the class
allegations, plaintiffs' attorneys said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs have brought this action to remedy specific
policies and practices of the Coca-Cola Co. that discriminate
against an entire class of employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs are challenging companywide policies and practices,
including specific aspects of Coca-Cola's performance evaluation
system, job grade system, compensation system and promotion
system.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters and e-mail messages to me, I have heard many
African-Americans, claiming to be Coca-Cola workers or retirees,
say they think they detected unfairness in certain company
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   I also have received letters from people claiming to be white
Coca-Cola employees insisting that they think black employees get
preference, not discriminatory treatment.
</P>
<P>
   However, in papers filed last week, lawyers for the plaintiffs
insisted that all personnel policies, ranging from performance
standards to job posting to pay patterns, are controlled by the
North Avenue headquarters and have resulted in several negative
results, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   1. A compensation system that permits undue discretion (by
managers) and is based on discriminatory evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   2. A pattern and practice of placing African-Americans in lower
pay grades than ``similarly situated white employees.''
</P>
<P>
   3. A promotion system ``that denies African-American employees
the opportunity for fair and open competition.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Failure to monitor training, compensation patterns and
promotion decisions to detect discriminatory patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the plaintiffs' contentions last week was that the
court cannot really examine these alleged discriminatory patterns
unless the court orders Coca-Cola to open the books or databases
and permit interviews of decision makers.
</P>
<P>
   In a first step in that direction, the court set up a schedule
for examining the company's materials and conducting the
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unresolved now is the procedural dispute that must be
resolved before the court plunges fully into the examination of
Coca-Cola's personnel policies toward African-Americans.

 &HT;    Commentary: It's all part of the job
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Halleluiah! We have another wage earner in the
household.
</P>
<P>
   It's been hard for our teen-age sons to grasp that ``earning''
an allowance from us for doing chores doesn't help the family's
economic bottom line. Nor does it keep the gas tanks of their cars
full.
</P>
<P>
   But, praise be, we now have a second somewhat-employed son
bringing in minimum wage. We are grateful, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   First jobs always bring on a slew of memories. What is it about
that unsuspecting teen-age worker that brings out the prankster in
some people?
</P>
<P>
   My husband worked construction one summer during high school and
remembers well his first day at a big hospital construction site. A
burly ironworker told him to run across the site to the supply
truck to get him a spool of ``left-handed tie wire,'' explaining
that he was a southpaw and wore it on the left side of his
workbelt.
</P>
<P>
   When my husband got to the truck and asked for the item, the
supervisor laughed. ``There's no such thing as left-handed tie
wire, son. Tie wire is tie wire. Someone's having some fun with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, he walked back across the construction site and
handed over the spool of tie wire to the guffawing ironworker. Such
episodes nurture the desire in most of us to be self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   My husband's next job wasn't any more encouraging. On the first
day of summer vacation, he went to work at a deli in a small
shopping center. That very afternoon a huge tornado ripped through
town, flattening a retail area just a few blocks away. He tried to
convince his parents it was God's sign that he didn't want him to
work that summer, but I think they surmised that was a bunch of
bologna _ and hold the mustard.
</P>
<P>
   My dad had a similarly bad first work experience. He was a farm
boy, so he mostly worked at home. When he was 16, though, his dad
let him get a part-time job at the town grocery. He worked for 18
cents an hour and thought he'd hit the big time. His first day on
the job, fresh off the farm, he showed up ready to make his
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor walked into the store, spotted my dad and quickly
apprised the situation. He asked him for some ``red bluing.'' If
you don't know, bluing is a rinse that folks used to put in their
wash to keep white clothes from yellowing. Eager to please, dad
scampered up and down the aisles searching for red bluing.
Exasperated, he finally had to ask the boss where it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son,'' the boss said slowly, ``why do you think they call it
bluing? Because it's blue. There's no such thing as `red' bluing.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor chuckled over that one at church and PTA
gatherings, much to my father's chagrin, for years to come. Dad
soon decided farming was a good future.
</P>
<P>
   My first job as a teen-ager was baby-sitting for a neighbor boy
out in the country. The parents went merrily off, leaving me to
tend to their 6-year-old. All went well until it was time for him
to go to bed. Upstairs at the door to his bedroom, I encountered a
ferocious terrier that absolutely refused to let me enter the room.
The boy crawled into bed, but I had to stand outside the door, the
terrier growling and snapping at my feet. I spent the rest of the
evening praying the kid wouldn't get sick or the house catch fire.
It was the only time I ever baby-sat.
</P>
<P>
   So far, things have gone better for our newly employed son,
although his boss did walk out one day after he messed up a phone
order and told him, ``Turn in your cap and your nametag. You're
fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, he was reaching for his nametag when the manager smiled
and said, ``Just kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the real world, son.

   DeLorme enhances its map offerings
</P>
<P>
   DeLorme is releasing an updated, enhanced version of its digital
topographical maps.
</P>
<P>
   The new features on the CD-ROM maps include contours every 20
feet, a 3-D engine, more than 300,000 miles of trails and new
drawing tools that let users customize maps. The disc also lets you

<P>
   The disc including maps of the United States retails for an
estimated $99. Six regional maps sell for $49.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   The company started in 1976 when David DeLorme created the Maine
Atlas and Gazetteer. The company now makes an atlas for each state.
The mapping software was developed in the early 1980s. The first
consumer software map was released in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorme Topo USA 2.0 requires at least Microsoft Windows 95, a
Pentium 120 or higher processor, 16 megabytes of RAM, 30 megabytes
of hard disk space, a CD-ROM drive, a 16-bit color monitor with
Super VGA graphics and a mouse.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Broderbund released an updated version of its genealogy
software, the Family Tree Maker Deluxe 15-CD set.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a different type of family tree, one that includes
everyone entered into the family file, not just blood relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The version has census and marriage records, immigration and
passenger lists and military records. Users can search by first and
last names, varied spelling of names, married and maiden names,
nicknames, relatives, dates and locations.

 &HT;    World Book on DVD fails to forge proper links
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM's venture into the world of DVD, the 1999 World
Book Family Reference Suite, is a pretty good tool hampered by
exceptionally poor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply expanding upon the entries contained in the
paper version of the World Book Encyclopedia, IBM opted to fill out
the vast space afforded by DVD-ROM with the Merriam-Webster
Dictionary and the latest Information Please almanac.
</P>
<P>
   This was a pretty good decision _ especially for kids struggling
with homework. The Merriam-Webster dictionary is always active, and
one need only double-click on any word in an article in the
encyclopedia to get a complete explanation of it.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of multimedia, including especially good movie
clips in fairly large format. Strangely, every last one of them
seems to be silent. There are lots of sounds, just not moving
picture sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Musical illustrations for the great composers are adequate in
number, although disappointingly brief. They are, however,
presented by the appropriate instruments rather than a synthesizer
or MIDI translation.
</P>
<P>
   I checked my usual out-of-the-way articles and found them
accurate, if not very enlightening. Longer, more mainstream
entries, such as that for Australia, are quite adequate for most
purposes, including homework, and well-written.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a brief separate entry under didgeridoo,
explaining that it is a musical instrument of the Australian
Aborigines. This is good, because only a few electronic
dictionaries include it. I was disappointed not to find a musical
example linked to it, which leads to my chief complaint about World
Book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever branch of the publisher charged with organizing the
material and providing cross-links appears to have been permanently
out to lunch. There is, in fact, a musical example of the
didgeridoo. You can find it in the general article on Australia. I
can think of no reason why it wasn't also included with the brief
article on the instrument itself.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing abounds. The article on flamenco offers no
examples. Yet the article on Spain, under arts, provides two aural
examples, portions of a fandango de Huelva and tientos. The former
is listed as a ``traditional fandango'' (it is not) and the latter
as a ``traditional dance.'' I supposed that whoever put together
the section simply didn't know much about it, but this sort of
thing is far too endemic throughout the book to be accounted for
that way.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you ask for information on the Second Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, World Book provides the text of it and a
discussion of the controversy surrounding it. If, however, you ask
for the Fourth Amendment, all you get is an article on wiretapping
which mentions the amendment in passing without giving its text.
</P>
<P>
   All the articles are signed, which is good. Some are written by
big-time experts in the field at issue; most are relatively
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, navigation is simple, although if you have
been browsing through articles and decide you want to look at a
list of videos on the disc, you're going to find you can't get
there from here. At least I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go through the ordeal of ``teaching'' the
software how you speak, or if you have difficulty typing, you can
even navigate with IBM's ViaVoice technology and a provided
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The search list hides the icon that indicates what multimedia
items, if any, are associated with an article. You wouldn't even
know it's there unless you look.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``wizards'' to help with things like Web pages and
homework, and a timeline feature which most users will find next to
useless because of its lack of organization. There is the
obligatory online link, but in this case obligatory is quite apt.
Unlike Microsoft Encarta, for instance, relatively few articles are
linked to Internet information, even when a wealth of it is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Information Please is a useful almanac for lists and records and
so forth, as well as 1998 events.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like about World Book. The pity is that if it
had been given the kind of organizational attention that every
other electronic encyclopedia has, it would be outstanding.

 &HT;    Elementary etiquette enhances e-mail enjoyment
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I go in spells _ in starts and stops like a balky 1974
Toyota _ when it comes to e-mail. It's one of those things that
seem to grow until, next thing you know, I spend most of my
evenings answering mail. Then I sort of shut down shop and decide
to move more of my life into the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when I do that, I discover all of a sudden that I
don't have a real life. Like a lot of people, I spend way too much
time at work, sometimes coming in before 8 o'clock and leaving
around that time in the evening. Once you factor in feeding the cat
and myself, that doesn't leave much time. So I start up that 1974
Toyota again and resume old conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these conversations span an enormous chunk of time _ my
longest-lived e-mail conversation goes back to 1993. So I think of
myself as a real expert on the important side of e-mail. You'll
read a lot, including from me at times, about security and
passwords and the mechanics of setting up an e-mail program. But
for today, we'll talk about some really basic tips that will make
e-mail more fun and that will increase the likelihood of a long and
interesting conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Husted's first rule of e-mail is that you must assume your
correspondent may have literally dozens of conversations going at
once by e-mail. Now that it is become part of daily life, most of
us get e-mail _ at home and work _ that is a mixture of personal
and business correspondence. When answering an e-mail, don't assume
the recipient remembers what he asked you several days before.
Include a snippet from the question, to avoid confusion. Otherwise,
like me, he may have to puzzle over the meaning of e-mails that
say: ``Yes, go right ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Along that same line of reasoning, you must assume your
correspondent has some sort of a life outside e-mail. Don't get
overly concerned if your mail remains unanswered for days, or if
you get a short and to-the-point reply. There's nothing worse than
turning a pleasant e-mail conversation into a guilt trip, in which
the recipient feels as if he has to answer quickly and at length.
When you are using e-mail as a modern substitute for having a pen
pal, the whole notion is to keep things fun.
</P>
<P>
   One really horrible trend, at least for me, is that folks
nowadays tend to attach two or three photographs or even a small
computer program. It's not that I don't like to see photos; it's
that they can take forever to download. At times I have gone home
for the evening, turned on the computer to check my e-mail and sat
for a long time watching photos and other attachments download.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second reason many of us don't like getting
unsolicited attachments: They can contain programs or even Word
documents with viruses. So don't stop sending photos and
attachments _ simply ask first if your recipient would like to
receive them. If I know I have photos or other data-heavy stuff
coming, I tell the sender when to send it and pick a time that is
convenient for me.
</P>
<P>
   But my real pet peeve comes from the well-meaning folks who
forward messages about viruses (there are more virus hoaxes than
viruses) or some other weird Internet scheme. Avoid forwarding
messages that Bill Gates will give the next 100 people who e-mail
him a million dollars or that a foundation in Des Moines is
collecting cigarette wrappers to buy an iron lung for some
deserving kid.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on the assurances of the sender that a friend told
him it was true. Just don't send it. Also, please don't simply
forward a joke you've found unless you know for a fact that your
friend loves to receive them. If you don't have anything to say at
all, try something really unusual these days: Just be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what I'm going to do right now.

 &HT;    Golfers can easily swing to advice, news sites
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most effective way to learn humility is to play
golf. In an average round, whether you've just taken up the game or
once played on the pro circuit, you will do several incredibly
stupid things that would make your own mother question your IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Several other times, you will strike the ball in such a way as
to convince the casual onlooker that not only have you never before
held a golf club but that you should not be allowed to hold one
again.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers will turn almost anywhere for help. In the course of a
playing career, most will spend time taking lessons from a pro,
buying weird gadgets that add to the humiliation of golf when worn,
reading books that contradict each other proudly, and nowadays
turning to the gods of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are some terrific sites that offer golf information _ as
long as you make your visits with the solid realization the advice
there is no different than you'd find from conventional sources.
You can get the same useless tips you'd hear from the books and
video courses. But you'll get them free.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there's more to most commercial golf sites than
instruction. Let's drop in on one of the really good ones, Golf Web
at www.golfweb.com/. The opening page heavily emphasizes golf news.
You'll be able to click on any of the news summaries and be taken
to the full story. You'll also find links that take you to areas
where you can have live chats with other golfers and to leave
messages asking for advice (none of which will help, some of which
will hurt).
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature of this page is the classifieds section. You
can buy golf clubs and other used gear or sell your equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The next site on our cyber-tour is called Golfonline at www
</P>
<P>
   .golfonline.com/. At first glance, it offers the same sort of
information as the first site. The two even look a little alike.
But one of this site's pluses is that it is run by the folks who
publish Golf magazine. So you can look forward to good writing and
also a real feeling of golfing expertise. One fun feature is the
weekly survey. You can give your opinion and also read what others
think. When I last visited, users were surveyed on the most hated
rules of golf.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other general purpose golf sites and _
frankly _ there doesn't seem to be a dime's worth of difference in
the look, features and appearance of them. You could try 19thHole
</P>
<P>
   .Com at www.19thHole.com/ or About.Com's About Golf site at
golf.about.com/. These are all good sites; there's just not much
difference in what you'll find. So pick your favorite.
</P>
<P>
   One of the real benefits the Web offers a golfer is a way to
check out a new golf course. Most of the Web sites mentioned offer
this service in one form or another. But some courses are too small
to be featured on these compilations.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, you'll find a listing of many courses at
www.netcaddie
</P>
<P>
   .com/ga/georgia.htm. If you live in another state, go to
www.netcaddie
</P>
<P>
   .com and select your state from the list. If you still can't
find a course, you can use one of the regular search engines such
as AltaVista at www.altavista.com and do the searching on your own.
Most state and private courses have some sort of a presence on the
Web, so there's a good chance you'll find the information you need
about course fees, layout and telephone numbers to make tee times.

 &HT;    `Official site' too often means `corporately dull'
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's talk about the Backstreet Boys and the Web.
According to a study released by the Web measurement gurus at Media
Metrix, visitors to the Backstreet Boys' official Web site at www
</P>
<P>
   .backstreetboys.com are 86.9 percent kids. Based on no
scientific knowledge whatsoever, I would venture to guess that this
86.9 percent is probably preteen, teen-age and twentysomething
female fans looking for the latest official news and gossip about
these very cool and very cute pop sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a former teen-age girl, I have to say the Backstreet
Boys' official site isn't really all that good, and this probably
has nothing to do with the guys themselves. The fault is with the
designers, the record company and everybody who had input into the
official site.
</P>
<P>
   An official Web site for anything, whether it's the new ``Star
Wars'' movie or a NASA mission, is usually the first place people
go to when searching for something. The innocent assumption is that
an official site will be the place where fans can get the real
inside news, look at the best photos, listen to officially
sanctioned clips and, in this case, have generally a really great
time staring at pictures of cute guys and listening to their cool
songs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the folks who run the Backstreet Boys' Web site clearly
have never met any teen-age girls. For one thing, the home page
plugs the guys' latest CD, ``Millennium.'' You don't have to have a
Ph.D. to figure out that most of the girls hitting the site already
own the CD and are looking for more detailed and personal
information, maybe some pictures. Really big, really cute pictures.
Or how about interviews with the band, or something that would take
advantage of the site's official status to show fans pictures they
haven't seen and tell them things they might not otherwise know?
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Irish alternative band, The Cranberries, used
its official site as the exclusive place to buy concert tickets
online. That's pretty cool. No boring Ticketmaster sites for
Cranberries fans; they get to check out a fan page when ordering
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody expects the Backstreet Boys to post their home
phone numbers on the Web site, and the server would probably crash
if they even thought about offering tickets on their site. Still,
it would be nice if sites like this one, which clearly know who
their audience is, would do a better job of giving fans what they
want. The Backstreet Boys, Brittany Spears, Ricky Martin and other
pop idols ought to have figured out by now that official Web sites
are to the Internet what music videos are to MTV _ an incredible
promotional vehicle if used right.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys' official site has chintzy pictures (too
small, too hard to see and not labeled, so you can't even tell
where the guys are performing). Hard copy teen magazines do an
incredible job of describing every move, every twitch and every
last harmless detail of teen stars and celebrities, and they sell a
lot of magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys don't need to reinvent the wheel, they just
need to understand what their fans want to see. Alison's Backstreet
Boys Wonderland (www
</P>
<P>
   .geocities.com/SunsetStrip
</P>
<P>
   /Backstage/1823), a site built by a loyal fan, is a far better
site. Organized Yahoo!-style by various topics, including
biographies, song lyrics, the latest news and, best of all, really
big pictures, it has a ``gee aren't these guys cool'' tone that
really captures how much fun it is to read about your favorite
stars and stare at their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What can be learned from a very brief tour of Backstreet Boys
Web sites is that the official site isn't always the best site.
When it comes to entertainment on the Web, sometimes fans can do a
better job of giving other fans what they want than the corporate
entities often responsible for the ``official'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, there was a woman named Bonnie, I think, who
was a huge fan of MTV's ``The Real World.'' For the uninitiated,
``The Real World'' is a popular series that throws seven strangers
into a very snazzy, trendy house in a trendy city, turns on the
cameras and lets the roommates go at each other. Bonnie's site had
cast photos, weekly plot summaries, ``where are they now''
information, bits of gossip almost always verified before they were
posted and an archive of past seasons. For ``Real World'' fans, it
was a wonderful site. However, as the years wore on, Bonnie's
interest in the show waned, and she decided not to keep up with
``The Real World'' any more.
</P>
<P>
   MTV decided to pick up the slack and offers a ``Real World''
area on its Web site that looks a bit like Bonnie's but is much
more corporate. The focus is less on the fun and more on promoting
the show so more people will watch it. That's where fan sites are
far superior to official sites in many cases. They don't have to be
told that TV shows, movies and rock stars are entertainment with a
focus on fun.
</P>
<P>
   If a user comes to a Web site called Backstreet Boys.com or
StarWars.com, they are clearly looking for fun. Publicity is nice,
but people will turn up at the concert, the movie theater, the
record shop and the toy store if the corporate types who build
official Web sites could remember that entertainment is meant to be
just that_ entertaining.

 &HT;    Computer adventure: Wiring a home network
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When's the last time you found yourself installing
computer hardware with a drill?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was using a 3/4-inch router bit, which does a great
deal more damage than a normal drill bit. Of course, I wasn't doing
anything inside my computer. Instead, I was standing in the frame
structure of my soon-to-be house with several boxes of Cat 5 cable
preparing to wire an ethernet network in the walls. I had done my
homework.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with one of the LAN pros at the AJC, who assured me
there was nothing to worry about as long as I kept my cables 6
inches away from the electrical wiring and didn't have any cable
runs longer than 300 feet. I also conferred with my father-in-law,
Bill, who sells telephone systems. He cautioned me not to make any
sharp turns, angles or bends in the wire as I laid it out through
the house, and he suggested following the phone lines as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I chatted up the brother-and-sister team that was wiring almost
everything else in my house _ phones, alarm system, electricity,
cable TV, thermostats _ and I picked up a few pointers while
watching their technique. To be in the proper frame of mind, I had
even gone back into the Wired magazine archives online and dug up
Neal Stephenson's mesmerizing 56-page epic about the world history
of wire and the huge backbone cables lying across ocean floors that
make the Internet possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, nobody told me to bring a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not Bob Vila.
</P>
<P>
   There are many good reasons _ among them the ability to share
files and programs, hard drive space, printers and Internet access
_ for using a network inside your home.
</P>
<P>
   My motives were a little more pedestrian: I initially decided to
put the network in so I wouldn't have to put cable modems, at $40 a
month each, on three computers.
</P>
<P>
   As I did my research, other benefits became obvious. With a
network, I wouldn't have to put a bunch of new hardware into the
old 486/SX2 that my daughter got from her grandparents _ she could
just use devices across the network. (Of course, using the CD-ROM
would mean she'd have to run between rooms to pop discs in and out
of the drive. But she's young and full of energy.)
</P>
<P>
   So _ with my ladder _ I was physically and mentally ready.
</P>
<P>
   While re-reading Stephenson's excellent article, my own wire
adventure began to take on a more profound and meaningful purpose,
like it was a metaphor for the infrastructure of life. But, after
sweating it out for a couple of hours in 90-degree heat, crawling
among the rafters, pulling cable, banging my shins and wiping
sawdust out of my eyes, I didn't care if it was the key to the
universe as long as I finished before dark.
</P>
<P>
   The process is really quite simple. In fact, a large part of it
is just mapping the network through your house. I tracked the paths
of my wires beam by beam to each room in the house, which avoided
dozens of nasty little surprises and tricky maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   One good tip: No matter if you are wiring a house frame or an
existing house, start in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Decide where your hub is going to be and work outward. Surfing
some Web sites with how-to pages on network wiring, I found there
are two kinds of networks and two primary network layouts. Either
type of network _ peer-to-peer or client-server _ works for home
networks, but that's a topic for a future column.
</P>
<P>
   A ``backbone'' network layout, a straight line of coaxial cable
with computers coming off the sides, is more suited for businesses
with a lot of terminals. Home networks typically use a ``star''
layout, which has a hub and terminals radiating outward on
telephone-type wires. (Actually, I may have created a third
configuration called the ``Silly String'' layout.)
</P>
<P>
   The cable comes in various categories, based on the data they
can push. Ordinary telephone wire is Cat 2 and has two pairs of
wire inside the cable. Cat 3 cable can also be used for an ethernet
and is capable of up to 10 megabytes, and Cat 5 cable _ which is
four pairs of wire _ is capable of up to 100 megabytes. (The plugs
for my Cat 5 cable ends are basically the same as phone jacks, only
bigger, and will require different wall plates.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the two ethernet speeds aren't interchangeable. And
mixing them requires special switching hubs that are, naturally,
more expensive. But 10 megabytes should be plenty fast for a home
network. Don't forget that cable modem access, the speediest
available, hits only 3 megabytes _ although I've heard from plenty
of cable modem subscribers who say actual and advertised speeds
vary greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the hub near your source of Internet access _ a
telephone jack or cable TV outlet _ should make things easier. I
added an extra cable jack about 6 feet up on the laundry room wall,
after some alert readers sent e-mail about possible moisture and
temperature extremes in the garage, my original location. I'm also
putting in a shelf for the cable modem, the hub and a small
computer to use as a server, if I need it.
</P>
<P>
   I did end up finishing my job before dark. My eight cables came
together in a beautiful thick bunch that follows one of the big
pipes through the upstairs bathroom floor along the ceiling over
the washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday after my wiring job, my wife stopped by the house to
check its progress. A new subcontractor, who was wiring my light
fixtures, asked if we were doing some of our own wiring work. When
she told him I had wired up a computer network, he said, ``Well, he
sure knew what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's profound enough for me.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Screwdriver PC postscript: According to my e-mail _ which was
filled with tales of frustration _ many readers have been victims
of shoddy service from screwdriver PC shops. Surprisingly, almost
every person's problem was with the same outfit. My advice still
stands, no matter which one you buy from: Buyer beware.

   ATLANTA _ This book is for those of you who are both interested
and have the inclination to mess with the inside of your PC. Called
``Upgrading Your PC,'' it offers illustrated guides on how to do
all kinds of things. Among those things are adding a multimedia
card, modem or CD-ROM drive. You can also use this book to upgrade
your PC's microprocessor and add memory. Published by Jamsa Press,
the book retails for $26.95.

   You've heard of the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&AMP;P
500. Now there's Wired magazine's own stock index, a list of 40
so-called new-economy companies. In its June issue, Wired says its
stock market index is up 81 percent in the past 12 months. Its
index includes companies such as Yahoo!, America Online, Microsoft,
Sun Microsystems and Intel.

   If you transfer a lot of files over the Internet, you might want
to look at a new product called CuteFTP. FTP, of course, refers to
the File Transfer Protocol software that enables you to do that.
What CuteFTP offers is a simple, Windows-like format in which to
use FTP to move files. CuteFTP uses drag-and-drop technology,
allows remote access and includes an HTML editor. The creators
claim the software excels at transferring large files between
corporate offices.

   AUS-GREIG Jane Greig's column used for June 8

   By Jane Greig

<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Q: The manager of my apartment complex told us to move
out. He says only two people are allowed in a one bedroom apartment
_ not three people. Our next-door neighbors are four children and
two parents _ six people living there.
</P>
<P>
   Where can I report this problem (the one bedroom apartment with
six people)? _ U.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``A minimum of 70 square feet in a sleeping room is needed
for two people; for each person added to that sleeping room you
need an additional 50 square feet,'' says chief housing inspector
James Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   To report suspected violations of these minimum square footage
requirements, contact the city's inspection services office at
499-2875.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently purchased some petunias and noticed when I arrived
home that they were called ``Laura Bush.'' Could they possibly be
named after the First Lady of Texas? _ Diane Williams
</P>
<P>
   A: No coincidence. The Laura Bush petunia is technically Petunia
x violacea ``Laura Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   This prolific bloomer tolerates heat well (no political pun
intended) and produces purple flowers. During testing, the
temporary name for this offspring of the V.I.P. Petunia (Violet in
Profusion) was Junior (no pun intended No. 2).
</P>
<P>
   Petunias do not like water on their flowers. After a Texas rain,
petunias close up and appear wilted for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm getting the runaround from the city as to whom to talk to
about installing a traffic light at a dangerous intersection _ FM
1325 and Century Park Boulevard. The city says it's the Texas
Department of Transportation's responsibility and, surprise
surprise, the TxDoT says it's the city's job. _ Michelle Wallace
</P>
<P>
   A: The Texas Department of Transportation. Put your request in
writing to have the location studied: TxDoT, Traffic Operations
Office, P.O. Drawer 15426, Austin 78761-5426. This office studies
traffic signal locations in 11 different counties, so it may be a
while before this intersection is examined.

 &HT;    Golfers can easily swing to advice, news sites
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most effective way to learn humility is to play
golf. In an average round, whether you've just taken up the game or
once played on the pro circuit, you will do several incredibly
stupid things that would make your own mother question your IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Several other times, you will strike the ball in such a way as
to convince the casual onlooker that not only have you never before
held a golf club but that you should not be allowed to hold one
again.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers will turn almost anywhere for help. In the course of a
playing career, most will spend time taking lessons from a pro,
buying weird gadgets that add to the humiliation of golf when worn,
reading books that contradict each other proudly, and nowadays
turning to the gods of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are some terrific sites that offer golf information _ as
long as you make your visits with the solid realization the advice
there is no different than you'd find from conventional sources.
You can get the same useless tips you'd hear from the books and
video courses. But you'll get them free.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there's more to most commercial golf sites than
instruction. Let's drop in on one of the really good ones, Golf Web
at www.golfweb.com/. The opening page heavily emphasizes golf news.
You'll be able to click on any of the news summaries and be taken
to the full story. You'll also find links that take you to areas
where you can have live chats with other golfers and to leave
messages asking for advice (none of which will help, some of which
will hurt).
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature of this page is the classifieds section. You
can buy golf clubs and other used gear or sell your equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The next site on our cyber-tour is called Golfonline at www
</P>
<P>
   .golfonline.com/. At first glance, it offers the same sort of
information as the first site. The two even look a little alike.
But one of this site's pluses is that it is run by the folks who
publish Golf magazine. So you can look forward to good writing and
also a real feeling of golfing expertise. One fun feature is the
weekly survey. You can give your opinion and also read what others
think. When I last visited, users were surveyed on the most hated
rules of golf.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other general purpose golf sites and _
frankly _ there doesn't seem to be a dime's worth of difference in
the look, features and appearance of them. You could try 19thHole
</P>
<P>
   .Com at www.19thHole.com/ or About.Com's About Golf site at
golf.about.com/. These are all good sites; there's just not much
difference in what you'll find. So pick your favorite.
</P>
<P>
   One of the real benefits the Web offers a golfer is a way to
check out a new golf course. Most of the Web sites mentioned offer
this service in one form or another. But some courses are too small
to be featured on these compilations.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, you'll find a listing of many courses at
www.netcaddie
</P>
<P>
   .com/ga/georgia.htm. If you live in another state, go to
www.netcaddie
</P>
<P>
   .com and select your state from the list. If you still can't
find a course, you can use one of the regular search engines such
as AltaVista at www.altavista.com and do the searching on your own.
Most state and private courses have some sort of a presence on the
Web, so there's a good chance you'll find the information you need
about course fees, layout and telephone numbers to make tee times.

 &HT;    `Official site' too often means `corporately dull'
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's talk about the Backstreet Boys and the Web.
According to a study released by the Web measurement gurus at Media
Metrix, visitors to the Backstreet Boys' official Web site at www
</P>
<P>
   .backstreetboys.com are 86.9 percent kids. Based on no
scientific knowledge whatsoever, I would venture to guess that this
86.9 percent is probably preteen, teen-age and twentysomething
female fans looking for the latest official news and gossip about
these very cool and very cute pop sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a former teen-age girl, I have to say the Backstreet
Boys' official site isn't really all that good, and this probably
has nothing to do with the guys themselves. The fault is with the
designers, the record company and everybody who had input into the
official site.
</P>
<P>
   An official Web site for anything, whether it's the new ``Star
Wars'' movie or a NASA mission, is usually the first place people
go to when searching for something. The innocent assumption is that
an official site will be the place where fans can get the real
inside news, look at the best photos, listen to officially
sanctioned clips and, in this case, have generally a really great
time staring at pictures of cute guys and listening to their cool
songs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the folks who run the Backstreet Boys' Web site clearly
have never met any teen-age girls. For one thing, the home page
plugs the guys' latest CD, ``Millennium.'' You don't have to have a
Ph.D. to figure out that most of the girls hitting the site already
own the CD and are looking for more detailed and personal
information, maybe some pictures. Really big, really cute pictures.
Or how about interviews with the band, or something that would take
advantage of the site's official status to show fans pictures they
haven't seen and tell them things they might not otherwise know?
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Irish alternative band, The Cranberries, used
its official site as the exclusive place to buy concert tickets
online. That's pretty cool. No boring Ticketmaster sites for
Cranberries fans; they get to check out a fan page when ordering
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody expects the Backstreet Boys to post their home
phone numbers on the Web site, and the server would probably crash
if they even thought about offering tickets on their site. Still,
it would be nice if sites like this one, which clearly know who
their audience is, would do a better job of giving fans what they
want. The Backstreet Boys, Brittany Spears, Ricky Martin and other
pop idols ought to have figured out by now that official Web sites
are to the Internet what music videos are to MTV _ an incredible
promotional vehicle if used right.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys' official site has chintzy pictures (too
small, too hard to see and not labeled, so you can't even tell
where the guys are performing). Hard copy teen magazines do an
incredible job of describing every move, every twitch and every
last harmless detail of teen stars and celebrities, and they sell a
lot of magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys don't need to reinvent the wheel, they just
need to understand what their fans want to see. Alison's Backstreet
Boys Wonderland (www
</P>
<P>
   .geocities.com/SunsetStrip
</P>
<P>
   /Backstage/1823), a site built by a loyal fan, is a far better
site. Organized Yahoo!-style by various topics, including
biographies, song lyrics, the latest news and, best of all, really
big pictures, it has a ``gee aren't these guys cool'' tone that
really captures how much fun it is to read about your favorite
stars and stare at their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What can be learned from a very brief tour of Backstreet Boys
Web sites is that the official site isn't always the best site.
When it comes to entertainment on the Web, sometimes fans can do a
better job of giving other fans what they want than the corporate
entities often responsible for the ``official'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, there was a woman named Bonnie, I think, who
was a huge fan of MTV's ``The Real World.'' For the uninitiated,
``The Real World'' is a popular series that throws seven strangers
into a very snazzy, trendy house in a trendy city, turns on the
cameras and lets the roommates go at each other. Bonnie's site had
cast photos, weekly plot summaries, ``where are they now''
information, bits of gossip almost always verified before they were
posted and an archive of past seasons. For ``Real World'' fans, it
was a wonderful site. However, as the years wore on, Bonnie's
interest in the show waned, and she decided not to keep up with
``The Real World'' any more.
</P>
<P>
   MTV decided to pick up the slack and offers a ``Real World''
area on its Web site that looks a bit like Bonnie's but is much
more corporate. The focus is less on the fun and more on promoting
the show so more people will watch it. That's where fan sites are
far superior to official sites in many cases. They don't have to be
told that TV shows, movies and rock stars are entertainment with a
focus on fun.
</P>
<P>
   If a user comes to a Web site called Backstreet Boys.com or
StarWars.com, they are clearly looking for fun. Publicity is nice,
but people will turn up at the concert, the movie theater, the
record shop and the toy store if the corporate types who build
official Web sites could remember that entertainment is meant to be
just that_ entertaining.

 &HT;    Atlanta's 10 most wanted bugs
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Step outside in your back yard this summer and you
won't be alone. In fact, you'll be surrounded by countless insects
and spiders. Sounds creepy, but before you call the exterminator or
crush the critters with your shoe, remember that not all bugs are
pests.
</P>
<P>
   Your yard needs some bugs, such as butterflies, praying mantises
and ladybugs, to stay healthy, and you'll want them around because
they can keep annoying insects away.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be frightened by spiders, either. As long as it's not a
brown recluse or a black widow, it will eat flies and mosquitoes
while you finish off those curds and whey.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this sounds interesting to you, then you may want to
consider a career in the field of entomology, or the study of
insects. One of the great things about the study of entomology is
that it's a ``very, very wide field,'' says Fred Sherberger, an
entomologist at DeKalb County's Fernbank Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   Entomologists can be found teaching in universities, working in
museums and zoos, doing research or survey work for government
agencies, working in pest management or looking for new species of
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are about one million different species of
insects that have been identified throughout the world,'' says
Duane Jackson, Zoo Atlanta curator of insects and associate
professor of psychology at Morehouse College. He specializes in
insect behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, entomologists find between 700 to 800 new
species,'' he says. ``A few have been found in people's back yards,
so it's possible that a kid could find an insect that has never
been identified before.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn more about entomology, places like Fernbank
sometimes offer summer programs on the subject. Schools can
schedule field trips to Fernbank, where seventh-graders can take
Sherberger's ``Insects and Adaptations'' class and fifth-graders
can take a class called ``Creatures That Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the entomology bug has bitten you bad, remember that one
of the best labs for studying insects can be found right in your
own back yard. You can start by entering our bug search contest
shown at right.
</P>
<P>
   Case File:
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) _ If you like pretty flowers
in your yard, thank the Tiger Swallowtail for helping to pollinate
them. As the state butterfly of Georgia, this black and yellow
butterfly is easy to spot. It's also one of the largest butterflies
in North America, with a wingspan of up to 5.5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Fritillary (Argraulis vanillae) _ This butterfly's upper
wings are red-orange with a few black spots. Its lower wings are
dull to rich brown or olive-colored and can have silver-white
streaks. It loves open, sunny areas with lots of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye (Junonia coenia) _ Buckeyes are mainly brown butterflies
with eye-shaped spots on their upper and lower wings. Some people
believe the eyespots are used to scare away predators. Buckeyes
pollinate flowers and like open, sunny areas with low vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus) _ Is the skipper a
butterfly or a moth or its own separate category? That's up for
debate. It has a thick body like a moth, but thin antennae like
butterflies. Like a butterfly, the skipper flies during the day,
but has a drab color like moths. Look for the silver spotted
skipper in open, sunny areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ladybug (Coccinella novemnotata) _ These cute, red-and-black
bugs feast on the aphids that like to eat your mom's favorite
plants. The Coccinella novemnotata is one of more than 350 kinds of
ladybugs found in North America. They have black dots on their back
and can be found perched on the leaves of a variety of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Hummingbird Moth (Hemaris thysbe) _ This moth got its name
because it resembles a hummingbird in flight. In fact, it's not
uncommon for people to confuse the two. Like butterflies and
skippers, moths help pollinate flowers, but they generally fly at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Honeybee (Apis mellifera) _ Honeybees play a key role in
pollination when they fly from flower to flower sipping nectar. As
their name suggests, they also make honey. The honeybee has a
reddish-brown body with orange-yellow rings on its abdomen. Its
head, antennae and legs are black. Look for them near a patch of
flowers in the bright sun.
</P>
<P>
   Praying Mantis (Mantis religiosa) _ Gardeners often place
praying mantises in their gardens because they eat a variety of
pests. You can find them perched several feet off the ground on
leaves or on the bark of trees. But look carefully _ they are very
well-camouflaged and will be small this time of year because they
just hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Yellow Argiope (Argiope aurantia) _ All spiders
contain poison, but most of the spiders in metro Atlanta are no
more harmful to humans than a bee sting. The Black and Yellow
Argiope eats pests like flies and mosquitoes. Look in a sunny place
for its spiraling webs with an X-shaped mark in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier Beetle _ also known as Pennsylvania Leather-wing
(Chauliognatus Pennsylvanicus) _ Soldier beetles eat aphids, which
are harmful to plants, and the larval form of certain moths that
can damage agriculture crops. They can be found along roads or in
meadows nestled among goldenrod blossoms.

 &HT;    Computer adventure: Wiring a home network
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When's the last time you found yourself installing
computer hardware with a drill?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was using a 3/4-inch router bit, which does a great
deal more damage than a normal drill bit. Of course, I wasn't doing
anything inside my computer. Instead, I was standing in the frame
structure of my soon-to-be house with several boxes of Cat 5 cable
preparing to wire an ethernet network in the walls. I had done my
homework.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with one of the LAN pros at the AJC, who assured me
there was nothing to worry about as long as I kept my cables 6
inches away from the electrical wiring and didn't have any cable
runs longer than 300 feet. I also conferred with my father-in-law,
Bill, who sells telephone systems. He cautioned me not to make any
sharp turns, angles or bends in the wire as I laid it out through
the house, and he suggested following the phone lines as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I chatted up the brother-and-sister team that was wiring almost
everything else in my house _ phones, alarm system, electricity,
cable TV, thermostats _ and I picked up a few pointers while
watching their technique. To be in the proper frame of mind, I had
even gone back into the Wired magazine archives online and dug up
Neal Stephenson's mesmerizing 56-page epic about the world history
of wire and the huge backbone cables lying across ocean floors that
make the Internet possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, nobody told me to bring a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not Bob Vila.
</P>
<P>
   There are many good reasons _ among them the ability to share
files and programs, hard drive space, printers and Internet access
_ for using a network inside your home.
</P>
<P>
   My motives were a little more pedestrian: I initially decided to
put the network in so I wouldn't have to put cable modems, at $40 a
month each, on three computers.
</P>
<P>
   As I did my research, other benefits became obvious. With a
network, I wouldn't have to put a bunch of new hardware into the
old 486/SX2 that my daughter got from her grandparents _ she could
just use devices across the network. (Of course, using the CD-ROM
would mean she'd have to run between rooms to pop discs in and out
of the drive. But she's young and full of energy.)
</P>
<P>
   So _ with my ladder _ I was physically and mentally ready.
</P>
<P>
   While re-reading Stephenson's excellent article, my own wire
adventure began to take on a more profound and meaningful purpose,
like it was a metaphor for the infrastructure of life. But, after
sweating it out for a couple of hours in 90-degree heat, crawling
among the rafters, pulling cable, banging my shins and wiping
sawdust out of my eyes, I didn't care if it was the key to the
universe as long as I finished before dark.
</P>
<P>
   The process is really quite simple. In fact, a large part of it
is just mapping the network through your house. I tracked the paths
of my wires beam by beam to each room in the house, which avoided
dozens of nasty little surprises and tricky maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   One good tip: No matter if you are wiring a house frame or an
existing house, start in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Decide where your hub is going to be and work outward. Surfing
some Web sites with how-to pages on network wiring, I found there
are two kinds of networks and two primary network layouts. Either
type of network _ peer-to-peer or client-server _ works for home
networks, but that's a topic for a future column.
</P>
<P>
   A ``backbone'' network layout, a straight line of coaxial cable
with computers coming off the sides, is more suited for businesses
with a lot of terminals. Home networks typically use a ``star''
layout, which has a hub and terminals radiating outward on
telephone-type wires. (Actually, I may have created a third
configuration called the ``Silly String'' layout.)
</P>
<P>
   The cable comes in various categories, based on the data they
can push. Ordinary telephone wire is Cat 2 and has two pairs of
wire inside the cable. Cat 3 cable can also be used for an ethernet
and is capable of up to 10 megabytes, and Cat 5 cable _ which is
four pairs of wire _ is capable of up to 100 megabytes. (The plugs
for my Cat 5 cable ends are basically the same as phone jacks, only
bigger, and will require different wall plates.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the two ethernet speeds aren't interchangeable. And
mixing them requires special switching hubs that are, naturally,
more expensive. But 10 megabytes should be plenty fast for a home
network. Don't forget that cable modem access, the speediest
available, hits only 3 megabytes _ although I've heard from plenty
of cable modem subscribers who say actual and advertised speeds
vary greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the hub near your source of Internet access _ a
telephone jack or cable TV outlet _ should make things easier. I
added an extra cable jack about 6 feet up on the laundry room wall,
after some alert readers sent e-mail about possible moisture and
temperature extremes in the garage, my original location. I'm also
putting in a shelf for the cable modem, the hub and a small
computer to use as a server, if I need it.
</P>
<P>
   I did end up finishing my job before dark. My eight cables came
together in a beautiful thick bunch that follows one of the big
pipes through the upstairs bathroom floor along the ceiling over
the washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday after my wiring job, my wife stopped by the house to
check its progress. A new subcontractor, who was wiring my light
fixtures, asked if we were doing some of our own wiring work. When
she told him I had wired up a computer network, he said, ``Well, he
sure knew what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's profound enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Screwdriver PC postscript: According to my e-mail _ which was
filled with tales of frustration _ many readers have been victims
of shoddy service from screwdriver PC shops. Surprisingly, almost
every person's problem was with the same outfit. My advice still
stands, no matter which one you buy from: Buyer beware.

   You've heard of the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&AMP;P
500. Now there's Wired magazine's own stock index, a list of 40
so-called new-economy companies. In its June issue, Wired says its
stock market index is up 81 percent in the past 12 months. Its
index includes companies such as Yahoo!, America Online, Microsoft,
Sun Microsystems and Intel.

</P>
<P>
   If you transfer a lot of files over the Internet, you might want
to look at a new product called CuteFTP. FTP, of course, refers to
the File Transfer Protocol software that enables you to do that.
What CuteFTP offers is a simple, Windows-like format in which to
use FTP to move files. CuteFTP uses drag-and-drop technology,
allows remote access and includes an HTML editor. The creators
claim the software excels at transferring large files between
corporate offices.

 &HT;    World Book on DVD fails to forge proper links
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM's venture into the world of DVD, the 1999 World
Book Family Reference Suite, is a pretty good tool hampered by
exceptionally poor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply expanding upon the entries contained in the
paper version of the World Book Encyclopedia, IBM opted to fill out
the vast space afforded by DVD-ROM with the Merriam-Webster
Dictionary and the latest Information Please almanac.
</P>
<P>
   This was a pretty good decision _ especially for kids struggling
with homework. The Merriam-Webster dictionary is always active, and
one need only double-click on any word in an article in the
encyclopedia to get a complete explanation of it.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of multimedia, including especially good movie
clips in fairly large format. Strangely, every last one of them
seems to be silent. There are lots of sounds, just not moving
picture sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Musical illustrations for the great composers are adequate in
number, although disappointingly brief. They are, however,
presented by the appropriate instruments rather than a synthesizer
or MIDI translation.
</P>
<P>
   I checked my usual out-of-the-way articles and found them
accurate, if not very enlightening. Longer, more mainstream
entries, such as that for Australia, are quite adequate for most
purposes, including homework, and well-written.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a brief separate entry under didgeridoo,
explaining that it is a musical instrument of the Australian
Aborigines. This is good, because only a few electronic
dictionaries include it. I was disappointed not to find a musical
example linked to it, which leads to my chief complaint about World
Book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever branch of the publisher charged with organizing the
material and providing cross-links appears to have been permanently
out to lunch. There is, in fact, a musical example of the
didgeridoo. You can find it in the general article on Australia. I
can think of no reason why it wasn't also included with the brief
article on the instrument itself.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing abounds. The article on flamenco offers no
examples. Yet the article on Spain, under arts, provides two aural
examples, portions of a fandango de Huelva and tientos. The former
is listed as a ``traditional fandango'' (it is not) and the latter
as a ``traditional dance.'' I supposed that whoever put together
the section simply didn't know much about it, but this sort of
thing is far too endemic throughout the book to be accounted for
that way.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you ask for information on the Second Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, World Book provides the text of it and a
discussion of the controversy surrounding it. If, however, you ask
for the Fourth Amendment, all you get is an article on wiretapping
which mentions the amendment in passing without giving its text.
</P>
<P>
   All the articles are signed, which is good. Some are written by
big-time experts in the field at issue; most are relatively
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, navigation is simple, although if you have
been browsing through articles and decide you want to look at a
list of videos on the disc, you're going to find you can't get
there from here. At least I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go through the ordeal of ``teaching'' the
software how you speak, or if you have difficulty typing, you can
even navigate with IBM's ViaVoice technology and a provided
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The search list hides the icon that indicates what multimedia
items, if any, are associated with an article. You wouldn't even
know it's there unless you look.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``wizards'' to help with things like Web pages and
homework, and a timeline feature which most users will find next to
useless because of its lack of organization. There is the
obligatory online link, but in this case obligatory is quite apt.
Unlike Microsoft Encarta, for instance, relatively few articles are
linked to Internet information, even when a wealth of it is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Information Please is a useful almanac for lists and records and
so forth, as well as 1998 events.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like about World Book. The pity is that if it
had been given the kind of organizational attention that every
other electronic encyclopedia has, it would be outstanding.

 &HT;    Elementary etiquette enhances e-mail enjoyment
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I go in spells _ in starts and stops like a balky 1974
Toyota _ when it comes to e-mail. It's one of those things that
seem to grow until, next thing you know, I spend most of my
evenings answering mail. Then I sort of shut down shop and decide
to move more of my life into the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when I do that, I discover all of a sudden that I
don't have a real life. Like a lot of people, I spend way too much
time at work, sometimes coming in before 8 o'clock and leaving
around that time in the evening. Once you factor in feeding the cat
and myself, that doesn't leave much time. So I start up that 1974
Toyota again and resume old conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these conversations span an enormous chunk of time _ my
longest-lived e-mail conversation goes back to 1993. So I think of
myself as a real expert on the important side of e-mail. You'll
read a lot, including from me at times, about security and
passwords and the mechanics of setting up an e-mail program. But
for today, we'll talk about some really basic tips that will make
e-mail more fun and that will increase the likelihood of a long and
interesting conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Husted's first rule of e-mail is that you must assume your
correspondent may have literally dozens of conversations going at
once by e-mail. Now that it is become part of daily life, most of
us get e-mail _ at home and work _ that is a mixture of personal
and business correspondence. When answering an e-mail, don't assume
the recipient remembers what he asked you several days before.
Include a snippet from the question, to avoid confusion. Otherwise,
like me, he may have to puzzle over the meaning of e-mails that
say: ``Yes, go right ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Along that same line of reasoning, you must assume your
correspondent has some sort of a life outside e-mail. Don't get
overly concerned if your mail remains unanswered for days, or if
you get a short and to-the-point reply. There's nothing worse than
turning a pleasant e-mail conversation into a guilt trip, in which
the recipient feels as if he has to answer quickly and at length.
When you are using e-mail as a modern substitute for having a pen
pal, the whole notion is to keep things fun.
</P>
<P>
   One really horrible trend, at least for me, is that folks
nowadays tend to attach two or three photographs or even a small
computer program. It's not that I don't like to see photos; it's
that they can take forever to download. At times I have gone home
for the evening, turned on the computer to check my e-mail and sat
for a long time watching photos and other attachments download.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second reason many of us don't like getting
unsolicited attachments: They can contain programs or even Word
documents with viruses. So don't stop sending photos and
attachments _ simply ask first if your recipient would like to
receive them. If I know I have photos or other data-heavy stuff
coming, I tell the sender when to send it and pick a time that is
convenient for me.
</P>
<P>
   But my real pet peeve comes from the well-meaning folks who
forward messages about viruses (there are more virus hoaxes than
viruses) or some other weird Internet scheme. Avoid forwarding
messages that Bill Gates will give the next 100 people who e-mail
him a million dollars or that a foundation in Des Moines is
collecting cigarette wrappers to buy an iron lung for some
deserving kid.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on the assurances of the sender that a friend told
him it was true. Just don't send it. Also, please don't simply
forward a joke you've found unless you know for a fact that your
friend loves to receive them. If you don't have anything to say at
all, try something really unusual these days: Just be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what I'm going to do right now.

WHEN DO YOU WAVE OFF A WALK-IN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 20)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I asked Rep. Chris Cox if the Chinese  &UR; walk-in &LR;  was a  &UR; dangle &LR; ,
and he  &UR; waved me off &LR; . Thirty years before, I asked Jim Angleton of
the CIA if the Nosenko  &UR; walk-in &LR;  was what he called a  &UR; dangle &LR; , and
he  &UR; waved me on &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Times change, adversaries shift, but spookspeak _ the inside
lingo of the intelligence trade _ lives on. Those who confuse a
 &UR; drop-dead &LR;  dress with a  &UR; dead-drop &LR;  address have not come in from
the cold and are unable to cope with delicious nuances of
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In the three volumes published by the House Select Committee on
U.S. National Security and Military-Commercial Concerns With the
People's Republic of China, a k a the Cox Report
(www.house.gov/coxreport), this drama is teased: ``In 1995, a
 &UR; `walk-in' &LR;  approached the CIA outside of the PRC and provided an
official PRC document classified `Secret' that contained design
information on the W-88 Trident D-5 warhead.''
</P>
<P>
   The report helpfully cited the definition of  &UR; walk-in &LR;  in ``Spy
Book: The Encyclopedia of Espionage,'' by Norman Polmar and Thomas
B. Allen: ``an unheralded defector or a  &UR; dangle &LR; , a  &UR; `walk-in' &LR;  is
a potential agent or a mole who literally walks into an embassy or
intelligence agency without prior contact or recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Note those ``ors'': If the  &UR; walk-in &LR;  is a true defector, the spy
becomes a potential agent for the side walked in on; if he or she
is a  &UR; dangle &LR; , the spy is seen as a potential  &UR; mole &LR; , a word coined
by the novelist John le Carre to mean ``penetration agent.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dangle &LR;  is a Danish verb meaning ``to hang so as to swing
freely.'' In its espionage sense, a  &UR; dangle &LR;  is like a delicious
morsel swung in front of the nose of a slavering animal. The
 &UR; dangle &LR;  is a tempter, much like the serpent in the Garden of Eden,
offering an apple of discord to the spy agency that welcomes and
trusts the  &UR; walk-in &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a buttoned-up attorney not given to colorful language,
apparently felt the need for a cooler term for  &UR; dangle &LR; . He chose
 &UR; directed walk-in &LR; , ``purposefully directed by the PRC to provide
this information to the United States.'' (The specific
 &UR; purposefully &LR;  means ``with intent to carry out a given purpose'';
the general  &UR; purposely &LR;  means ``on purpose, not accidentally.'')
Spy novelists hope the compound, formalized Cox synonym for
 &UR; dangle &LR;  does not catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Although the earliest printed citation in the Dow Jones database
for  &UR; dangle &LR;  in the specialized sense is from 1985, I heard it in
1970 from the lips of James Jesus Angleton, the legendary
counterintelligence chief of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   He was deeply suspicious of the bona fides of Yuri Nosenko, a
Soviet  &UR; walk-in &LR;  who transmitted to the United States information
about Lee Harvey Oswald dissociating Moscow from the Kennedy
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Angleton, an orchid-raising fishing enthusiast and poetry lover
nicknamed Mother, talked of Nosenko as ``a probable  &UR; dangle &LR; '' and
what he brought in as ``feed material,'' both phrases taken from
fishing. To this day, his supposition that Nosenko was supplying
disinformation is fiercely disputed within the agency.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked if I would be wise to think of Nosenko as what
Angleton called a  &UR; dangle &LR; , he replied only that he would not  &UR; wave
me off &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   To  &UR; wave off &LR; , in hockey, means not to count a goal even though
it looks as if the puck went into the net. In auto racing, a driver
has the chance to  &UR; wave off &LR;  his qualifying laps if he doesn't
think his car is making good enough time. On aircraft carriers, it
is to abort a landing. In general colloquial use, it means ``to
disregard or dismiss.''
</P>
<P>
   In journalingo, akin to spookspeak because of their commonality
of snooping, to  &UR; wave off &LR;  means ``to suggest a hypothesis is
mistaken without denying it.'' The earliest citation I can find,
unfortunately, is in a column of my own in 1981: ``As columnist
Jack Anderson was about to write of the secretary's incipient ((I
meant imminent)) departure, the secretary of state ((Al Haig))
panicked to the point of begging the president to call the newsman
to  &UR; wave him off &LR;  the story. Mr. Reagan complied.''
</P>
<P>
   If the reporter is not  &UR; waved off &LR;  a story by a source, is the
source tacitly confirming it? No. In 1990, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh deplored the fact that ``the media on occasion
interprets the fact that we will not deny information or  &UR; wave them
off &LR;  of a story as confirmation of an unauthorized disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when a source, worried about confirming a leak,  &UR; waves
a reporter off &LR;  a story that is true (as Cox did with my early
query about a  &UR; walk-in &LR; ), that is considered by the inquirer to be
a misstep in the symbiosis minuet.
</P>
<P>
   THINKING TO MYSELF
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Irving has just published the hoax he went to jail for
a generation ago, ``Autobiography of Howard Hughes.'' Because no
ordinary publisher would touch ``the most famous unpublished book
of the 20th century,'' Irving is selling it through
terrificbooks.com.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself, How can he get away with it? And he
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``What other way can you think, other than to yourself? You
can't think to someone else, and you can only think aloud in
special fictional circumstances that are really not antithetical to
 &UR; thinking to yourself &LR; ; thinking aloud contrasts only with
thinking. Let's put a stop to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Squad Squad, hunter of prolix tautologies, salutes him:
 &UR; Think to yourself &LR;  is redundant. As the Cartesians say, ``I think;
therefore I  &UR; think to myself &LR; .'' But still, I have to wonder, How
does Cliff get away with it?

PERENNIAL LAVENDER GIVES MUCH AND ASKS LITTLE
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photos of a field of lavender and a close-up of a
sprig of lavender 
 By MEG MCCONAHEY 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the perfect garden plant _ bewitching, aromatic,
restorative, the stuff of romance and scented memories _ and it
doesn't ask for much.
</P>
<P>
   Breaker waves of hardy, old-fashioned lavender in deep purple
and violet blue are washing across the landscape as home gardeners
increasingly discover, or rediscover, the virtues of the perennial
herb that for millennia has inspired poets, perfumiers and natural
healers.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbornly self-reliant, demanding only infrequent watering and
repugnant to deer, gophers and other garden thieves, lavender is
both ornamental and practical. With a little attention to timely
pruning and selection, gardeners could arrange to have some
lavender in glorious purple bloom every month of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Its many useful products have found a place in modern spice
racks, medicine cabinets, dried flower arrangements, beside the
bathtub, in undie drawers and even on the bed in the form of tiny
''pillows'' that according to lore, foster sleep and sweet dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Lavender lovers hold forth with the zeal of religious converts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you told me I could have only one plant in my garden it
would be lavender. It's wonderful. It's gorgeous. I'm just so
attached to it I can't seem to bring myself to grow anything
else,'' said Myra Portwood, whose property overlooking the
Freestone Valley in California is aflame in spring and summer with
100 to 200 lavender plants _ including a lavender hedge, a second
line of defense in front of her deer fence.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the lavender fervor is Robert Kourik, a landscape design
consultant and garden writer whose book ''The Lavender Garden''
(Chronicle Books, $18.95) is quickly becoming the bible of American
lavender growers, the first book, he said, published in America by
an American for American lavender growers.
</P>
<P>
   Kourik selected 16 commonly found lavender varieties for the
book. He provides tips on planting, cultivating, pruning,
harvesting and drying and instructions on how to put a ''crop'' to
good use in potpourri, cooking and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The romance of lavender is back,'' said Kourik. ''A lot of our
mothers and grandmothers used it in some form so it has a floral
memory in people's brains, and it's very versatile both as a fresh
and dried cut flower. It makes a great landscaping plant, and it's
very low maintenance. It gets no diseases if you give it the
drainage it requires, and it grows prolifically. There are some
varieties that get up to 6 feet tall, and you can choose all the
way down to cute little compact plants that don't get any taller
than 8 inches. So there's a size to fit every section of the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Although lavender blooms in the spring and summer, has fall is
the perfect time to plant lavender to get that amethyst beauty and
heady scent by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you put the plant in, the top doesn't seem to be doing
anything, but the roots are growing into the soil with the winter
rains,'' he said. ''In the spring, it makes a full foliage but its
roots are more expansive, both in width and depth. Whereas, if you
plant in spring, when you're inspired, the plant doesn't have any
chance to get a root system in before the dryness of June hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavender planted in the fall may need little or no irrigation. A
monthly watering, said Kourik, could be enough. Lavender needs
alkaline soil, and little fertilization, just good drainage, so if
you have heavy, clay soil, plant in deep, gravel-lined holes or
raised beds. Also, growers in areas that have cold winters will
want to select a hearty variety.
</P>
<P>
   Kourik said his initial interest in the ornament herb was merely
pragmatic. It proved the ideal landscaping solution in an area
where deer were eating the plants. But practicality doesn't really
explain the sway the woody shrub holds over humans with, as Kourik
writes, its ''unique fragrance emitted by a complex oil with over
180 different constituents and unduplicated by the chemistry of any
other plant.''
</P>
<P>
   The lavender guru admits to being thoroughly besotted with the
aromatic shrub Romans used for luxurious baths, Medievals spread to
ward off the Black Death and French courtiers dabbed on their wigs
and gloves to mask the sins of poor hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   Kourik, who defined the genre of edible landscaping, started
experimenting with cooking lavender, even throwing the long stems
on the grill for smoking food.
</P>
<P>
   Lavender, which can easily substitute for rosemary, is finding
its way into more chef's recipes _ in ice creams, grilled foods and
with lamb and trout.
</P>
<P>
   More and more products also are being infused with a scent that,
depending on the variety, can be woody, floral, hay-like, citrusy
or any of dozens of other descriptors.
</P>
<P>
   Lavender is being paired with pumpkin in soaps and food as a
sort-of natural alternative to Viagra. And cosmetic and toiletry
companies are coming up with ever more lavender concoctions for
aromatherapy and personal pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes Magazine last year declared the homespun herb suddenly
''chic'' _ with the price of the drid plant nearly doubling to $27
a pound as baby boomers with disposable income turn to lavender as
a cure-all for every ill from headaches and hair loss to dandruff
and bladder infections. Lavender is believed to be good for aging
skin, burns and muscle pain and by releasing serotonin in the
brain, induces a calming effect to relieve migraines and improve
sleep. &QL;

GOOD BUSINESSMEN CAN MAKE GREAT FATHERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM HIRSCHFELD with JULIE HIRSCHFELD, Ph.D. 
 c.1999 Thomas P. Hirschfeld 
 North American Rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The following is an excerpt from ''Business Dad'' by Tom
Hirschfeld with Julie Hirschfeld, Ph.D. Copyright 1999 by Thomas P.
Hirschfeld. Reprinted by arrangement with Little, Brown and
Company, Inc. All rights reserved.)
</P>
<P>
   Parenting is a joint responsibility. Numerous studies of kids
who have absent fathers show that the odds are stacked heavily
against them, even after adjustment for factors like family income
and education. Even when the father is physically present but
relatively uninvolved, child-rearing experts say there is a
negative impact on kids' IQ, sense of humor, self-esteem,
motivation to learn and other important qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The truism that two heads are better than one seems tailormade
for child raising, especially when one head is male and the other
is female.
</P>
<P>
   Let me be perfectly clear: being a good father does not mean
learning how to mother. Mothers are wise, mothers are wonderful,
mothers are essential, but mothers are not the only parents _ or
the only kind of parents _ that children need. Men and women have
different ways of looking at things, as our workplace experiences
demonstrate every day.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who are exposed to only one way, or brought up according to
only one way, miss out big time. Here are a few reasons why:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dads get physical. &LR;  Roughhousing gives kids a chance to be both
silly and cuddly, a winning combination to which dads are naturally
disposed. It never hurts to have that kind of additional, nonverbal
path toward intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guy things'' like wrestling and bouncing on the bed (and,
later, playing hoops or catch together) also help boys' and girls'
physical development. Kids are not so different in this respect
from tiger cubs, which spend hours in playful scuffling that
actually helps them practice deadly serious skills such as stalking
and pouncing.
</P>
<P>
   Getting physical, by the way, exemplifies perfectly why being an
involved father does not have to mean giving up an ounce of your
masculinity. Some men are concerned that acting too ''nurturing''
will somehow smooth their rough edges or make them less attractive
to their wives. That fear may have some basis if they try to act
like Assistant Mom, but not if they are true to their own natures
as fathers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dads are strong. &LR;  There's a heartbreaking story about John F.
Kennedy Jr. shortly after his father's funeral, when he was still
known as John-John. He asked William Haddad, a family friend, ''Are
you a daddy?'' When Haddad said yes, John-John said, ''Then will
you throw me up in the air?''
</P>
<P>
   He missed his dad, and needed something he thought only a daddy
could give him.
</P>
<P>
   Men typically have the upper body strength to hoist their kids
high and let them imagine the giddy joy of flight. Dads can walk a
mile with a child on their shoulders, a child looking down on the
passing world from a vantage point of total security.
</P>
<P>
   Kids' lives are shadowed by the knowledge that they're weak and
small, so experiencing firsthand the strength of a dad sworn to
protect them gives them a warm and wonderful feeling. Even old
Sigmund Freud wrote, ''I could not point to any need in childhood
as strong as that for a father's protection.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dads provide balance in protectiveness. &LR;  Kids are born
adventurous into a world full of peril. Many moms, with their extra
nine months' investment to protect and millennia of social
conditioning behind them, tend to come down on the side of caution
in restricting exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Kids need Dad to say, ''Oh, let her walk along the top of the
wall. It's not too high, and I'll catch her if she falls.'' (Your
wife's instincts, however, may be right. Business dads make their
living by taking calculated risks, but the downside is much greater
when your kids' safety is on the line.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dads discipline by the rules. &LR;  It's important for both parents
to be consistent in how they apply discipline, but gray areas often
leave room for judgment calls. In those cases, some experts believe
that mothers tend to make greater allowances for extenuating
circumstances, the reasons or intent behind a transgression,
whereas fathers tend to stick to the letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches are valuable: kids learn sensitivity and mercy
from their mothers at such times, but absorb from their fathers the
respect for rules that any social being requires.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boys need male role models. &LR;  Boys identify with dads, all the
more as they distance themselves from Mom to stake out their male
identities. Without dads as models, boys risk one of two extremes,
either becoming overly aggressive or failing to learn how to stand
up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Boys will watch you in everything you let them: how you solve
problems, how you handle frustration, how you take responsibility,
how you treat women. Unless you somehow convince them otherwise,
their unspoken M.O. will be, ''When in doubt, do like Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Girls need male role models. &LR;  At least once a year, I read a
tribute to Dad from some world-class woman executive, who credits
him with showing her how to think and act in business and in life.
Studies show that girls with involved fathers perform better in
math, logical reasoning, and other ''male'' fields.
</P>
<P>
   You are also your daughter's role model in another, equally
important sense: as prototype for a future husband. Girls grow up
seeing their fathers as standards for male behavior, so if you want
her to marry well and have a happy life, act like the kind of guy
you'd want her to pick.
</P>
<P>
   Give her the warmth, admiration, and respect she deserves and
she'll look for a husband who loves her enough to do the same. By
contrast, if you act dishonest or remote or unsupportive, she will
think all men are like that and adjust her expectations
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kids need role models. &LR;  Not everything you pass on to kids
relates to gender (yours or theirs). Virtues like honor,
compassion, dignity, love, and self-discipline come not from Mars
or Venus, but from Earth and Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The more exemplars kids have of these virtues, the better. If
you're truly involved, then you and your wife can reinforce each
other's lessons, and also show the young ones how two people of
goodwill lead their lives together.

Mateo misses in first shot at hero's role 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It could have been the stuff dreams are made
of.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo, in only his second major-league game, had his
chance, batting with two outs and two on in the ninth inning, his
team down by two runs. A home run there and the first chapter of
the Mateo legend would have been written.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the harsh reality of the big leagues prevailed.
Colorado Rockies closer Dave Veres struck out Mateo with a 2-2
fastball and the Rangers fell, 4-2, at The Ballpark in Arlington
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be put in that situation sometime,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``I'm sure Ruben will be critiqued every time he
takes a step, whether that's right or wrong. But he's young, he's
going to get a few hits in those situations before it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, 0-for-4 with two strikeouts, wasn't the only Rangers'
hitter to struggle yesterday. Other than back-to-back home runs by
Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro in the fourth inning, the
Rangers' offense mounted little against Rockies starter Bobby Jones
and two relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo had the best chance of erasing the Rangers' frustrations
with some ninth-inning heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he could handle it,'' Palmeiro said. ``He came up
yesterday and hit a home run. I thought he wanted to be in that
situation. I know it's a lot to ask, but he's an exceptional
player. He'll thrive on those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Veres pitched the Rangers' rookie carefully with a diet of
off-speed pitches before getting the fastball by him for strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to win it, I was just trying to get a base hit
or something,'' Mateo said. ``It just didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little bit excited, but I was much better today. I
know tomorrow it's going to get better. Every day will be better.
I'm going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has thrived in those situations as much as anybody, but
he also missed his chance, striking out against Jones with two on
and two out in the fifth. Jones caught Palmeiro going after a pitch
out of the strike zone for strike three, an example of the
impatience the Rangers showed all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guys threw pretty good, but we helped them a lot,''
Palmeiro said. ``They threw a lot off-speed stuff and sliders and
we were swinging at them. It's going to happen. I wish we could do
it right every time, but it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Mike Morgan put the Rangers in their hole, allowing four
runs in the second inning. All came with two outs. Angel Echevarria
grounded a single through the right side, and Lenny Harris drew a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrible walk, right there with two outs,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan then threw a slider to Kurt Abbott, who crushed it deep
into the left-field bleachers for a three-run homer. Abbott was
0-for-6 with three strikeouts in his career against Morgan before
that blast.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blanco followed with a triple, and Darryl Hamilton's
single gave the Rockies a 4-0 lead. Morgan rallied from that to
throw five scoreless innings recover from his early troubles].
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've thrown since Toronto,'' said Morgan,
referring to a 4-3 victory on May 8 against the Blue Jays before on
onset of injuries. ``It's something for me to build on. But it's
still a loss and tough to swallow.''

A NATIONAL MILESTONE FOR BIZARRENESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 13, 1994, news of the previous night's double murder in
Los Angeles was just beginning to spread across America. Over the
next 16 months, the crime and its aftermath would become a national
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Nicole Brown Simpson, ex-wife of former
football star O.J. Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. They were
savagely stabbed and slashed to death _ a cop called it
``overkill'' _ outside Nicole's condominium.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been those who immediately jumped to the
conclusion that O.J. Simpson had committed this horrible crime, but
I wasn't one of them. My first reaction was sympathy for the
athlete/actor/commercial pitchman whose two young children had lost
their mother to a vicious killer.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, the early news reports noted that O.J. was in
Chicago on the night of June 12 _ a fact that seemed to suggest no
involvement by him. But Simpson's presumption of innocence didn't
last long.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after the killings, Simpson was charged with murder
and embarked on the infamous ``low-speed chase'' along the freeways
of Southern California. That adventure _ carried live on nationwide
television and ending with Simpson's surrender to police in the
driveway of his elegant home _ seemed plenty bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with events that would follow, however, the weird car
chase barely moved the needle on the bizarreness meter.
</P>
<P>
   It will surely be a long time before we witness a court
proceeding as bizarre as Simpson's murder trial in Los Angeles;
before we see an infomercial as bizarre as the post-trial videotape
that O.J. marketed in a futile attempt to convince the world of his
innocence; before we see a media juxtaposition as bizarre as the
near-simultaneous coverage of a presidential State of the Union
speech and the verdict in Simpson's civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   If none of that was bizarre enough for your taste, how about
Simpson's successful court fight for custody of the children whose
mother he allegedly butchered? How about his incessant print and
broadcast interviews proclaiming his innocence and predicting the
eventual apprehension of the ``real killer''?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about his carefree lifestyle, financed by a
$25,000-per-month, judgment-proof annuity that lets him while away
his days playing golf?
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the bizarreness spectrum, of course, there
are Ron Goldman's father and sister, who continue to hound Simpson
like Ahab chasing the whale. They won their civil suit _ and a
multimillion-dollar judgment that they'll never collect _ but still
can't come to grips with the reality of Simpson's acquittal in the
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the criminal trial. The definition of ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors showed up with what they proudly described as a
``mountain of evidence'' and set about conducting a clinic in the
art of blowing an open-and-shut murder case. The cops who
investigated the murders and the assistant district attorneys who
presented the case exhibited such a breathtaking combination of
obnoxiousness and ineptitude that the jurors were more than ready
to consider the defense's relentless arguments for reasonable
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors who declared O.J. not guilty in October 1995 have
been vilified for their decision, but I say they had no choice. I'm
only slightly embarrassed to confess that I followed the trial
virtually gavel to gavel, and if I'd been on that jury, I would
have voted ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution simply didn't prove Simpson's guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm open to the possibility that O.J. didn't do it,
that his predictions of vindication might one day come true. It's a
long shot, I know, but when a defendant is found not guilty of a
crime by a jury of his peers, it hardly seems unreasonable to
wonder if the accused might actually be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   If Simpson got away with murder, well, nobody said our justice
system was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the system survived the O.J. case, despite dire
warnings of its imminent demise. And that's the one shred of good
news in the whole sorry mess.

FAMILY PRECEDENT: ELDER BUSH REJECTS NOTION OF DYNASTY

<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ They have the same name, the same facial
expressions, the same family background. Now the son is seeking to
share a place in history with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 175 years after John Quincy Adams followed his father
into the White House, Texas Gov. George W. Bush wants to do the
same for his family. But don't use the term ``dynasty'' around his
dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never felt entitled to something,'' former President Bush
said. ``Dynasty, to me, at least, connotes the expectation of
something coming your way. I never felt that way. I don't like the
concept of dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sense of family destiny was hard to miss Sunday as
Bush and his son joined other relatives at the family compound on
the Maine coast. Under a sunny sky tempered by a cool coastal
breeze, the former president and his wife, Barbara, beamed at the
son who wants to reclaim the office that his father lost in a
humiliating defeat seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes around, comes around,'' the elder Bush said. ``I got
some things right, maybe messed some things up. It's his turn now
in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush put it in Texas terms: ``I feel like we done good
with this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old governor, who took the day off between campaign
stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, said it was only fitting that he
come to Kennebunkport on his first presidential campaign swing.
Bush said that watching his father deal with his loss to Bill
Clinton steeled him for his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that life doesn't end if you lose a campaign,''
he said. ``This is an appropriate place to talk about it. This is
the place where we find love and comfort, where we know the values
of life that are bigger than straw polls and caucuses and
primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush clan, including three of the former president's four
sons, his daughter and his 10 grandchildren, gathered to mark the
elder Bush's 75th birthday Saturday. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush missed
the reunion, an absence that left the spotlight solely on his older
brother.
</P>
<P>
   George and Barbara Bush said they have been intently following
TV coverage of their son's campaign debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see George out in Iowa, and I say, `Hey, I've been there,'''
the elder Bush said. ``We thought it was a good start, but we would
admit that we are probably the two most nonobjective people in the
United States when it comes to support for this son of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The proud parents maintained their good humor when a reporter
asked the former president to explain how voters could reject him
but put his son at the top of campaign 2000 polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he means is, you were unpopular,'' Barbara Bush joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' Bush said. ``Maybe I'm a little egotistical. I think
the American people, at least from surveys I've seen, have been
rather pleasant about me, and certainly about Barbara, so I don't
worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he refrains from giving his son advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need a voice from the past,'' he said. ``I think
it's better to let George now make his own way, which he seems to
be doing very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has spent much of his life following a path
set by his father. Both Bushes attended prep school at the Phillips
Academy in Andover, Mass., before enrolling at Yale University,
where they both served as president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity and joined the secretive Skull and Bones social club.
</P>
<P>
   Both men learned to fly in the military _ the former president
during World War II and his son as a member of the Texas Air
National Guard. Both sought their fortune in the West Texas
oilfields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived with being `George Bush's son' all my life,'' the
governor wrote in a Father's Day reminiscence for P.O.V., a men's
magazine. ``Growing up, I probably didn't want to be like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Family friends say that any teen-age resentment about life with
a famous father is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have unconditional love for each other,'' said Midland,
Texas, oilman Don Evans, one of the governor's closest friends.
``George, the governor, is just very content with who he is. He
doesn't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what his score
card looks like vs. somebody else's score card.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their many similarities, father and son have distinct
personalities, shaped in large part by their childhood
surroundings. Although they both claim Texas as home, the younger
Bush often says that the biggest difference is that he grew up in
Midland and his dad spent his childhood in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the younger Bush is more conservative, more
outspoken and more outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. is much more Texan than his dad,'' said former
Transportation Secretary Andrew Card. ``President Bush wouldn't
like me saying this, but I see a lot more New England, Old Yankee
in his dad than I do in the governor. But I think that values that
come of that hearty New England stock are very much present in
Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush, who went fishing with his father Sunday
morning, said he considers his parental ties ``a huge plus'' in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just see what happens,'' he said. ``If it works out, I'm
ready. And if it doesn't work out, me and the old boy will spend a
lot of time fishing together.''

VEGETARIANS PLAN CAMPAIGN TO CONVERT SOUTHERN BAPTISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern Baptists have targeted other groups for conversion in
the past. Now, the tables are turned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, when thousands of Baptists arrive in Atlanta for
their national convention, they will be greeted by a 60-foot by
20-foot billboard declaring, ``Jesus Was a Vegetarian.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking our message to Baptists that killing and eating
animals is inherently un-Christian,'' said Bruce G. Friedrich, a
spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. ``Jesus
was the Prince of Peace, not a butcher.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Baptists met in Salt Lake City and carried out
door-to-door evangelism campaigns among members of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Anti-Defamation League officials
objected three years ago when a resolution was approved calling for
a ``missionary'' to Jewish people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vegetarian crusade could be one of the more provocative
events in a convention in which about 14,000 delegates will focus
more on winning new converts than on conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It won't be emphasized, but this year's meeting in the Georgia
Dome on Tuesday and Wednesday marks the 20th anniversary of the
beginning of the conservative rise to power over moderates in the
country's largest non-Catholic denomination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unlikely that the pro-vegetarian crusade will win
over many of the Southern Baptists. But Friedrich said the animal
rights group plans to have a man dressed like Jesus parading
outside the Georgia Dome carrying a sign declaring, ``For Christ's
Sake _ Go Vegetarian.'' Another will dress like a chicken and
display a sign saying ``Meat is Murder.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baptists have several banquets scheduled for the meeting, and
none are likely to be meatless, predicted Jennette Briggs, director
of alumni affairs at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Fort Worth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's in charge of an alumni luncheon where chicken enchiladas
will be served. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do have vegetarians, they are out of luck,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One Texas Baptist preacher said biblical evidence doesn't
indicate that Jesus refrained from meat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest bunch of baloney I've ever heard,'' said
the Rev. Charles Clary, pastor of the Tate Springs Baptist Church
in Arlington, Texas. ``All the Jewish feasts involved meat, and
Jesus was a good Jewish man.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clary said the stereotype about Baptists and chicken dinners is
accurate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This Baptist here eats chicken, beef, pork _ anything that's
not moving on my plate,'' he said. ``I've even eaten
rattlesnake.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights group's first ``Jesus Was a Vegetarian''
billboard was put up across from Oral Roberts University in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, in December. The sign carries the Dulles, Va.,
organization's Web site address, www.jesusveg.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a ``Jesus Was a Vegetarian'' billboard was displayed in
Amarillo, Texas, on March 9, it received numerous protests. A sign
company quickly took down the sign after the Amarillo Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported that a caller had
threatened to burn one cat per day until the sign was removed. No
cats were harmed, police said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the two early leaders of the conservative movement, Paige
Patterson, is expected to be re-elected president of the convention
without opposition. The former Dallasite is also president of
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man who teamed with Patterson in 1979 to begin unseating
moderates from control of the denomination, Judge Paul Pressler of
Houston, will be at the meeting promoting his new book, ``A Hill on
Which to Die.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Baptist convention business, conventioners are expected to
reject a proposal that the name ``Southern'' be taken out of the
denomination's name. Many have called for the change because the
15.7 million member convention now has churches in every state. A
$159.5 million budget, $5 million more than the current budget, is
expected to be approved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton could come under fire again from his fellow
Southern Baptists at the 142nd annual convention. But that's
nothing new. He has long been condemned by conservative Baptists
for his stands on gay rights and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wiley Drake of Buena Vista, Calif., said he will
propose a resolution condemning Clinton's appointment of James
Hormel, an openly gay man, as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, pastor of the First Baptist Church Buena Park, Calif.,
near Disneyland, also helped spearhead a Southern Baptist boycott
of Disney theme parks and products. Southern Baptists complained
because gays were allowed to have special days in theme parks.
Also, they contend that Disney programming is moving away from
traditional family values.
</P>
<P>
   Drake will also introduce a resolution _ not expected to receive
much support _ urging Southern Baptists not to hold their national
convention in Orlando, Fla., next year because he contends that the
city is too ``gay-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention's executive committee has already rejected
another motion that Southern Baptists not meet in Orlando because
it is the home of Disney World. The committee said it would be too
costly to move the convention because contracts already have been
signed.

FALWELL SEES BUSH AS NEXT PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell is in Atlanta to pray and vote at the
national Southern Baptist Convention this week. And he is singing
the praises of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is our next president,'' Falwell said in an interview
before the opening of the convention Tuesday in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody that could derail Mr. Bush at this
point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell is pastor of the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist
Church in Lynchburg, Va. He has been an independent Baptist most of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern Baptist Convention's turn to conservatism led
him to align with that 15.7-million member group last year as well
as his own. His congregation is sending 10 delegates, called
messengers, to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Falwell will officially be on the program of
the national convention, giving the closing prayer Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken at the Southern Baptist Pastors Conference as a
guest,'' he said, ``but I've never been on the official program. I
consider it an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Southern Baptists will play a major role in the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell expects Vice President Al Gore to be the Democratic
nominee, but predicts that the scandals associated with President
Clinton will sabotage Gore's chances for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore, unlike his boss, who also is a Southern Baptist, is a
man of character,'' Falwell said. ``But I don't think he is capable
of being president. He has the same problem Gerald Ford had'' after
the scandals of the Richard Nixon presidency, in which Ford was
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falwell has other Republican friends seeking the
presidential nomination, including Elizabeth Dole, he said the
polls so far indicate that Bush is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Baptists took part in several pre-convention
events, including a ``crossover'' evangelistic campaign. It
included block parties, door-to-door visitations, magicians on the
street and ``prayer warriors'' who walk through designated
inner-city areas praying for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists also reported that a record $101,713,066 was donated in
the annual Lottie Moon Christmas offering to support overseas
missionary work. The Woman's Missionary Union, meeting in Atlanta
before the main convention, is a major promoter of the annual fund
drive.

`STAR WARS' FANS WANT TO SINK THE `TITANIC'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(A version moved Friday, June 11)  
By BETTY KWONG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the hype had subsided,
``Star Wars'' fans are flooding the Internet with impassioned pleas
to pack the theaters once again.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think George Lucas himself was behind the international
movement, but two Internet site creators operating out of Maryland
are claiming credit for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   June 19, they have proclaimed, will be Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace's'' one-month anniversary, they want devotees to gather
their friends, dress as their favorite characters and go see the
movie over and over again, just like on opening day of the
much-anticipated prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan: Dethrone ``Titanic,'' current king of the box-office
gross chart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lofty goal, considering the movie had only climbed to
11th-highest grosser of all time as of close of business Thursday,
reaping a total of $271.3 million by its 23rd day in theaters.
``Forrest Gump'' and ``Lion King'' were still ahead of the
``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Daoudi, 21, of Tarzana, Calif., is paying no mind to
the movie pundits who have widely declared ``Phantom'' an
attendance dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the movie and believe
in `Star Wars' again _ and try to make it pass `Titanic,''' said
Daoudi, the self-anointed man in charge of Los Angeles' Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce College student is occupying much of his time trying
to spread the word about Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   He's circulating Fan Day fliers. He's making up Fan Day badges
that participants can wear around their necks that day. He's even
tried recruiting toy stores and movie theaters to sponsor and host
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about a phantom menace. Many of his efforts have fallen
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Toy companies aren't interested in supplying free lightsabers to
fans in line. And a disappointed Daoudi discovered last week that
Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, site of all the craze on
opening day, won't even be showing the film anymore by the time Fan
Day arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Mann Theaters, said
taking ``Phantom'' off the schedules at Mann's Chinese and its
Westwood Village locations after June 17 was decided long before
the movie debuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happened, that was just the deal that we
made with Fox,'' said Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The film, she said, met Mann's expectations for attendance, with
long lines waiting to get in at both theaters during the first
week. But the crowds diminished after that, and on Friday, ``The
General's Daughter'' will replace ``Phantom'' on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go, `It's been there long enough. We gotta show other
movies,' '' Daoudi said. ``I go, in my head, `Stupid mooove.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed on, redirecting local fans to celebrate at
Burbank's AMC 14 theater, which is scheduled to begin showing the
film in its new digital format starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   AMC officials, however, are distancing themselves from Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that anything, particularly connected to `Star
Wars,' is a very sensitive issue,'' said Richard Fay, president of
AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said this was the first he'd heard of any individual or
group promoting the movie as an event a month after its opening.
And while the intentions are good, even he had doubts that the
fan-driven campaign could help ``Phantom'' steal ``Titanic's'' top
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea, but they've got a long way to go to
do that,'' Fay said. ``But anything is possible, especially, as
I've learned, when it comes to movies.'' &UR;  &QL;

DISNEY ANIMATORS IMAGINE JUNGLE HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(A version moved Friday, June 11)  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; One of the best-known pop-culture creations of
the 20th century has finally joined forces with the era's top
pop-culture factory.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan _ the jungle hero of 24 Edgar Rice Burroughs books, 47
live-action movies, TV shows, comics and other artifacts too
numerous to mention _ is now the subject of the Walt Disney Co.'s
37th fully animated feature film.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a long-overdue natural, that's because it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three months ago, we got a letter that Burroughs wrote
in 1936 to his son Jack, about a possible animated version of
Tarzan,'' notes producer Bonnie Arnold. ``It said three things: It
has to look naturalistic, it must have a great deal of humor, and
it must approximate Disney excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was an interesting validation of what we'd been
doing,'' she adds. ``But if we'd have seen that letter about three
years ago, when we were first starting, we'd have been totally
intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not like they weren't anyway. Tarzan is known to millions as the
ultimate Ape Man, not big on conversation but one of the all-time
great hollerers. The popular Johnny Weissmuller film series of the
1930s and '40s pretty much fixed the not-so-smart, ``Me Tarzan, you
Jane'' image in the public imagination forevermore.
</P>
<P>
   But those who actually read Burroughs (the initial ``Tarzan of
the Apes'' story was first published in 1912) knew that the King of
the Jungle _ actually a shipwrecked English aristocrat raised from
babyhood by African gorillas _ was a superhuman combination of
animal physical ability and outstanding intelligence. Could both
the Burroughs fans' and the general public's very different
expectations be satisfied in a cartoon that, at the same time,
would appeal to kids with no knowledge of the pulp hero's previous
incarnations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I didn't want to do it at all,'' says co-director
Kevin Lima (``A Goofy Movie''). ``I was actually pretty skeptical
about the material when it was first offered to me. Why make
another movie that has been made, seemingly to me, hundreds of
times? I didn't think there was room for a new Tarzan film that
could speak to contemporary audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I went back and read the book, and I was actually
kind of shocked that the tale that was in the book had really never
been put down on film. I think part of that was because a human
actor could never do half of the things that Burroughs describes.
The next thing I thought was that the movies never really explored
the relationship between Tarzan and the animal world, specifically
the apes, in a satisfying way. That seemed like another reason to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   How to do it was a whole other matter. Anthropomorphic apes and
other creatures would hardly pose a challenge to Disney, whom many
feel reached its animation zenith with its last Africa-set feature,
``The Lion King,'' in 1994. But that was set on semi-arid plains
and hills. What the filmmakers needed was a method of putting their
animals and animal-man in a convincing, primeval rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a naturalistic look, so the audience could relate to
Tarzan's journey a little better,'' explains co-director Chris
Buck. ``We took a research trip to Africa, and being there, in this
three-dimensional world, surrounded by the beautiful, lush jungle,
we were struggling with how we could bring this back to the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the great advances Disney has pioneered over the last
decade, traditional cel animation was still a stubbornly
two-dimensional art form. The solution lay in a new computer
graphics program that Disney dubbed Deep Canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invented a lot of tricks, and we've had a lot of really
interesting, technological breakthroughs at the studio, but we
still weren't getting some of the shots that we really wanted to
get,'' says veteran Disney layout supervisor Daniel St. Pierre, who
served as art director for ``Tarzan.'' ``Especially given that
Tarzan is so mobile and could move through the treetops
effortlessly, it was important to me to be able to take the camera
up there, too, and give the audience a similar kind of experience
to what Tarzan would have.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve his aim, St. Pierre approached CG supervisor Eric
Daniels, whose team then set about the mammoth applied-mathematics
task of developing a program that could change complex forest
dimensions, details and directions as fast as the new, hyper-agile
Tarzan could swing through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process we came up with basically does what a painter
does,'' explains Daniels, who divides his own time between computer
work and traditional pencil drawing. ``A painter creates a painting
by building it up out of hundreds of thousands of brush strokes,
dabbing a little bit of paint there, a bit of green here, then
changing it to slightly bluer or darker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rendering software repaints those brush strokes over and
over, hundreds of times _ but each time it paints them slightly
differently. It paints this stroke a little over to the left
because that tree is moving past us, or that stroke up a little bit
because that leaf is moving up at that particular moment. So when
you see the `Tarzan' backgrounds moving in three dimensions, you're
actually seeing hundreds of individual paintings that were created
using this software.''
</P>
<P>
   That was only the environment. For the main attraction, Tarzan
himself, the filmmakers sought out Disney's most accomplished
character animator of the modern era, Glen Keane. After bringing
the likes of the Little Mermaid, ``Beauty's'' Beast, Aladdin and
Pocahontas to screen life, Keane had taken a well-deserved
sabbatical in Paris, where he spent a year studying the great
masters and anatomy drawing.
</P>
<P>
   He had essentially decided to stay with his family in the French
capital when team ``Tarzan'' came calling. But the chance to work
on a childhood favorite was too hard to resist. (Keane ended up
enjoying the best of both worlds; while most of the movie was
animated in Burbank, he supervised Tarzan's animation at Disney's
Paris studio). &UR;  &QL; 
( &LR; SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The artist's father, ``Family Circus'' cartoonist Bill Keane,
had taught his son how to draw using the influential ``Dynamic
Anatomy'' book by Burne Hogarth, one of the outstanding artists who
drew the ``Tarzan'' newspaper comic strip. The youthful Keane was
also such a big fan of fantasy painter Frank Frazetta that he never
got around to reading his paperback copy of ``Tarzan of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'd try to read the book, I couldn't resist the
temptation to try to draw that great Frazetta cover,'' Keane
recalls. So he, too, was startled when he finally got around to
reading Burroughs in preparation for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that this guy was going to be a lot of fun to do,''
Keane notes, ``because the only way to bring him to life was by
going through the process myself, mentally, that Tarzan had to to
learn to move and to survive, and to base all of your movements on
animal study.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and skateboarding. Keane not only raided his own
childhood memories for Tarzan's look; his own son, Max, inspired
the animated ape man's need-for-speed manner of locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been looking at Johnny Weissmuller swinging on the vine
and realized that that was not the way I wanted Tarzan to move,''
Keane reveals. ``It was a passive way of moving through the jungle;
the vine does all the work, and he hangs on. It's also just lateral
movement across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something where Tarzan could be more active,
aggressive, attacking the jungle. At the same time, my son was
skateboarding all the time across from the Eiffel Tower at a place
called the Trocadero. All the kids did it there, and they never did
it on anything flat. It was always angles, something dangerous that
could break your arm. He was coming home with these bloody knees,
and I said, `Max, why are you doing this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, it's fun,' and it just clicked for me. In all
these extreme sports videos that he'd been bringing home, there was
this thrill in the adrenaline rush that was the fun that they were
looking for. And for Tarzan to move through the trees, it couldn't
be just the getting from Point A to Point B; it had to be the
getting there was the fun for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Tarzan swings in every which direction using every limb
God gave him, and surfs along gnarly, moss-covered branches like he
was shooting the curl at Zuma.
</P>
<P>
   But although the visual aspects of ``Tarzan'' are its most
memorable elements, much more was required to make it into a mass
Disney entertainment. Voice casting was, of course, crucial. Tony
Goldwyn (``Ghost'') provided the adult Tarzan's alternately
articulate and grunting voice. He also did a pretty good job of
approximating the signature Weissmuller Tarzan yell _ with a little
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whole big deal trying to get the yell just right, we
kept going back and forth,'' Goldwyn admits. ``It's mainly my
voice, but they helped it electronically by extending it. I think
they may even have other voices in there, like opera singers
helping with the yodel.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver essays Tarzan's spunky English love interest Jane,
Glenn Close and Lance Henriksen voice his gorilla ``parents,'' and
Rosie O'Donnell is his comic ape pal, Terk. The film's musical
numbers, which are mostly played over montages rather than ``sung''
by the characters, were produced and performed by crooning drummer
Phil Collins, who was chosen specifically for his percussive sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balancing the tone of the film was probably the most difficult
thing that we did,'' admits director Lima. ``Because you have,
basically, three elements: the drama, the comedy and the
action-adventure. All three of them have to be perfectly balanced
in order for it to feel like one texture. You don't want the
sidekicks to suddenly take over the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Burroughs fans are wary of potential
over-Disneyfication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, animation can portray Tarzan interacting with
animals more intimately and can create ideal backdrops, especially
when you're talking about a fantasy Africa,'' respected Burroughs
authority James Van Hise acknowledges. ``But a fully animated
feature is inevitably going to have more comedy elements in it,
which seems to be considered a necessity to balance out any of the
serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert, while noting that some compromises have been made,
is nevertheless thrilled by how true Disney's ``Tarzan'' is to the
spirit of the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The live movies magnificently lacked my grandfather's
characters and his action and a lot of the elements that he made
famous in the books, and it just frustrated the daylights out of
him,'' says Danton Burroughs. ``This movie brings Tarzan back up to
the heroic, articulate stature that he always should have had. This
is the most fantastic portrayal of Tarzan that, I think, the public
will ever have seen.''

TEEN THRIVES IN FISHBOWL OF MTV'S `REAL WORLD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: The season premiere is Tuesday, June 15 at 10 p.m. on MTV). 
(A version moved Friday, June 11)  
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seven attractive, co-ed roommates get chosen to
live in a ridiculously plush house in Hawaii _ landscaped with its
own pool and mini ``volcano'' _ for three months. Their only job?
To be TV stars and run a ``cafe and performance space.'' Par-tay!
</P>
<P>
   That's what Colin, a 19-year-old Thousand Oaks, Calif., native
figured when he tried out for MTV's ``The Real World,'' the
(ITALICS BEGIN)video verite(ITALICS END) program that throws seven
college-age people together in a different location each season.
The show returns 10 p.m. Tuesday with a one-hour special (regular
half-hour episodes run weekly at the same time).
</P>
<P>
   Colin (the cast isn't permitted to give out their last names
during the show's run) failed to make the cut the first time
around, along with 23,000 other hopefuls. According to MTV, that's
27 percent more young adults than applied to Harvard last year.
</P>
<P>
   As a consolation prize, he was tapped to host a TV special about
the casting of the show. Bummer ... but at least, he figured, he'd
get some on-camera experience from that gig. After all, he's an
aspiring sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   But during the taping, the outgoing student's personality won
over the program's producers, who decided to reverse their decision
and give Colin a berth on ``The Real World.'' Colin was elated: On
the show's first episode, we see him collapse in a joyous frenzy
with a friend just after getting the news.
</P>
<P>
   Colin, though, ended up getting a lot more than he bargained
for. One of his roommates turned out to have an alcohol problem so
serious it landed her in the emergency room; another left the show
early, for a variety of reasons including just being tired of
living under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Colin, who turned out to be the youngest of this year's group,
admits he wasn't prepared for the experience of being constantly
on-camera with a bunch of strangers thrown together from all
different backgrounds. His roommates included Amaya, a 21-year-old
UCLA graduate; Justin, also 21, a child prodigy already in his
second year at Harvard Law School; Chicago native Kaia, 22, a fan
of fitness and African culture; Matt, a 22-year-old Del Mar native
looking for love; Ruthie, 21, whose alcoholism apparently stems
from a painful childhood in a foster home in Hawaii; and Teck, 22,
a minister's son-cum-ladies' man who aspires to a career in
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really went into this process naively, as most people
probably do. I figured it would be nice to have a break from school
and to just be on the show,'' admitted Colin, now a student at UC
Berkeley, in a phone interview from Hawaii. ``You really learn
quickly that it's a total loss of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the appeal for MTV viewers, who have made
``The Real World'' the cable channel's top-rated show. It's also
been the top-rated show on basic cable for its time slot among
young adults for the past several years. Part soap opera, part
therapy session, ``The Real World'' has become a real-life
``Melrose Place'' for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a cast member finds he can't take living in a
glass house. This year, Justin, the 21-year-old law student, who is
active in gay causes, ended up jumping ship. Jonathan Murray, one
of the show's executive producers, says Justin ended up being
``uncomfortable'' with the show's process and regretted having
joined the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Murray says that from early on, they've sought out cast members
who didn't have acting aspirations _ part of a drive to keep the
show more diverse and unstaged. Still, the series has spawned a few
show-biz careers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nies went on from the show's first season to appear on
MTV's exercise show, ``The Grind,'' and host a series of popular
``Grind'' videos. Jacinda Barrett, a cast member of season four in
London, has gotten major television acting jobs, including on NBC's
``Wind and Water.'' Jason Cornwell, who appeared on the Boston
``Real World'' two years ago, has become an associate casting
director for the show. Also, a number of young people who have been
``rejects'' for the show have ended up working for ``The Real
World's'' production company, Van Nuys-based Bunim/Murray
Productions (see related story).
</P>
<P>
   Colin admits the show could help him in his ambition to go into
sports broadcasting. ``I knew it couldn't hurt, though that wasn't
the main reason I wanted to be on the show,'' he said. ``Of
course,'' he added, ``I also thought about the possible backlash.
... If you come off looking like a complete freak, it could end up
hurting you.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Colin couldn't have bargained for was becoming
romantically involved with one of his housemates. He and Amaya, a
blond Oakland native, launched what MTV terms in a press release
``the first-ever serious romance between two of the roommates.''
Despite the fact that the show's producers make a policy of bowing
out if two of their young charges start ``getting busy,'' the
couple found the scrutiny a strain on their budding relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Colin graciously allows that ``I would really like to keep in
touch with her ... I can say we'll stay in contact.'' But the
couple admits the pressure of not really conducting their
relationship in the ``real world'' probably took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, Colin says he's glad he did the show. ``It
turned out to be some of the best of times and the worst of times
I've been through,'' he says philosophically. ``I don't think
there's anything in the world I can liken this experience to. It's
very unique.'' &QL;

THERE'S MORE TO EDDIE IZZARD THAN WOMEN'S CLOTHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(A version moved Friday, June 11)  
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ About midway through ``Eddie Izzard: Dress to
Kill,'' you start looking at the British comedian's face and think,
``That really is very nice makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, Izzard is a transvestite, an ``executive transvestite''
as he is fond of saying, who also points out that he likes girls.
He describes his particular lifestyle choice of cross-dressing as
``male lesbianism.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though he does his ``running, jumping, standing still''
bit at the beginning to prove he can navigate on platform shoes,
that or his painted nails or his colorful Chinese jacket or frosted
hair have little to do with his humor. Or the fact that he is one
of the funniest stand-up comedians working today. Former Monty
Python member John Cleese has called him ``the funniest man in
England,'' but with this HBO special, he has staked a claim to both
sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed last September at San Francisco's Stage Door Theatre,
``Dress to Kill'' shows off the facile mind of Izzard, who slips
from the ironic to the silly to the hilarious with the greatest of
ease.
</P>
<P>
   That would make him interesting enough, but consider the topics:
druids, the Inquisition, the American Revolution, the Killing
Fields, violence in schools, original sin, the Church of England
and squirrels. OK, the Church of England and squirrels are
inherently funny, but Izzard manages to make this odd mix flow.
More than flow _ interconnect in unexpected ways by slyly
referencing an earlier joke or a topic.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard takes pleasure in poking fun at Americans' lack of
knowledge about history, particularly their own. After doing an
amusing impression of how the French in films about the American
Revolution are portrayed as friends of Lafayette, he turns to the
audience and smirks, ``You don't know who he is, do you? What is
it? The Spanish-American War? The French Banana War? What?'' Or he
gives hilarious instructions on how to sing the national anthem
when you don't know the words.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's being topical, as when he talks about gun control
(remember, this was taped before Littleton) or perjury, Izzard
takes an unusual tack. If we can have different degrees of murder,
why not perjury, he reasons. ``Perjury one is when you say there's
no Holocaust. Perjury nine is when you said you shagged someone
when you didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And Izzard has that cheeky, British wickedness in humor that
keeps you off guard, such as at the end of his bits on Engelbert
Humperdinck or when talking about the first women he nearly slept
with (we won't spoil the jokes).
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what Izzard takes on, he's consistently smart,
funny, surprising and fabulous. Did we mention his bit on the Roman
Empire? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (``Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill'' shows on HBO Saturday, June 12
at 11:30; and repeats at midnight Tuesday, June 15; 3:30 a.m.
Friday, June 18; 10 p.m. June 21, 9 p.m. June 24 and 2:45 a.m. July
4). &QL;

`CONNECTIONS' HOST GOES ON SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(A version moved Friday, June 11)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you created a book that mirrored the way many
of us seek information on the World Wide Web, it might end up
reading a lot like James Burke's latest tome, ``The Knowledge Web''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 262 pages; $25).
</P>
<P>
   Burke wrote and hosted the PBS TV series ``The Day the Universe
Changed'' and ``Connections'' (``Connections 3'' is now on The
Learning Channel) and created a fun computer game of the same name
a few years back. Now he's taking another traipse through the pages
of scientific and cultural history with ``The Knowledge Web.''
</P>
<P>
   As with previous books such as ``The Pinball Effect'' and, of
course, ``Connections,'' Burke bounces freely across the centuries,
tying together technological developments and their cultural,
economic and political impacts with other seemingly unrelated
topics in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The book's subtitle _ ``From Electronic Agents to Stonehenge and
Back _ and Other Journeys Through Knowledge'' _ gives some idea of
its dizzying breadth.
</P>
<P>
   The result can be remarkably non-linear, hop-scotching across
two dozen developments in a few pages, highlighting interesting
figures from history briefly before heading on to another one. From
Kellogg's Corn Flakes to Coleridge, corn cobs to carborundum, he
traces ties across time that prove intriguing and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Burke further encourages this Web-like approach with a primitive
sort of hypertext that he calls ``gateways.'' Every so often, a
pair of numbers will appear next to a term, showing where a
connection can be found elsewhere in the book for readers
interested in pursuing a different tangent than whatever direction
Burke chose in organizing his writing.
</P>
<P>
   You can jump through the gateways, or stick with Burke's
meandering story line, depending on your bent. And if you've got a
slow Internet connection, you'll definitely be able to hop across
Burke's gateways faster than you could surf the Web. Plus, with a
book, you can read it on a really high-resolution, easily portable
``flat screen. ''
</P>
<P>
   GUIDING LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Good news for gaming fans online. The same folks who brought us
the truly wonderful All-Music Guide (at www.allmusic.com) have
created the All-Game Guide (at www.allgame.com) with obvious
ambitions to be just as all-encompassing.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Music Guide has long been one of the best resources
(both online and in a series of terrific books) for learning more
about musicians of all kinds and the music they've created.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Game Guide is similar in its ambitious reach, with
information broken down by a dozen kinds of game genres and nearly
50 platforms, stretching all the way back to the very earliest, now
long-dead consoles (Pong, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   You can search by company (Electronic Arts, unsurprisingly,
generates a massive list), by character and much more.
</P>
<P>
   There's great trivia here: Nintendo's Mario surfaced in 1981 as
Jumpman, in another game. But he got a new name and his own
starring role when then-president of Nintendo of America Minoru
Arakawa said the character looked a lot like his Italian landlord,
Mario Segali.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has reviews, codes and cheats, difficulty ratings
and more for specific games. Its creators still have some
substantial work to do because many games lack much or any
information, and areas like a guide to notable video-gaming leaders
haven't yet been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   But the folks behind the All-Music Guide (the general home page
has been cannily renamed the All-Media Guide to include sister
sites for movies and classical music) built their prodigious
database of information by relying on the qualitative input of
thousands of fans.
</P>
<P>
   As with the All-Music Guide, a player will be able to provide
reviews and other information that will help shape how the game is
rated, and give other players a sense of its gameplay.
</P>
<P>
   The more that happens, the more worthwhile the site. In time,
this could be a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   CHARGE IT
</P>
<P>
   If your child's Game Boy is devouring batteries at an alarming
rate, which it no doubt is if Pokemon or some other all-consuming
title is in the house, here's a nifty answer to the battery dollar
drain: an attachable, rechargeable power pack that wraps around the
game machine for up to 22 hours of non-stop use.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Buddy from Battery Technologies Inc. also doubles as a
night light when you plug it in to recharge, giving off a soft
glow. (Of course, the night light may just be a beacon of trouble
for an ought-to-be-sleeping child).
</P>
<P>
   The Game Buddy uses built-in rechargable alkaline manganese
batteries, which the company says will last for at least 2,000
hours, saving you a ton of money over the daily Duracell dose.
</P>
<P>
   I love this product's design, which about doubles the thickness
of a Game Boy Pocket but still allows access to all the important
ports.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has just released a version of the Game Buddy
for the fatter Game Boy Color, though I've not seen it yet. For
more information, check out BTI's Web site at www.game-buddy.com.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft began its promotional blitz for the latest update of
its Office software package this week. Trust me, you'll hear plenty
about it elsewhere from the vaunted MS publicity machine.
</P>
<P>
   For those who've been avoiding this kind of thing, however,
Office 2000 includes Word, Excel and Powerpoint, along with one or
more publishing and Internet programs, depending on which edition
you get.
</P>
<P>
   The entire thing is tightly integrated with soon-to-come
versions of Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer 5.0, and
operating system, Windows 2000, which makes it easier to use, but
no doubt will make Microsoft's anti-trust trial more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a small-time business or home user, do you really
need to spend close to $200 to upgrade to the relevant editions of
this software? Probably not, and certainly not right away, a
refrain we've sung before regarding Microsoft upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Office 2000's biggest benefits will pertain to people
working in large corporations trying to share information with each
other, particularly over Web sites both inside the company and
across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That said, like remoras clinging to a really big shark, other
software companies already are releasing add-on software designed
to expand what Office 2000 does. One such company is Streetwise
Software, which has two packages that work with both Office 97 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Office Letters 2000 provides a series of electronic guides to
writing better, along with a raft of stock letters for your
business and personal needs. It's just the sort of thing small
companies and work-at-home types can most use, given their
typically slender resources. The package also comes with 500 fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Office Graphics 2000 packages some of Streetwise's fine
Professor Franklin graphics and photo editing tools with tons of
clip art, fonts and design templates for all three of Office's main
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes Art Alive 3D!, an art program with
more than 500 3-D models that you can manipulate, dress up and drop
into your documents. All told, this is a sort of odds-and-ends
package of nifty little stuff that fills out some areas Microsoft
somehow overlooked. &QL;

   PODUJEVO _ 'Twas not a famous victory. And as we followed the
Yugoslav Third Army out of northern Kosovo Thursday and saw all the
young men who would have fought _ and died _ in their battle with
equally young British and Americans and French and Italians, a
terrible reality dawned upon the Serb people.
</P>
<P>
   They stood by the road, weeping and giving the retreating
soldiers the three-fingered victory salute of Serbia _ and then
they went to their homes, many of them, and packed their bedding
onto the roofs of their cars and drove away behind their soldiers
with their stiff-faced, grieving families.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the start of the Third Army's withdrawal, but it was
real enough; a juggernaut of supply trucks and armored personnel
carriers and busloads of troops and ambulances and Praga
antiaircraft gun-trucks and truckloads of soldiers in steel helmets
draped with plastic camouflage leaves.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier left with his German shepherd dog sitting beside him
in the cab of his truck, another with a photograph of old Marshal
Tito pinned to the back of his troop carrier, the founder of the
Yugoslav National Army standing at his desk in a blue suit in a
Yugoslavia long lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not Milosevic, but Tito.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Belgrade, of course, when the joy-shooting and fireworks
had died down, the pro-Milosevic television was celebrating a
``victory'' which had been achieved _ wait for it _ ``thanks to the
peaceful policy of our President, Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive victory this, it seems, like the victory of Mark
Antony at Actium, of Custer at the Little Big Horn, like Rommel's
victory at El Alamein.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs of Kosovo _ for the tens of thousands of decent,
worthy Serbs who are not war criminals or militiamen _ it is a
tragedy of epic proportions. And for the Albanians _ deliverance,
or political betrayal?
</P>
<P>
   As we threaded our way through the 15 mile-long convoy of
Yugoslav armor and trucks humming up the highway to Raca, there was
time enough to reflect on Serbia's defeat after almost three months
of NATO air raids, after thousands of Serb deaths _ 1,600 of them
civilians _ and after the loss in action of not a single NATO
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   We drove with these soldiers through valleys and gentle fields
that might have been Kent were it not for the burned houses amid
the fields of crimson poppies.
</P>
<P>
   One home in Podujevo _ a ghost town of smashed Albanian houses
and shops with a clutch of terrified Serb civilians at a street
corner _ was still smoldering, set alight, I suspect, by four ugly,
shaven-headed, bearded men we saw in a white car.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers didn't look like the ``degraded'' army of
NATO-speak. Their soldiers smiled and gave the three-fingered
salute and sat chatting or sleeping in their trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Prizren Brigade of the Third Army were in full camouflage
kit, their faces bronzed by days in the sun and long nights in the
open. And not a single vehicle _ not a single truck or Praga or
personnel carrier _ had a single scratch on it, not even a bullet
hole.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO's bombs were destroying the Yugoslav Third Army, then a
lot of the Third Army had kept a lot of their kit and troops in
perfect condition. They left, most of them, not as a rabble but as
soldiers withdrawing in good order.
</P>
<P>
   And they would, I think, have fought had NATO come. Goran, a
young army doctor from Nis to whom I gave a lift on the way back to
Pristina _ his departure will come later - said that his greatest
concern had been KLA guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of my four best friends at Podujevo, one was shot dead by the
KLA ten days ago, another wounded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Serbia and the KLA never respected this. It is my
opinion that we should not be leaving here like this, that we
should not be withdrawing. We should have fought.''
</P>
<P>
   And he pulled out his wallet and produced every soldier's dream:
a photograph of a beautiful child with brown hair sitting on a
chair. ``She is my first daughter, Miljana, and she is just 18
months old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought of other family snapshots I had seen in Kosovo, in
the ``cleansed'' Albanian villages and beside the road to
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Here on this very road upon which I was driving, the
Independent's Albanian interpreter had undergone her moment of
terror just seven weeks ago. And all those gutted homes among the
poppy fields have created a terrible legacy of contempt as well as
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Most accounts talk of execution and rape by the paramilitaries
and by the drunken ``White Eagles'' gunmen from the Drina River.
</P>
<P>
   But those murderers contaminated _ if only by association _
every Serb who held a gun in Kosovo. And that includes the Yugoslav
army. I know Yugoslav soldiers who have been sickened by these
crimes. But they could not _ or did not _ stop them. &QL;

<P>
   Military officers were talking Thursday of 800 arrests of
paramilitary men by the Serb authorities, of sentences of up to 20
years for murder. They talked of one Serb gunmen sentenced for
killing an Albanian family of 15.
</P>
<P>
   A bit late, I thought. And I'd like to know more about all those
court cases and all that Serb justice meted out to the killers of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs of Kosovo tried to give their soldiers their support
as they drove away from Serbia's most sacred soil. On a road
bridge, someone had strung a banner which said: ``We live for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   At Luzane, the Prizren Brigade fired into the air with their
hundreds of Kalashnikov rifles, a spray of golden cartridge cases
falling like rain through the brown dust of the trucks. One army
truck carried a photograph of a young and half-naked woman on its
hood.
</P>
<P>
   Another bore the red, white and blue flag of Yugoslavia. A
pretty Yugoslav female soldier sat in the back of one truck, her
blonde braids hanging over her tunic. &QL;

   At one point on the highway, three Albanian women in scarves
watched the Third Army in retreat. Thanks to NATO, these soldiers
are going. Thanks to NATO, those three women will no longer have
the chance of independence from Serbia in three years' time _ as
they were led to believe after March's Paris ``peace'' talks. For
them, too, this may not prove a famous victory. &QL;

   Yugoslavia's heavy armor and tanks and antiaircraft missiles
will be hauled up this road in the coming days and then will come
the Serb police and the paramilitaries (those of the latter who
have not already made it back to what is now called ``Serbia
proper'').
</P>
<P>
   There will follow, too, the thousands of Serbs who are
abandoning the land of their fathers, just as the Serbs fled
Krajina and eastern Croatia and eastern Bosnia. I saw them
Thursday, their little Yugo cars hugging the back of the last
convoy from Pristina, women in the back, men crammed in the front.
</P>
<P>
   The world is not going to care about their dispossession. Serve
them right, the world will say.
</P>
<P>
   And what message will they take with them to Nis and Novi Sad
and Kraljevo and Belgrade and the other bombed cities of Serbia?.
</P>
<P>
   I came across a smart young machine-gunner guarding his army's
main supply route in the shadow of an ancient Serbian church
Thursday . His black beret and camouflage tunic and webbing were
spotless, his English almost as clean.
</P>
<P>
   How did he feel, I asked? ``I am a soldier,'' he replied. ``And
I do not have political views.'' Oh but you do, I said to myself.
You do. &QL;

   PODUJEVO _ 'Twas not a famous victory. And as we followed the
Yugoslav Third Army out of northern Kosovo Thursday and saw all the
young men who would have fought _ and died _ in their battle with
equally young British and Americans and French and Italians, a
terrible reality dawned upon the Serb people.
</P>
<P>
   They stood by the road, weeping and giving the retreating
soldiers the three-fingered victory salute of Serbia _ and then
they went to their homes, many of them, and packed their bedding
onto the roofs of their cars and drove away behind their soldiers
with their stiff-faced, grieving families.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the start of the Third Army's withdrawal, but it was
real enough; a juggernaut of supply trucks and armored personnel
carriers and busloads of troops and ambulances and Praga
antiaircraft gun-trucks and truckloads of soldiers in steel helmets
draped with plastic camouflage leaves.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier left with his German shepherd dog sitting beside him
in the cab of his truck, another with a photograph of old Marshal
Tito pinned to the back of his troop carrier, the founder of the
Yugoslav National Army standing at his desk in a blue suit in a
Yugoslavia long lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not Milosevic, but Tito.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Belgrade, of course, when the joy-shooting and fireworks
had died down, the pro-Milosevic television was celebrating a
``victory'' which had been achieved _ wait for it _ ``thanks to the

</P>

   An exclusive victory this, it seems, like the victory of Mark

<P>
   PRISTINA _ So, ``Wag the Dog'' was a documentary. ``The Russians
are coming,'' a Yugoslav army captain announced to the coffee
drinkers on the Corso in Pristina Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They roared in delight and disbelief. But it was quite beyond
their comprehension that NATO forces would delay their own entry
into Kosovo over an infantile squabble about whose soldiers should
cross the frontier first.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, of course, the innocent who had to pay the price for
this farce.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Catholic church, an Albanian priest shook his head
in disbelief. ``Why hasn't NATO come?'' he pleaded. ``Things here
are very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the hill, a clutch of Albanian homes were
smoldering. And in the streets of Pristina Friday there were too
many men with guns. One of them walked into the restaurant of the
Grand Hotel on Thursday night and threatened to kill the diners.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred KLA captives were seen wandering through the city,
still dressed in their black prison uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   And the roads around Kosovo's capital were lined with civilian
cars as the Serbs of Prizren and Djakovica _ trusting in a KLA
cease-fire _ abandoned their cities for northern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what NATO wants,'' Yugoslav volunteer Private Stefan said
with contempt when I came across him near the Army club. ``They are
delaying so that the Serbs will leave and give them an
Albanian-only Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is `cleansing' us with their delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I have the nerve to explain that no, really, NATO Generals
Wesley Clark and `Mike' Jackson were rowing like children about who
goes first? I murmured something I'd heard on the BBC about
``logistics difficulties'' and Private Stefan snorted with
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as NATO hesitated _ only to find the Russians stealing their
thunder _ Kosovo was moving towards just the kind of anarchy NATO
had promised to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   When I drove the road north to Merdare Friday, the villages were
burning _ either Serb homes set alight by their departing owners or
Albanian property destroyed by Serb gunmen _ while the Third Army's
withdrawal sucked thousands of panic-stricken civilians into its
wake.
</P>
<P>
   The old city of Prizren is almost entirely empty of its Serb
inhabitants _ almost every car I saw bore a Prizren or Djakovica
license plate _ while the Serb citizens of Pristina are turning
with bitterness against their own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of civilians called to halt the exodus, a tall man
in spectacles screamed at his fellow Serbs: ``You've been (screwed)
by Tito and by Milosevic _ may their descendants have bone cancer
for 12 generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along the highway out of Pristina appeared the kind
of men we had hoped not to see.
</P>
<P>
   There were tall militiamen with long hair and gunmen in black
shirts, and even the departing Yugoslav troops now displayed an
unhappy combination of regular soldiers in army uniform and bearded
men in military vehicles with slouch hats or cloths wound around
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier was waving a beer bottle in the air. Several were
driving tractors among the army convoys, pulling trailers covered
with tarpaulins. Who, I wonder, owned the tractors?
</P>
<P>
   The convoys themselves were a Boys Own of Russian weaponry, BMP
armored vehicles, tracked radar-guided antiaircraft guns and
batteries of white-tipped SAM-6 surface-to-air missiles along with
FROG ground-to-ground rockets.
</P>
<P>
   And yet again, not a single one had been scratched by NATO
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the SAM-6 racks were empty _ the missiles must have been
fired at NATO planes _ and many of them were still covered with the
branches of the fir trees with which they had been camouflaged
during the war. Several guns had been draped with flowers, one
antiaircraft battery sprouting dark red roses from its barrels.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Serbs enjoyed Moscow's temerity in tweaking NATO's
ego, they waited in vain for the Russians to show up. It mattered
little to the families driving north, towing trailers piled with
living-room furniture and beds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the highway, a new banner has been raised. ``The only road
is the road to Kosovo,'' it says. But Friday, the only road was the
road out of Kosovo _ and the Serbs were using it to flee the land
in which they have lived for generations. &QL;

   PRISTINA _ So, ``Wag the Dog'' was a documentary. ``The Russians
are coming,'' a Yugoslav army captain announced to the coffee
drinkers on the Corso in Pristina Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They roared in delight and disbelief. But it was quite beyond
their comprehension that NATO forces would delay their own entry
into Kosovo over an infantile squabble about whose soldiers should
cross the frontier first.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, of course, the innocent who had to pay the price for
this farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what NATO wants,'' Yugoslav volunteer Private Stefan said
with contempt when I came across him near the Army club. ``They are
delaying so that the Serbs will leave and give them an
Albanian-only Kosovo.
</P>

   PODUJEVO _ 'Twas not a famous victory. And as we followed the
Yugoslav Third Army out of northern Kosovo Thursday and saw all the
young men who would have fought _ and died _ in their battle with
equally young British and Americans and French and Italians, a
terrible reality dawned upon the Serb people.
</P>
<P>
   They stood by the road, weeping and giving the retreating
soldiers the three-fingered victory salute of Serbia _ and then
they went to their homes, many of them, and packed their bedding
onto the roofs of their cars and drove away behind their soldiers
with their stiff-faced, grieving families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs of Kosovo _ for the tens of thousands of decent,
worthy Serbs who are not war criminals or militiamen _ it is a
tragedy of epic proportions. And for the Albanians _ deliverance,
or political betrayal?... &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin thought there never was a good war, nor a bad
peace. Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and the other leaders of the West
thought it could be otherwise. They launched the first war in
history said to be in pursuit of principle, not interest.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that they had never intended to do more than
drop a few bombs. Then, when a few bombs proved inadequate, they
found they had stumbled into a war they did not mean to fight, had
not prepared to fight and were not willing to fight, at least with
men who might get killed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the stuff of nobility. The Kosovo war turned out, as
wars generally do, a mess. The peace, if that is what the deal
finally signed on June 9 brings, looks little better.
</P>
<P>
   The first shortcoming is that the West, whatever its
protestations, has not won a clear-cut victory. It resorted to
force, remember, to make Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
accept the terms he had rejected at the French chateau of
Rambouillet in February.
</P>
<P>
   He had balked in particular at two conditions: that NATO should
have the free run not just of Kosovo, but of all of Serbia, and
that within three years the Kosovars should have the chance of
voting for independence.
</P>
<P>
   These may have been foolish conditions to try to impose on
Serbia; had the West never set them, it might not have mattered
much that they have now been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were set, and their abandonment means Milosevic
may legitimately claim at least a partial vindication of his
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO's victory lacks shine, however, it is because of the
cost at which it has come and, above all, the distribution of that
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The death figures tell their own tale: allied servicemen, nil;
Serb soldiers, perhaps 6,000; Serb civilians, perhaps 2,000;
Kosovars, perhaps 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   To these must be added the wounded and the refugees: 600,000
displaced within Kosovo, 800,000 driven out. Many of those will
never return home, if only because they now have no home to return
to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the blame for most of these deaths and displacements
lies with Milosevic, not NATO. But not for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the genuine mistakes, any dispassionate accounting of
the conflict is almost certain to find the allies guilty of some
terrible crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the elegant trituration of targets in Serbia, the
destruction of bridges, the incapacitation of power stations,
however necessary in war, when carried out night after night from
the safety of the skies seemed to turn the bombing into a horrible
high-tech coconut shy.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest reason for questioning the nature of the allies'
triumph, however, was its central failure: this was a war to stop
ethnic cleansing, but the main effect was to intensify it.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign accelerated the killing _ to more than
2,000-3,000 people had died in the province before the bombing
began, quite a few at the hands of Kosovar guerrillas _ and it
accelerated the emptying of the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   In humanitarian terms, the Kosovo campaign turned into a
disaster. Whether that disaster can now be mitigated may depend on
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his claims of victory, for the Serb people as a whole
the war has been a catastrophe. If they can get rid of him,
establish a democracy and settle down to live in peace with their
neighbors, then the prospects not just in Kosovo but in the region
as a whole look much brighter.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, though, is certain. For the moment, at least,
Milosevic is still in charge, still in a position to frustrate
progress towards peace and, because he is now officially wanted for
war crimes, still with a motive to defy the West.
</P>
<P>
   How nice if someone could nab him and have him put on trial.
Unfortunately, the allies' apparently opportunistic release of
evidence about him that made his indictment possible has also made
the war-crimes tribunal seem less than independent. That could be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting peace will be even harder to establish in the Balkans
without an unambiguously impartial court that can bring the
region's many war criminals to book.
</P>
<P>
   A compromised court, however, is not the only difficulty ahead
for the allies. To the costs of reconstruction and resettlement
must be added the cost of garrisoning this new corner of
ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is already a protectorate in all but name, and likely to
remain so for many years. Kosovo will be in NATO's hands for just
as long. Serbia itself is likely to stay turbulent, its hard-liners
truculent.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the dropping of more explosives than in any other 11
weeks in history, the Serb army remains potent: relatively few of
its men have been killed, a formidable proportion of its armor,
artillery and mobile air-defense systems is still intact.
</P>
<P>
   Though this may be consistent with Clinton's avowed aim of
reducing Serbia's ability to attack Kosovo's civilians, it is not
impressive. The main job will lie with the incoming peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, as some are claiming, has the bombing opened a new chapter
in the history of warfare by showing that air power alone can
produce victory.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last two weeks of the fighting, when the kamikaze
tactics of the Kosovar guerrillas flushed the Serbs' armor into the
open and rendered it vulnerable to NATO's strikes, the infamous
Serb army had escaped serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kosovo is now inviolate, Serb troops could still be
used, say, to suppress Montenegro, the last Yugoslav republic still
yoked to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   One day, several years off, a grand conference of interested
parties may be able to redraw the map of the Balkans with the
consent of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The hope will be that by then the West will have tied the
now-volatile countries of the region to its clubs _ the European
Union, NATO and so on _ and made them at least see the merits of
good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   With generosity, luck and a fair wind, that might reduce the
volatility, but it would be foolish to imagine that ancient
animosities will by then be entirely dead, or that recent upheavals
will be forgotten. Many of the refugees of the 1990s will still be
displaced. More transfers of population will probably have to
follow, peacefully, it must be hoped.
</P>
<P>
   And has the Kosovo war made even a distant settlement more
likely? Yes, despite the awful cost, if only because such a
settlement would have been less likely had Milosevic been allowed
to expel the Kosovars without any resistance from the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   That he would have tried to do so seems almost certain: fully
35,000 people, maybe more, had already fled the province in the
months before the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   The West could surely not have just turned its back on such an
outrage. But it could have shown itself ready to drive the Serbs
back by fighting on the ground as well as from the air.
</P>
<P>
   If it now confronts a messy war and a messy peace, it is largely
because it resorted to force with such inadequate preparation. &QL;

<P>
   Most workers today have had a pay raise every year of their
working life _ and most assume they always will.
</P>
<P>
   But contrast this with a century ago. In 1900 the average weekly
wage of an American worker was $9.30 a week, exactly what it had
been 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The result of ruthless capitalists exploiting defenseless
workers? No, for this happened at a time of falling prices: real
wages actually rose by almost 40 percent over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Before the First World War, prices and wages seldom rose
continuously; instead they were broadly stable over long periods.
The annual pay raise is an invention of the late 1950s, when
inflation first became persistent.
</P>
<P>
   With prices stable or falling in many industries in many
countries, that invention is looking stale.
</P>
<P>
   In macroeconomic terms, many rich industrial economies are
within sight of price stability. The average rate of consumer-price
inflation in the G7 economies is running at 1 percent, its lowest
for half a century. And central banks seem determined to keep it
there.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's inflation is higher than most, and America may also be
an exception: there are hints that inflation there may be reviving.
But the Federal Reserve will almost certainly raise rates soon to
put the lid back on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most important changes are those affecting individual
industries and companies. Even if general inflation revives or
remains positive, prices are falling in some industries.
</P>
<P>
   This is forcing managers who have been reared on decades of
inflation to rethink some of their old ways of doing business. In
particular, the case for a general annual pay raise, tied to
consumer-price inflation, is vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   A periodic pay review is welcomed by many managers: it is easier
than an ad hoc approach, and is less liable to cause conflict and
jealousy. But there is no reason why it should be annual,
especially in industries where prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees feel differently. Trade unions in particular
might feel undermined. Moreover, people like an annual pay raise
even if it provides no real gain. In other words, they suffer from
money illusion.
</P>
<P>
   When inflation was 10 percent, people felt good about getting a
10 percent pay raise; in hard times they might even have accepted a
7 percent raise _ a 3 percent cut in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   But when inflation is close to zero, a pay freeze is regarded as
an insult, even if it leaves living standards unchanged. And since
it is hard to cut nominal wage rates, price stability could put a
floor beneath real wages.
</P>
<P>
   There is thus a risk that price stability may make relative
wages even more rigid. This is why some economists argue that a
little bit of inflation, say 3 percent, is a useful lubricant for
relative wage adjustment, because it makes it easier to disguise
real wage cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is a dangerous argument: the past three decades have
shown that a little bit of inflation, just like a little drink, can
easily get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution is to make wages more flexible _ down as well
as up. This requires not only reconsidering the negotiation of
annual pay raises; it also suggests linking a bigger share of pay
to profits or individual performance.
</P>
<P>
   The wage bill would then fall automatically in hard times. That
would mean lower take-home pay _ but most people would surely
prefer that to losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More variable pay might also increase the incentive for
employees to raise their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, a pay raise was a special event _ the result of
promotion or a reward for individual merit _ and not an automatic
annual expectation. Since then, annual pay negotiations have not
only served to keep inflation going; they have also sometimes
obscured the signals that link effort to reward.
</P>
<P>
   Central bankers may argue, entirely correctly, that inflation is
bad for the economy and for growth. Yet employees (and often their
employers, too) are rather fond of it.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, as J. K. Galbraith once said, rescues firms from the
errors of optimism and stupidity. It is time that bosses and
workers learned the advantages of living without it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The more paranoid Arab commentators insist that NATO's war with
Yugoslavia is designed to distract attention from America's war
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo may have pushed Iraq out of the headlines but, for
policymakers in Washington, diplomats at the United Nations and
American and British pilots patrolling the skies over northern and
southern Iraq, the battle continues, as fiercely and inconclusively
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   And the plight of ordinary Iraqis worsens by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Since a four-day bombing blitz last December, the U.N. Security
Council has been split over Iraq. Inspectors from UNSCOM, the U.N.
body charged with disarming Iraq, decamped to Bahrain to sit out
the bombardment, and have not been allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   All the veto-wielding members of the council agree that some
sort of arms-control regime must resume to winkle out Iraq's
remaining biological and chemical weapons. But they disagree over
what concessions to make to Iraq in return.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and France argue that the oil embargo should be
suspended when Iraq allows inspectors to return. A British and
Dutch proposal, backed by America, stipulates a four-month waiting
period to ensure compliance with a new inspection regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis say they have no more banned weapons, and demand an
unconditional end to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A special U.N. panel was convened in March to find a way out of
this deadlock, but it failed. A recent French proposal supposedly
blended the Anglo-Dutch and Russian schemes, but ended up pleasing
no one _ least of all the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Even the relatively simple matter of sending a team to dismantle
UNSCOM's abandoned laboratory in Baghdad caused a kerfuffle in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo taking center-stage, there is little diplomatic
capital to expend on Iraq. Even if there were, the American view
(no letup in the pressure on Saddam Hussein) and the Russian,
Chinese and French line (that the crippling nine-year embargo must
be eased) seem irreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, America wants to tighten the screws. Its planes have
bombed Iraq on average every three days since January, ostensibly
because of Iraqi infractions of the two ``no-fly zones'' that
America and Britain have declared in the north and south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Americans welcome any chance to weaken
Hussein's army. They still hope, Iraqi opposition groups say, that
eight years and five bombing campaigns after the Gulf war, the
Iraqi armed forces will turn on their master.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans insist that internal dissent _ as evidenced by the
bomb attack that killed several members of a Baghdad-based Iranian
militia on June 9 _ shows that Hussein's police state is weaker
than outsiders imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has long wanted to arm and train Iraqi opposition
groups to help them topple Hussein, and last year authorized the
administration to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has dragged its feet, arguing that the
opposition is weak and divided, and none of Iraq's neighbors is
willing to support it. In late May it agreed to hand out some fax
machines and photocopiers for the war effort _ but no guns.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress (INC),
has smartened itself up, dropped its unpopular president, Ahmad
Chalabi, and recruited representatives from the most powerful
Kurdish, Shia and Sunni factions.
</P>
<P>
   This revamped INC plans to hold a much-hyped meeting next month,
hoping to turn decision-makers' heads.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an exceptionally hot, dry summer has withered
nearly three-quarters of this year's crops. The Tigris in Baghdad
is reduced to a third of its normal level, disease-ridden livestock
are dying of hunger, and worse is still to come.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program, whereby Iraq is allowed to sell some
oil to pay for humanitarian imports, has been hit by low oil prices
and run-down Iraqi infrastructure; in the past six months, it
raised $3 billion, $2.2 billion less than projected.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years that the scheme has run, Iraq's rates of
malnutrition and disease have stabilized, but education,
agriculture and electricity-generation have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has allowed Iraq to pump more oil but
America and Britain veto many contracts for new oil equipment. And
appeals for extra aid for Iraq's 20 million people have fallen on
deaf ears. &QL;

<P>
   For generals who are said by NATO to have lost around 6,000
troops, Serbia's commanders were remarkably defiant, before signing
up, on June 9, to a detailed plan for a complete and rapid
withdrawal of their troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The peace terms, calling for the swift deployment in the Serbian
province of a robust, western-dominated force, had become embroiled
in the murky intrigues of Belgrade and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But a flurry of telephone calls between the Kremlin and western
capitals, and hard diplomatic bargaining in Cologne between the
foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven rich countries,
eventually cleared the way for the generals on both sides to settle
the procedures for an orderly Serb retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military minds were concentrated by American bombers
continuing to pound their troops, killing ever-increasing numbers
until the last moment. Even the hard-won withdrawal plan, providing
for the Serbs to take away what remains of their armor and air
defenses, did not quite mark the end of NATO's 11-week-old
conflict, nor the onset of a new, peacekeeping phase.
</P>
<P>
   China said it would try to water down, though not block
completely, a U.N. Security Council resolution providing for a
well-armed force in Kosovo; the exact peacekeeping arrangements
were still subject to bargaining between America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But for General Mike Jackson, the Briton who commands NATO's
forces in Macedonia, reaching an agreement with the Serb commanders
was a welcome end to five days of Slav brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   A steady hardening of the Serbs' position had been encouraged by
the arrival at their side of General Yevgeny Barmyantsev, the
Russian military attache in Belgrade, who has never hidden his
longing to help Serbia fight NATO more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the man from Moscow, the Serbs' General Svetozar
Marjanovic presented his NATO counterparts with a string of new
objections.
</P>
<P>
   He needed more than a week to withdraw; NATO eventually agreed
on 11 days. He balked at NATO's demand for a demilitarized zone
outside Kosovo; the zone was finally cut from 25 km (15 miles) to 5
km.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he suggested that the pullout could not begin at
all until after NATO had stopped bombing and the U.N. Security
Council had passed a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Serbia's generals appear to agree that only a few
hundred of their troops should remain in Kosovo in the longer run.
</P>
<P>
   Something had clearly gone wrong with the deal that Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, and Finland's President Martti
Ahtisaari (speaking for the European Union) had seemingly forced on
Milosevic, with the explicit assent of Serbia's parliament, on June
3.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Chernomyrdin had been subjected to a chorus of
denunciation from the foreign and defense ministries, both hinting
that the ex-prime minister had imposed on Serbia an even greater
humiliation than was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, Milosevic conferred with Vojislav
Seselj, his deputy prime minister and leader of the
ultra-nationalist Radical Party, who bitterly opposed the peace
terms. He was later allowed on Serbian state television to voice
his objections.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj may have made a bargain with Milosevic under which the
Radicals will hold back from street demonstrations and from trying
to bring the government down. At what price?
</P>
<P>
   One grim possibility is Seselj and his cutthroats have been
allowed to settle scores with the more enlightened figures in
Serbia's narrow political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   A side-effect of all these maneuvers was the toughening of the
terms on which the Serbian and Russian governments would cooperate
with western plans for an international force to bring Kosovo's
800,000 or so refugees safely back home. But fears that the
generals in both Serbia (and Russia) had slipped their political
bosses' control seemed exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Serb soldiers will be angry over the war's outcome,
there seemed little reason to doubt that Milosevic, backed by the
secret service and interior ministry, could still deliver a deal
once deprived of any more wiggle-room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issues on which he and his commanders stood ground
until the last moment were more than technicalities. The most
delicate had to do with the exact timing of the military and
diplomatic steps needed to set Kosovo on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
   NATO insisted it would not stop bombing until the Serbs were
seen to be seriously withdrawing; Russia and China said they would
not sign up to a U.N. resolution to license a peacekeeping force so
long as NATO kept bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's initial response to the stiffening of Serbia's
terms was to harden its own position. Its commanders said on June 7
that it was up to the Serbs whether to seize their last chance for
an orderly withdrawal _ or be chased out by western firepower.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, an American B-52 bomber made the
biggest single attack of the bombing campaign, unleashing a load of
cluster bombs on a group of 1,000 or so soldiers on a hillside near
Kosovo's border with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Cologne, meanwhile, the bargaining picked up speed when Igor
Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, grudgingly agreed with his
counterparts from the G7 on the text of a U.N. resolution which,
without mentioning NATO explicitly, called for a robust
international presence in Kosovo. &QL;

   The text says the Kosovo Liberation Army should ``comply with
the requirements'' of the peacekeepers' commander for
``demilitarization''; this leaves open the question of how much, if
at all, they will be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some aspects of the peacekeeping regime were left
for further bargaining, essentially between Russia, which is keen
to send 10,000 troops, and America, which seems happier about
humoring the Russians now that the broad outcome _ a Serb
withdrawal _ seems beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton assured Russia that its troops would
not be formally subordinated to NATO, which is preparing to put in
up to 50,000 of its own. But Strobe Talbott, America's envoy,
insisted on arrival in Moscow on June 10 that there would be no

hopes that some areas would be set aside for troops from Russia or
other Serb-friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, critics of Chernomyrdin complained that the
peacekeeping structure still favored NATO far too much.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a bleak week for Serbia and its Slav friends.
But the 50-year-old alliance now faces its hardest peacekeeping
task in a landscape of mines, charred bodies and burned villages.

Kosovo's 150,000 Serbs from ethnic-Albanian revenge. &QL;

 UNDATED: expanding economy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution notes that income
and other types of support for nonworking people, like disability
insurance payments, are much higher now than in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freeman-Rodgers study cites one group that has made
significant gains in tight labor markets: young black men without a
college education, whose non-employment rate fell from 48 percent
to 36 percent between 1992 and 1998. Though adult men barely
registered gains in employment or earnings in the regions with
tight labor markets, the earnings of young men _ including blacks
without a college education _ rose by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that a long extended boom can go a long way
to resolving the African-American youth employment problem,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Burtless points to another disadvantaged group that has been
helped by the robust economy: single mothers, whose non-employment
rate fell from 43 percent to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. Burtless
says that sharp improvement is a result in part of welfare reform
but also of a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one encouraging reading of the tea leaves, even if it's
unlikely that overall unemployment will dip much further: Those
groups in the worst economic shape _ unskilled young black men and
single mothers _ respond well to tight labor markets and would
benefit from future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And economists note that as more young black men and single
mothers are absorbed into the labor force, they will gain work
experience that will prove attractive to future employers and help
them weather the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has started to do for these groups what
government training programs have not accomplished: provide
substantially higher earnings and employment. And if the economic
boom continues for a few years, there is a chance it will do
wonders for the disadvantaged workers who need help the most.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So who will be the West's proconsul for Kosovo, presuming that
such a job is on offer?
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bildt, a former international ``high representative'' to
Bosnia, tapped last month to be the U.N.'s special envoy to the
Balkans, is a front-runner, though he fiercely denies wanting the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Americans, whom he has occasionally annoyed, let him
have it? Would his fellow Europeans want him to do it? Would he be
better suited to an even smarter-sounding job as the West's
coordinator of a grand strategy for boosting the entire Balkans?
And would he be up to taking on any such task?
</P>
<P>
   Bildt's credentials are impressive. For a start, he is a most
unusual _ indeed, a most unSwedish _ sort of Swede who, at 49, has
outgrown Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   This week he was nowhere to be seen in Stockholm, though he was
supposed to be leading his country's main opposition party, the
Moderates (who are on the free-market right), into elections to
Europe's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was in Geneva, trying to get international
do-gooding agencies, led by the U.N., into planning a rescue
package for Kosovo, before flying to New York to take matters
further.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he has led the Moderates for 14 years, briefly _ as
prime minister from 1991 to 1994 _ loosening the Social Democrats'
corporatist grip, before tacitly conceding that most of his
compatriots are still loath to lose their high-tax,
welfare-cosseted, unadversarial way of life.
</P>
<P>
   And Bildt is ahead of the Swedish game (too much so,
electorally) in other respects.
</P>
<P>
   Most Swedes (and their parties in parliament) are against
joining NATO; cherish Sweden's longstanding neutrality; are muddled
or ambivalent about the European Union; and deeply wary of joining
Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, a passionate European who wants to see Sweden inside
NATO, disagrees on all counts _ and in doing so he flouts Sweden's
unspoken code of dignified consensus by speaking his mind candidly,
often with a waspish wit.
</P>
<P>
   He tends to treat people he considers fools (of whom there are
quite a few) ungladly, and chastises fellow Swedes for what he sees
as their limp-wristedness.
</P>
<P>
   He derides the Social Democrats' old boast that Sweden is (or at
least was) a ``moral superpower,'' pooh-poohs the idea of a Nordic
block, and cheekily queries whether, these days, Sweden has any
foreign policy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from Bosnia in 1997, and losing a general
election (not too badly) in 1998, his heart has not really been in
domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign fields are what beckon. Recently he married, as his
third wife, a clever and beautiful Italian he met in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   That was where his appetite for international troubleshooting

   What Bildt argues most strongly (and has for several years) is
that the West must hurl itself far more heartily into
reconstruction _ not just in Kosovo or Bosnia, but across the
entire Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, he has often said, is ``not an exit strategy
from Bosnia but an entry strategy for the Balkans as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants a ``truly common foreign and security policy of the
European Union, a new and more radical integration across the
continent as a whole (including the Balkans), and a strengthened
and rebalanced relationship between the EU and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In tune with his zest for European unity, he bemoans the
consequences of trying to build latter-day Balkan nation-states out
of the ethnic mosaic that makes up ``that bloody mess called the
Balkans'' _ because ethnic cleansing, for which he castigates
Croats as much as Serbs, is the invariable means of that
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkanization of the Balkans has already gone too far,''
he says. Changing borders, let alone endorsing partition, is ``a
very long way down the list'' of options.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans should, he recently wrote, be treated as one big
region: ``The EU should provide the Balkan states with a clear
blueprint for reforms that would pave the way for close
integration, if not full membership of the EU. This would entail a
transfer of sovereignty to EU institutions in matters of economics
and structural issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Current Balkan barriers and borders, he says, must eventually
come down.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary, idealistic stuff, of course; Bildt is indeed an
idealist. But he is also tough, pragmatic and brave. ``He
understands power very well,'' says an ex-adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is asked to handle Kosovo or the whole region, he
could be the man for the job. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   So who will be the West's proconsul for Kosovo, presuming that
such a job is on offer?
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bildt, a former international ``high representative'' to
Bosnia, tapped last month to be the U.N.'s special envoy to the
Balkans, is a front-runner, though he fiercely denies wanting the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Americans, whom he has occasionally annoyed, let him
have it? Would his fellow Europeans want him to do it? Would he be
better suited to an even smarter-sounding job as the West's
coordinator of a grand strategy for boosting the entire Balkans?
And would he be up to taking on any such task?
</P>
<P>
   Bildt's credentials are impressive. For a start, he is a most
unusual _ indeed, a most unSwedish _ sort of Swede who, at 49, has
outgrown Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   This week he was nowhere to be seen in Stockholm, though he was
supposed to be leading his country's main opposition party, the
Moderates (who are on the free-market right), into elections to
Europe's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was in Geneva, trying to get international
do-gooding agencies, led by the U.N., into planning a rescue
package for Kosovo, before flying to New York to take matters
further.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he has led the Moderates for 14 years, briefly _ as
prime minister from 1991 to 1994 _ loosening the Social Democrats'
corporatist grip, before tacitly conceding that most of his
compatriots are still loath to lose their high-tax,
welfare-cosseted, unadversarial way of life.
</P>
<P>
   And Bildt is ahead of the Swedish game (too much so,
electorally) in other respects.
</P>
<P>
   Most Swedes (and their parties in parliament) are against
joining NATO; cherish Sweden's longstanding neutrality; are muddled
or ambivalent about the European Union; and deeply wary of joining
Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, a passionate European who wants to see Sweden inside
NATO, disagrees on all counts _ and in doing so he flouts Sweden's
unspoken code of dignified consensus by speaking his mind candidly,
often with a waspish wit.
</P>
<P>
   He tends to treat people he considers fools (of whom there are
quite a few) ungladly, and chastises fellow Swedes for what he sees
as their limp-wristedness.
</P>
<P>
   He derides the Social Democrats' old boast that Sweden is (or at
least was) a ``moral superpower,'' pooh-poohs the idea of a Nordic
block, and cheekily queries whether, these days, Sweden has any
foreign policy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from Bosnia in 1997, and losing a general
election (not too badly) in 1998, his heart has not really been in
domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign fields are what beckon. Recently he married, as his
third wife, a clever and beautiful Italian he met in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   That was where his appetite for international troubleshooting
was whetted. His two-year term as ``high rep'' in Bosnia was, he
says, ``hell _ but I don't regret a second of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After co-chairing the peace talks in Dayton, he oversaw the
West's stuttering efforts to recreate a civil and political order.
</P>
<P>
   He did well just to keep the show on the road, but was hampered
by hideously unclear lines of command, by American-European
rivalries, and by the reluctance of the three antagonistic
communities to seek a genuine accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Refashioning Kosovo, he says, will be ``militarily easier,''
though the degradation, after the fighting, ethnic cleansing and
bombing, is much greater.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas in Bosnia the high representative was technically
answerable to no one in particular, in Kosovo, he hopes, there will
be a plainer ``de facto U.N. protectorate, protected by NATO.''

<P>
   The comes straight from a Clint Eastwood script. Victimized for
years by oppressive bandits, beleaguered villagers seek help from a
mysterious cowboy who rides into town from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows much about his background, and he reveals even
less. Yet he is the villagers' only hope, and, though greatly
outnumbered, he manages to drive off the men in black hats with a
single revolver that never runs out of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   So, gun in holster, George W. Bush sets out to end the
Democratic occupation of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As he makes his first trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, the
governor of Texas has tucked in his saddle bag an estimated $20
million in campaign contributions and hundreds of political
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   He also carries with him the expectations that he will broaden
his party's appeal to minorities, forge a rational foreign policy,
prolong the economic boom, and, if time permits, strengthen the
American family.
</P>
<P>
   While the tight-lipped Hollywood cowboy never had to define his
stance on gun control, Bush _ already criticized for failing to
back such controls in Texas after the Littleton, Colo. high-school
shootings _ is now going to have to do that, and a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a ravenous press corps eager to grill him on a range of
subjects, and a pack of Republican presidential opponents who can
finally take shots at him.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates have the luxury of easing into a campaign
by honing their message in front of small groups, Bush, as the
leader of the pack, is beginning his run under the glare of an
international spotlight. His peaceful life in Austin will soon seem
a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be impossible for the governor to live up to his
billing, he could start by putting substance behind his vague
campaign motto of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the country, he can brag about a strong Texas
record of tax cuts, education reform and broad minority support,
yet he will have to suggest that his program can be successful
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he must sell his ideas to social conservatives,
who never trusted his ``kinder, gentler'' father and seem equally
skeptical about Bush the Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Although the religious wing of the Republican Party is likely to
fall in line if Bush wins his party's nomination _ they have
nowhere else to go _ socially conservative candidates such as Gary
Bauer and Dan Quayle could give him great headaches during the
primaries over issues such as abortion, on which Bush performs that
well-known Republican straddle of disliking it personally, but
backing the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in some trouble over taxes, as his father famously
was before him. Bush-la-pere lost the 1992 election, in large part,
because he promised ``No new taxes'' and then broke his word.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-le-fils, in a telephone interview with a group of New
Hampshire journalists on June 8, also vowed he would not raise
taxes if elected president, a pretty foolish corner to back himself
into.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in a typical wriggle, he declined actually to sign a
pledge to oppose any tax increase that might be put before him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush must also silence the skeptics who question his knowledge
of foreign affairs. He has given them fuel in recent weeks both
with his reluctance to take a stand on Kosovo, and with his public
statement that America should take care ``to keep good relations
with the Grecians.'' (Presumably, not at the expense of the
country's relations with Sparta.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the governor himself lacks international experience, he
makes up for it with a seasoned foreign-policy team that briefs him
regularly: a group dominated by cold-warriors, such as Richard
Perle, who have not thawed out much a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recent public statements have been hawkish (especially
over China), and Republican leaders are hopeful that a coherent
``Bush Doctrine'' will be the antidote to two terms of Clinton
muddle.
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of governors, congressmen and businessmen in his
camp, Bush is undoubtedly the candidate of the Republican
establishment. Rival Republican candidates have been left to
scramble for the scraps. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So desperate are party leaders (especially those in Congress) to
reclaim the White House and retain their majority on Capitol Hill
that, even before their favorite has committed himself, they have
already met Bush and forged a unified agenda for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced rumblings among conservatives that in their
desperation for a winner, Republican leaders are sacrificing
ideology for strategy, selling the party's soul for the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   They quietly disparage Bush's vapid public statements as
Clintonesque, and one staffer for Lamar Alexander (a rival whose
campaign seems on the brink of shutting up shop already) goes so
far as to call the governor a ``force of evil'' within the
Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Others grumble that the real star of the Bush family is George's
younger brother Jeb, the governor of Florida. Jeb has just won
approval for a statewide school-voucher plan, while George failed
to persuade the Texas legislature that it wanted any such thing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents, both in Texas and outside it, have
characterized him as a political neophyte, a wayward businessman
trying to ride the coattails of a famous name.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, politics is the first arena where Bush has
had real professional success. As an oil man, his companies struck
far more dry holes than gushers.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he often jokes about his time as part-owner of the
Texas Rangers baseball team, which failed to shine during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   After an uneasy time in Washington advising his father, Bush has
finally found a comfortable home in Texas politics, enjoying
statewide approval ratings approaching 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems to want to return to Washington. To get there, he
is going to have to fill in the blanks both in his vision of the
road ahead, and in his hazy recollection of what came before.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has given up booze, married a librarian, and found
God, Bush may finally have to answer media questions about his
``reckless youth.'' Perhaps most important, he must be so set on
the prize that he is able to recover quickly from the inevitable
setbacks along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   For the shoot-outs and saloon brawls that await him, Bush must
show he has the two things most indispensable to any cowboy: a
quick draw and an iron jaw. &QL;

<P>
   As he makes his first trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, the
governor of Texas has tucked in his saddle bag an estimated $20
million in campaign contributions and hundreds of political
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   He also carries with him the expectations that he will broaden
his party's appeal to minorities, forge a rational foreign policy,
prolong the economic boom, and, if time permits, strengthen the
American family.
</P>
<P>
   While the tight-lipped Hollywood cowboy never had to define his
stance on gun control, Bush _ already criticized for failing to
back such controls in Texas after the Littleton, Colo. high-school
shootings _ is now going to have to do that, and a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a ravenous press corps eager to grill him on a range of
subjects, and a pack of Republican presidential opponents who can
finally take shots at him.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates have the luxury of easing into a campaign
by honing their message in front of small groups, Bush, as the
leader of the pack, is beginning his run under the glare of an
international spotlight. His peaceful life in Austin will soon seem
a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be impossible for the governor to live up to his
billing, he could start by putting substance behind his vague
campaign motto of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the country, he can brag about a strong Texas
record of tax cuts, education reform and broad minority support,
yet he will have to suggest that his program can be successful
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he must sell his ideas to social conservatives,
who never trusted his ``kinder, gentler'' father and seem equally
skeptical about Bush the Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Although the religious wing of the Republican Party is likely to
fall in line if Bush wins his party's nomination _ they have
nowhere else to go _ socially conservative candidates such as Gary
Bauer and Dan Quayle could give him great headaches during the
primaries over issues such as abortion, on which Bush performs that
well-known Republican straddle of disliking it personally, but
backing the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in some trouble over taxes, as his father famously
was before him. Bush-la-pere lost the 1992 election, in large part,
because he promised ``No new taxes'' and then broke his word.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-le-fils, in a telephone interview with a group of New
Hampshire journalists on June 8, also vowed he would not raise
taxes if elected president, a pretty foolish corner to back himself
into.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in a typical wriggle, he declined actually to sign a
pledge to oppose any tax increase that might be put before him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush must also silence the skeptics who question his knowledge
of foreign affairs. He has given them fuel in recent weeks both
with his reluctance to take a stand on Kosovo, and with his public
statement that America should take care ``to keep good relations
with the Grecians.'' (Presumably, not at the expense of the
country's relations with Sparta.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the governor himself lacks international experience, he
makes up for it with a seasoned foreign-policy team that briefs him
regularly: a group dominated by cold-warriors, such as Richard
Perle, who have not thawed out much a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recent public statements have been hawkish (especially
over China), and Republican leaders are hopeful that a coherent
``Bush Doctrine'' will be the antidote to two terms of Clinton
muddle.
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of governors, congressmen and businessmen in his
camp, Bush is undoubtedly the candidate of the Republican
establishment. Rival Republican candidates have been left to
scramble for the scraps. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So desperate are party leaders (especially those in Congress) to
reclaim the White House and retain their majority on Capitol Hill
that, even before their favorite has committed himself, they have
already met Bush and forged a unified agenda for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced rumblings among conservatives that in their
desperation for a winner, Republican leaders are sacrificing
ideology for strategy, selling the party's soul for the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   They quietly disparage Bush's vapid public statements as
Clintonesque, and one staffer for Lamar Alexander (a rival whose
campaign seems on the brink of shutting up shop already) goes so
far as to call the governor a ``force of evil'' within the
Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Others grumble that the real star of the Bush family is George's
younger brother Jeb, the governor of Florida. Jeb has just won
approval for a statewide school-voucher plan, while George failed
to persuade the Texas legislature that it wanted any such thing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents, both in Texas and outside it, have
characterized him as a political neophyte, a wayward businessman
trying to ride the coattails of a famous name.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, politics is the first arena where Bush has
had real professional success. As an oil man, his companies struck
far more dry holes than gushers.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he often jokes about his time as part-owner of the
Texas Rangers baseball team, which failed to shine during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   After an uneasy time in Washington advising his father, Bush has
finally found a comfortable home in Texas politics, enjoying
statewide approval ratings approaching 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems to want to return to Washington. To get there, he
is going to have to fill in the blanks both in his vision of the
road ahead, and in his hazy recollection of what came before.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has given up booze, married a librarian, and found
God, Bush may finally have to answer media questions about his
``reckless youth.'' Perhaps most important, he must be so set on
the prize that he is able to recover quickly from the inevitable
setbacks along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   For the shoot-outs and saloon brawls that await him, Bush must
show he has the two things most indispensable to any cowboy: a
quick draw and an iron jaw. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A year ago, Arnold Levine agreed to help clean up
Sunnyside Park, a half-acre stretch of grass and trees in a
middle-class San Francisco neighborhood. Along with other
volunteers, Levine, a Londoner by origin, wiped out graffiti,
chased out drug dealers and in general spruced up the little park.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful youngsters and their families swarmed all over it. But
now, says Levine, he fears that Sunnyside Park will lose out to an
unexpected adversary: dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 19 parks due to become ``off-leash'' areas as San
Francisco tries to accommodate the growing number of dogs living
within the city.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has pleaded with officials to maintain the park primarily
for local people and their children _ and for dogs on a leash. He
has been cursed by dog owners, chaired meetings that dissolved into
shouting matches, and recently opened his car door to find a pile
of dog-poop on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog owners have obviously tried to send me a message,''
Levine explains.
</P>
<P>
   Few issues are hotter just now in urban America than whether
dogs should be given free run of public parks in these off-leash
areas (OLAs, in bureaucratese).
</P>
<P>
   Battles over dogs have erupted in Florida, Oregon, New York,
Connecticut, Wyoming and Washington, to name but a few. ``I would
equate it to abortion,'' Nick Licata says with a gulp; he is a city
councillor here in Seattle who has tried to mediate between dog
owners and the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the woofing? Canine demographics, for one thing. It is
reckoned that 58 million dogs live in the United States. Although
the number has held steady (and is now exceeded by the 66 million
or so cats kept as pets), several new developments have complicated
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For one, more and more dogs are living in cities or thickly
populated suburbs where they have no back gardens in which to romp
(or dump). It also seems that many dog owners are opting for larger
breeds; the boisterous, bulky Labrador retriever is now the most
popular breed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, many people have come to regard dogs as
something more than a furry household accessory. They have become
family members, showered with Christmas gifts and birthday presents
and treated to a romp on the park as readily as a five-year-old
child would be.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities have long looked the other way as dogs ran loose in
the parks and the streets. But, as American cities have grown more
attractive and property values have risen, humans have sought to
reassert their control over the parks.
</P>
<P>
   A culture clash almost worthy of the Balkans has resulted. Dog
owners cannot see why everyone doesn't find Shiloh or Molly or
Sheba adorable. Non-owners feel harassed by rambunctious dogs, and
see parks becoming dog-poop minefields.
</P>
<P>
   Most dog owners manage their dogs responsibly, says Nicholas
Dodman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Tufts University and
the author of several books on dogs. But, as is so often the case,
the bad behavior of the few tars the many.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman is particularly disturbed by the dog owner who pretends
to be surprised when his animal attacks someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people who come to me with aggressive dogs know that
their dogs are aggressive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, two unleashed Rottweilers in Seattle attacked and
nearly killed a two-year-old. Officials destroyed one dog; the
owner then claimed the other dog was trying to ``save'' the child.
</P>
<P>
   Often the dog problem is not really a dog problem at all; it is
a people problem.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, the quality-of-life crackdown on
squeegee men and jaywalkers by the city's mayor, Rudolf Giuliani,
has recently been imitated in a campaign against unruly dogs led by
Henry Stern, the parks commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has proposed tighter enforcement of leash laws and bigger
fines for off-leash scofflaws. To support his case, he has amassed
a stack of letters from irate New Yorkers. Most of them complain
more about abusive dog owners than aggressive dogs.
</P>
<P>
   One recalled being harassed by a large off-the-leash mutt.
``Quit moving, and the dog won't bother you,'' explained the owner.
</P>
<P>
   It can be worse than that. One owner gave the name of ``Eva
Braun'' when stopped for having an illegally off-leash dog, and
another hung a sign marked ``Treblinka'' on a newly installed
anti-dog fence.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a moral. So far in America dog owners have had the
upper hand. As Licata observes, most of the people who turn up at
meetings to discuss the issue are those with dogs, not with
grouches about dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This may be changing. In Avon, Conn., leash-law supporters
handily outvoted supporters of more liberal off-leash rules in a
referendum last year. If enough dogs behave badly enough, a lot
more victims are liable to turn on the people who own the dogs. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's charms can quickly pall. Meeting one hairy
millionaire in cycling shorts can be diverting. Meeting a
succession leaves you pining for less repellent forms of
conformity.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, however, you come across someone who is
doing something genuinely wacky: such as the leader of the local
branch of the AFL-CIO, Amy Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago one American worker in three was a member of a
trade union. Today the figure is closer to one in seven.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley start-ups, trade unionists are about as thick
on the ground as manual typewriters. Yet it is here that Dean is
planning the rebirth of the American labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   As Don Quixotes go, she has an impressive record. She is part of
the new labor movement: young (36, and already a five-year veteran
as head of the South Bay labor council); well-educated (a degree in
sociology and economics would have led to postgraduate work had she
not been seduced into the Ladies' Garment Workers Union); and
plugged into the new economy (her husband works for a software
start-up).
</P>
<P>
   When she took over the South Bay branch of the AFL-CIO, it was
little more than a blue-collar rest home. Now it is humming, housed
in what looks like a high-tech hatchery, staffed by bright young
things, many of them Hispanic women, and elaborately ``networked,''
along the best Silicon Valley lines.
</P>
<P>
   A sister group, Working Partnership USA, which she set up in
1995, does research, trains local activists and cultivates
relations with universities.
</P>
<P>
   Dean can sound like an academic with the gift of the gab. Do not
be deceived: she is a street fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her organization not only trounced the bosses'
candidate in a brutal battle for a seat on the San Jose city
council. (``I was up against the single most powerful political
machine in the Valley,'' grumbled the loser.)
</P>
<P>
   It also won its campaign to force San Jose to adopt a ``living
wage'' for all municipal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose now has the highest minimum wage in the country, almost
twice the mandatory level in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney,
recruited Dean to head a committee on the future of the labor
movement. She started by admitting what was obvious to everybody
but the movement itself: that it is on a hiding to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are still rooted in a world of vertically integrated
companies, glacial innovation and jobs for life, she says, in her
best academic tones.
</P>
<P>
   But these days firms are spinning into webs, innovation is
relentless and the average length of employment in California,
where the new economy is being forged, is three years.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, Dean is remarkably upbeat. Labor organizations are
not alone in failing to keep pace with economic change: the same
could be said of almost any public-sector institution.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing odd about unions failing in new industries:
the same was true of the infant car and electricity industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for Dean's optimism is that she thinks
that the defining characteristic of the new economy _ its obsession
with flexibility _ will turn out to be a boon for unions.
</P>
<P>
   This seems counterintuitive. How can unions represent people who
might be changing job any day? And how can they recruit people who
fear that a reputation for bolshiness could stop them from getting
another job?
</P>
<P>
   The rise of temp agencies such as Manpower (which is now
America's largest employer) has coincided with the unions' decline.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, Dean points out, temporary workers are often
miserable workers. The worst-paid live a hand-to-mouth existence
without medical or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the best-paid are fearful of the future and envious
of those on the permanent payroll, as Microsoft discovered last
month when some ``permatemps'' won a class-action suit against it.
Microsoft is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's bright idea for reaching these discontented but elusive
temps is to establish a temping agency of her own, Together &LR; Work.
</P>
<P>
   The month-old agency is not only paying its workers better than
its rivals pay theirs. It also plans to give them medical benefits,
pensions and training. (This is not as unrealistic as it sounds:
conventional agencies charge fat commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Dean wants her agency to become a stable point in lives
otherwise blown hither and thither by the flexible economy. This is
also her plan for the union movement as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As firms become more nimble, workers will have to look elsewhere
for things that make life secure, from training to medical
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century some craft unions proved so good at
providing these that they controlled the supply of workers: when
people wanted a carpenter they went to the union.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of the new economy, notably Hollywood, unions are
starting to play this role again; Dean would like it to become the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Her heady vision raises all sorts of questions. Is she really a
convert to the flexible economy? Her most concrete achievement so
far has been to make wages in San Jose more rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Can trade unions really provide training in the new economy? At
the moment, her power base is in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Dean will not make her mark. She has
proved remarkably successful at bullying San Jose politicians and
raising questions the cyber elite would rather forget, such as why
wages for the low-paid in the world's center of wealth creation are
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The discontent smoldering among permatemps could become a blaze
when the economy turns down. And if the history of Silicon Valley
teaches anything, it is never to write off people with crazy
ideas. &QL;

 UNDATED: expanding economy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution notes that income
and other types of support for nonworking people, like disability
insurance payments, are much higher now than in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freeman-Rodgers study cites one group that has made
significant gains in tight labor markets: young black men without a
college education, whose non-employment rate fell from 48 percent
to 36 percent between 1992 and 1998. Though adult men barely
registered gains in employment or earnings in the regions with
tight labor markets, the earnings of young men _ including blacks
without a college education _ rose by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that a long extended boom can go a long way
to resolving the African-American youth employment problem,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Burtless points to another disadvantaged group that has been
helped by the robust economy: single mothers, whose non-employment
rate fell from 43 percent to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. Burtless
says that sharp improvement is a result in part of welfare reform
but also of a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one encouraging reading of the tea leaves, even if it's
unlikely that overall unemployment will dip much further: Those
groups in the worst economic shape _ unskilled young black men and
single mothers _ respond well to tight labor markets and would
benefit from future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And economists note that as more young black men and single
mothers are absorbed into the labor force, they will gain work
experience that will prove attractive to future employers and help
them weather the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has started to do for these groups what
government training programs have not accomplished: provide
substantially higher earnings and employment. And if the economic
boom continues for a few years, there is a chance it will do
wonders for the disadvantaged workers who need help the most.

<P>
   Silicon Valley's charms can quickly pall. Meeting one hairy
millionaire in cycling shorts can be diverting. Meeting a
succession leaves you pining for less repellent forms of
conformity.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, however, you come across someone who is
doing something genuinely wacky: such as the leader of the local
branch of the AFL-CIO, Amy Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago one American worker in three was a member of a
trade union. Today the figure is closer to one in seven.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley start-ups, trade unionists are about as thick
on the ground as manual typewriters. Yet it is here that Dean is
planning the rebirth of the American labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   As Don Quixotes go, she has an impressive record. She is part of
the new labor movement: young (36, and already a five-year veteran
as head of the South Bay labor council); well-educated (a degree in
sociology and economics would have led to postgraduate work had she
not been seduced into the Ladies' Garment Workers Union); and
plugged into the new economy (her husband works for a software
start-up).
</P>
<P>
   When she took over the South Bay branch of the AFL-CIO, it was
little more than a blue-collar rest home. Now it is humming, housed
in what looks like a high-tech hatchery, staffed by bright young
things, many of them Hispanic women, and elaborately ``networked,''
along the best Silicon Valley lines.
</P>
<P>
   A sister group, Working Partnership USA, which she set up in
1995, does research, trains local activists and cultivates
relations with universities.
</P>
<P>
   Dean can sound like an academic with the gift of the gab. Do not
be deceived: she is a street fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her organization not only trounced the bosses'
candidate in a brutal battle for a seat on the San Jose city
council. (``I was up against the single most powerful political
machine in the Valley,'' grumbled the loser.)
</P>
<P>
   It also won its campaign to force San Jose to adopt a ``living
wage'' for all municipal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose now has the highest minimum wage in the country, almost
twice the mandatory level in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney,
recruited Dean to head a committee on the future of the labor
movement. She started by admitting what was obvious to everybody
but the movement itself: that it is on a hiding to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are still rooted in a world of vertically integrated
companies, glacial innovation and jobs for life, she says, in her
best academic tones.
</P>
<P>
   But these days firms are spinning into webs, innovation is
relentless and the average length of employment in California,
where the new economy is being forged, is three years.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, Dean is remarkably upbeat. Labor organizations are
not alone in failing to keep pace with economic change: the same
could be said of almost any public-sector institution.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing odd about unions failing in new industries:
the same was true of the infant car and electricity industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for Dean's optimism is that she thinks
that the defining characteristic of the new economy _ its obsession
with flexibility _ will turn out to be a boon for unions.
</P>
<P>
   This seems counterintuitive. How can unions represent people who
might be changing job any day? And how can they recruit people who
fear that a reputation for bolshiness could stop them from getting
another job?
</P>
<P>
   The rise of temp agencies such as Manpower (which is now

 MOSCOW: about Yugoslavia.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Look at the leaders of almost all the newly independent
states,'' said Sergei Rogov, the director of the government's
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. ``Like Milosevic, they used to
be leaders of the Communist Party before the collapse of
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you look at how they treat the ethnic minorities in the
newly independent states, you'll see that Milosevic fits the
pattern,'' he added. ``He's not perceived as something
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Western Europe he is. Of course part of that is because
Serbia is so close. Even as he declared victory on Thursday,
Clinton added a caveat to the lessons of Kosovo for future ethnic
cleansers: The world will act, he said, when ``we can do something
about it.'' But here, too, even more is at play.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat, democratization and integration into Europe brought the
Germans full circle. Unchecked slaughter in Bosnia and Rwanda
shamed their neighbors into action. And now Western Europe has no
stomach to watch Milosevic revive the bad memories, setting off
ethnic expulsion and slaughters to consolidate the power of Serbs
who don't like their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a step forward or a foolish vanity? Kosovo will be safe
for Albanians, it seems, which is what 78 days of bombing were all
about.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows how many will return. Milosevic remains
entrenched in Belgrade. Russia, burning at the popular notion that
it has been a shill for NATO, is balking at Western efforts to
oversee peacekeeping. And there is a new danger that radical
Albanians will exact revenge on ordinary Serbs, starting the cycle
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the Old World argument _ everyone does it, the world
works this way, a few thousand Serbs or Albanians aren't important,
it's none of our business _ seem almost attractive, even logical.
It is not hard to envision the Russians nodding and saying, ``Told
you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to remember, however, that in attitude, if not behavior,
Russia today is roughly where Britain, Germany and France were 81
years ago. It took World War II to change the West's mind about
inhumanity, and 50 years more to make that change of mind a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albats, the journalist, says her nation needs time, too.
``This is still imperial Russia,'' she said. ``It's still the
Soviet Union. The generation ruling this nation grew up in the
Soviet Union, and you can't expect people to change their minds the
way you change a rule on private property. But another generation
is coming.''

Serbia is so close. Even as he declared victory on Thursday,
Clinton added a caveat to the lessons of Kosovo for future ethnic
cleansers: The world will act, he said, when ``we can do something
about it.'' But here, too, even more is at play.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat, democratization and integration into Europe brought the
Germans full circle. Unchecked slaughter in Bosnia and Rwanda
shamed their neighbors into action. And now Western Europe has no
stomach to watch Milosevic revive the bad memories, setting off
ethnic expulsion and slaughters to consolidate the power of Serbs
who don't like their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a step forward or a foolish vanity? Kosovo will be safe
for Albanians, it seems, which is what 78 days of bombing were all
about.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows how many will return. Milosevic remains
entrenched in Belgrade. Russia, burning at the popular notion that
it has been a shill for NATO, is balking at Western efforts to
oversee peacekeeping. And there is a new danger that radical
Albanians will exact revenge on ordinary Serbs, starting the cycle
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the Old World argument _ everyone does it, the world
works this way, a few thousand Serbs or Albanians aren't important,
it's none of our business _ seem almost attractive, even logical.
It is not hard to envision the Russians nodding and saying, ``Told
you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to remember, however, that in attitude, if not behavior,
Russia today is roughly where Britain, Germany and France were 81
years ago. It took World War II to change the West's mind about
inhumanity, and 50 years more to make that change of mind a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albats, the journalist, says her nation needs time, too.
``This is still imperial Russia,'' she said. ``It's still the
Soviet Union. The generation ruling this nation grew up in the
Soviet Union, and you can't expect people to change their minds the
way you change a rule on private property. But another generation
is coming.''

   EAST-WEST-VALUES-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Americans think their values
are the world's _ and in economics, that often is true. But to some
nations, the Kosovo atrocities were just the broken eggs of yet
another national omelet and the West is a self-righteous, ever-more
meddlesome cook. This anti-West club is not so much motivated by
love for Milosevic as a conviction that bloodlettings like Kosovo
are internal matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust
yourself into someone else's war; that the safe and even humane
course usually is to let the two sides duke it out. By Michael
Wines. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   LOWERCLASS-PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S. economic boom
is finally starting to trickle down to affect the poorest
Americans, challenging the conventional wisdom that government had
a crucial role in helping the poor. But now there's reason to
wonder if maybe prosperity can do the job alone. Or to put it
another way, how far down the economic ladder can prosperity be
expected to reach? Economists aren't sure, but job statistics give
some interesting clues. By Michael Weinstein. (`a' category)

   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-SWITCH-REVIEW (Washington) _ With more drugs available and
more prescriptions being written each year, the FDA is concerned
about deaths and injuries caused by medications. Much attention is
given to medication mix-ups and other pharmaceutical errors. But
many people don't realize that pharmacists, at the behest of
insurance companies and HMOs, intentionally switch medications all
the time, with potentially harmful consequences. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDRAISING-LOSERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Whether they are
well-known faces or ordinary people who run for Congress, losing
candidates find that just because the election is over doesn't mean
the fund-raising stops. But if it was tough raising money in the
heat of a campaign, try fund-raising after Election Day, as the
bills from pollsters, the telephone company and poster makers keep
rolling in. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   JUDAISM-PROSELYTIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike Christianity,
Judaism emphatically shuns prosyletizing. But even if many
modern-day rabbis are not so discouraging as all that, what would
happen if they took a really different tack and encouraged
spiritual seekers to embrace Judaism? That idea is gaining
attention _ and some hot criticism. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-APPOINT-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's recess
appointment of a homosexual as ambassador to Luxembourg has
provoked a clash between two of the most venerable _ and arguably
most anachronistic _ traditions of the federal government. At issue
is the right of the president to make appointments during
congressional recesses without Senate confirmation vs. the right of
individual senators to block any nomination that comes before them.
By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-TITUS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Movie audiences will
see a different side of Shakespeare in the upcoming film version of
`Titus Andronicus.' It is Shakespeare's bloodiest play and, many
critics feel, his worst. Some examples of critical reaction over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   WILDE-HUSBAND-REVIEW (Undated) _ A century after the debut of
Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' the portrait of a successful
politician trying to slip out of humiliation retains a certain
currency, while the portrait of his wife seems like a classy
photograph that has faded from fashion. By Waklter Goodman.

   CHINA-COMPUTERS-REVIEW (Washington) The U.S. has determined that
the new Sony Playstation II, available later this year, is powered
by a chip so powerful that Washington would have to be notified
before it could be shipped to China. But a Chinese military officer
determined to play out his fantasies on state-of-the-art Sony _
perhaps simulate an attack on Taiwan _ can simply send his kids to
any of the five Toys `R' Us stores in Hong Kong, which is still
considered a safe place to send advanced technology even though it
has reverted to Chinese rule. By David E. Sanger.

   GREECE-TURKEY-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The Kosovo crisis has
underlined how closely Greek and Turkish strategic interests
coincide. Both would benefit enormously from stability in the
Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. Yet, in one of the most
persistent and puzzling anomalies of modern geopolitics, their
dispute remains seemingly intractable. Though joined by geography
and history, they are divided by one of the world's angriest and
longest-running blood feuds. By Stephen Kinzer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When he was a much younger man, Jose
Concepcion once found himself holding up a bullet and peering at it
through his thick glasses. ``They are shooting at us,'' he said,
more incredulous than afraid. That was 13 years ago in the
Philippines, when Concepcion and other partisans of democracy were
learning how to face down a dictator, and how a dictator fights
back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and scores of others are bringing such lessons to
places like Indonesia, applying them and building on them in the
growing number of emerging democracies. One of the founders of the
National Movement for Free Elections, known by the acronym Namfrel,
Concepcion helped end the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
That experience helped him and others fashion a new instrument for
the spread of democracy: the independent, citizen-led
election-watch group.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-monitoring groups sponsored by the United Nations or the
United States or by independent American organizations have become
a fairly familiar sight in countries conducting elections for the
first time. But Concepcion's movement is different: These are
home-grown groups that take it upon themselves to visit neighboring
countries, help them launch democracies, and leave behind similar
home-grown groups to help the fledgling free society grow.
</P>
<P>
   So last week Concepcion was in Jakarta with a Namfrel delegation
keeping an eye on Indonesia's first free election in 44 years and
simultaneously training local poll-watchers to start a
self-sustaining effort here. Also here were scores of men and women
from other nations who were in effect his students.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example set in the Philippines, they had already
helped bring democratic elections to their own countries. Now, like
Concepcion, they were sharing the benefits of their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Feroz Hassan, for example, was here from Bangladesh, where he
helped found the Fair Election Monitoring Alliance in 1995, with
help and advice from Namfrel. ``They brought the idea and gave us
the training,'' he said. Hassan then took his poll-watch experience
to Kenya before coming to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lachmansingh was here from Guyana, where he formed the
Electoral Assistance Bureau in 1991. ``People were getting quite
fed up,'' he said. ``Elections were rigged on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, he too went abroad, helping monitor elections in the
West Bank in 1995, in Sri Lanka in 1996 and 1997 and in Cambodia
last year before coming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the same anywhere you go,'' he said. ``Always in
people's mind is hope and a desire for change and democracy, which
they associate first with democratic elections. People often have
unrealistic expectations, but always there is that basic ingredient
of hope which propels concerned citizens to want to make a
contribution. Call it patriotism, saintliness, bravery _ martyrdom
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious imagery seemed apt. These are today's secular
missionaries, spreading the democratic faith in a time of mass
conversion around the world. They have carried the gospel of
democratic possibilities to places as far-flung as Yemen, Nigeria,
Panama, Taiwan, Romania, Bulgaria, Chile, Haiti, Nicaragua, Kenya
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the poll-watch groups they helped found remained
in place after the election was over, transforming themselves into
good-government watchdog organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a life-and-death choice, almost,'' said Lachmansingh.
``In Guyana, every single year of my life had been lived under an
authoritarian government. I was prepared to die for this. This is
something you have to do. You want your children to grow up and
have a better life than you've had.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if democracy is something of a secular religion these days,
Hassan bridled at a suggestion that it is somehow a particularly
American creed. Democracy, he said, is a political belief that is
every bit as fundamental to an Asian or African.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider that democracy is defined by America only or
that it is biased toward American policy,'' he said. And as it
spreads around the world, he added, it is becoming redefined by its
many new practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that democracy is an American imposition is a not
uncommon misperception, Lachmansingh said. ``You know, your country
has a bad name,'' he told an American reporter. ``People talk about
an American agenda, and you almost always have to deal with that:
Who are you? Are you an American organization? What's your
agenda?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the monitoring groups play many different roles
depending on the situation in each country.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, Hassan said, the priorities were to restore
confidence in the electoral process, to encourage larger-scale
participation and to deter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyana, Lachmansingh's group analyzed and discredited a voter
list so far removed from reality that people made jokes about it.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, where elections were conducted relatively freely,
poll watchers guarded against violence that turned voting days into
a time of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   And after popular unrest forced the resignation of the
autocratic leader Suharto last fall, Indonesia faced most of the
challenges of an emerging democracy: intimidation, fraud,
disorganization and the lack of a culture of free choice. Even now,
with the results of last Monday's vote still not fully tallied, the
possibility of postelection violence hangs over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a very simple but very difficult cultural lesson that
must be learned in order to make free elections work, said Dumaria
Tampubolon, a statistician with Rectors Forum, one of the largest
of 99 local groups that have registered to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
   People must learn to lose,'' she said. Otherwise, elections
simply become the spark for more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers themselves remain at risk from people who have not
yet learned the concept of neutrality, said Smita Notosusanto, the
executive director of a local poll-watch group called Unfrel, which
has fielded about 100,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our volunteers are students, and they are threatened
from both sides,'' she said. ``The police and military in some
areas intimidate our volunteers just because they are students. On
the other side, the biggest challenge right now is that students
are facing threats from their friends who are against the holding
of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, she said, some of these people are right to
mistrust her volunteers. Until they signed up for poll-watch duty,
many of the students were angrily demonstrating against the current
government.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are not prepared to believe that the government
could win in a fair election. ``I'm not sure I can convince my
students to accept the results even if they cannot confirm any
violations,'' Ms. Smita said.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion pronounced himself pleased last week with Indonesia's
experiment in democracy, despite its rough edges. ``Generally
speaking, it was a free and fair and peaceful election,'' he said.
``Now it is up to the Indonesian people to work together to improve
the life of the people. After five more years they can fight
again.''

 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.

<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''

   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When he was a much younger man, Jose
Concepcion once found himself holding up a bullet and peering at it
through his thick glasses. ``They are shooting at us,'' he said,
more incredulous than afraid. That was 13 years ago in the
Philippines, when Concepcion and other partisans of democracy were
learning how to face down a dictator, and how a dictator fights
back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and scores of others are bringing such lessons to
places like Indonesia, applying them and building on them in the
growing number of emerging democracies. One of the founders of the
National Movement for Free Elections, known by the acronym Namfrel,
Concepcion helped end the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
That experience helped him and others fashion a new instrument for
the spread of democracy: the independent, citizen-led
election-watch group.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-monitoring groups sponsored by the United Nations or the
United States or by independent American organizations have become
a fairly familiar sight in countries conducting elections for the
first time. But Concepcion's movement is different: These are
home-grown groups that take it upon themselves to visit neighboring
countries, help them launch democracies, and leave behind similar
home-grown groups to help the fledgling free society grow.
</P>
<P>
   So last week Concepcion was in Jakarta with a Namfrel delegation
keeping an eye on Indonesia's first free election in 44 years and
simultaneously training local poll-watchers to start a
self-sustaining effort here. Also here were scores of men and women
from other nations who were in effect his students.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example set in the Philippines, they had already
helped bring democratic elections to their own countries. Now, like
Concepcion, they were sharing the benefits of their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Feroz Hassan, for example, was here from Bangladesh, where he
helped found the Fair Election Monitoring Alliance in 1995, with
help and advice from Namfrel. ``They brought the idea and gave us
the training,'' he said. Hassan then took his poll-watch experience
to Kenya before coming to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lachmansingh was here from Guyana, where he formed the
Electoral Assistance Bureau in 1991. ``People were getting quite
fed up,'' he said. ``Elections were rigged on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, he too went abroad, helping monitor elections in the
West Bank in 1995, in Sri Lanka in 1996 and 1997 and in Cambodia
last year before coming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the same anywhere you go,'' he said. ``Always in
people's mind is hope and a desire for change and democracy, which
they associate first with democratic elections. People often have
unrealistic expectations, but always there is that basic ingredient
of hope which propels concerned citizens to want to make a
contribution. Call it patriotism, saintliness, bravery _ martyrdom
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious imagery seemed apt. These are today's secular
missionaries, spreading the democratic faith in a time of mass
conversion around the world. They have carried the gospel of
democratic possibilities to places as far-flung as Yemen, Nigeria,
Panama, Taiwan, Romania, Bulgaria, Chile, Haiti, Nicaragua, Kenya
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the poll-watch groups they helped found remained
in place after the election was over, transforming themselves into
good-government watchdog organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a life-and-death choice, almost,'' said Lachmansingh.
``In Guyana, every single year of my life had been lived under an
authoritarian government. I was prepared to die for this. This is
something you have to do. You want your children to grow up and
have a better life than you've had.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if democracy is something of a secular religion these days,
Hassan bridled at a suggestion that it is somehow a particularly
American creed. Democracy, he said, is a political belief that is
every bit as fundamental to an Asian or African.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider that democracy is defined by America only or
that it is biased toward American policy,'' he said. And as it
spreads around the world, he added, it is becoming redefined by its
many new practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that democracy is an American imposition is a not
uncommon misperception, Lachmansingh said. ``You know, your country
has a bad name,'' he told an American reporter. ``People talk about
an American agenda, and you almost always have to deal with that:
Who are you? Are you an American organization? What's your
agenda?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the monitoring groups play many different roles
depending on the situation in each country.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, Hassan said, the priorities were to restore
confidence in the electoral process, to encourage larger-scale
participation and to deter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyana, Lachmansingh's group analyzed and discredited a voter
list so far removed from reality that people made jokes about it.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, where elections were conducted relatively freely,
poll watchers guarded against violence that turned voting days into
a time of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   And after popular unrest forced the resignation of the
autocratic leader Suharto last fall, Indonesia faced most of the
challenges of an emerging democracy: intimidation, fraud,
disorganization and the lack of a culture of free choice. Even now,
with the results of last Monday's vote still not fully tallied, the
possibility of postelection violence hangs over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a very simple but very difficult cultural lesson that
must be learned in order to make free elections work, said Dumaria
Tampubolon, a statistician with Rectors Forum, one of the largest
of 99 local groups that have registered to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
   People must learn to lose,'' she said. Otherwise, elections
simply become the spark for more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers themselves remain at risk from people who have not
yet learned the concept of neutrality, said Smita Notosusanto, the
executive director of a local poll-watch group called Unfrel, which
has fielded about 100,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our volunteers are students, and they are threatened
from both sides,'' she said. ``The police and military in some
areas intimidate our volunteers just because they are students. On
the other side, the biggest challenge right now is that students
are facing threats from their friends who are against the holding
of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, she said, some of these people are right to
mistrust her volunteers. Until they signed up for poll-watch duty,
many of the students were angrily demonstrating against the current
government.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are not prepared to believe that the government
could win in a fair election. ``I'm not sure I can convince my
students to accept the results even if they cannot confirm any
violations,'' Ms. Smita said.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion pronounced himself pleased last week with Indonesia's
experiment in democracy, despite its rough edges. ``Generally
speaking, it was a free and fair and peaceful election,'' he said.
``Now it is up to the Indonesian people to work together to improve
the life of the people. After five more years they can fight
again.''

<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``f I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at

   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder

very natural pinks.

   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a signal week for the West, no doubt about it.
Fifty-four long years after the Holocaust revelations, the United
States and Europe had finally said ``enough,'' and struck a blow
against a revival of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian ethnic cleansers were now routed; ethnic Albanians would
be spared further murders and rapes. Germany was exorcising a few
of its Nazi ghosts. Human rights had been elevated to a military
priority and a pre-eminent Western value.
</P>
<P>
   There was so much to applaud _ European unity, American
technology, British spine, the stiff upper lips of the Greeks and
Italians _ that it was easy to overlook the fact that much of the
world was sitting on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, flush with victory over communism and inhumanity,
think ever more reflexively that their values are the world's. In
economics, that often is true. But to many other nations, the
Kosovo atrocities that Germany equated with its own past and
President Clinton labeled ``vicious'' and ``terrifying'' were just
the broken eggs of yet another national omelet, and the West was a
self-righteous, ever-more-meddlesome cook.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the nations that see Kosovo this way is Russia, and
that is hardly a harbinger of smooth sailing in future efforts to
right moral wrongs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia joined the diplomatic effort to force a Serbian
retreat from Kosovo, giving that effort the final push that allowed
78 days of bombing to end. And afterward, it ostentatiously
insisted on a role in the peacekeeping that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the same thing as saying Russia shares the
West's view that Kosovo is a turning point away from ethnic blood
baths and toward harmony, even if at Western gunpoint. Quite the
opposite: The war only underscored the deep ideological divide
between an idealistic New World bent on ending inhumanity and an
Old World equally fatalistic about unending conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson tried to bridge that gap 81 years ago at
Versailles, and failed. These days, his faith in internationalist
ideals seems to be shared _ at least in their own back yard _ by
the same British, French and Germans who were that day's
nationalist cynics.
</P>
<P>
   Go much beyond Central Europe, however, and the world still
seems rooted at Versailles, dismissing the notion of universal
human rights as wonderful in concept, and a foolish vanity in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   So the anti-West club is a big one _ not just perennial bad
actors like Syria, Libya and Iraq, but rivals like China and even
democracies like Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   They are not motivated by love for Slobodan Milosevic _ by and
large, they also find him and his tactics repulsive _ but by a
conviction that bloodlettings like the one in Kosovo are internal
matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust yourself into
someone else's war; that the safe and even humane course for the
world usually is to let the two sides duke it out alone.
</P>
<P>
   Put baldly, there is also a yawning gap between the West and
much of the world on the value of a single life. Much of the world
is still Hobbesian, looking to strongmen to impose order on lives
that are nasty, brutish and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the concept that the state as an entity is much more
important than the life of one human being,'' said Yevgenia Albats,
an author and independent journalist who writes about human rights
issues here. ``Pinochet is a hero in the press here. For a lot of
writers, the fact that he killed 100,000 people before Chile had
its economic miracle is just not a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The West finds such views alien. But this war's epiphany may be
that a lot of people around the world who drink Guinness, buy IBM
preferred and drive Audis just don't buy into Western notions of
rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Russians, who by temperament, history and current
attitudes are proving themselves the great case study for such
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only different countries; we're living in different
dimensions,'' Leonid Dobrokhotov, an informal adviser to the
Russian Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said in a recent
interview. ``We have a completely different understanding of
values. We're a very independent-minded people. Yes, maybe Saddam
Hussein is the wrong guy. But let him live in his own country. If
the Iraqis like it, it's their business. If they want to take him
away and hang him, it's also their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has absorbed this ideological slap in the face
before, most recently from the Chinese. But the United States
expects rebuffs from dictatorships like China. It is those
new-found democrats, the Russians, who brought the message home in
capital letters by turning overnight from ideological soulmates to
embittered critics.
</P>
<P>
   The first, most familiar explanation was that the Russians are
the historic big Slavic brother to the Serbs. But that is only part
of the story, and maybe not a big part. Moscow and Belgrade, after
all, were estranged for most of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   No, more is at play here. In the words of the Russian government
_ and in the minds of many ordinary Russians _ it was NATO, not the
Milosevic regime, that was a criminal organization, and NATO's air
war, not ethnic cleansing, that was a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Russian backlash is rooted in part in Moscow's
frustration at having to stand idly by at the drubbing of a country
in its own back yard by its former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans to view Moscow's anger as purely a political
temper tantrum would be as mistaken as it is for Russians to view
Kosovo as a Western land grab. For the truth is that Russians see
Milosevic and Kosovo through an entirely different lens from the
United States and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cleansing and forced migration are not exactly unknowns
to Russians. Pogroms forced 1.5 million Russian Jews to flee at the
turn of the century. And Nikita Khrushchev forcibly moved so many
Russians to Kazakhstan that by 1959 native Kazakhs made up less
than a third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   From Stalin on, Soviet policy was to dilute the Soviet Union's
80-odd ethnic groups by moving Russian citizens onto their
territories, evicting them from homelands and drawing borders so as
to split large ethnic groups in two.
</P>
<P>
   Those carefully planned policies went south when the Soviet
Union began to collapse, and nationalist strongmen began to take
control. In 1988, U.N. officials say, a half-million Armenians and
Azerbaijanis were driven back to homelands in each others' nations.
In 1989, 60,000 Meskhetian Turks were forced out of Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan. In 1992 the Ossetians threw out tens of thousands of
Inguish; hundreds of thousands of Tajiks fled Tajikistan. In 1995
scores of thousands died in a civil war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russians rapidly _ and correctly _ point out that these frenzies
of ethnic retribution went virtually unnoticed by ordinary
Westerners, and drew little more than hand-wringing from Western
governments. And they wonder what is so different about Yugoslavia.

   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're

Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,

C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment

 MOSCOW: about Yugoslavia.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Look at the leaders of almost all the newly independent
states,'' said Sergei Rogov, the director of the government's
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. ``Like Milosevic, they used to
be leaders of the Communist Party before the collapse of
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you look at how they treat the ethnic minorities in the
newly independent states, you'll see that Milosevic fits the
pattern,'' he added. ``He's not perceived as something
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Western Europe he is. Of course part of that is because
Serbia is so close. Even as he declared victory on Thursday,
Clinton added a caveat to the lessons of Kosovo for future ethnic
cleansers: The world will act, he said, when ``we can do something
about it.'' But here, too, even more is at play.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat, democratization and integration into Europe brought the
Germans full circle. Unchecked slaughter in Bosnia and Rwanda
shamed their neighbors into action. And now Western Europe has no
stomach to watch Milosevic revive the bad memories, setting off
ethnic expulsion and slaughters to consolidate the power of Serbs
who don't like their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a step forward or a foolish vanity? Kosovo will be safe
for Albanians, it seems, which is what 78 days of bombing were all
about.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows how many will return. Milosevic remains
entrenched in Belgrade. Russia, burning at the popular notion that
it has been a shill for NATO, is balking at Western efforts to
oversee peacekeeping. And there is a new danger that radical
Albanians will exact revenge on ordinary Serbs, starting the cycle
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the Old World argument _ everyone does it, the world
works this way, a few thousand Serbs or Albanians aren't important,
it's none of our business _ seem almost attractive, even logical.
It is not hard to envision the Russians nodding and saying, ``Told
you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to remember, however, that in attitude, if not behavior,
Russia today is roughly where Britain, Germany and France were 81
years ago. It took World War II to change the West's mind about
inhumanity, and 50 years more to make that change of mind a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albats, the journalist, says her nation needs time, too.
``This is still imperial Russia,'' she said. ``It's still the
Soviet Union. The generation ruling this nation grew up in the
Soviet Union, and you can't expect people to change their minds the
way you change a rule on private property. But another generation

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a signal week for the West, no doubt about it.
Fifty-four long years after the Holocaust revelations, the United
States and Europe had finally said ``enough,'' and struck a blow
against a revival of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian ethnic cleansers were now routed; ethnic Albanians would
be spared further murders and rapes. Germany was exorcising a few
of its Nazi ghosts. Human rights had been elevated to a military
priority and a pre-eminent Western value.
</P>
<P>
   There was so much to applaud _ European unity, American
technology, British spine, the stiff upper lips of the Greeks and
Italians _ that it was easy to overlook the fact that much of the
world was sitting on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, flush with victory over communism and inhumanity,
think ever more reflexively that their values are the world's. In
economics, that often is true. But to many other nations, the
Kosovo atrocities that Germany equated with its own past and
President Clinton labeled ``vicious'' and ``terrifying'' were just
the broken eggs of yet another national omelet, and the West was a
self-righteous, ever-more-meddlesome cook.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the nations that see Kosovo this way is Russia, and
that is hardly a harbinger of smooth sailing in future efforts to
right moral wrongs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia joined the diplomatic effort to force a Serbian
retreat from Kosovo, giving that effort the final push that allowed
78 days of bombing to end. And afterward, it ostentatiously
insisted on a role in the peacekeeping that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the same thing as saying Russia shares the
West's view that Kosovo is a turning point away from ethnic blood
baths and toward harmony, even if at Western gunpoint. Quite the
opposite: The war only underscored the deep ideological divide
between an idealistic New World bent on ending inhumanity and an
Old World equally fatalistic about unending conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson tried to bridge that gap 81 years ago at
Versailles, and failed. These days, his faith in internationalist
ideals seems to be shared _ at least in their own back yard _ by
the same British, French and Germans who were that day's
nationalist cynics.
</P>
<P>
   Go much beyond Central Europe, however, and the world still
seems rooted at Versailles, dismissing the notion of universal
human rights as wonderful in concept, and a foolish vanity in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   So the anti-West club is a big one _ not just perennial bad
actors like Syria, Libya and Iraq, but rivals like China and even
democracies like Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   They are not motivated by love for Slobodan Milosevic _ by and
large, they also find him and his tactics repulsive _ but by a
conviction that bloodlettings like the one in Kosovo are internal
matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust yourself into
someone else's war; that the safe and even humane course for the
world usually is to let the two sides duke it out alone.
</P>
<P>
   Put baldly, there is also a yawning gap between the West and
much of the world on the value of a single life. Much of the world
is still Hobbesian, looking to strongmen to impose order on lives
that are nasty, brutish and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the concept that the state as an entity is much more
important than the life of one human being,'' said Yevgenia Albats,
an author and independent journalist who writes about human rights
issues here. ``Pinochet is a hero in the press here. For a lot of
writers, the fact that he killed 100,000 people before Chile had
its economic miracle is just not a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The West finds such views alien. But this war's epiphany may be
that a lot of people around the world who drink Guinness, buy IBM
preferred and drive Audis just don't buy into Western notions of
rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Russians, who by temperament, history and current
attitudes are proving themselves the great case study for such
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only different countries; we're living in different
dimensions,'' Leonid Dobrokhotov, an informal adviser to the
Russian Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said in a recent
interview. ``We have a completely different understanding of
values. We're a very independent-minded people. Yes, maybe Saddam
Hussein is the wrong guy. But let him live in his own country. If
the Iraqis like it, it's their business. If they want to take him
away and hang him, it's also their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has absorbed this ideological slap in the face
before, most recently from the Chinese. But the United States
expects rebuffs from dictatorships like China. It is those
new-found democrats, the Russians, who brought the message home in
capital letters by turning overnight from ideological soulmates to
embittered critics.
</P>
<P>
   The first, most familiar explanation was that the Russians are
the historic big Slavic brother to the Serbs. But that is only part
of the story, and maybe not a big part. Moscow and Belgrade, after
all, were estranged for most of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   No, more is at play here. In the words of the Russian government
_ and in the minds of many ordinary Russians _ it was NATO, not the
Milosevic regime, that was a criminal organization, and NATO's air
war, not ethnic cleansing, that was a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Russian backlash is rooted in part in Moscow's
frustration at having to stand idly by at the drubbing of a country
in its own back yard by its former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans to view Moscow's anger as purely a political
temper tantrum would be as mistaken as it is for Russians to view
Kosovo as a Western land grab. For the truth is that Russians see
Milosevic and Kosovo through an entirely different lens from the
United States and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cleansing and forced migration are not exactly unknowns
to Russians. Pogroms forced 1.5 million Russian Jews to flee at the
turn of the century. And Nikita Khrushchev forcibly moved so many
Russians to Kazakhstan that by 1959 native Kazakhs made up less
than a third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   From Stalin on, Soviet policy was to dilute the Soviet Union's
80-odd ethnic groups by moving Russian citizens onto their
territories, evicting them from homelands and drawing borders so as
to split large ethnic groups in two.
</P>
<P>
   Those carefully planned policies went south when the Soviet
Union began to collapse, and nationalist strongmen began to take
control. In 1988, U.N. officials say, a half-million Armenians and
Azerbaijanis were driven back to homelands in each others' nations.
In 1989, 60,000 Meskhetian Turks were forced out of Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan. In 1992 the Ossetians threw out tens of thousands of
Inguish; hundreds of thousands of Tajiks fled Tajikistan. In 1995
scores of thousands died in a civil war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russians rapidly _ and correctly _ point out that these frenzies
of ethnic retribution went virtually unnoticed by ordinary
Westerners, and drew little more than hand-wringing from Western
governments. And they wonder what is so different about Yugoslavia.

<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's
manager said, noting Thursdays are traditionally the busiest for
his store, which is on the corner of Wisconsin and M Streets. ``By
9 or 10, the crowd is wall to wall. It's like daytime on Fifth
Avenue in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddled outside Georgetown Park Mall, Washington natives Ariel
Sutro and Stephanie Seems weren't quite sure where to head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something cool in the window at night, you're like,
`Wow! Let's go in,''' Seems explained.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and
until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a pair of just-purchased Kenneth Cole open-toed heels,
Sutro noted, ``It's pleasant and convenient to shop at night.
Especially in the nice weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mana and Maha Yamany said they were ``too sleepy'' during
the day to brave the throngs in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dark it's more relaxing and interesting,'' Mana said.
``We look at the clothes we want, think about it and then there's a
reason to go back.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last eight years, the United States' economic boom,
which has made so many Americans rich and self-confident, has been
noteworthy for those it has left out: the people at the bottom of
the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that's changed. Unemployment rates among blacks and
Hispanic people, though still high compared with that for whites,
are at or near record lows. Joblessness among high school dropouts
has fallen to about half the rate in 1992. And wages for the lowest
paid are rising faster than inflation for the first time in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   That's important because the last generation produced an
underclass of people so poor, discouraged and alienated that they
were thought to exist almost outside the general economy. The
conventional wisdom has been that the country could get richer or
poorer, and the number of jobs could rise or fall, but a large
swath of the poor would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently that wisdom held true, but now prosperity is
trickling down to the underclass. Imagine that the economy
continues to flourish. The question then becomes how far down the
ladder economic benefits will reach. Economists aren't sure, but
they are gathering statistical tidbits, tossing in some educated
hunches and producing some interesting predictions, however
tentative.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the nation's stunning 4.2 percent unemployment rate,
which is lower than at any time since the late 1960s, when the
economy was artificially buoyed by government spending on the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps overall unemployment cannot fall much more, no matter
how tight the labor market becomes. The number of workers who are
temporarily unemployed appears to have been squeezed to a minimum.
And many of the long-term unemployed _ those who persistently look
for work but can't find it _ will remain unattractive to employers
no matter how big the boom.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another category of people, including single
mothers and young black men with few skills and little education,
who appear willing to seize the new opportunities that a robust
economy is creating.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the best economic conditions, there are people who
are temporarily out of work. At any moment, some workers quit their
jobs. Others get fired. Students and spouses leave school and home
to find their first jobs. All these people need time to find
attractive jobs. Economists call this frictional unemployment and
say it is a necessary feature of labor markets and nothing to fret
about.
</P>
<P>
   In the supercharged economy of the 1960s, about 2 percent of the
labor force was unemployed for fewer than five weeks. Today the
percentage is about the same. So perhaps the time between jobs for
qualified workers has contracted as much as it can, suggesting that
further economic growth will produce little additional employment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hall of Stanford University, after studying business
cycles and current unemployment data, has concluded, ``Anyone who
wants a job and is plausibly attractive to employers can find a job
within a half-dozen weeks of searching.'' This may sound cavalier,
given the fact that about 5 million people say they can't find
suitable work. But economists across the political spectrum share
Hall's view.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the long-term unemployed _ those who can't get
hired even in the tightest labor markets. These people may be
poorly educated, or have spotty work records or a history of crime.
They may live in urban areas too far from suburban jobs for which
they might qualify.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many of the long-term unemployed would find
work if the economy continues to prosper. In the late 1960s, about
0.2 percent of the work force was unemployed for six months or
more. Today the figure is three times as high. This suggests that a
healthy economy alone may be incapable of reducing long-term
unemployment to the levels achieved in the 1960s. This group might
need other kinds of help like government-provided training or
subsidized jobs, though the record of such programs is hardly
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   But if statistics for the temporary and long-term unemployed
suggest that joblessness may have been driven as low as it can go,
another jobless category appears to hold promise: the non-employed.
</P>
<P>
   This group includes all the unemployed plus those who don't
bother looking for work and thus aren't counted among the jobless.
These people may choose not to work, or may be physically or
mentally incapable of holding jobs. Or they may be discouraged from
seeking work because employers constantly reject their applications
or because they are offered inadequate wages.
</P>
<P>
   Among men aged 25 to 55, the non-employment rate is about 11
percent, compared with about 6 percent during the 1960s. Since
there is no strong evidence that the rate of physical and mental
disability has risen, it's worth asking whether the extra 5
percentage points _ several million people _ can be helped by a
growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Topel and Kevin Murphy of the University of Chicago think
so. They say that most of those who dropped out of the labor force
since the 1960s were low-skilled workers who gave up looking for
jobs, because of plummeting wages.
</P>
<P>
   Among men without a college education, wages have fallen about
25 percent over the past 25 years after inflation is taken into
account. But for the last two years wages for these workers have
risen by 2 percent or 3 percent after inflation. Further economic
expansion could bring a continued rise in pay and an attractive
alternative for millions who have left the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists are more skeptical. A recent study by Richard
Freeman of Harvard University and William Rodgers III of the
College of William and Mary found that even in areas of the country
with very tight labor markets, overall non-employment rates barely
budged throughout the 1990s. That might suggest that relatively few
nonworking Americans would be drawn to work by an expanding
economy.

   ``Look at the leaders of almost all the newly independent
states,'' said Sergei Rogov, the director of the government's
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. ``Like Milosevic, they used to
be leaders of the Communist Party before the collapse of
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you look at how they treat the ethnic minorities in the
newly independent states, you'll see that Milosevic fits the
pattern,'' he added. ``He's not perceived as something
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Western Europe he is. Of course part of that is because
Serbia is so close. Even as he declared victory on Thursday,
Clinton added a caveat to the lessons of Kosovo for future ethnic
cleansers: The world will act, he said, when ``we can do something
about it.'' But here, too, even more is at play.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat, democratization and integration into Europe brought the
Germans full circle. Unchecked slaughter in Bosnia and Rwanda
shamed their neighbors into action. And now Western Europe has no
stomach to watch Milosevic revive the bad memories, setting off
ethnic expulsion and slaughters to consolidate the power of Serbs
who don't like their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a step forward or a foolish vanity? Kosovo will be safe
for Albanians, it seems, which is what 78 days of bombing were all
about.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows how many will return. Milosevic remains
entrenched in Belgrade. Russia, burning at the popular notion that
it has been a shill for NATO, is balking at Western efforts to
oversee peacekeeping. And there is a new danger that radical
Albanians will exact evenge on ordinary Serbs, starting the cycle
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the Old World argument _ everyone does it, the world
works this way, a few thousand Serbs or Albanians aren't important,
it's none of our business _ seem almost attractive, even logical.
It is not hard to envision the Russians nodding and saying, ``Told
you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to remember, however, that in attitude, if not behavior,
Russia today is roughly where Britain, Germany and France were 81
years ago. It took World War II to change the West's mind about
inhumanity, and 50 years more to make that change of mind a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albats, the journalist, says her nation needs time, too.
``This is still imperial Russia,'' she said. ``It's still the
Soviet Union. The generation ruling this nation grew up in the
Soviet Union, and you can't expect people to change their minds the
way you change a rule on private property. But another generation
is coming.''

 UNDATED: expanding economy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution notes that income
and other types of support for nonworking people, like disability
insurance payments, are much higher now than in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freeman-Rodgers study cites one group that has made
significant gains in tight labor markets: young black men without a
college education, whose non-employment rate fell from 48 percent
to 36 percent between 1992 and 1998. Though adult men barely
registered gains in employment or earnings in the regions with
tight labor markets, the earnings of young men _ including blacks
without a college education _ rose by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that a long extended boom can go a long way
to resolving the African-American youth employment problem,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Burtless points to another disadvantaged group that has been
helped by the robust economy: single mothers, whose non-employment
rate fell from 43 percent to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. Burtless
says that sharp improvement is a result in part of welfare reform
but also of a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one encouraging reading of the tea leaves, even if it's
unlikely that overall unemployment will dip much further: Those
groups in the worst economic shape _ unskilled young black men and
single mothers _ respond well to tight labor markets and would
benefit from future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And economists note that as more young black men and single
mothers are absorbed into the labor force, they will gain work
experience that will prove attractive to future employers and help
them weather the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has started to do for these groups what
government training programs have not accomplished: provide
substantially higher earnings and employment. And if the economic
boom continues for a few years, there is a chance it will do
wonders for the disadvantaged workers who need help the most.

   Below, top retailers cite the hottest beauty products on

pretty is the favored beauty philosophy. And don't forget the color
pink and skin care that puts you at ease.

   &UR; SAKS FIFTH AVENUE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Deborah Walters, vice president, divisional merchandise manager for
cosmetics and fragrance. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and
really appealing. Perfumes Isabell is a huge business. We also like
Anna Sui, both in color and fragrance, and Angel Innocent.
 &UR; HAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hair care is a high-growth area. Especially great is the new
Frederic Fekkai Sun Protectant Spray with shea butter and items
from Phytologie and J.F. Lazartigue.

 &UR; Dale Crichton, executive vice president of cosmetics. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're seeing a lot of sheer washes of color and a lot of pink. A
good example is Lancome's spring collection, Candide, which
includes trios of pastel eye shadows. We think the blue shade is
very easy to wear. Good lip glosses to try are Bobbi Brown Lip
Shine and Prescriptives Grace Lipgloss.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're hearing a lot about treating dull, stressed skin.
Prescriptives Vibrant brightens tired skin and gives you a rested

Essence. Lancome Hydra Zen corrects skin imbalances caused by
stress.

 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big trend is a blushed and dewy face with natural-toned
lips. Bronzers continue to be very important and our favorite
bronzers include Guerlain Terracotta and Bobbi Brown Bronze Sticks.
For a natural and fresh look, we like Chantecaille Real Skin cream
foundation. As for color, Paula Dorf lip glosses in soft pinks are
nice, as is Laura Mercier's new powder blush in Cedar Rose.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simple regimes are important for skin, with an emphasis on
products rich in nutrients. We like Estee Lauder Renutriv Intensive
Lift Body Creme, which is chock-full of goodies that firm and
moisturize the body. Others that we like, and that are exclusive to
Bergdorf Goodman, include Jo Malone Skincare and Leanne Hirsh
Skincare with marine extracts.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fragrances are becoming more full-bodied. Some that we like
include Geoffrey Beene, S.T. DuPont, Fable and Lucien LeLong, whose
flacon incorporates a working timepiece.

</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest messages is the color pink, from pink
mascara to a pink face shimmer from Bobbi Brown that's exclusive to
Neiman Marcus. Versace has a new foundation that's beautiful. It
looks like a really expensive jar of cream. The Versace mascara is
also a really good product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about technology in skin care, especially
from Awake. People are also adding serums to their routines,
particularly from ReVive, La Prairie and Creme de la Mer. Also
important in skin care are Eve Lom Dynamite Lotion, Sisley's masks
and Lancome Oligo Minerale, exclusive to Neiman Marcus in the U.S.

   Pink will carry us through the summer, as will shine around the

<P>
   We're so excited about the Mario Badescu skin-care line. It has
minimal packaging and is really basic, but it works. It has an

   Last season's berry thing is gone and the glitter thing is gone.
Instead, there's lots of shimmer, such as the Stila All Over
Shimmer. Nars Galaxy Girl lipstick and Stila Kitten eye shadow are
shot with gold and give a very warm look for summer. A line that I
know will do very well is T. LeClerc. It's very sophisticated and
the packaging is gorgeous. Body &AMP; Soul's lip glosses are amazing _

   Below, top retailers cite the hottest beauty products on
counters near you _ and they named names. The consensus? Low-key
pretty is the favored beauty philosophy. And don't forget the color
pink and skin care that puts you at ease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAKS FIFTH AVENUE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Deborah Walters, vice president, divisional merchandise manager for
cosmetics and fragrance. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and
really appealing. Perfumes Isabell is a huge business. We also like
Anna Sui, both in color and fragrance, and Angel Innocent.
 &UR; HAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hair care is a high-growth area. Especially great is the new
Frederic Fekkai Sun Protectant Spray with shea butter and items
from Phytologie and J.F. Lazartigue.

   &UR; NORDSTROM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Dale Crichton, executive vice president of cosmetics. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're seeing a lot of sheer washes of color and a lot of pink. A
good example is Lancome's spring collection, Candide, which
includes trios of pastel eye shadows. We think the blue shade is
very easy to wear. Good lip glosses to try are Bobbi Brown Lip
Shine and Prescriptives Grace Lipgloss.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're hearing a lot about treating dull, stressed skin.
Prescriptives Vibrant brightens tired skin and gives you a rested
and healthy glow, as does the Shiseido Bioperformance Clarifying
Essence. Lancome Hydra Zen corrects skin imbalances caused by
stress.
</P>

 &UR; Vicki Haupt, senior vice president and general merchandise
manager. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big trend is a blushed and dewy face with natural-toned
lips. Bronzers continue to be very important and our favorite
bronzers include Guerlain Terracotta and Bobbi Brown Bronze Sticks.
For a natural and fresh look, we like Chantecaille Real Skin cream
foundation. As for color, Paula Dorf lip glosses in soft pinks are
nice, as is Laura Mercier's new powder blush in Cedar Rose.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simple regimes are important for skin, with an emphasis on
products rich in nutrients. We like Estee Lauder Renutriv Intensive
Lift Body Creme, which is chock-full of goodies that firm and
moisturize the body. Others that we like, and that are exclusive to
Bergdorf Goodman, include Jo Malone Skincare and Leanne Hirsh
Skincare with marine extracts.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fragrances are becoming more full-bodied. Some that we like
include Geoffrey Beene, S.T. DuPont, Fable and Lucien LeLong, whose
flacon incorporates a working timepiece.

 &UR; Leslie Faust, vice president, divisional merchandise manager of
cosmetics and fragrances. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest messages is the color pink, from pink
mascara to a pink face shimmer from Bobbi Brown that's exclusive to
Neiman Marcus. Versace has a new foundation that's beautiful. It
looks like a really expensive jar of cream. The Versace mascara is
also a really good product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're very excited about technology in skin care, especially
from Awake. People are also adding serums to their routines,
particularly from ReVive, La Prairie and Creme de la Mer. Also
important in skin care are Eve Lom Dynamite Lotion, Sisley's masks
and Lancome Oligo Minerale, exclusive to Neiman Marcus in the U.S.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're really excited about Fresh, including its Index and Life
fragrances, and about Creed.

<P>
   Pink will carry us through the summer, as will shine around the
eyes and around the face. Our Trish McEvoy business continues to
grow, especially her beauty ``planners.'' Laura Mercier's Secret
Camouflage concealer is her best-selling product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're so excited about the Mario Badescu skin-care line. It has
minimal packaging and is really basic, but it works. It has an
incredible cult following in New York, and it's our No. 1 requested
skin-care line. Also exciting are Recipes for the Skin treatment
products and the Bliss Spa dine.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   From New York, the city that never sleeps, to Los Angeles, the
city that never walks, after-dark shopping _ from about 9 p.m.
until as late as 2 a.m. in some cases _ is becoming more popular.
It seems to be happening in urban locations, apparently among
younger shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, shopping has become part of an evening's
entertainment, something to do between dinner out and club-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the nocturnal shopping habits of consumers in
New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stores along lower Broadway like Antique
Boutique, Yellow Rat Bastard, Canal Jeans, Urban Outfitters and
Joyce Leslie, which stay open until at least 9 p.m. during the
week, retailers in surrounding neighborhoods are keeping their
doors open longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy Girl Lifestyle, which recently opened on LaGuardia Place
in Greenwich Village, does business until 10 p.m. from Mondays to
Wednesdays and until midnight and later, depending on the traffic,
the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which carries apparel, accessories, cosmetics and
home accessories and caters to a young, hip customer, benefits from
its proximity to New York University and does a brisk business with
students, according to owner Corinne Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really happy to find a cool store that's open after
hours,'' said Purdy, who does much of her business between 9 p.m.
and 11 p.m. ``They are just going out to dinner or are on their way
back from the bars or going to the clubs. They may prefer to shop
at night because it's part of their night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said she has seen customers walk out as late as midnight
with complete outfits _ the same merchandise people buy during the
day. Top sellers at night are clothes by Hybrid, messenger bags,
Buddha T-shirts and aromatic candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working all day, I don't have time to shop,'' said
Yvonne Okoh, 21, a Colgate University physics major who was
visiting an NYU friend, as she eyed a skirt by Hybrid. ``It's great
to be able to stop in a place like this and pick up something for
the club when all the other stores are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village and on the Lower East Side, young people
roam the streets at night looking for high-fashion vintage clothes
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite nighttime destinations are Village Scandal on East
Seventh Street, Candy Store on Second Avenue and Marmalade on
Ludlow Street, all of which stay open late on weekends _ as long as
there are customers trickling in from neighboring bars or
restaurants. That can be as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something decadent and exciting about shopping at
night,'' said Billie Madley, a co-owner of Marmalade. ``We've seen
this place turn into a sort of nightclub of shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Madley said her nighttime clientele is largely young, barhopping
and ready to snap up any trends in fashion. Presently, items from
the late '70s and early '80s are doing particularly well _
reconstructed denim skirts, embroidered hippie tops and dyed slips,
which range in price from $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOS ANGELES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Diesel USA, located on the hip, happening Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica, the music is groovy, the decor is cool
(mint and white) and customers are encouraged to shop till they
drop, which can be as late as 11 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   According to manager Carol McNairy, shoppers tend to be under
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of couples out for dinner. They're pretty relaxed.
They mosey around and take their time. They're impulse shoppers,''
McNairy said. ``Surprisingly, we don't get a lot of returns.''
</P>
<P>
   An average Diesel outfit runs $125 to $155 for something like a
T-shirt and a pair of Walling antique dirty-denim jeans or a pair
of Kannoth cotton cargo pants with drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   For the more fashion-hungry, there is the StyleLab section,
where a pair of polyurethane-treated linen pants is $199 and a sexy
jersey skirt and top costs $250.
</P>
<P>
   High-end sexy merchandise is the house specialty at Undercover,
another late-night destination. Beneath a chandelier and a replica
of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is an artful selection of
lingerie, jewelry, shoes, dressy separates and dresses bearing such
labels as Plein Sud, Yigal-Azrouel and Mark Wong Nark.
</P>
<P>
   A typical outfit _ dress and shoes or dress and jewelry _ might
run $500 to $600. But Adam Shaffer, owner of Undercover, is
currently ``trying to appeal to younger girls'' by offering
lower-priced prom dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's
manager said, noting Thursdays are traditionally the busiest for
his store, which is on the corner of Wisconsin and M Streets. ``By
9 or 10, the crowd is wall to wall. It's like daytime on Fifth
Avenue in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddled outside Georgetown Park Mall, Washington natives Ariel
Sutro and Stephanie Seems weren't quite sure where to head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something cool in the window at night, you're like,
`Wow! Let's go in,''' Seems explained.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and
until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a pair of just-purchased Kenneth Cole open-toed heels,
Sutro noted, ``It's pleasant and convenient to shop at night.
Especially in the nice weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mana and Maha Yamany said they were ``too sleepy'' during
the day to brave the throngs in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dark it's more relaxing and interesting,'' Mana said.
``We look at the clothes we want, think about it and then there's a
reason to go back.'' &QL;

   ``They are paying an average of $250 for slim, elegant dresses
in beautiful colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week his latenight customers are mostly locals _ on
weekends, they're mostly tourists, according to Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a girlfriends' night out. They've had a glass
of wine or two and it's time to play dress-up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, the girlfriends were Brenda Roos, a flight
attendant, and Susan Steinman, a medical sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Roos, an established customer, said she was shopping past
Shaffer's official closing time, which is 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll offer to stay open for me. That's just an awesome
convenience,'' she said. ``I love the atmosphere and walking up and
down the street.''
</P>

   ``With the weather being pleasant and with less traffic in the
evening, we're always busy at night,'' according to a manager at
Urban Outfitters on M Street in Georgetown. ``This store always has
a mix of all different kinds of people shopping at night _
tourists, neighborhood people and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have people running in at the last minute in the
evening, picking up gifts for a party or birthday,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Outfitters is open until 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays,
11 p.m. on Saturdays and 9 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Allen and Kristen Cioffi jetted in from Harrisonburg, Va.,
for an evening in Georgetown. The James Madison University
undergrads made a night of it, visiting Urban Outfitters, Banana
Republic, French Connection and Kenneth Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in Georgetown at night is spectacular, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nighttime shopping is getting better and better,'' said a
manager at Banana Republic. He said the bulk of customers at night
were students and young professionals who had gone to dinner, but
weren't ready to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is open until 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays,
until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 8 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-work crew is our prime evening customers,'' reported
a manager at the Ralph Lauren store. ``Usually they know what they
want; they've checked out the market and know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get in the mood at night,'' Banana Republic's
manager said, noting Thursdays are traditionally the busiest for
his store, which is on the corner of Wisconsin and M Streets. ``By
9 or 10, the crowd is wall to wall. It's like daytime on Fifth
Avenue in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddled outside Georgetown Park Mall, Washington natives Ariel
Sutro and Stephanie Seems weren't quite sure where to head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something cool in the window at night, you're like,
`Wow! Let's go in,''' Seems explained.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is open until 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and
until 6 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a pair of just-purchased Kenneth Cole open-toed heels,
Sutro noted, ``It's pleasant and convenient to shop at night.
Especially in the nice weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mana and Maha Yamany said they were ``too sleepy'' during
the day to brave the throngs in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dark it's more relaxing and interesting,'' Mana said.
``We look at the clothes we want, think about it and then there's a
reason to go back.'' &QL;

pretty is the favored beauty philosophy. And don't forget the color
pink and skin care that puts you at ease.

 &UR; COLOR &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   We're very excited about Nars Face Glow shimmer. It makes you
look like you just came out of the sun. Also, the Guerlain
Terracotta Shiny Shine in bronze or gold imparts a healthy,
sun-kissed look. From Stila, Convertible Color tinted cream for
lips and cheeks, All Over Shimmer and Illuminating Powder
Foundation are wonderful. Trish McEvoy's Girly collection features
very natural pinks.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of growth in the mask category, and they're
popular for a wide age group. We like Sisley Radiant Glow Express
Mask with Clays for cleansing and Express Flower Gel for hydrating,
toning and firming. We also see growth hormones as the next vitamin
C. One we especially like is Osmotics Kinetin, which is made with
plant growth hormones. We're having very good response to American
Vitamin Company, Philosophy, Christian Dior Vitalmine and Lancome
Hydra Zen. Interesting and new is Talika, an eyelash treatment
product with liposomes that claims to help grow lashes. There's
also Source Ocean nail and hand care and Danielle Netelle's
AntiDistress Lotion.
 &UR; FRAGRANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Lempicka is unique and the packaging is whimsical and
really appealing. Perfumes Isabell is a huge business. We also like
Anna Sui, both in color and fragrance, and Angel Innocent.
 &UR; HAIR &LR;  &QL;

   Hair care is a high-growth area. Especially great is the new

<P>
   We're seeing a lot of sheer washes of color and a lot of pink. A
good example is Lancome's spring collection, Candide, which
includes trios of pastel eye shadows. We think the blue shade is
very easy to wear. Good lip glosses to try are Bobbi Brown Lip
Shine and Prescriptives Grace Lipgloss.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're hearing a lot about treating dull, stressed skin.
Prescriptives Vibrant brightens tired skin and gives you a rested

Essence. Lancome Hydra Zen corrects skin imbalances caused by
stress.

   The big trend is a blushed and dewy face with natural-toned
lips. Bronzers continue to be very important and our favorite
bronzers include Guerlain Terracotta and Bobbi Brown Bronze Sticks.
For a natural and fresh look, we like Chantecaille Real Skin cream
foundation. As for color, Paula Dorf lip glosses in soft pinks are
nice, as is Laura Mercier's new powder blush in Cedar Rose.

   Simple regimes are important for skin, with an emphasis on
products rich in nutrients. We like Estee Lauder Renutriv Intensive

Bergdorf Goodman, include Jo Malone Skincare and Leanne Hirsh
Skincare with marine extracts.

   One of the strongest messages is the color pink, from pink
mascara to a pink face shimmer from Bobbi Brown that's exclusive to
Neiman Marcus. Versace has a new foundation that's beautiful. It
looks like a really expensive jar of cream. The Versace mascara is
also a really good product.
 &UR; SKIN &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   We're very excited about technology in skin care, especially
from Awake. People are also adding serums to their routines,

   We're so excited about the Mario Badescu skin-care line. It has

   Last season's berry thing is gone and the glitter thing is gone.
Instead, there's lots of shimmer, such as the Stila All Over
Shimmer. Nars Galaxy Girl lipstick and Stila Kitten eye shadow are
shot with gold and give a very warm look for summer. A line that I
know will do very well is T. LeClerc. It's very sophisticated and
the packaging is gorgeous. Body &AMP; Soul's lip glosses are amazing _
really shiny, but they don't move around _ and their loose powder
is really nice. Also exciting is the Anna Sui color collection and
Origins As Good As It Gets.

   Even with no new product introductions, Kiehl's never seems to

   Moviegoers who were recently seduced by the lyricism of
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' will see
a starkly different side of William Shakespeare in ``Titus'' (short
for ``Titus Andronicus''), starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica
Lange and directed by Julie Taymor. With more than a dozen murders,
assorted dismemberments and the emperor Saturninus sitting down to
a pie made from the bodies of his stepsons, ``Titus'' is
Shakespeare's goriest play and, many critics feel, his worst. T.S.
Eliot described it as ``one of the stupidest and most uninspired
plays ever written.'' A 1923 production of ``Titus'' at the Old Vic
was laughed off the stage. Observations on the play and
disputations on its authorship over the centuries follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   The Naysayers
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Down through the centuries, many members of the literati have
argued that Shakespeare could not have written something as awful
as ``Titus.'' One early disbeliever was Edward Ravenscroft, a
playwright whose comments appeared in the bowdlerized version of
the play that he published in 1687. (Shakespeare died in 1616.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I think it a greater theft to Rob the dead of their Praise than
the Living of their Money. That I may not appear Guilty of such a
Crime, 'tis necessary I should acquaint you, that there is a Play
in Mr. Shakespears Volume under the name of Titus Andronicus, from
whence I drew part of this. I have been told by some anciently
conversant with the Stage, that it was not Originally his, but
brought by a private Authour to be Acted, and he only gave some
Master-touches to one or two of the Principal Parts of Characters;
this I am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and
indigested piece in all his Works; It seems rather a heap of
Rubbish than a Structure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Titus Andronicus'' for the ``Shakespeare in Performance''
series (Manchester University Press, 1989), Alan C. Dessen noted
some of Ravenscroft's major changes. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most of these moments involve on-stage violence or images that
can elicit unwanted audience laughter. ... Rather than cutting off
his hand on-stage, this Titus exits with an executioner and
re-enters ``with his hand off'' ... The problematic exeunt in
III.i, in which Titus and Marcus each carries a head and Lavinia is
directed to carry the hand in her mouth, is avoided when the boy
Junius, asked to ``share in this Ceremony,'' is ordered to ``bring
thou that hand _ and help thy handless Aunt.'' The bloodiest moment
in Shakespeare's script, the on-stage murders of Chiron and
Demetrius with Lavinia holding a basin to catch their blood, is not
witnessed by the audience; rather, Titus appears afterward ``like
an Executioner'' with a bloody weapon in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Samuel Johnson, in his 1765 edition of Shakespeare's plays,
also argued against the playwright's being the author. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All the editors and criticks agree with Mr. ((Lewis)) Theobald
in supposing this play spurious. I see no reason for differing from
them; for the colour of the stile is wholly different from that of
the other plays, and there is an attempt at regular versification,
and artificial closes, not always inelegant, yet seldom pleasing.
The barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are
here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any
audience; yet we are told by ((Ben)) Jonson, that they were not
only borne but praised. That Shakespeare wrote any part, though
Theobald declares it ``incontestable,'' I see no reason for
believing.
</P>
<P>
   The Defenders
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Shakspere as a Playwright'' (Scribner's, 1913), Brander
Matthews, a professor of dramatic literature at Columbia University
who deliberately shortened the playwright's name as part of his
advocacy of simplified spelling, says ``Titus'' was a smash by
Elizabethan standards. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Revolting as the several episodes may be to us, the play gave
the Elizabethans the kind of pleasure they expected in the theater.
It has a complicated plot, easy to follow in action and gathering
force as it moves onward. ... Seen on the stage, it could not fail
to arouse and to hold the interest of a contemporary audience. Its
action advances swiftly; its characters are boldly outlined; its
dialogue is stiff with top-lofty rhetoric. It may be only a medley
of invective and assassination, of bombast and brutality; but it is
adroitly devised to capture the favor of the groundlings. Even if
it does accumulate horror on horror's head, this did not displease
the full-blooded and coarse-grained playgoers for whom it had been
compounded.

   Last season's berry thing is gone and the glitter thing is gone.
Instead, there's lots of shimmer, such as the Stila All Over
Shimmer. Nars Galaxy Girl lipstick and Stila Kitten eye shadow are
shot with gold and give a very warm look for summer. A line that I
know will do very well is T. LeClerc. It's very sophisticated and
the packaging is gorgeous. Body &AMP; Soul's lip glosses are amazing _
really shiny, but they don't move around _ and their loose powder
is really nice. Also exciting is the Anna Sui color collection and

the pool, and this Medusa woman with a dress floating in the water

eyeballs and they eat the various parts of the face. It's
shockingly beautiful.

 UNDATED: expanding economy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution notes that income
and other types of support for nonworking people, like disability
insurance payments, are much higher now than in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freeman-Rodgers study cites one group that has made
significant gains in tight labor markets: young black men without a
college education, whose non-employment rate fell from 48 percent
to 36 percent between 1992 and 1998. Though adult men barely
registered gains in employment or earnings in the regions with
tight labor markets, the earnings of young men _ including blacks
without a college education _ rose by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that a long extended boom can go a long way
to resolving the African-American youth employment problem,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Burtless points to another disadvantaged group that has been
helped by the robust economy: single mothers, whose non-employment
rate fell from 43 percent to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. Burtless
says that sharp improvement is a result in part of welfare reform
but also of a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one encouraging reading of the tea leaves, even if it's
unlikely that overall unemployment will dip much further: Those
groups in the worst economic shape _ unskilled young black men and
single mothers _ respond well to tight labor markets and would
benefit from future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And economists note that as more young black men and single
mothers are absorbed into the labor force, they will gain work
experience that will prove attractive to future employers and help
them weather the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has started to do for these groups what
government training programs have not accomplished: provide
substantially higher earnings and employment. And if the economic
boom continues for a few years, there is a chance it will do
wonders for the disadvantaged workers who need help the most.

   Moviegoers who were recently seduced by the lyricism of
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' will see
a starkly different side of William Shakespeare in ``Titus'' (short
for ``Titus Andronicus''), starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica
Lange and directed by Julie Taymor. With more than a dozen murders,
assorted dismemberments and the emperor Saturninus sitting down to
a pie made from the bodies of his stepsons, ``Titus'' is
Shakespeare's goriest play and, many critics feel, his worst. T.S.
Eliot described it as ``one of the stupidest and most uninspired
plays ever written.'' A 1923 production of ``Titus'' at the Old Vic
was laughed off the stage. Observations on the play and
disputations on its authorship over the centuries follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   The Naysayers
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Down through the centuries, many members of the literati have
argued that Shakespeare could not have written something as awful
as ``Titus.'' One early disbeliever was Edward Ravenscroft, a
playwright whose comments appeared in the bowdlerized version of
the play that he published in 1687. (Shakespeare died in 1616.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I think it a greater theft to Rob the dead of their Praise than
the Living of their Money. That I may not appear Guilty of such a
Crime, 'tis necessary I should acquaint you, that there is a Play
in Mr. Shakespears Volume under the name of Titus Andronicus, from
whence I drew part of this. I have been told by some anciently
conversant with the Stage, that it was not Originally his, but
brought by a private Authour to be Acted, and he only gave some
Master-touches to one or two of the Principal Parts of Characters;
this I am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and
indigested piece in all his Works; It seems rather a heap of
Rubbish than a Structure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Titus Andronicus'' for the ``Shakespeare in Performance''
series (Manchester University Press, 1989), Alan C. Dessen noted
some of Ravenscroft's major changes. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most of these moments involve on-stage violence or images that
can elicit unwanted audience laughter. ... Rather than cutting off
his hand on-stage, this Titus exits with an executioner and
re-enters ``with his hand off'' ... The problematic exeunt in
III.i, in which Titus and Marcus each carries a head and Lavinia is
directed to carry the hand in her mouth, is avoided when the boy
Junius, asked to ``share in this Ceremony,'' is ordered to ``bring
thou that hand _ and help thy handless Aunt.'' The bloodiest moment
in Shakespeare's script, the on-stage murders of Chiron and
Demetrius with Lavinia holding a basin to catch their blood, is not
witnessed by the audience; rather, Titus appears afterward ``like
an Executioner'' with a bloody weapon in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Samuel Johnson, in his 1765 edition of Shakespeare's plays,
also argued against the playwright's being the author. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All the editors and criticks agree with Mr. ((Lewis)) Theobald
in supposing this play spurious. I see no reason for differing from
them; for the colour of the stile is wholly different from that of
the other plays, and there is an attempt at regular versification,
and artificial closes, not always inelegant, yet seldom pleasing.
The barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are
here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any
audience; yet we are told by ((Ben)) Jonson, that they were not
only borne but praised. That Shakespeare wrote any part, though
Theobald declares it ``incontestable,'' I see no reason for
believing.
</P>
<P>
   The Defenders
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Shakspere as a Playwright'' (Scribner's, 1913), Brander
Matthews, a professor of dramatic literature at Columbia University
who deliberately shortened the playwright's name as part of his
advocacy of simplified spelling, says ``Titus'' was a smash by
Elizabethan standards. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Revolting as the several episodes may be to us, the play gave
the Elizabethans the kind of pleasure they expected in the theater.
It has a complicated plot, easy to follow in action and gathering
force as it moves onward. ... Seen on the stage, it could not fail
to arouse and to hold the interest of a contemporary audience. Its
action advances swiftly; its characters are boldly outlined; its
dialogue is stiff with top-lofty rhetoric. It may be only a medley
of invective and assassination, of bombast and brutality; but it is
adroitly devised to capture the favor of the groundlings. Even if
it does accumulate horror on horror's head, this did not displease
the full-blooded and coarse-grained playgoers for whom it had been
compounded.

DRUG SWITCHING SAVES MONEY, BUT THERE IS A COST

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a brother who died of a heart attack and two
parents who had strokes, it came as no surprise to Joanne Best
that, at age 60, she had developed heart disease. The surprise came
at the drugstore counter, when Ms. Best, of Concord, Calif., tried
to refill her prescription for Norvasc, the medication that kept
her blood pressure under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the insurance doesn't pay,'' she said. ``It wasn't
on the formulary.'' Her doctor switched her to nifedipine, a
different drug in the class known as calcium channel blockers. But
the new medicine isn't working, and last week the doctor doubled
the dose. ``It's very scary,'' Ms. Best said. ``This could be a
matter of life and death with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care executives call what happened to Ms. Best
``formulary management,'' or ``therapeutic substitution.'' Consumer
advocates use a less flattering term: ``drug switching.''
</P>
<P>
   With more drugs on pharmacy shelves than ever before, and with
more prescriptions being written each year, officials at the Food
and Drug Administration are growing increasingly concerned about
deaths and injuries caused by medications.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention is being paid to medication mix-ups and other
pharmaceutical errors. But many people don't realize that
pharmacists, at the behest of insurance companies, intentionally
switch medications all the time, with potentially harmful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   These switches do not involve replacing brand-name drugs with
generics, which pharmacists are allowed to do unless the doctor
writes ``dispense as written'' or ``D.A.W.,'' on the prescription.
Rather, one chemical entity is substituted for another; the drugs
may treat the same disorder but have entirely different side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is particularly common with some of the most often
prescribed medications: anti-depressants, high-blood-pressure
medication and cholesterol-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Often the switching, which is done to save money, is harmless.
But for some people, particularly those who have been on an
established therapy for a long time, the changes can cause
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very dangerous and it is rampant,'' said Dr. Raymond
Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at the Georgetown
University Medical Center. ``This counters everything we teach in
medicine, which is, `Know a few drugs, know them well, pick the
best medicine for your patient, don't change unless it is medically
indicated.'''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that doctors should know a few drugs and know them well
was the original concept behind formularies, or restricted lists of
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old concept,'' said Susan Winckler, director of policy
and legislation at the American Pharmaceutical Association, a
pharmacists' trade group, ``and in a hospital setting it allowed
physicians and other prescribers to get used to a limited number of
drugs. Managed care has taken that concept from the hospital to the
community environment, and we are not quite sure that the
translation has worked as well as it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say it is not working at all. Howard
Metzenbaum, the former Democratic senator from Ohio who is now
chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit
organization in Washington, described drug switching as ``an evil
practice.'' He would like to see Congress ban it, but said, ``My
guess is we'd have a hell of an uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 report titled ``Pharmaceutical Payola,'' Mark Green,
the New York City public advocate, cited a string of complaints
about drug switching that had been sent to the FDA. A 63-year-old
woman developed a joint condition after switching
cholesterol-lowering drugs; a 29-year-old schizophrenic ``began
exhibiting bruises and swelling'' after changing medications, and
an 86-year-old woman who traded one high-blood-pressure pill for
another suffered ``nausea, weakness and shakiness.''
</P>
<P>
   And even when there is no harm, pharmacists and doctors say, the
switching is a nuisance. ``That's where the nightmare in pharmacy
comes in,'' said Bruce Roberts, the owner of Leesburg Pharmacy in
Leesburg, Va. ``First we have to determine what they will cover.
Then we have to call the physician and get authorization. Most
physicians are so beat down by managed care that they say, `OK.'''
But when the doctor refuses, he said, ``You have to get back on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefits managers, who serve as middlemen between drug
companies and health plans, say the wrangling is worth it. Drug
costs are spiraling upward; the pharmaceutical industry's revenues
are estimated at $91.8 billion this year, up from $38.5 billion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Medications play such a big role in modern medicine, health
economists say, that some health plans are now paying more for
pharmaceuticals than for hospital visits. Switching is so important
in keeping costs down that benefits managers pay pharmacists a
premium for dispensing drugs that are on a company's formulary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We estimate that we save our clients over $1 billion a year in
prescription drug costs,'' said Kevin Colgan, a spokesman for
Merck-Medco Managed Care, which administers prescription drug
benefits for more than 51 million people. He said no one is
pressured to switch; doctors are simply ``presented with an
opportunity to help the health plan to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of the time, he said, they agree. Patients who
don't like it, Colgan said, have another option: ``They can always
pay for it themselves, out of pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking enrages Ms. Best, who said she already
pays a $200 monthly premium for health insurance. Paying for
Norvasc would cost her an additional $80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when the insurance company and the drug company
are one and the same? When Merck, the pharmaceutical giant,
purchased Medco in 1993, critics complained that the parent company
would steer its own drugs to the benefits management firm, a wholly
owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission agreed; an investigation
found that Medco had given favorable treatment to Merck products.
Without admitting wrongdoing, Merck-Medco signed a consent
agreement that required it to maintain an ``open formulary,'' a
practice Colgan said the company already had in place.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some wonder how much money is really being saved by
all this switching, and at what cost. Green, the New York City
public advocate, concluded that drug switching is ``likely to mean
that a patient does not get well as fast,'' which drives up
health-care costs from additional doctors' visits.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathryn Bennett, who treats Ms. Best, has reached the same
conclusion. ``Now she is taking this medication twice a day,'' the
doctor said, ``which may well be more expensive than what she was
taking before.''

fruit, that is a half female face, half male _ empress and emperor.
It's floating by these partygoers who are lounging on the edge of
the pool, and this Medusa woman with a dress floating in the water
is pushing the cake. The guests have long forks that poke the
eyeballs and they eat the various parts of the face. It's
shockingly beautiful.

   WASHINGTON _ With a brother who died of a heart attack and two
parents who had strokes, it came as no surprise to Joanne Best
that, at age 60, she had developed heart disease. The surprise came
at the drugstore counter, when Ms. Best, of Concord, Calif., tried
to refill her prescription for Norvasc, the medication that kept
her blood pressure under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the insurance doesn't pay,'' she said. ``It wasn't
on the formulary.'' Her doctor switched her to nifedipine, a
different drug in the class known as calcium channel blockers. But
the new medicine isn't working, and last week the doctor doubled
the dose. ``It's very scary,'' Ms. Best said. ``This could be a
matter of life and death with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care executives call what happened to Ms. Best
``formulary management,'' or ``therapeutic substitution.'' Consumer
advocates use a less flattering term: ``drug switching.''
</P>
<P>
   With more drugs on pharmacy shelves than ever before, and with
more prescriptions being written each year, officials at the Food
and Drug Administration are growing increasingly concerned about
deaths and injuries caused by medications.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention is being paid to medication mix-ups and other
pharmaceutical errors. But many people don't realize that
pharmacists, at the behest of insurance companies, intentionally
switch medications all the time, with potentially harmful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   These switches do not involve replacing brand-name drugs with
generics, which pharmacists are allowed to do unless the doctor
writes ``dispense as written'' or ``D.A.W.,'' on the prescription.
Rather, one chemical entity is substituted for another; the drugs
may treat the same disorder but have entirely different side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is particularly common with some of the most often
prescribed medications: anti-depressants, high-blood-pressure
medication and cholesterol-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Often the switching, which is done to save money, is harmless.
But for some people, particularly those who have been on an
established therapy for a long time, the changes can cause
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very dangerous and it is rampant,'' said Dr. Raymond
Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at the Georgetown
University Medical Center. ``This counters everything we teach in
medicine, which is, `Know a few drugs, know them well, pick the
best medicine for your patient, don't change unless it is medically
indicated.'''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that doctors should know a few drugs and know them well
was the original concept behind formularies, or restricted lists of
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old concept,'' said Susan Winckler, director of policy
and legislation at the American Pharmaceutical Association, a
pharmacists' trade group, ``and in a hospital setting it allowed
physicians and other prescribers to get used to a limited number of
drugs. Managed care has taken that concept from the hospital to the
community environment, and we are not quite sure that the
translation has worked as well as it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say it is not working at all. Howard
Metzenbaum, the former Democratic senator from Ohio who is now
chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit
organization in Washington, described drug switching as ``an evil
practice.'' He would like to see Congress ban it, but said, ``My
guess is we'd have a hell of an uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 report titled ``Pharmaceutical Payola,'' Mark Green,
the New York City public advocate, cited a string of complaints
about drug switching that had been sent to the FDA. A 63-year-old
woman developed a joint condition after switching
cholesterol-lowering drugs; a 29-year-old schizophrenic ``began
exhibiting bruises and swelling'' after changing medications, and
an 86-year-old woman who traded one high-blood-pressure pill for
another suffered ``nausea, weakness and shakiness.''
</P>
<P>
   And even when there is no harm, pharmacists and doctors say, the
switching is a nuisance. ``That's where the nightmare in pharmacy
comes in,'' said Bruce Roberts, the owner of Leesburg Pharmacy in
Leesburg, Va. ``First we have to determine what they will cover.
Then we have to call the physician and get authorization. Most
physicians are so beat down by managed care that they say, `OK.'''
But when the doctor refuses, he said, ``You have to get back on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefits managers, who serve as middlemen between drug
companies and health plans, say the wrangling is worth it. Drug
costs are spiraling upward; the pharmaceutical industry's revenues
are estimated at $91.8 billion this year, up from $38.5 billion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Medications play such a big role in modern medicine, health
economists say, that some health plans are now paying more for
pharmaceuticals than for hospital visits. Switching is so important
in keeping costs down that benefits managers pay pharmacists a
premium for dispensing drugs that are on a company's formulary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We estimate that we save our clients over $1 billion a year in
prescription drug costs,'' said Kevin Colgan, a spokesman for
Merck-Medco Managed Care, which administers prescription drug
benefits for more than 51 million people. He said no one is
pressured to switch; doctors are simply ``presented with an
opportunity to help the health plan to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of the time, he said, they agree. Patients who
don't like it, Colgan said, have another option: ``They can always
pay for it themselves, out of pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking enrages Ms. Best, who said she already
pays a $200 monthly premium for health insurance. Paying for
Norvasc would cost her an additional $80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when the insurance company and the drug company
are one and the same? When Merck, the pharmaceutical giant,
purchased Medco in 1993, critics complained that the parent company
would steer its own drugs to the benefits management firm, a wholly
owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission agreed; an investigation
found that Medco had given favorable treatment to Merck products.
Without admitting wrongdoing, Merck-Medco signed a consent
agreement that required it to maintain an ``open formulary,'' a
practice Colgan said the company already had in place.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some wonder how much money is really being saved by
all this switching, and at what cost. Green, the New York City
public advocate, concluded that drug switching is ``likely to mean
that a patient does not get well as fast,'' which drives up
health-care costs from additional doctors' visits.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathryn Bennett, who treats Ms. Best, has reached the same
conclusion. ``Now she is taking this medication twice a day,'' the
doctor said, ``which may well be more expensive than what she was
taking before.''

   NEW YORK _ The guest list was top drawer, headed by President
Clinton and both of New York's Democratic senators. But even with
that political star power, hardly anyone wanted to come to
Geraldine Ferraro's $1,000-a-person fund-raiser to pay off her
campaign debts. So late last month, just 48 hours before curtain
time, she called the whole thing off.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly $1 million in debt after having raised $8 million
for her failed Senate primary bids in 1998 and 1992 _ including
$400,000 from her own pocket _ Ferraro has joined the ranks of
unsuccessful candidates who discover that beyond the humiliation of
defeat lies another harsh reality: a mountain of debt, with few
easy prospects for paying it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the optimum circumstances,'' Ferraro said in an
interview. ``And we still couldn't push the event forward to raise
money. This is a tough place to be in. I'm just tired of asking
people for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are well-known faces or ordinary people who run for
Congress, losing candidates find that just because the election is
over, that doesn't mean the fund raising stops. But if it was tough
raising money in the heat of a campaign, try fund raising after
Election Day, as the bills from pollsters, the telephone company
and poster makers keep rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonse D'Amato spent $24.2 million in his losing bid to keep
his Senate seat last year. Now he's left with $300,000 in debts,
and the donors who supported him when he was in office are nowhere
to be seen _ or have already given him the maximum $2,000 allowed
by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in office, it's no big deal to raise money,''
said D'Amato, whose fund-raising prowess in the Senate was
legendary. Now the Wall Street executives and powerful New Yorkers
who once supported him have moved on. ``People's priorities are to
help the incumbent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To pay off debts, D'Amato has sent two direct-mail letters
begging for donations. ``My mother always told me to own up and pay
debts and that's what we are trying to do,'' said D'Amato, reading
from the text of one letter. So far, the letters have brought in
only around $30,000, D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is a collision of two facts of life about
campaigning. It costs more than ever to run for Congress _ last
year was the most expensive midterm election, breaking the $1
billion barrier. At the same time, donors _ whether ordinary
citizens or lobbyists _ cannot donate more than $2,000 per
election.
</P>
<P>
   This means that losing candidates have to seek out new donors
who either never gave to them before Election Day or have not
``maxed out,'' in campaign-finance parlance, and given their entire
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that there should be a change in the law to
allow separate postelection fund-raising committees, like a legal
defense fund,'' Ferraro said. ``This would allow a losing campaign
to set up a committee to pay off debt. I've had lots of people
sending me checks, and I've had to send the money back to them
because they've already maxed out to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other big names with big debt include Rep. Lauch Faircloth, who
spent $9.4 million and lost his North Carolina Senate seat. He's
$1.7 million in debt and has sent out letters to North Carolina
businessmen soliciting funds. Legendary among debt-laden
politicians is Sen. John Glenn, who is still trying to raise money
to pay off $2.5 million from his failed 1984 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if you are still in politics,'' said Ken Gross,
an election-law attorney in Washington. ``But once you are not
going to run again, it becomes nearly impossible. Look at John
Glenn. He is truly famous. He is a hero and, for those reasons, he
might have some hope of raising money. But even he has had
insurmountable difficulties in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's tough for Glenn, what about unknown candidates like Paul
Barby, a Democrat from Oklahoma who failed in his bid for a House
seat and now owes $570,000. ``I have no choice but to eat it,'' he
said. ``There is no way to recoup it unless I go begging.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turnham, a salesman who lost a race for a House seat in
Alabama is paying off his $50,000 debt from his household budget.
``With what I've paid back, I could have sent my kids to a nice
four-year college,'' he said. ``It really takes the Horatio Alger
element out of running for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Any money lent by candidates to their own campaigns doesn't have
to be paid off. Candidates can absorb that loss personally, though
it cannot be claimed as a tax deduction. Money owed to vendors, by
federal law, must be paid back, either through donations or
personally, though the law allows any candidate, after the
election, to negotiate these sums down to a lower level.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, leftover campaign debts can linger on for years,
with the Federal Election Commission slow to pursue candidates to
get them to pay vendors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, many losing candidates say paying off bills is a matter
of personal pride. Scott West, a university administrator in
Wisconsin who failed last year to upset David Obey, the ranking
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, has used his own
money to whittle down his $120,000 campaign debt to $60,000 by
expanding his consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an honorable person and I've got to raise those dollars,''
West said. ``We had trouble raising money when I had a chance to
win. Getting people to back you up after the fact is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the opposite case: Incumbents who leave office
with large campaign war chests. Since 1993, they have been unable
to use this money on personal expenses and must give it either to
other candidates or to charity. For many who leave Congress, this
nest egg is invaluable, especially if they turn to lobbying, as
many do, and need cash to spread around Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who stepped down last year as
House speaker and is now a Washington lobbyist, left office with
$400,000. He has given $30,000 to charity and says he gets ``four
or five'' requests a day from debt-laden incumbent officeholders
for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played golf the other day with Tom Davis,'' said Livingston,
referring to the Republican congressman from Virginia, ``and he had
lots of ideas on how to spend the money.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bad news for Chinese generals: The U.S. Commerce
Department has just determined that the new Sony Playstation II,
available later this year, is powered by an American-made chip so
powerful that Washington would have to be notified before it could
be shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
   If the final destination were a company, institute or household
linked to the Chinese military, a lengthy review would be required
to make sure America's most sophisticated technology does not fall
into the hands of bomb makers.
</P>
<P>
   But any Chinese officer determined to play out his fantasies on
a state-of-the-art Sony _ perhaps simulating a naval attack to
retake Taiwan? _ has other options. He could simply send his
teen-agers over to shop at any of the five Toys ``R'' Us stores in
Hong Kong, which is still considered a safe place to send advanced
technology even though it reverted to China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the Playstation is bandied about a lot in
Washington these days as one more example of how disconnected the
politics of controlling high-tech exports is from the realities of
a marketplace that reinvents itself every six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the disclosures about Chinese espionage, there
has been daily talk on Capitol Hill about crackdowns on the export
of American technology, not only nuclear secrets from the labs,
which everyone agrees must be locked up, but also the computing
power that would help the Chinese simulate nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Playstation is only the tip of the chip. Over the next 12
months American computer and semiconductor makers are planning to
roll out a series of new products, with code names like Willamette
and Merced, that blow wildly past the limits Washington has used to
define a supercomputer that needs to be guarded.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, says Andrew Grove, chairman of Intel Corp.,
``You'll be spending $1,200 at CompUSA for a computer that, if the
rules aren't changed, we may not be able to ship to China.'' Or to
Israel, Russia, India or 50 other nations subject to strict
controls.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the Clinton administration in a bind. Just as it is
defending itself against charges of letting technology out the
door, the computer industry's top executives were visiting Capitol
Hill and the White House last week asking for a relaxation of the
export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under their proposal, the definition of a high-performance
computer requiring government approval for export to those 50
countries would be increased sixfold to 12,300 MTOPS (millions of
theoretical operations per second) from 2,000 now. Otherwise, they
warn, Europe and Japan will eat their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Clinton administration agree that the current limits
are too strict given today's technology. The president could ease
the restrictions with a stroke of his pen, but he must give
Congress six months to review the decision. Nowadays, though, one
White House official lamented, ``We'd be giving ammo to anyone who
believes that we are helping arm potential enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   What the computer industry seeks is a fundamental rethinking of
what kind of technology it makes sense to control. During the Cold
War that issue seemed relatively straightforward: The most powerful
Cray supercomputers and their Japanese rivals were clearly off
limits for shipments to the likes of the old Soviet Union and
China.
</P>
<P>
   But Crays were produced in limited numbers, and when they were
sold to countries whose intentions might be less than honorable,
part of the deal was that they would be accompanied by a full-time
technical expert who, in theory, also served as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But the motto of last week's Silicon Valley visitors, who
included some big donors to Democratic and Republican causes, is
``Yesterday's supercomputer is today's laptop.'' They have a point:
A $20 million Cray X-MP, state of the art in the mid-1980s, had
about the power of a 1999 personal computer equipped with a
relatively fast version of Intel's Pentium II chip.
</P>
<P>
   That Pentium is, of course, passe. By the end of this year Intel
projects that a high-end Pentium III chip will perform 1,600 MTOPS,
well above the current limit for microprocessors that can be
shipped to China and similar countries.
</P>
<P>
   Then come Willamette and Merced, chips that Dell, Compaq, IBM
and others plan to put in clusters of two or four in forthcoming
machines. These computers would operate at upward of 12,000 MTOPS,
or more than six times the current threshold for export controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there are going to be millions of these
computers produced,'' said Lewis Platt, the president and chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard, who led the lobbying effort here.
``There comes a moment when a technology is so widely available
that the kind of limits that we put in place just a few years ago
simply don't make any sense anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main authors of the report on China's espionage efforts,
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., sympathize
but insist it is time to revive the Cold War organization that
limited exports, the Committee on Multilateral Export Controls. It
went out of business in 1994, replaced by a weak accord that allows
most countries to ship whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Export controls remain essential because even as China has
stolen some of our most important secrets, it has not yet obtained
everything it needs to exploit them,'' Cox and Dicks wrote last
week in The Wall Street Journal. Europe and Japan, however, see the
threat differently; they worry more about America's technological
supremacy than about what happens when China gets the Merced. They
are reluctant to re-institute cold-war controls.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. The Gartner Group, a computer industry
consulting group, projects that within three years the Chinese will
be buying nearly 400,000 multi-processor personal computers a year,
to say nothing of Sony Playstations.

<P>
   When the eminent politician Sir Robert Chiltern worries, he
bites his lip, and for most of ``An Ideal Husband,'' the Oscar
Wilde play that comes to the screen this week, he has plenty to
worry about. He is threatened with exposure for having sold a
government secret to a stock exchange speculator.
</P>
<P>
   The deed, done years before the curtain rises, laid the
foundation for Sir Robert's wealth and career as well as for a
witty play. Exposure now, at the height of his prospects, would
ruin his reputation and destroy his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the debut of ``An Ideal Husband,'' Wilde's
portrait of a successful politician trying to slip out of
humiliation retains a certain currency, while the portrait of his
wife seems like a daguerreotype that has faded from fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert's readiness to commit a new offense in an effort to
cover up an old one bears comparison with current events. Though he
doesn't resort to charges of a right-wing conspiracy, he denounces
any who would criticize him as ``men who, each one of them, have
worse secrets in their own lives.'' Take that, Congress!
</P>
<P>
   Like generations of lip-biters, Sir Robert tries to talk his way
out of trouble by glossing over his act: ``The affair to which you
allude was no more than a speculation. The House of Commons had not
yet passed the bill; it might have been rejected.'' But, alas,
there is an incriminating letter afloat that even a glib politician
would be hard put to explain. (Victorian playwrights had to make do
without the evidence of a stained frock.)
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert, along with the play, is saved by some mechanics of
19th-century melodrama, but he is almost done in by his moralizing
wife, for whom he represents the ideal husband. To his explanation
that ``Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise,''
she instructs him in female psychology straight out of romance
fiction: ``Robert, men can love what is beneath them, things
unworthy, stained, dishonored. We women worship when we love and
when we lose our worship, we lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with being a threat to her husband, Lady Chiltern's
worshipful attitude is an offense to feminism, which was astir at
the time. She is assuredly no model for today's achieving woman. If
she had political ambitions of her own, say to run for senator from
New York; if she had a career, perhaps as an Arkansas lawyer, that
brought her into dubious company; if she had made surprising
amounts of money in problematic ways, then she might well have
collaborated sensibly in the cover-up, although at the expense of
an enjoyable plot.
</P>
<P>
   But what prudent spouse with the slightest acquaintance with
politics would advance the dangerous proposition ``that a person
who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonorable action may
be guilty of it a second time, and should be shunned''? An
invitation to voters?
</P>
<P>
   As Lady Chiltern, more bent on saving her husband's soul than
his career, urges him into assured destruction, she preaches, ``I
don't think you realize sufficiently, Robert, that you have brought
into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, an inner
attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher
ideals.'' Some consolation for a man whose career is going down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   Today's more knowing spouse would surely be found off the
pedestal and at rallies celebrating her husband's record of
accomplishment: The economy is perking, the electorate is tranquil.
And anyway, the offense was small. Sir Robert claims he did not
make much money on the deal after all, that he has since given away
far more in public charities. To which his friend Lord Goring, who
utters Wilde's best lines, cracks: ``In public charities? Dear me!
What a lot of harm you must have done, Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lord Goring asks, ``How could you have sold yourself for
money?'' Sir Robert produces one of those parsings that have lately
become famous: ``I did not sell myself for money. I bought success
at a great price. That is all.'' Oscar! Thou shouldst be living at
this hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilde's own attitude, delivered via Lord Goring, combines what
today's audience might dismiss as a dated and dreamy depiction of
women's role in public life with an acute view of the politician's
reason for being. ``Failure to Robert would be the very mire of
shame,'' he warns Lady Chiltern. ``Power is his passion. He would
lose everything, even his power to love.'' No contemporary woman
requires such a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   The discerning Lord Goring could not fail to note that these
days the sexes are equally prone to the appeals of power and
ambition, which can make for ideal bedfellows as the campaign grows
hot.

   WASHINGTON _ Bad news for Chinese generals: The U.S. Commerce
Department has just determined that the new Sony Playstation II,
available later this year, is powered by an American-made chip so
powerful that Washington would have to be notified before it could
be shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
   If the final destination were a company, institute or household
linked to the Chinese military, a lengthy review would be required
to make sure America's most sophisticated technology does not fall
into the hands of bomb makers.
</P>
<P>
   But any Chinese officer determined to play out his fantasies on
a state-of-the-art Sony _ perhaps simulating a naval attack to
retake Taiwan? _ has other options. He could simply send his
teen-agers over to shop at any of the five Toys ``R'' Us stores in
Hong Kong, which is still considered a safe place to send advanced
technology even though it reverted to China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the Playstation is bandied about a lot in
Washington these days as one more example of how disconnected the
politics of controlling high-tech exports is from the realities of
a marketplace that reinvents itself every six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the disclosures about Chinese espionage, there
has been daily talk on Capitol Hill about crackdowns on the export
of American technology, not only nuclear secrets from the labs,
which everyone agrees must be locked up, but also the computing
power that would help the Chinese simulate nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Playstation is only the tip of the chip. Over the next 12
months American computer and semiconductor makers are planning to
roll out a series of new products, with code names like Willamette
and Merced, that blow wildly past the limits Washington has used to
define a supercomputer that needs to be guarded.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, says Andrew Grove, chairman of Intel Corp.,
``You'll be spending $1,200 at CompUSA for a computer that, if the
rules aren't changed, we may not be able to ship to China.'' Or to
Israel, Russia, India or 50 other nations subject to strict
controls.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The future leadership of the U.S. Embassy in
Luxembourg, a landlocked European duchy with about as many people
as Oklahoma City, might seem an unlikely issue to pit the White
House against the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of a gay San Francisco businessman as the
new U.S. ambassador there has provoked a clash between two of the
most venerable _ and arguably most anachronistic _ traditions of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the right of the White House to make government
appointments during congressional recesses without Senate
confirmation vs. the right of individual senators to block any
nomination that comes before them. Recess appointments vs.
nomination holds.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably safe to say that the Founding Fathers never
envisioned this type of showdown. The concepts of both recess
appointments and nomination holds reflect the interests of a
different era of American history. When the Founding Fathers sat
down to hammer out the Constitution, they believed that Congress
would often be out of session, with lawmakers returning to their
states by horse and buggy, and out of contact for weeks or months
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So they came up with the idea of recess appointments, enabling
the president to make important appointments _ Cabinet members,
ambassadors, judges _ when Congress was not in session and senators
were not available to give their ``advice and consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Senate meets most of the year, and members travel by
jet and can be back in Washington for an important vote within
hours. But still, the recess appointment privilege lives on, and
presidents continue to use _ and possibly abuse _ their power to
push through appointments that would otherwise never be approved by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The current struggle began when President Clinton used the
Senate's Memorial Day recess as an opportunity to appoint James
Hormel as the nation's first openly gay ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   He sent Hormel to Luxembourg without seeking Senate approval
under a 32-word clause in the Constitution that permits the
president ``to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the
recess of the Senate.'' Hormel can serve until the end of the next
session of Congress, which is likely to be the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Hormel, heir to his family's meat-processing
fortune and a prominent backer of gay-rights groups, caused a furor
among conservative Senate Republicans who had opposed the
nomination because of his sexual orientation when it was first
offered two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republicans complained that the appointment amounted to
pandering to gay-rights organizations that are expected to provide
important backing to Vice President Gore in the next year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, one outraged Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, invoked the traditional privilege of any senator to block
_ or hold _ Senate approval for nominations by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While nomination holds in the Senate are not enshrined in the
Constitution, they have nearly as long a history as recess
appointments, and reflect the view of early members of the Senate
that the body should operate by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, known for both stubbornness and fierce conservatism,
accused Hormel of promoting a ``gay agenda'' and vowed to block all
White House nominations until he receives a commitment from Clinton
to strictly limit the use of recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The move could delay Senate confirmation for both Lawrence
Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to be the
next chief diplomat at the United Nations. If Inhofe insists and is
willing to block every presidential nomination that comes to the
Senate floor, he can only be stopped, under Senate rules, by a vote
of 60 members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Controversy over recess appointments dates from the earliest
days of the Republic. President George Washington used a Senate
recess in the summer of 1795 to appoint John Rutledge of South
Carolina as chief justice, knowing that the majority Federalists in
the Senate were hostile to Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge had presided over only two cases as chief justice when
the Senate returned from its recess that fall and, presented by
Washington with a formal nomination, voted to reject it, forcing
Rutledge from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower placed three justices on the
Supreme Court during recesses: Earl Warren, William Brennan and
Potter Stewart, all of whom were later confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan made liberal use of the power and granted 239
recess appointments, prompting a fight with the Senate similar to
the one involving Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then majority
leader, placed holds on nearly 6,000 presidential nominations in
protest over what he described as Reagan's effort to circumvent
Congress with recess appointments. Reagan eventually agreed to
limit the appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dove, the Senate's parliamentarian, said the use of
nomination holds reflects the Senate's view of itself as a place of
cautious deliberation, where all voices will be heard and where a
senator from a small, underpopulated state has as much power as a
senator from the largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system works amazing well,'' Dove said. ``Senators
are normally very restrained in the use of their powers because
they need to form alliances if they want to get things done. From
an idea of pure democracy, that's why the Senate is here _ to force
consensus.''

attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher
ideals.'' Some consolation for a man whose career is going down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   Today's more knowing spouse would surely be found off the
pedestal and at rallies celebrating her husband's record of
accomplishment: The economy is perking, the electorate is tranquil.
And anyway, the offense was small. Sir Robert claims he did not
make much money on the deal after all, that he has since given away
far more in public charities. To which his friend Lord Goring, who
utters Wilde's best lines, cracks: ``In public charities? Dear me!
What a lot of harm you must have done, Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lord Goring asks, ``How could you have sold yourself for
money?'' Sir Robert produces one of those parsings that have lately
become famous: ``I did not sell myself for money. I bought success
at a great price. That is all.'' Oscar! Thou shouldst be living at
this hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   Wilde's own attitude, delivered via Lord Goring, combines what
today's audience might dismiss as a dated and dreamy depiction of
women's role in public life with an acute view of the politician's
reason for being. ``Failure to Robert would be the very mire of
shame,'' he warns Lady Chiltern. ``Power is his passion. He would
lose everything, even his power to love.'' No contemporary woman
requires such a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   The discerning Lord Goring could not fail to note that these
days the sexes are equally prone to the appeals of power and
ambition, which can make for ideal bedfellows as the campaign grows
hot.

   WASHINGTON _ The future leadership of the U.S. Embassy in
Luxembourg, a landlocked European duchy with about as many people
as Oklahoma City, might seem an unlikely issue to pit the White
House against the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of a gay San Francisco businessman as the
new U.S. ambassador there has provoked a clash between two of the
most venerable _ and arguably most anachronistic _ traditions of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the right of the White House to make government
appointments during congressional recesses without Senate
confirmation vs. the right of individual senators to block any
nomination that comes before them. Recess appointments vs.
nomination holds.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably safe to say that the Founding Fathers never
envisioned this type of showdown. The concepts of both recess
appointments and nomination holds reflect the interests of a
different era of American history. When the Founding Fathers sat
down to hammer out the Constitution, they believed that Congress
would often be out of session, with lawmakers returning to their
states by horse and buggy, and out of contact for weeks or months
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So they came up with the idea of recess appointments, enabling
the president to make important appointments _ Cabinet members,
ambassadors, judges _ when Congress was not in session and senators
were not available to give their ``advice and consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Senate meets most of the year, and members travel by
jet and can be back in Washington for an important vote within
hours. But still, the recess appointment privilege lives on, and
presidents continue to use _ and possibly abuse _ their power to
push through appointments that would otherwise never be approved by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The current struggle began when President Clinton used the
Senate's Memorial Day recess as an opportunity to appoint James
Hormel as the nation's first openly gay ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   He sent Hormel to Luxembourg without seeking Senate approval
under a 32-word clause in the Constitution that permits the
president ``to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the
recess of the Senate.'' Hormel can serve until the end of the next
session of Congress, which is likely to be the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Hormel, heir to his family's meat-processing
fortune and a prominent backer of gay-rights groups, caused a furor
among conservative Senate Republicans who had opposed the
nomination because of his sexual orientation when it was first
offered two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republicans complained that the appointment amounted to
pandering to gay-rights organizations that are expected to provide
important backing to Vice President Gore in the next year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, one outraged Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, invoked the traditional privilege of any senator to block
_ or hold _ Senate approval for nominations by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While nomination holds in the Senate are not enshrined in the
Constitution, they have nearly as long a history as recess
appointments, and reflect the view of early members of the Senate
that the body should operate by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, known for both stubbornness and fierce conservatism,
accused Hormel of promoting a ``gay agenda'' and vowed to block all
White House nominations until he receives a commitment from Clinton
to strictly limit the use of recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The move could delay Senate confirmation for both Lawrence
Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to be the
next chief diplomat at the United Nations. If Inhofe insists and is
willing to block every presidential nomination that comes to the
Senate floor, he can only be stopped, under Senate rules, by a vote
of 60 members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Controversy over recess appointments dates from the earliest
days of the Republic. President George Washington used a Senate
recess in the summer of 1795 to appoint John Rutledge of South
Carolina as chief justice, knowing that the majority Federalists in
the Senate were hostile to Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge had presided over only two cases as chief justice when
the Senate returned from its recess that fall and, presented by
Washington with a formal nomination, voted to reject it, forcing
Rutledge from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower placed three justices on the
Supreme Court during recesses: Earl Warren, William Brennan and
Potter Stewart, all of whom were later confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan made liberal use of the power and granted 239
recess appointments, prompting a fight with the Senate similar to
the one involving Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then majority
leader, placed holds on nearly 6,000 presidential nominations in
protest over what he described as Reagan's effort to circumvent
Congress with recess appointments. Reagan eventually agreed to
limit the appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dove, the Senate's parliamentarian, said the use of
nomination holds reflects the Senate's view of itself as a place of
cautious deliberation, where all voices will be heard and where a
senator from a small, underpopulated state has as much power as a
senator from the largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system works amazing well,'' Dove said. ``Senators
are normally very restrained in the use of their powers because
they need to form alliances if they want to get things done. From
an idea of pure democracy, that's why the Senate is here _ to force
consensus.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ During the flurry of NATO meetings that have
accompanied the Kosovo crisis, a strange sight has been seen
several times. The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey, the
alliance's bitterest rivals, have huddled for private talks.
</P>
<P>
   They have discussed ways to bring Yugoslav leaders to the
negotiating table, plans for sheltering refugees and ideas about
increasing the weight of NATO's southeastern flank. In fact, they
have discussed just about everything but the issue that people want
them to discuss: Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said after one
conference that he and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, have
``very good personal communication.'' He even said he was open to
``new ideas and proposals'' to resolve the issues that have divided
the two nations for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis has underlined once more how closely Greek and
Turkish strategic interests coincide. Both would benefit enormously
from stability in the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. Yet,
in one of the most persistent and puzzling anomalies of modern
geopolitics, their dispute remains seemingly intractable. Though
joined by geography and history, they are divided by one of the
world's angriest and longest-running blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   The feud has taken a turn for the worse in recent months,
following the capture of Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Ocalan, who is reviled in Turkey as a terrorist responsible for
thousands of deaths, was found to have been living under the
protection of Greek diplomats in Kenya. Turkish leaders accused
Greece of supporting a mass murderer in an effort to sow chaos in
Turkey. Greek leaders shot back, calling Turkey a thinly disguised
military dictatorship that brought the Kurdish problem on itself
through discrimination and repression.
</P>
<P>
   If Turks are outraged by Greece's role in protecting Ocalan,
Greece also has a new focus for its anger. Turkish leaders have
begun asserting that there are political ``gray zones'' in the
Aegean Sea, suggesting that Turkey has designs on islands that have
long been considered Greek. Dozens of interviews in both countries
suggest that the animosity between these neighbors is fed by a
combination of prejudice and political competition. But they also
revealed hope that a more positive relationship might emerge out of
the current trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I am in Greece, what strikes me is how alike we
are,'' said Orhan Taylan, a Turkish painter who is a member of a
small Greek-Turkish friendship group. ``We have the same emotions,
we tell the same jokes, we eat the same food, we listen to the same
music, we look at the world the same way. That's what makes it so
awful that this conflict just keeps dragging on.''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the psychology of Greek-Turkish relations is a passion
for historian Hercules Millas, who was born to Greek parents in
Istanbul and considers himself at home in both countries. ``Neither
side has any empathy with the other or any doubt that it is 100
percent right,'' Millas said. ``The Turk you know personally may be
good, but the Turkish nation as a whole is a brutal and warlike
enemy. For Turks, Greeks are liars, full of intrigues and bad
intentions, definitely not to be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has nearly six times the population of Greece, a much
more powerful army and a crucial location that makes it a highly
desirable ally. Greece is more developed and widely considered more
democratic, but Turkey has far greater strategic value.
</P>
<P>
   History plays a great role in creating the suspicions that
infect the Greek-Turkish relationship. These may be the only two
countries in the world that fought their definitive wars of
liberation against each other. After centuries of subjugation,
Greeks drove out the Ottoman Turks to emerge as an independent
state in the 1820s, and a century later, amid the wreckage of the
Ottoman Empire, Turks drove Greek forces from Anatolia to establish
the Turkish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the nations warmed during the 1930s, but then
cooled and reached a breaking point in 1974, when Turkish forces
landed on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and occupied a
substantial part of it. Turkey said it was acting to prevent the
slaughter of ethnic Turks by the ethnic Greek majority. Greece
called the act an illegal invasion of a sovereign country that
proved Turkey's expansionist nature.
</P>
<P>
   A few isolated rays of light have fallen on the Greek-Turkish
relationship in the quarter-century since the Cyprus operation, but
they have not been enough to brighten the darkness that has come to
envelop it. The nations have come to the brink of war several
times, most recently over a barren Aegean islet in 1996. Their
naval units still conduct maneuvers in the Aegean at the same time,
and their pilots routinely engage in mock dogfights.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion that many ordinary Greeks and Turks harbor for
each other is fed by a remarkable lack of contact. There is little
trade between the two nations. Greeks and Turks rarely visit each
other's countries, and very few speak the other's language.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders insist they can begin no dialogue with Greece
until the Greek government closes what they say are camps used to
train Kurdish guerrillas in Greece and declares the guerrilla
group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a terrorist
organization. But Papandreou insisted in an interview that there
are no guerrilla camps in Greece, and that his government is not
prepared to label the PKK terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   The PKK is not a legal organization in Greece and is not allowed
to exist here,'' Papandreou said. ``We do not say that it is or is
not a terrorist group. I think it's putting a blindfold on the
problem to say that this is only a problem of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days following Ocalan's capture in Kenya last February,
Greece was shaken by a political earthquake. Three ministers and
the chief of the intelligence service were forced to resign. Their
successors, including Papandreou, are considered strong supporters
of the relatively moderate prime minister, Constantine Simitis, and
less likely to embark on provocative adventures like sheltering a
man who is the most wanted fugitive in a nearby country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to come out of the worst of it not only
unscathed, but with some very positive changes,'' said Theodore
Couloumbis, director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and
Foreign Policy. ``We're leaving behind this idea that the enemy of
our enemy is our friend, which got us into this huge mess in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish anger over Greece's support for Ocalan has not faded,
however, and the victory of nationalist parties in Turkey's April
election may have made compromise more difficult. One of the elder
statesmen of Greek politics, Defense Minister Apostolos
Tsohatzopoulos, is among those who hope that the shock of the
Ocalan affair will lead to a new dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very heavy blow to Greece, and it created a
political and ethical crisis here,'' Tsohatzopoulos said. ``I see
it as a chance to change the bad perceptions that exist.''

<P>
   Tradition says that when someone interested in converting to
Judaism knocks on a synagogue's door, the rabbi should turn him
away _ not once but three times, to test the seriousness of the
person's intent. Unlike Christianity, Judaism emphatically shuns
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if many rabbis today are not so discouraging as that,
what would happen if they took a really different tack and
encouraged spiritual seekers to embrace Judaism?
</P>
<P>
   That idea is gaining attention _ and some hot criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Among its exponents is Gary Tobin, president of the Institute
for Jewish and Community Research in San Francisco, who advocates
``a positive, welcoming approach to non-Jews becoming Jews.''
Tobin, the author of ``Opening the Gates: How Proactive Conversion
Can Revitalize the Jewish Community'' (Jossey-Bass), is not alone
in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Rabbi Alexander Schindler, then president of the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Reform Judaism's synagogue
organization, spoke publicly of the value of reaching out to the
unaffiliated. Abraham's tent, he said, ``was continually open on
all four sides for fear that he would miss a wandering nomad and
fail to bid him enter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, the organization has offered a free program,
advertised in secular newspapers and hosted by synagogues around
the country. ``A Taste of Judaism'' has sessions on Jewish
spirituality, ethics and community.
</P>
<P>
   This program has attracted 17,000 people, half of them Jews
interested in learning more about their faith, the other half
non-Jews, according to the union's director of outreach, Dru
Greenwood. A union survey found that one in seven among the
non-Jews went on to study for conversion.
</P>
<P>
   One ``Taste of Judaism'' class this spring at the South Street
Temple in Lincoln, Neb., drew about 80 people, including Jews,
Christians, agnostics and others. Afterward, 10 non-Jews expressed
interest in conversion; none of them was married to a Jewish
partner, said Cantor Michael Weisser, the synagogue's spiritual
leader. ``I think what attracts non-Jewish people to Judaism once
they get a tiny taste of it is the logic of it, the ability to
argue with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, though, has suggested that Jews should be out ringing
doorbells or passing out magazines. Jewish outreach efforts, like
the union's program and similar efforts elsewhere, are restrained,
taking the form of invitations to study and directed primarily
toward people with family ties to Jews, or those already seriously
interested in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a conference at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New
York City in May, Tobin said the Jewish community would help itself
by reaching out to non-Jewish partners in interfaith marriages,
their children, people with some Jewish ancestry and gentiles
spiritually searching. Converts bring an enthusiasm for their new
identity that inspires other Jews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New converts, Tobin said in an interview, are not a magic bullet
to remedy Jews' concerns about cultural assimilation, a low birth
rate and the rise in marriages between Jews and non-Jews, which
many fear often produces families without a clear identity. Rather,
reaching out is an expression of American Jews' position in a
democratic, religiously pluralistic society. ``We're strong enough
and secure enough that we can think about growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Converts are already a presence in American Jewish life. Most
who convert are married or engaged to Jews. Of the nation's 6
million Jews, about 180,000, or 3 percent, identify themselves as
converts, or ``Jews by choice.''
</P>
<P>
   This discussion has taken place amid two larger trends.
Anti-Semitism has declined in America, removing a barrier against
assimilation but also making it socially easier for non-Jews to
consider conversion. A widespread search for spirituality is also
running at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant churches lost their dominance of the religious
culture years ago. Their influence was offset by what many perceive
as a free market of faiths more or less equally competing for the
attention of spiritual seekers, said Rabbi A. James Rudin,
interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Jewish groups should enter this free market is
another matter. Some reject efforts at major outreach as faddish, a
threat to provoke counter-efforts by some Christian groups or, at
worst, a waste of time, talent and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep concern about this kind of approach among
people in all sectors of American Judaism,'' said Jack Wertheimer,
provost and professor of American Jewish history at the Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said he was not against people converting to Judaism.
But he objected to major efforts because they amounted to ``an
expression of panic, a real lack of faith'' in ``traditional
methods of transmitting Jewish identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critical is Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald, director of the
Jewish National Outreach Program, which runs short courses in basic
Judaism, essential Hebrew and a beginners' religious service, all
designed to bring Jews closer to their faith. Buchwald spoke at
Tobin's conference, declaring that the Jewish community needed to
invest far more time and money in educating Jewish children so they
would not lose their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ``expend Jewish resources trying to convince a
gentile to put on a yarmulke,'' Buchwald said at the conference,
the future depended on exposing Jewish children to the ``joyous,
optimistic side of Judaism.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tradition says that when someone interested in converting to
Judaism knocks on a synagogue's door, the rabbi should turn him
away _ not once but three times, to test the seriousness of the
person's intent. Unlike Christianity, Judaism emphatically shuns
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if many rabbis today are not so discouraging as that,
what would happen if they took a really different tack and
encouraged spiritual seekers to embrace Judaism?
</P>
<P>
   That idea is gaining attention _ and some hot criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Among its exponents is Gary Tobin, president of the Institute
for Jewish and Community Research in San Francisco, who advocates
``a positive, welcoming approach to non-Jews becoming Jews.''
Tobin, the author of ``Opening the Gates: How Proactive Conversion
Can Revitalize the Jewish Community'' (Jossey-Bass), is not alone
in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Rabbi Alexander Schindler, then president of the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Reform Judaism's synagogue
organization, spoke publicly of the value of reaching out to the
unaffiliated. Abraham's tent, he said, ``was continually open on
all four sides for fear that he would miss a wandering nomad and
fail to bid him enter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, the organization has offered a free program,
advertised in secular newspapers and hosted by synagogues around
the country. ``A Taste of Judaism'' has sessions on Jewish
spirituality, ethics and community.
</P>
<P>
   This program has attracted 17,000 people, half of them Jews
interested in learning more about their faith, the other half
non-Jews, according to the union's director of outreach, Dru
Greenwood. A union survey found that one in seven among the
non-Jews went on to study for conversion.
</P>
<P>
   One ``Taste of Judaism'' class this spring at the South Street
Temple in Lincoln, Neb., drew about 80 people, including Jews,
Christians, agnostics and others. Afterward, 10 non-Jews expressed
interest in conversion; none of them was married to a Jewish
partner, said Cantor Michael Weisser, the synagogue's spiritual
leader. ``I think what attracts non-Jewish people to Judaism once
they get a tiny taste of it is the logic of it, the ability to
argue with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, though, has suggested that Jews should be out ringing
doorbells or passing out magazines. Jewish outreach efforts, like
the union's program and similar efforts elsewhere, are restrained,
taking the form of invitations to study and directed primarily
toward people with family ties to Jews, or those already seriously
interested in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a conference at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New
York City in May, Tobin said the Jewish community would help itself
by reaching out to non-Jewish partners in interfaith marriages,
their children, people with some Jewish ancestry and gentiles
spiritually searching. Converts bring an enthusiasm for their new
identity that inspires other Jews, he said.

rate and the rise in marriages between Jews and non-Jews, which
many fear often produces families without a clear identity. Rather,
reaching out is an expression of American Jews' position in a
democratic, religiously pluralistic society. ``We're strong enough
and secure enough that we can think about growth,'' he said.

   Theaters Move to Enforce Ratings
</P>
<P>
   An organization representing the owners of most of the United
States' movie theaters announced that they would begin requiring
young people who are not accompanied by adults to show photo
identification cards proving they are at least 17 years old, when
they try to buy tickets to R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the National Association of Theater Owners, was
responding to public concern that violent movies lead teen-agers to
commit violence themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts were pessimistic, however. They said the move might
backfire by making the movies all the more alluring because of the
challenge of getting in.
</P>
<P>
   And many teen-agers expressed confidence they would find ways to
sneak into whatever movies they wanted.

   A Food Scare in Europe
</P>
<P>
   Belgian animal feed tainted with dioxin caused a food crisis
that scared governments around the world into banning many poultry,
meat and dairy products from all European countries because of
fears they contained the poison.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities first discovered high concentrations of the
poison, which accumulates in fatty tissues, in sick chickens last
March, but waited until two weeks ago to tell the Belgian and
European public and take poultry off the market. Later, beef, pork,
and butter were added to the list while officials ascertained which
products were safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Belgians satisfied European Union authorities
that they had done so, filling their supermarket shelves and
resuming exports. But the Europeans remained furious at the way
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition government had handled
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities say that they traced the problem to chicken
and animal feed from a single Belgian feed company, and that it is
now under control.

   Court Frees Woman Who Threatened Cosby

   A federal appeals court in New York overturned the conviction of
Autumn Jackson, who was sent to prison for threatening to tell a
supermarket tabloid that she was Bill Cosby's out-of-wedlock
daughter unless he paid her $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson, who had served about 14 months of her 26-month
prison term, was released on Thursday, one of her lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not yet said whether they will appeal the
decision of the three-judge panel, or retry Ms. Jackson and two
associates who were also convicted. Legal experts said the ruling
may have broader significance by helping to clarify what
constitutes an acceptable threat, as opposed to blackmail or
extortion.

   A New Plan for Drug Coverage Under Medicare
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants to expand Medicare to cover prescription
drugs, and White House officials disclosed some details of the
proposal. They also said, however, that they were still trying to
figure out how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of elderly people say they cannot afford the drugs they
need, and many Democrats are hoping to retake control of the House
of Representatives in next year's elections by running on the
promise of Medicare drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the proposed
drug benefit would be ``universal and affordable,'' would have ``a
modest premium'' and would be ``better than anything you could buy
today in the open market.''

</P>
<P>
   As a young man, George Bush had to bail out of a Navy fighter he
was piloting over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two years ago, at the age of 72, the former
president hit the silk again over Arizona, prompting his wife
Barbara to tell him, ``It's the first time you've been in free-fall
since 1992.''

   Supreme Court Strikes Down Loitering Law Aimed at Gangs
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's anti-loitering law, a model for cities seeking to
reclaim the streets from violent gangs, was declared
unconstitutional. By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court said the law
gave the police too much discretion to sweep up innocent people in
their fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the law
didn't give police officers enough guidance. Under the law, he
said, ``it matters not whether the reason that a gang member and
his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob
an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving
the ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion suggested that Chicago could solve the problem
by rewriting the law to define prohibited behavior more precisely,
and Mayor Richard M. Daley vowed that the city would do so.
Municipal lawyers said they hoped to have a new version ready
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
challenged the 1992 law, said it would be hard to write a broad
anti-loitering law that would be both constitutional and effective.
</P>
<P>
   African National Congress Seals an Election Victory
</P>
<P>
   Final election results showed that South Africa's ruling African
National Congress, the party of outgoing President Nelson Mandela
and President-elect Thabo Mbeki, was re-elected in a landslide on
June 2, gaining even more Parliament seats than it got in 1994
during the country's first post-apartheid elections.
</P>
<P>
   The party fell just one seat short of the two-thirds majority it
needed if it wanted to start making changes to the Constitution,
though it can no doubt put together such a majority by making
alliances with smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to face a boisterous opposition, however. The new
Parliament will include 12 opposition parties, up from six last
time; it also includes several new outspoken personalities and a
far larger Democratic Party, which captured 38 seats, up from
seven. That party has been a vocal and effective government critic
and seems determined to continue in that vein.

   25,000-Year-Old Footprints

   In a cave in Southern France, scientists have found human

</P>
<P>
   The Chauvet cave was discovered in 1994 by spelunkers.
Scientists have since recorded 447 engraved and painted images of
animals there; they include some of the oldest and most stunning
images left by the ice-age inhabitants of Europe. The scientists
began to examine the footprints only last month.
</P>

to be 12,000 to 14,000 years old.

   Pope John Paul II was back in his native Poland again, this time
to focus attention on the 20th-century martyrdom of Christians and
underline the broad themes of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   The visit took a bizarre turn when the chief rabbi of Poland,
Pinchas Monachem Joskowicz, introduced himself on a receiving line
and addressed the pope directly, saying: ``I have a favor to ask
Mr. Pope'' _ to seek to remove a cross at the walls of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, broadcast live on Polish television, shocked many
Polish viewers and embarrassed leaders of Poland's Jewish
community, who said the setting was inappropriate and the form of
address scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear was that the incident would undermine their own more
diplomatic efforts to find a compromise over the visibility of the
cross at a site of great Jewish suffering. It was put up to
commemorate the pope's 1979 visit to Auschwitz, and as a memorial
to Christian victims of the Holocaust.

   Hillary Rodham Clinton took her most decisive step yet toward
running for the Senate from New York, declaring her lifelong
allegiance to the Bronx Bombers. At a White House ceremony honoring
the 1998 World Series champs, she got a Yankees cap that she tugged
over her forehead as she posed with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In this initial skirmishing over the Senate seat, Mrs. Clinton's
declaration amounted to a Bronx cheer to New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely rival and a diehard Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's sense of loyalty,
since she was born and bred in Chicago and had worn her love for
the Cubs on her sleeve.
</P>

   No problem, Mrs. Clinton said. Because the Cubs were in the

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congratulations!'' the letter begins. ``Your entry has been
accepted for the 39th `Run to the Clouds.' More than half of this
year's applicants were rejected in the lottery. Now that you are
IN, please take a few moments to read this letter carefully. The
information that follows will help you avoid problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Elated to learn that you will be allowed to run the Mount
Washington Road Race, in which just under 1,000 (pick one:
competitors, adventure-seekers, idiots) will begin the 7.6-mile
trek up the Auto Road from Gorham, N.H., to the 6,288-foot summit
at 10 a.m. Saturday, June 19, you read on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Course rises 4,650 vertical feet at an average 11.5 percent
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carry extra clothing in case of dangerous wind chill above
tree line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have someone meet you at the top with mittens, a hat, and a
winter jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``BE PREPARED!''
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations?
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell people you're running up the Auto Road, and they look
at you as if you have two heads,'' conceded Julie Peterson of
Beverly, Mass., who will run this year for the sixth time and has
never finished lower than third.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Washington is likely the steepest road race in the United
States, rising 611.8 vertical feet per mile, compared to 586.7 feet
for the Pike's Peak Ascent. The mountain's weather, some of the
worst in the world, includes a world-record wind speed of 231 miles
per hour during a storm in 1934. In June, the average temperature
at the top is usually around freezing. Gusts of 60 miles per hour
that blow runners sideways are common on race day, and there is
often fog above the treeline.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, you can't keep 'em away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most modern Americans are bored to tears, so they need a
challenge,'' theorized Bob Teschek, race director. ``It used to be
work or your daily life, now it's sport.''
</P>
<P>
   According to those who have done it, the challenge begins
stunningly quickly. Peter Watson of Rockport, Mass., who has run in
the race for 12 consecutive years, described the start in idyllic
terms: going over a little bridge, up a small incline, and into the
woods. Then, you turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you take that right, the steepness hits you like a
sledgehammer,'' said Watson, 60. ``You have the sense the first
time that it never, ever lets up.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson finished 483d last year, in a time of 1 hour, 50 minutes,
and 19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Dunham may have been 479 places and 47 minutes ahead of
him, but he shared the same impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we hit a turn I said, `It's got to flatten out,' ''
recalled Dunham, a three-time winner, of his first assault on the
course. ``It never flattens out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's never, as in not once. According to John Stifler, who ran
the race in 1989 and is now the race's media director, ``There is
literally not one level step.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quarter-mile of slight downhill at the start, the course
goes straight up, except for a brief stretch somewhere in the
second mile. ``I think it's 11 steps, maybe 12,'' said Stifler.
``But nobody remembers them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 90 percent of the entrants walk at some point, but
timing stops at three hours, so no one dallies. Hardly anyone gives
up, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a race to drop out of,'' explained Stifler. Besides
the pride factor, he said, ``at a certain point it can't get any
worse than it is, so you just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   After the surprising steepness at the beginning and the steady
steepness in the middle comes a brief respite of just plain steep,
before the staggering steepness just before the finish line of a
22-percent grade, twice the pitch of the rest of the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way they could make it worse is to have you climb the
radio tower at the end,'' observed Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the first timed run up Mount Washington goes to
George Foster, a medical student out to impress his friends in
1904, according to a history of the race. Foster finished in 1 hour
and 42 minutes, faster, at the time, than any automobile had ever
made the trek.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, the first race was held, with 12 runners finishing. For
the next two years, the race grew, but then it wasn't held again
until 1961, when it was revived to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the Mount Washington Carriage Road. That year's
winner was John J. Kelley, winner of the 1957 Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old chestnut is, `There's only one hill,' '' said Kelley
last week. ``You can fool your legs until about 2 miles (into the
race). The idea is, you didn't go out too fast, and you got slower
as you went,'' said Kelley, reached at his home in Mystic, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been 38 years since that victory, the man still
known as Johnny the Younger (to distinguish him from the legendary
John A. Kelley, who has run Boston 61 times and won twice, in 1935
and 1945) can recall every detail: the weather (about 70 degrees at
the base, 34 degrees and sleet at the top), how he felt (``just as
whacked as the last 6 miles of a marathon''), what he worried about
(``from 3 to 6 miles I was quite concerned my legs would numb out
and cease to be operational'').
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``I enjoyed it as much as you can enjoy any
masochistic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley and Jacqueline Gareau are the only two Boston Marathon
winners to also triumph at Mount Washington, but they are not the
only elite marathoners to have success there. Just two years ago,
two-time Olympic marathoner Cathy O'Brien of Durham, N.H., won,
with Joan Benoit Samuelson right behind her, setting a women's
masters record (age 40-44) of 1:16:03 in coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through stages of thinking, `Gee, this isn't so bad.
This is bad. This is terrible. This isn't so bad,' '' said O'Brien.
``Was that fun? (Running) it is something that in a weak moment you
could be talked into. It isn't rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the race appeals especially to older runners. There are
almost as many entrants 60 and over this year (61) as there are
under 30 (71).
</P>
<P>
   Runners who have done all the other races and have run the
fastest marathon they're ever going to run start looking around for
new frontiers, and, voila, there's Mount Washington, explained
Stifler.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there's nothing really special about the training.
If you're already a runner, doing some speed work or adding some
hills to improve your cardiovascular strength is really about all
you can do, since there is nothing like the course and conditions.
</P>
<P>
   While the ascent may be physically and mentally draining in the
extreme, the recovery is mercifully swift. Explained Watson: ``Your
feet don't get more than three inches off the ground at any one
point,'' so there is little impact, which minimizes the strain on
muscles and joints.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Campbell, 81, of Lynnfield, Mass., is a member of the New
England 65 Plus Runners Club. Last year, he shattered the course
record for runners 80-84, completing the trek in 2:19:48. He'll be
back Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the good Lord is kind to me, I'll do it as many years as I
can,'' said Campbell. ``I'd like to be able to run it into my
90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hodge of Clinton, Mass., who has won the race a record seven
times, has perhaps the most basic outlook on the relentless climb,
the arduous effort, the implacable and mocking mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything in running is overrated in terms of
difficulty, even the marathon,'' said Hodge, who has run 19 times.
``It's just one foot in front of the other.''

   Theaters Move to Enforce Ratings
</P>
<P>
   An organization representing the owners of most of the United
States' movie theaters announced that they would begin requiring
young people who are not accompanied by adults to show photo
identification cards proving they are at least 17 years old, when
they try to buy tickets to R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the National Association of Theater Owners, was
responding to public concern that violent movies lead teen-agers to
commit violence themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts were pessimistic, however. They said the move might
backfire by making the movies all the more alluring because of the
challenge of getting in.
</P>
<P>
   And many teen-agers expressed confidence they would find ways to
sneak into whatever movies they wanted.

   A Food Scare in Europe
</P>
<P>
   Belgian animal feed tainted with dioxin caused a food crisis
that scared governments around the world into banning many poultry,
meat and dairy products from all European countries because of
fears they contained the poison.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities first discovered high concentrations of the
poison, which accumulates in fatty tissues, in sick chickens last
March, but waited until two weeks ago to tell the Belgian and
European public and take poultry off the market. Later, beef, pork,
and butter were added to the list while officials ascertained which
products were safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Belgians satisfied European Union authorities
that they had done so, filling their supermarket shelves and
resuming exports. But the Europeans remained furious at the way
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition government had handled
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities say that they traced the problem to chicken
and animal feed from a single Belgian feed company, and that it is
now under control.

   Court Frees Woman Who Threatened Cosby

supermarket tabloid that she was Bill Cosby's out-of-wedlock
daughter unless he paid her $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson, who had served about 14 months of her 26-month
prison term, was released on Thursday, one of her lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not yet said whether they will appeal the
decision of the three-judge panel, or retry Ms. Jackson and two
associates who were also convicted. Legal experts said the ruling
may have broader significance by helping to clarify what
constitutes an acceptable threat, as opposed to blackmail or
extortion.

   A New Plan for Drug Coverage Under Medicare

proposal. They also said, however, that they were still trying to

   Millions of elderly people say they cannot afford the drugs they

drug benefit would be ``universal and affordable,'' would have ``a
modest premium'' and would be ``better than anything you could buy

   A little more than two years ago, at the age of 72, the former

   Supreme Court Strikes Down Loitering Law Aimed at Gangs
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's anti-loitering law, a model for cities seeking to
reclaim the streets from violent gangs, was declared
unconstitutional. By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court said the law
gave the police too much discretion to sweep up innocent people in
their fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the law
didn't give police officers enough guidance. Under the law, he
said, ``it matters not whether the reason that a gang member and
his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob
an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving
the ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion suggested that Chicago could solve the problem
by rewriting the law to define prohibited behavior more precisely,
and Mayor Richard M. Daley vowed that the city would do so.
Municipal lawyers said they hoped to have a new version ready
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
challenged the 1992 law, said it would be hard to write a broad
anti-loitering law that would be both constitutional and effective.

   African National Congress Seals an Election Victory
</P>
<P>
   Final election results showed that South Africa's ruling African
National Congress, the party of outgoing President Nelson Mandela
and President-elect Thabo Mbeki, was re-elected in a landslide on
June 2, gaining even more Parliament seats than it got in 1994
during the country's first post-apartheid elections.
</P>
<P>
   The party fell just one seat short of the two-thirds majority it
needed if it wanted to start making changes to the Constitution,
though it can no doubt put together such a majority by making
alliances with smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to face a boisterous opposition, however. The new
Parliament will include 12 opposition parties, up from six last
time; it also includes several new outspoken personalities and a
far larger Democratic Party, which captured 38 seats, up from
seven. That party has been a vocal and effective government critic
and seems determined to continue in that vein.

25 YEARS WITHOUT DUENDE 
</HEADLINE>

 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day I read the newspapers and every day I miss George
Frazier more. In the 25 years since he died, on June 13, 1974, no
other columnist has come along to equal him. But as his friend
Charlie Davidson points out, how could anyone take his place? ``No
one says: `I want to be another Bobby Short,' '' Davidson said the
other day. ``He's a singular talent. So was George.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lydon, host of WBUR's ``The Connection'' and another
FOG (friend of George), sees a lot of Frazier in Maureen Dowd,
Christopher Buckley, Christopher Hitchens, Stanley Crouch. These
writers and others show Frazieresque flashes of wit and mischief.
They can be irreverent or erudite, scathing or silly or lyrical.
But not one of them does it all. Frazier did, and he did it for a
daily newspaper, three, four, even six times week.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was an unusually graceful and literate writer, a master
of a dazzling range of styles. He practically invented attitude. He
had a gift for irritating people, and he did it in the most
entertaining way. He was born, reared, and educated in Boston, and
knew this city's curious ways as well as any native, but he spent
most of his working life in New York. His Boston newspaper career
spanned only seven years, three years at the Herald in the 1960s,
four at the Globe in the 1970s. In those few years, he made a
powerful impact on readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has this extraordinary effect on people who knew
him,'' said Charles Fountain, who wrote a biography of Frazier,
``Another Man's Poison.'' Fountain said he still gets a dozen or so
inquiries a year from people who want to know where they can buy
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University,
included in his book a telling analysis of Frazier's value by the
poet L. E. Sissman, who in the magazine Metro likened Frazier to
Shaw and Mencken as someone willing to ``think the unthinkable and
say the unsayable in print.''
</P>
<P>
   Sissmen continued: ``Eccentric, erratic, irascible, and, more
important, irrational, he takes on targets of opportunity, beats
them with verbal bladders without regard for his own personal job
security, and makes us think about his targets and ourselves.
Frazier doesn't throw baby punches; he hits hard out of the
mounting waspishness most of us increasingly feel, and makes blood
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it with such grace and wit. We're feeling more
waspish than ever, but who could take his place? Don Imus's name is
mentioned. Obviously he's not a writer, but Imus has, or had, a
similar ability to provoke, to think the unthinkable, say the
unsayable. ``Don Imus five years ago, before he became a Fortune
500 company, was, in a way, what Frazier was when he was at the
Herald and the Globe,'' Fountain said.
</P>
<P>
   Lydon, too, sees a certain similarity. ``The beautiful thing
about Imus four or five years ago was the same thing that was true
of George,'' he said. ``They could bring you up to speed on the
whole Zeitgeist in about 10 minutes. TV. Sports. Politics. A book.
A joke.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to wonder whether Frazier would like being
compared to Imus, even the Imus of a few years ago, before he
became a bloated parody of his former self. ``George would have
turned on him long ago,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after his death, Frazier's name keeps coming
up. Just last Saturday, I heard Craig Mustard and Larry Johnson
discussing Frazier on WEEI Sports Radio. Johnson took umbrage at
Mustard's repeated use of the word ``duende,'' a favorite theme of
Frazier's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring him up all the time, when we talk about taste or
clothes or writing,'' said Davidson, owner of the Andover Shop in
Harvard Square. ``Every time I turn around, somebody's using
`duende,' and I know that half of them don't know what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier wrote that Duende (he capitalized the word) denoted
``electricity'' or ``the certain something that sets persons
apart.'' He wrote whole columns about who had it and who didn't
(``Fred Astaire has it to the degree that Gene Kelly lacks it . . .
Jack Lemmon is Duende, Tony Randall could not be less so . . .'').
When he wrote that the Andover Shop had Duende, Davidson swears
someone called to ask what colors it came in.
</P>
<P>
   Monica. O.J. Simpson. The death of Diana. Marv Albert. The
decline of Brooks Brothers. Bill Weld. Foodies. Elvis's death and
reincarnation. Mike Tyson. Madonna. The resurrection of Richard
``The Mad Bomber'' Nixon. Bob Kraft. Martha Stewart. The deaths of
Sinatra and DiMaggio. It seems impossible that Frazier wasn't here
for any of the above, and so much more. Many times I've wondered
what he would have written about one thing or another. I'll go on
wondering for the rest of my life. He was, as Charlie Davidson
said, a singular talent.

SUSPENSE TO SPARE 
</HEADLINE>

IN A DRY SEASON 
By Peter Robinson 
Avon, 422 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The murder victim in Peter Robinson's ``In a Dry Season'' has
been dead for half a century when this resonantly satisfying
suspense novel opens. That we come to care as much as we do about
the person who animated these old bones is a tribute to the
author's foremost talent. Able plotter and smooth stylist that he
is, Robinson is above all a gifted creator of fully fleshed and
vividly present characters.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the central role in the book played by Alan Banks
(this is the author's 10th Inspector Banks novel), the real
protagonist is the passionate, pretty, and ill-fated Gloria
Stringer. At first merely a forensic puzzle to Banks, she becomes
an obsession, both a magnetically appealing human being whose
reality he helps to rescue from the past, and a symbol of the
tragedies of victimization that drove him into police work.
Attractive, likable, complexly flawed, and fatally wronged, she
generates a charge that is felt on almost every page of this
eminently readable novel.
</P>
<P>
   Her skeleton is discovered accidentally in the muck of the
empty, ruined North Yorkshire village of Hobb's End, once covered
by the waters of a reservoir but now exposed again in an especially
dry season. Banks, himself a richly realized character _ a
grittier, funkier version of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse _ is
assigned to investigate the remains for disciplinary reasons. His
officious superintendent dislikes him for being vaguely
insubordinate _ in fact, the reflective and often philosophical
Banks is merely independent and unsuited to office politics.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the intended putdown turns into a plum as Banks
gathers (forensically fascinating) evidence suggesting an
unreported and unavenged crime of passion committed during the
1940s. Into the bargain, Banks, estranged from his wife, aquires an
enchanting girlfriend in the person of Annie Cabbot, an intuitive
and self-determining detective sergeant in the mold of Banks
himself.
</P>
<P>
   By braiding together three distinctly different narrative
strands, Robinson creates a suspense novel with many of the dynamic
qualities of more literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   One strand is the lively present-day police procedural following
Banks's investigation, enriched by his risky romance with a
subordinate and the complications of his imploding middle-aged
life. His son has renounced university life to pursue a career in
pop music, aggravating the tension between them. Smoking too many
cigarettes and brooding about his choice of profession, his ancient
hatred of schoolyard bullies, and his own unappreciative
working-class parents, Banks is as deeply and thoroughly faceted as
any serial detective, British or American, I can think of.
</P>
<P>
   A second narrative element is a journal by Gwynneth Shackleton,
chronicling her life in Hobb's End and, in particular, her close
wartime friendship with Gloria Stringer, a mysterious refugee there
from the London blitz. Gloria eventually marries Gwynneth's brother
but also manages to inflame a number of other men, including
several posted at the American air base established nearby late in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson masterfully embodies the voice of the awkward,
literarily inclined Gwynneth and, through her, paints a remarkable
picture not only of Gloria but also of English wartime existence,
filled with colorful and intriguing historical details. Gloria, for
example, comes to Hobb's End as a member of the Women's Land Army,
a corps of young women assigned to replace soldiers who did farm
work. There is much attention to the stringent rationing of the day
and the hardships of nightly blackouts. In one country town,
``People had ... put little dabs of luminous paint on their
doorbells, which glowed like fireflies all along the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The third narrative line involves an aging crime writer, the
best-selling Vivian Elmsley, who's increasingly disturbed by the
nationally breaking news of Banks's investigation. As more is
disclosed about the old bones and the violence they reveal, she is
assailed by feelings of grief and guilt. But just what role the
unraveling author played in the wartime crime isn't made clear
until the novel's melodramatic but neatly satisfying conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   British crime novels tend to be baggier than their leaner, and
generally meaner, American counterparts, and often seem padded with
digressions and eccentric swatches of local color that curb their
narrative drive. But Robinson's book justifies its considerable
length with its well-built and finely polished multi-voiced
structure. His rather daring approach to the genre has the effect
both of deepening the form and intensifying the anguish and
excitement we expect from good suspense fiction.

ALBRIGHT'S TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Of Slobodan Milosevic's endgame canards, none is
sicker than his boast that his beaten armed forces never gave up
Kosovo, and never will give up Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The boast is understandable in the context of this murderous
loser's effort to stay in power. But its absurdity suggests an
awareness of the domestic consequences possibly in store for him
should the citizens of his shrinking ``country'' come to understand
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to see how they can be shielded from it, given what is
about to unfold. The NATO victors have yet to discuss Kosovo's
future in detail, mostly because Russia's large contribution to the
diplomatic side of the conflict merits a decent respect for its
concerns, but NATO's planning envisages a future where any notion
of Yugoslav ``sovereignty'' on paper will have no meaning on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the fact that sovereignty should not be permitted
is a major consequence of the end of the fourth conflict Milosevic
has started within what used to be a functional Yugoslav federation
of six republics plus the then-autonomous province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For this consequence, the world has Madeleine Albright to thank.
Unlike her counterparts and foreign policy establishments
throughout the West still mired in Cold War old thinking, she has
spent years thinking about the conflict between self-determination
of peoples and the sovereignty of states.
</P>
<P>
   I remember her euphoria in 1989 as European communism began to
shatter, especially as the Velvet Revolution of her friend, Vaclav
Havel, succeeded in her native Czechoslovakia; so was her concern
as Czechoslovakia split in two. Then the Soviet Union went through
the demise that spawned more than a dozen new nations. And, as the
1992 presidential campaign was still taking shape, she was positive
that the pivotal test would come as mass murder in the name of
virulent nationalism began under the guidance of Milosevic in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even before becoming UN ambassador, Albright had no illusions
about the conflict and the test. At its extreme, self-determination
could produce a phenomenon linked to the very region in flames _
Balkanization; and at its own extreme, respect for sovereignty
meant tolerance for the kind of mass murder within borders. She was
also realistic about the challenge of uniting Europe against even a
monster with the political genes of Hitler and Mussolini. She was
similarly aware of the difficulties in summoning US will against an
evil not widely seen as directly threatening. And she acknowledged
that there had to be a link between an effort to respond to evil
and an ability to make a difference, meaning the United States
could not act with force in every situation, and that it would
almost always need allies in situations where making a difference
was possible.
</P>
<P>
   But she was convinced that sovereignty could not be immune from
challenge in a post-Cold War world, and, above all, not in Europe's
still-unstable South. And so she went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was maddeningly slow, but military action from the air
leading to peacekeepers on the ground was at long last taken in
Bosnia in 1995 and now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's blather aside, consider the record: Slovenia, free;
Croatia, free; Bosnia, de facto partitioned, still a mess, but
independent and peaceful; Montenegro, its hold on autonomy from
Belgrade tenuous but real; Macedonia, free and probably out of
immediate danger of destabilization from Milosevic's assault by
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it is also impossible not to believe that ideals
of democracy and free markets haven't been strengthened in Albania,
Bulgaria, and Romania, and that Turkey and Greece don't have even
stronger reasons for settling their dangerous differences over
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Kosovo. As Albright said, Milosevic has lost his
control. The currency for the immediate future is most likely to be
the dollar and the mark; the new trade patterns will flow south and
west, not north to Serbia; and once the armed perpetrators of
murder and displacement are back in Serbia, their return becomes
inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the NATO, European Union, UN, and other plans for
reconstruction involve a gradual erection of civilian leadership,
beginning with local elections. But every so often an official will
slip up privately and refer to the next level of elections down the
road in Kosovo as ``national.'' If ever tears and blood can be said
to qualify a people for internationally sanctioned
self-determination, the Kosovars are entitled.
</P>
<P>
   When we spoke by phone from Cologne Thursday night, Albright was
totally focused on the enormous scale of her tasks ahead, but
obviously aware a major corner has been turned _ in this crisis and
in the broader friction between self-determination and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the false euphoria that produced ``new world order''
babble in the Persian Gulf period, she is wary of grand summary,
but also venue-shopping for a major speech soon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what has happened, Albright will get the hearing she
richly deserves.

ELECTION IN INDONESIA IS HARDLY SETTLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After Indonesia's first democratic
elections in 44 years, the ruling party of ousted autocratic
President Suharto has conceded defeat, ending decades of one-party
rule.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a complex and indirect voting system, the race for
the presidency is just beginning and the final winners and losers
in Indonesia's transition to democracy are not at all clear.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the outcome of every election here was well known
in advance; the ruling Golkar party banned most opposition and
rigged results when intimidation and vote-buying did not work. But
even if massive cheating finally ended with last Monday's vote,
that does not mean the widely reviled ruling party has been
eliminated from power.
</P>
<P>
   A year after anti-Suharto riots claimed 1,200 lives and forced
the autocrat to step down, voters' expectations for democratic
change are soaring. If a split vote enables Suharto's old party to
cobble together a coalition, analysts suggested that Indonesians
may take to the streets again in fury.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ``the opposition has restrained itself, because they
are expecting to win,'' said Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of the
Jakarta-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   But what if those hopes are dashed?
</P>
<P>
   Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle
still leads official and unofficial vote counts, but nearly every
tally has Golkar in a surprise second-place finish in the
parliamentary race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really talking about a choice among 48 parties, but
between the Suharto order and a new political system. . . . Even if
20 percent of people voted for Golkar, that means four-fifths of
the people want a new government,'' said Wimar Witoelar, an
oppostion political commentator and radio host.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters will not choose the next president. It will be
the national assembly _ made up of 462 newly elected members, 38
military appointees, 135 regional electors and 65 representatives
from minority groups. That leaves the field open for deal-making
among 700 people who will choose the leader of the world's
fourth-most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking now among potential winners is that we've got to
avoid being mathematical about it, and we have to play the game and
show which way the political wind is blowing so those people
capable of buying votes realize they cannot do it,'' Witoelar
added. ``Those who select the president in November should realize
they will face the wrath of the people if they do not choose one of
the leaders of the reform movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without dirty dealing, however, votes for Parliament do not
translate directly into seats. Indonesia's district/proportional
voting system overrepresents thinly populated provinces, and the
ruling party remains strong in many outlying islands. For example,
the province of Irian Jaya has 1 million people and gets 12 seats
in Parliament, while the capital city Jakarta has more than 10
million people, but gets just 18 seats. By Golkar's count, it will
control the votes in 13 provinces, the same number as Megawati's
party.
</P>
<P>
   Projections based on the national distribution of votes indicate
that even with 38 percent of the vote Megawati's party holds so
far, it would get only 27 percent of parliamentary seats. In
contrast, Golkar, with 16 percent of votes, would get a
disproportionate 24 percent of seats. Golkar is farther ahead in
unofficial tallies that have tabulated more votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're conceding defeat in terms of the electoral count, but in
terms of the formation of the government, it's not over yet,'' said
Marzuki Darusman, cochairman of Golkar. Darusman said Golkar's
strategy was to boost its credibility among the public by accepting
technical defeat and thereby counter allegations of vote-tampering,
while ``building up the acceptability of cooperation'' with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces were long associated with Suharto, and military
appointees to Parliament may align themselves with the party of the
old regime. An array of small Muslim parties is also likely to side
with Golkar, partly because many could not accept a woman as
president and partly because her party represents secular rather
than religious interests. Megawati has also opposed granting
significant autonomy to restive provinces, a position that could
undermine her support with assembly members from those regions.
</P>
<P>
   That means it is conceivable that Megawati, the candidate
favored by the largest bloc of voters, may not have enough support
in the assembly to lead the next government.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the likely outcome would be a compromise
candidate, such as the sultan of Yogyakarta, the Muslim scholar
Nurcholis Majid or even General Wiranto, head of the armed forces.
``Golkar cannot control the government, it's not possible,'' said
Arbi Sanit, a political scientist at the University of Indonesia.
``But Megawati herself may not be the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that outcome would almost surely be unacceptable to the
nearly 40 percent of people who apparently voted for Megawati. That
in itself, some analysts said, could make any government without
her at its head unsustainable, because it would spark such outrage
and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Golkar leads the government, what will be the reaction of
the people?'' asked an Asian diplomat posted here. ``People are not
interested in the intricacies of how votes are allocated. They
thought they were voting for president, and voted for her.''

compromised figure set the pulses of liberal New Yorkers racing?''
Instead of shunning her for her role in the Clinton scandals, ``We
seem determined to conclude all over again that character doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee rains contempt on her efforts
to don a New York persona. ``If Hillary Clinton thinks New Yorkers
are too dumb to see through this phony White House photo-op,''
needles RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson, referring to last week's White
House reception for the New York Yankees, ``she's got an even lower
opinion of New York than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' animus toward Mrs. Clinton I understand. I
can't abide her, either. But their dudgeon over her Senate race and
the reaction thereto mystifies me.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't she run for New York's Senate seat? Because she's
not a New Yorker? Because she's never run for public office before?
Those to whom such factors matter can vote against her; why should
those with other priorities be denied the chance to vote for her?
Surely, an eight-year sojourn in the White House -- in (ital) this
(unial) White House -- is as useful a preparation for the blood
feuds and mosh pits of New York politics as anything she might have
learned by running for the Nassau County Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   She's popular in her party; she can raise money by the sackful;
her name recognition is 100 percent; she has powerful political
allies. She may be self-righteous and she may be ethically
challenged, but those can hardly be fatal flaws in a state that has
put Chuck Schumer and Al D'Amato in the Senate. New York voters may
eventually turn Hillary down -- that's the outcome I'll be rooting
for -- but there is nothing about her candidacy or the excitement
it ignites that anyone should find hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans really want to talk about a baffling political
craze, they need look no further than their own tent. What explains
the mania for George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   He is barely into his second term as governor of Texas, has
minimal experience in national politics, and is a virtual unknown
outside his part of the country. It is only this week that New
Hampshire voters are getting their first look at him. Yet, since at
least last fall -- two years before the 2000 election -- Bush has
been hailed as the candidate to beat for the GOP nomination.
Hundreds of Republican officials, including 19 governors, a dozen
senators, and 114 members of the US House, have already endorsed
him. Incredibly, many of these endorsers have never met Bush or
seen him in action.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been anything like it. The closest parallel to
the Bush hysteria is Dwight D. Eisenhower's vast popularity after
World War II. But not even Eisenhower, a five-star war hero, had
the Republican establishment kneeling at his feet this far in
advance of the election. On the contrary, the foremost Republican
in Washington, Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, contended with
Eisenhower for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After losing two elections to Bill Clinton, Republicans are
understandably desperate for a candidate who can win. But there is
something surreal about the stampede to Bush. It is like the rush
to buy Internet stocks, a frenzy to invest in a start-up with great
PR but no earnings history.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, George W. has a cheerful personality. He polls
well. He has carried Texas, a crucial state, twice. His brother is
governor of Florida, another crucial state.
</P>
<P>
   But who is he? What does he stand for? What are the principles
for which he would sacrifice his popularity? He talks about his
``compassionate conservatism'' the way his father talked about a
``kinder, gentler America.'' But George Sr. could never quite
articulate what he stood for; indeed, he had only disdain for ``the
vision thing.'' George Jr. may have a compelling answer to the
question of why he wants to be president, but so far he hasn't
offered one. Neither have his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan ran for president, nobody wondered what his
priorities were. The Gipper's philosophical clarity held a powerful
appeal; he was elected and reelected in back-to-back landslides. By
contrast, George Bush and Bob Dole never stood for much of
anything, and the voters gave them short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   And George W.? Is he a Reaganite or his father's son? Is he
seeking the White House because of a conviction that his country
needs him, or is he just surfing a wave? He spent the winter and
spring declining to answer questions about where he stands on the
issues or what he would do if he were president. Now, at last, the
presumed front-runner is ready to start running. Now, at last, we
will learn about his deeply-held political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's hard not to wonder: If George W. Bush (ital) had
(unital) deeply held political beliefs, wouldn't we already know
what they are?

STRONG ECONOMY STEALS GOP THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You are tired, says Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   You are ``exhausted and stressed,'' he says. ``You work hard.
You miss dinners. You miss breakfasts. Sometimes you skip your
child's play at school.'' And all because the government demands
that you work ever-harder to pay always-higher federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes puts it this way: Many of you are bankrupt,
``drowning in personal debt'' and in constant fear of creditors.
Many middle-class families are ``struggling to keep their heads
above water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lift up the hood on the American economy, and you will not find
the smooth-running machine that has made the United States an
island of prosperity in a turbulent world. At least, not if you are
a Republican candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   While much of America revels in a record-high stock market and
near record-low unemployment, the booming economy has become a
problem for Republicans as they try to dislodge the Democratic
Party from the White House. Traditionally, the party out of power
searches for some dissatisfaction among Americans and tries to turn
that feeling into votes.
</P>
<P>
   But voters are so content with their financial lives these days
that a whole range of familiar GOP themes has been blunted.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts? Americans are too busy earning money to worry about
trimming the government's share, a perennial Republican issue. In a
Gallup Poll last month, only 4 perecent of people cited the tax
burden as the nation's top problem _ down precipitously from 67
percent in early 1992, the last year Republicans held the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Improving the business climate, another common Republican
appeal, carries little urgency as the world pours money into US
stocks. Promises to create jobs mean little to a nation already at
work. And the balanced federal budget has made another GOP
evergreen issue _ cutting the size of government _ hard to get
passionate about.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more generous in their view of government when
they're doing well themselves,'' said Karlyn Bowman, a public
opinion scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ``There's not
the same opposition to federal programs as in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the general election is still 17 months away _
plenty of time for the red-hot economy to cool and for economic
complaints to take center stage. But for now, Republicans face a
challenge in raising some of their traditional themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency is to look to taxes and a balanced budget,'' said
Linda DiVall, a pollster working for GOP candidate Elizabeth Dole.
``But the robust economy means that Republicans have to deal with a
range of other issues that they were not as comfortable with in the
past, like education and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will it be easy for Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator, to use the economy to his advantage in chasing Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. ``I think he's
just going to have to find traction on other issues,'' said Charles
Cook, a political analyst and columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is often the overarching theme of an election.
President Clinton, for example, rode to power on the campaign
mantra: ``It's the economy, stupid.'' But for the party in power, a
strong economy will not always guarantee success. Richard Nixon cut
short an eight-year Democratic reign in 1968 despite a long-running
economic boom related to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore is not quite basking in the economic sunshine. Two
Republican candidates, Dole and Texas Governor George W. Bush, hold
significant leads on him in early polling.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans frequently vote their pocketbooks. A candidate who
can claim credit for putting money in the voters' wallets is in an
enviable position.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only a matter of time, many analysts say, before Gore
begins running TV ads promoting himself as the key architect, along
with Clinton, of the longest-running peacetime expansion on record.
The ads will probably brag that wages are up, unemployment is down,
and home ownership is at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will feature every leader of the Republican Party talking
in 1993 about how Clinton's plan for the economy will be the worst
thing in the history of mankind,'' said Cook. ``They will ask: Who
do you want? The team that did it, or the team that adamantly
opposed it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard for any Republican nominee to answer those
ads,'' acknowledges Jeffrey Bell, a policy aide to presidential
candidates Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Jack Kemp, who this year is
advising social conservative Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   So, what can a Republican candidate say about the economy?
``Change the subject in some way,'' advised Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just avoid it,'' said Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But that is nearly impossible for some Republicans. They are
running for two jobs at once: for president, and for heir to Reagan
as leader of the small-government, tax-cutting wing of the party.
That requires them to talk about how much those policy
prescriptions could do for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are trying a variety of strategies, often several at
once, to turn the economy to their advantage. Their tactics: &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Argue that times are not as good as they seem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The economy may look strong, but Representative John Kasich of
Ohio says that wage and productivity growth are ``far slower'' than
in past economic recoveries. Three-time candidate Patrick Buchanan
rails about the trade deficit, which he calls ``a malignant tumor
in the intestines of the US economy'' that is killing off US
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look behind the illusion of the Clinton and Gore magic show
and see what has happened in the years since they took over,''
urges Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor. ``Twelve more
countries have jumped over us in high school graduation rates; our
taxes are higher; the federal regulation book is thicker; our
national defense is weaker.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Deny the Democrats credit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The true hero of the economy is tax-cutter and inflation-fighter
Ronald Reagan, said Elizabeth Dole in a recent speech. She gave
credit for the current economy to Reagan, to the Republican
Congress, to Alan Greenspan, and to ``the powerful engine of
private enterprise.'' At the same time, she criticized Clinton and
Gore for raising taxes and adding burdensome federal regulations. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Cast taxes and prosperity as a moral issue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While polls show that Americans have few concerns aout the
economy, they are greatly worried about the challenge of raising
children amid a perceived decline in ethics and parenting skills.
Republicans are trying to bring the two issues together.
</P>
<P>
   High taxes keep Americans on the job and away from their
children, says Forbes. Arguing for tax cuts, he says: ``Just look
at the explosion of teenage crime and violence and drug abuse _
look at the emptiness in the lives of so many young people today _
and tell me that we shouldn't be doing everything that we possibly
can to set parents free to spend more time with each other and
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Quayle, the former vice president, says that high
taxes keep parents on the job and out of the home. And Bush speaks
of ``prosperity with a purpose.'' The Texas governor has not
defined the concept in detail, but says it entails ``not just
material wealth'' but a chance to help the needy and ``to
strenghten our families, where we find love and values.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -Argue that they will be better stewards of the current
prosperity than Al Gore &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also adopted this strategy, highlighting his work as
a senator on the 1986 tax reform bill and on the mid-'80s debt
crisis in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all of these are ``secondary arguments'' that will carry
less punch than Gore's claim to be directly responsible for the
good economy, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American
University in Washington. ``You've got to hit people between the
eyes, given that half of the people don't even vote. None of these
arguments will go very far,'' Lichtman predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, said Bell and other Republicans, the party is
hampered because it has already won the debate on several important
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed on to welfare reform, long a Republican goal. The
federal budget is in balance, a preoccupation of many Republicans.
And Democrats have largely abandoned any talk of a federal
industrial policy, especially now that Japan has tumbled into
recession. The Japanese government's role in controlling bank
lending and industry is considered a chief culprit in the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have a great deal to run on with the
economy,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National
Committee. ``We have real bragging rights in reforming welfare and
other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bell, the aide to Bauer, doubted that argument would sell.
``There may be truth to it, but voters are not interested,'' he
said. ``They don't dwell on who has the best claim to some change
that they favor. They'll give the benefit of the doubt to the
people in the White House.''

AS RATES FALL, DIGITAL CELL PHONES SWITCHING ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to look far to see that digital cell phones, as
opposed to the traditional analog ones, are fast becoming the most
popular type of wireless phone in this country.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny handsets are tucked into backpacks, briefcases, and
purses everywhere, and sales are brisk. In the first three months
of this year, 75 percent of the people who signed up for cellular
phone plans chose digital, not analog, service.
</P>
<P>
   There's good reason: Prices of the phones and plans are
dropping. And new plans come in simple bulk-rate packages _
hundreds of minutes at a flat monthly rate _ so people aren't so
anxious about each minute's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more people are addicted to the convenience of a cell
phone in their everyday life, no longer seeing it as something only
for an emergency. And the more you use the phone, the more
cost-effective it becomes to buy a digital plan.
</P>
<P>
   Analog phones remain a good buy for emergency users, largely
because the monthly cost can stay in the $15 range if you keep your
usage very low. But there's no question analog handsets are on
their way to extinction. In a few years, analysts say, analog
phones will be like black-and-white TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Analog service does have the benefit of being around longer.
There are more analog antennas up, offering superior coverage at
this time, particularly in rural areas. But analog relies on a
less-efficient technology: A person's entire voice is transmitted
across the radio channel, taking up more space along the channel.
With digital, a caller's voice is converted into a stream of binary
1's and 0's, which enables calls to be greatly compressed.
Per-minute charges with digital are generally cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Walton, an energetic 78-year-old, is among the new digital
converts. She just came to the end of a two-year contract with Bell
Atlantic Mobile, in which she had a clunky analog phone and paid
$15 a month for the service, as well as 35 to 99 cents a minute for
each local call. She wanted the phone for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But now she wants to use the phone more often, keeping her in
touch with family and friends regardless of where she is. After
looking around at all the carriers, she chose the Bell Atlantic
Mobile DigitalChoice plan that offers 200 minutes at $29.99, with
free nights and weekend calling. She also gets the entry-level
phone, a BAM300D, for $50 after rebates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convenience of these cell phones excites me,'' said
Walton, a retired school psychologist. ``It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to price for a moderate user, it's hard to beat
the Bell Atlantic and the Sprint entry-level digital plans. AT&AMP;T's
plans become more competitive if you are a more extensive user, and
Cellular One and Omnipoint offer cheaper monthly deals but with far
fewer minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond price, you have to consider what carrier offers the
best coverage for your needs. A cheap plan is useless if you can't
get a dial tone. Don't accept the mistaken notion _ often
perpetuated by cellular phone sales staff _ that your area is full
of cellular antennas providing blanket coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaps in coverage in the Boston area, for example, and
it's particularly noticeable if you rely on digital service only.
Carriers are scrambling to put up digital antennas, while facing
opposition from some communities.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what carrier is best for you, you have to do your
own homework. There's no simple chart available. It depends on
where you live and where you travel. Ask carriers for their
coverage maps and antenna locations, and talk to people who have
cell-phone experience in the areas where you travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``With competition and lots of choice, it requires people to do
a lot of research,'' said Mark Lowenstein of the Yankee Group, a
telecommunications research firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the maximum amount of coverage, it's best to stick
to dual-band phones, offering analog and digital service, and buy a
bucket of minutes that includes both types of calls. When you buy a
bucket of minutes with Bell Atlantic Mobile, AT&AMP;T Wireless, and
Cellular One, you get analog and digital types of minutes included.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's bucket only covers digital calls, with analog costing
extra. And Omnipoint phones can only handle digital calls, with no
option to roam onto analog service.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to consider is if you want a local or national
one-rate plan. Calls outside that area bring about extra per-minute
long-distance charges, as well as a deduction from your allotment
of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The national one-rate plans are more costly and require the
purchase of more minutes, but the amount you buy covers local and
long-distance calls. If you're a heavy long-distance caller, these
plans might be good for you.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating plans, think about what is truly important to
you. Some don't charge for the first incoming minute, which can be
a big benefit if you receive many calls that are only a sentence or
two. If you're unsure of how much you'll like the digital service,
you might want a month-to-month plan.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, take your time in doing your research and don't get
pressured into a deal because a sales person warns you a special
promotion is ending. Competition is fierce, and carriers want your
business badly. This week's Father's Day specials will probably be
next month's Fourth of July bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Documentary-film researcher Mario Valdes was
born in the Caribbean Basin country of Belize, part of a family
ensconced in the country's white power structure.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a teenager, he stumbled upon a family secret: His
roots actually dug deep into the Caribbean black majority,
considered by many whites to be lower-class descendants of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by what he learned about the blurring of family lines, and
his growing sense of the futility of racial distinctions, Valdes
embarked on a quest to challenge assumptions about race by tracing
the unknown African lineage of world figures.
</P>
<P>
   His latest genealogical effort _ in negotiations for an English
television documentary _ is causing an international stir: He
exposed the alleged black roots of England's Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sunday Times of London reported his findings last
week, Valdes became a sought-after man. He received calls from the
media across the British Commonwealth, and negotiations began for a
documentary series, including notables of African descent _ a
famous Russian poet and the first duke of Florence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This upsets the whole paradigm of the social ladder where
black is at the very bottom and royal houses at the very top,''
said Valdes, a light-skinned man of 58.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Valdes's claims about Queen Elizabeth is the family
tree he charted of England's Queen Charlotte, who died in 1818 and
who has been rumored for nearly two centuries to be a direct
descendant of a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of a recent scientific article that cited DNA
evidence of a probable relationship between Thomas Jefferson and
his slave Sally Hemings, and this year's 200th birthday of Russian
literary giant Alexander Pushkin _ a direct descendant of Ethiopian
Prince Ibrahim Hannibal _ the likely blood tie between the British
royal family and Africa again illustrates the extent of mixing of
black and white blood throughout the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the eyes of Valdes and other historians, it exposes the
resistance, particularly in white society, to acknowledge how much
race-mixing went on here and throughout Europe over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells us that we ought to be careful about defining race
and issues pertaining to race,'' said Selwyn Carrington, a British
Imperial historian at Howard University in Washington, D.C. ``That
outer layer of white or black is so subjective.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Valdes nearly two decades to trace the British royal
family's black blood line, but he said genealogical charts firmly
link Charlotte, the wife of King George III and grandmother of
Queen Victoria, to a Portuguese king and his Moorish mistress in
the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   But because royals tended to intermarry, Valdes said, he traced
six connections between Charlotte and Madalena Gil, the Moorish
``rite of conquest'' of a king who defeated her father's army at
Faro, a town in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Valdes might well be the first to document, link by
link, the strongly rumored black blood line of the British royal
family, he is not the first to give voice to the claims.
</P>
<P>
   During the black nationalism movement in the 1970s, blacks
throughout the British Commonwealth embraced Queen Charlotte as one
of their own. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canadians of African
ancestry insisted on having a black Mountie stand by the portrait
of Charlotte, which hangs in Government House in Halifax, Valdes
said.
</P>
<P>
   African-American historian Joel Rogers noted in his book ``100
Amazing facts about the Negro'' that Charlotte was of African
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a drum that has been beating in the black community
for a long time,'' Valdes said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, a 17-year-old German princess, was perceived to have
strong African features, which set off rumors of her ancestry as
soon as she arrived in England to marry the king in 1761. Sir
Walter Scott, a contemporary of the queen, described her family as
``ill-colored,'' and her personal physician, Baron Stockmar, said
she had ``true mulatto features,'' Valdes said. She had ``a nose
too flat . . . a mouth too large,'' Nora Lofts wrote in her book,
``Queens of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte was a handpicked bride for George III. The marriage
was a success: The couple remained close despite the king's illness
and alleged insanity, and they produced 15 children.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, some specialists on British peerage
tried to minimize Valdes's findings, saying the racial connection
is nothing more than a historical blip, given that it stretches
back so many centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is so remote,'' said David Williamson, co-editor of
Debrett's Peerage, a guide published in London every five years on
barons, dukes and duchesses, marquises, and other titled people.
``In any case, all European royal families somewhere are linked to
the kings of Castille. There is a lot of Moorish blood in the
Portuguese royal family and it has diffused over the rest of
Europe. The question is, who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   Said a Buckingham Palace spokesman, David Buck: ``This has been
rumored for years and years. It is a matter of history, and
frankly, we've got far more important things to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people celebrated the racial and cultural
ramifications of Queen Charlotte's lineage, saying the notion of a
shared ancestry could have important ramifications for multiracial
nations such as Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the public doesn't want to acknowledge what has been
a long-hidden secret, especially in America,'' said Shirlee Taylor
Haizlip, author of ``Sweeter the Juice,'' which chronicles the life
of her black family members who passed as whites. ``One of the
major cudgels of slavery was that black people were inferior to
white people. But it can be demonstrated that black people and
white people were very much intertwined.''
</P>
<P>
   Haizlip said she and others estimate that 70 to 95 percent of
European Americans have some black ancestry, and 80 percent of
black Americans have some white ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   One historian predicted that reaction to the African link would
probably be muted, even a little hostile, in certain British and
American circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a quest for political correctness,'' said
Eugene Black, a European history professor at Brandeis University.
``We have all these questions now about not-pure Anglo-Saxon
bloodlines, and I don't think that will play particularly well over
the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Haizlip, a former university lecturer on race, argued
that Pushkin, the Jefferson-Hemings link, and the black lineage of
Queen Elizabeth are ``important because (they) show that one group
is not less human or inferior to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, playwright Valerie Mason-John said, ``Most people are
not aware that the royal family has this black heritage. Not only
is it fascinating, but also people would want to know just how
diverse their background is because they are seen by many as the
model family.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the revelations about the alleged lineage of the
British royal family fulfilled Valdes's desire to make a strong
point about the merging of racial bloodlines.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sullivan, executive producer of the WGBH ``Frontline''
series of documentaries, said: ``He (Valdes) is the real thing. He
is on this gigantic personal quest to expose a view of race that I
think most of us are completely unaware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Valdes researched a number of cases of racial
crossing for film producer June Cross's Emmy-award winning
documentary ``Secret Daughter.'' Sullivan said ``Frontline''
created a Web site after Valdes provided a number of examples of
famous people with African blood links, including Alessandro De
Medici, the first duke of Florence, whose mother was reported to be
an African servant.
</P>
<P>
   He first started trying to unlock the riddle of Charlotte's
ancestry when he moved from what was then the crown colony of
British Honduras to the Boston area in 1967. Initially, he was
stumped to find that her lineage showed not a trace of a black
ancestor: ``Four generations of her genealogy and she was
absolutely lily-white. No illegitimacy. They were all German.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up until he moved to Montreal in the 1970s and resumed
his research. All along, he had struggled fitfully to identify the
wife of Charlotte's ancestress _ the wife of Lieutenant Jean De
Neufchatel of Burgundy. That's when he contacted a genealogist from
the New York Public Library, who returned his call almost
immediately with the name of the lieutenant's wife _ Margarita de
Castro y Sousa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bingo!'' said Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   The de Sousas are widely accepted among genealogists as a black
branch of the Portuguese royal family, he said. ``The next question
was why, if her black ancestry was so far down the line, could
(black features) show up so vividly in Charlotte?''
</P>
<P>
   The key, he discovered, was that Charlotte was descended from
the black line in a number of ways: When Alfonso III of Portugal
conquered Faro, a small Portuguese town controlled by the Moors in
the 13th century, he took the African daughter of Faro's governor _
Ouruana, who is later baptised Madalena Gil _ as his ``droit de
seigneur,'' or rite of conquest. One of their sons, Martin Alfonso,
married into the de Sousa family, who also had black ancestry,
Valdes said. Back then, it was proper to take the name of the most
powerful family.
</P>
<P>
   Although Charlotte was chronologically distant from her Moorish
ancestors, Valdes said royal inbreeding was common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was the black blood repeated in six different ways,
but in my calculation, she was between an octoroon (one-eighth
black) or someone of one-sixteeth black,'' Valdes said.

BUSH HOPES TO SHAKE FRONT-RUNNER CURSE IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he begins his first presidential campaign foray, Texas
Governor George W. Bush is mindful that front-runners in New
Hampshire have a history of becoming also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have to be prepared for the unexpected,'' Bush said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, one political candidate or another starts off
strong. And every four years, someone who was supposed to easily
win the nation's first primary trips along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire's a very independent, sometimes cranky state,''
said Steve Duprey, chairman of the state's Republican Party. ``It
has a history of occasionally causing frontrunners problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush supporters in New Hampshire are nervous that their
popular candidate may be too far ahead for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in the 1 to 5 percent category are lobbing grenades at
the guy out front,'' said Will Abbott, who ran the state for Bush's
father in 1988. ``It's not easy, and it's going to get less easy as
time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhona Charbonneau, a Hillsborough County commissioner, who
helped squire Bush around the Lilac Luncheon, sponsored by the New
Hampshire Federation of Republican Women, says:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to work very hard and stick to the grass
roots. Here in New Hampshire, you see these people two and three
and four times. People just want to listen to them and look them
right straight in the eye and make sure he's not gazing off at
someone else to see who he's going to talk to next.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, a Concord, N.H., lawyer, has seen presidential
candidates come and go. He remembers when Edmund S. Muskie appeared
to cry in 1972 outside the Manchester Union-Leader, contributing to
his disappointing finish in the primary and providing an opening
for George S. McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Rath also remembers Walter F. Mondale locking up all the labor
and political endorsements, only to be upset by Gary Hart in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is not afraid to say to candidates, `I'm not
sure you're the front-runner till I say you're the front-runner,'
'' said Rath, a senior adviser to former Tennessee governor Lamar
Alexander, who is decidedly not a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is nervous about entering New Hampshire, he has good
reason. His father never had an easy time of it in the Granite
State. In 1980, George Bush came out of the Iowa caucuses with
momentum but was stopped cold by Ronald Reagan in the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Bush was on the verge of losing the state to Bob Dole
when then-Governor John H. Sununu helped rescue Bush's bid in the
final days. And in 1992, President Bush won New Hampshire but was
wounded by Patrick J. Buchanan's surprisingly strong showing. ``I
would rather think about the '88 campaign than the '80 campaign,''
Governor Bush said, when asked about his father's experiences and
his words of wisdom. ``My dad has given me good advice, which is be
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that every election is unique, and there is only
so much he can apply to his own race from his father's experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, is to get out, shake hands, and put
together a great grass-roots organization. In fact, the Bush
campaign haas promised a substantial announcement regarding its New
Hampshire effort. That announcement is likely to detail an array of
supporters in each of the state's counties, cities, and towns.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bob Dole knows from his 1996 New Hampshire loss to
Buchanan, anything can happen to spoil the aura of inevitability.
While stumping in New Hampshire, for example, Dole said he was
surprised that jobs and the economy were such big issues in the
campaign. The remark was a turning point that crystallized fears
about Dole and helped to pave the way for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But David M. Carney, a Republican political consultant who once
worked for President Bush, said there is no good analogy to the
supercharged atmosphere surrounding the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of phenomenon has never happened before,'' said
Carney, who is remaining independent in the 2000 campaign. ``There
have never been these kinds of numbers, never this far out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carney said this week's visit is fraught with danger for
Governor Bush. He said the governor essentially is visiting New
Hampshire without a dress rehearsal, without a defined message, and
with a national media hungry to scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could come in and do a flawless trip and the election could
be over,'' Carney said. ``He could come in and there could be a
perceived stumble and it could be wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he leaves the state Tuesday, Bush said, he hopes he
will have made a good impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like for the people of New Hampshire to say, `This is a
man who speaks plainly, that he's got a philosophy, that he knows
how to lead, that he's a hard worker and takes nothing for
granted.' ''

SHORT REVIEWS OF RECENT MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! ``After Life'' It looks like a rundown school building,
staffed by civil-service interviewers, but it's actually a way
station for the just-deceased in Japanese director's Hirokazu
Kore-eda's original and compassionate fantasy where the pilgrims
are asked to choose one vivid memory to take with them into the
afterlife. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (FL) !!! ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' More of the
same: Mike Myers's toothy '60s airhead recycles his Carnaby Street
James Bond-wannabe routine, reveling in a screenful of campy
artifacts, most psychedelic. He also doubles as Powers's nemesis,
Dr. Evil, a pussycat who can't manage his dysfunctional family,
much less dominate the world. Heather Graham's nubile CIA operative
named Felicity Shagwell is a big plus in this good bad movie.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (FR) !! ``Besieged'' Bernardo Bertolucci tries for a
cross-cultural love story in a Roman villa. But there's no depth of
character or point of believable connection between Thandie
Newton's African medical student and political refugee and David
Thewlis's eccentric concert pianist. He falls for her after she
comes to work for him as a domestic, setting off master-servant
vibes that never realize their sexual or political potential. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !!! ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' Beguiling romantic fantasy, set
in contemporary London, that beats the odds by gambling on gentle
magic to sort out a couple of relationship crises. This impressive
debut film from Spain's Maria Ripoll is given a big boost by
Penelope Cruz's softly luminous romantic, who helps Douglas
Henshall's loose-cannon actor get the rain out of his shoes _ with
an assist from Elizabeth McGovern's bartender, who may be dishing
out magic along with pints of bitter. (R)

ELLISON TAKES UP THE AMERICAN STORY OF RACE AND IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its singular ardor voice and uncompromising vision, Ralph
Ellison's ``Invisible Man'' merged the underworld of midcentury
black America with the infinitely subterranean quest for
self-identity. Striving only to become a good man, the nameless
narrator of the novel finds chicanery and cruelty almost
everywhere; but much of his journey is underscored by his
grandfather's dying words to his son: ``Live with your head in the
lion's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark and endless odyssey of the novel was a vast literary
undertaking defined by brilliant riffs of language and metaphors of
light and shadow, and it was recognized upon its publication in
1952 for the modernist classic it was to become. By the time of his
death, at 80, in 1994, it would be Ellison's only published novel _
a poignant fact that allowed for mythic possibility, in the form of
another manuscript, unpublished, some 40 years and 2,000 pages in
the making.
</P>
<P>
   Although a relatively small portion of that fugitive second
novel was destroyed in a fire in 1967, most of the manuscript was
intact and incomplete when Ellison died; the last excerpt had been
published in 1977, but he told David Remnick of The New Yorker in
the months before his death that he still expected to finish the
book. Of such absences great expectations are made, and so it has
been with ``Juneteenth'' _ an extraction by Ellison's literary
executor of one-third of the story, meant to stand alone as ``the
true center of Ellison's great, unfinished house of fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Even aside from the manuscript's legendary status, the apparent
motives behind John F. Callahan's revisions and selections (which
had the full blessing of Ellison's widow) are understandable.
Scholars have access to the full work-in-progress, including
Ellison's notes and letters, now housed at the Library of Congress;
this curatorial placement was the only request the author made
about the novel before he died. But the reading public, too,
deserves a glimpse of what so consumed and eluded Ellison for four
decades. In letters and interviews over the years, he revealed his
wish to articulate the profoundly American story of race and
identity that he had begun in ``Invisible Man''; as an unstructured
whole, the projected second novel would move between Washington,
D.C., and Oklahoma, back and forth in time from the beginning of
the 20th century to the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to distill a narrative ``that best stands alone as
a single, self-contained volume,'' Callahan has chosen the
intertwined story of two men, set in the 1950s: Bliss Sunraider, a
racist senator of indeterminate birth who is probably mostly white,
and Daddy Hickman, the huge-hearted black jazzman turned preacher
who raised him.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the June 19, 1865, day of celebration, some two years
after the Emancipation Proclamation, when word reached slaves in
Galveston, Texas, that they were free, ``Juneteenth'' is structured
as two antiphonal narratives between Bliss and Hickman; they are in
the hospital, where Bliss lies dying from an attempt on his life on
the Senate floor. Because the novel opens with this assassin's
bullet, when Hickman has traveled to Washington to see Bliss and
perhaps warn him of the attack, we will learn their stories through
a retrospective exchange, much of it unspoken. As with Faulkner's
alternating narrators in ``As I Lay Dying,'' the same events are
relayed and retold from different perspectives; as with Faulkner's
mythic mysteries in ``Absalom, Absalom!,'' events of central
significance elude us until the end of the story.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mark of Faulkner is all over the narrative of
``Juneteenth,'' but these comparisons are technical rather than
qualitative. While the novel contains rhapsodic passages,
particularly those illuminating the interplay between Baptist
revivalism and political rhetoric, the story itself manages to feel
both bloated and gauzy. Stripped of any larger meaning at the time
of their introduction, Bliss's oratories (born, it turns out, from
learning at Hickman's knee how to swoon a crowd) take on the
eye-glazing quality of a literary filibuster. And while the
sorrowful ironies surrounding Hickman's rearing of Bliss may speak
beautifully to the tragedies of race in America, these revelations
occur so haltingly _ most of them at the end of the novel _ that
the preceding story lacks any real compelling thrust or urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The very sketchiness of the characters' history, especially
Bliss's, suggests their having been gleaned from a much larger
work, and suggests, too, some of the troubles Ellison must have
faced in completing his work. There is ample evidence here of a
brilliant mess, decorated with dazzling language and high-wire
wisdom, but a mess nonetheless. One can imagine the excerpts over
the years seeming breathtaking in their promise: Daddy Hickman
eventually emerges as a strong creation, equal parts ``horn-blowing
gambler'' and holy giant, and drawn from the same enigmas that
touched Rinehart in ``Invisible Man.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bliss is shot at the beginning of the novel, Hickman,
seated in the Senate's visitors' gallery, rises and begins to sing
_ ``his white head towering over his clustered flock, tears
gleaming bright against the darkness of his face, creating with his
voice an atmosphere of bafflement and mystery no less outrageous
than the shooting which had released it.'' This is the man who
sheltered the light-skinned Bliss as an infant and raised him
within the abiding love of a black religious community; his
lamentation, then, is in part a heartbroken song of homecoming to a
prodigal son.
</P>
<P>
   If the failings in ``Juneteenth'' are large, they are not flaws
of mediocrity, and Ellison's admirers will find discrete treasures
to sustain their regard: passages on the forced migrations of
slavery, on modernity's fracturing of linear time, on Bliss's
horrid circus experience or Hickman's standing before the Lincoln
Memorial. More than anything Ellison was a passionate writer, and
passion is unquestionably present in ``Juneteenth,'' even in the
weakest and most indulgent parts of the novel. With his somber
comprehension of the near-fatal wounds of race, Ellison also
understood inexorable longing _ a quality that hovers over Bliss's
story, from his yearning for a mother he never knew to his
misguided path away from Daddy Hickman. This emotional eloquence,
carefully muted in ``Invisible Man,'' was one of that novel's
greatest gifts; its presence here, however scattershot, is a
reminder of just what kind of writer Ellison could be.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike too many efforts by literary executors to publish
posthumously everything but recipes, something of Ellison's unknown
opus warranted print. Whether it was ``Juneteenth,'' Callahan's
apparently well-intended vision, will be for scholars who view the
entire manuscript to ascertain. But one gets the feeling from
reading ``Juneteenth'' that Ellison could never assume the
requisite mastery over this work to make it what it needed to be.
He long paid homage to the influences of Faulkner and Twain and
Stephen Crane and Henry James, and he must have envisioned an epic
that would take him across his own version of America's territories
_ across decades of history and miles of struggle, to that part of
land and memory with ``everything wide open and hopeful.'' But like
some great unfinished surveyor's map, filled with colors but no
final coordinates, it sprawled out before him into a vast,
uncharted unknown.

FRONT-RUNNING, BUT ON WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not quite Caesar crossing the Rubicon, but from the billing
in Republican circles, this week's big event seems almost as
momentous. George W. Bush is crossing the Merrimack.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor comes to New Hampshire for two days of
campaigning with GOP hopes and expectations, as Groucho Marx once
quipped of his taxes, as high as an elephant's eye.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this hasn't been a campaign so much as a coronation.
Bush, on the strength of four and a half years as governor of
Texas, has benefitted from a coalescence of party support that
eluded his more accomplished father even after a lifetime of public
service, including eight years as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever putting Texas in the rear-view mirror, George the
younger has powered by two-time cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole
and 1996 New Hampshire victor Pat Buchanan. So large does he loom
that Lamar Alexander, undercapitalized and overshadowed, has scaled
back his campaign from a full-fledged national effort to a
hope-for-a-stumble stand in Iowa and New Hampsire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Hampshire as well as the across the country, Bush is
the frontrunner,'' said David Moore, New Hampshire-based managing
director of the Gallup Poll. ``But we just completed a big survey
that found that seven of 10 Americans said they need to know more
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. As many have noted, it's odd indeed that the
Republican Party has annointed as its savior the son of man who
only a few short years ago was reviled by many conservatives as a
tax-raising apostate to the party's fiscal faith. It's odder still
since George W. has collected scores of endorsements and millions
of dollars while hardly offering a clue about why he should be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be what he stands for,'' notes Tufts University
political scientists Jim Glaser. ``Who the heck knows what he
stands for?''
</P>
<P>
   So what's powering Bush's candidacy? Big-state status, a
well-known name, and a sense (affirmed by polls) that he could beat
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But frontrunning electablility is marshy soil on which to build
a primary campaign. So far, it's often made Bush's candidacy seem
conceived in committee and consumed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where New Hampshire comes in. It's a state whose
Republicans admire forthright, plain-spoken aspirants, a state
whose penchant for surprise led to it back Henry Cabot Lodge's
absentee write-in effort against party titans like Nelson
Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater in 1964, to flock to the
take-charge qualities of a Ronald Reagan in 1980 and to reward the
mince-no-words conservatism of a Patrick Buchanan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is going to have to take some stands and answer some
tough questions and New Hampshire will really be the first forum
where he he has to do that,'' said John Camobreco, professor of
political science at the University of New Hampshire. ``And this
state has never been particularly kind to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it hasn't. Even as vice president, the elder Bush barely
staved off a challenge from Bob Dole there in 1988, and then only
with the all-out help of then Gov. John Sununu. In 1992, New
Hampshire Republicans gave GOP insurgent Pat Buchanan 37 percent of
the vote _ enough to fuel his campaign against President Bush well
into the South.
</P>
<P>
   And George W. is no time-tested party leader who can lay claim
to the Republican rites of political primogeniture. Indeed, he
might not even make the top 10 list of the nation's most effective,
innovative, or hard-charging Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he's been no Tommy Thompson pushing a radical overhaul
of welfare in Wisconsin, no Gary Johnson, waging a hammer and tong
war for school vouchers in New Mexico, no Christine Todd Whitman,
winning big tax cuts in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, as governor, Bush has been the GOP equivalent of a
second-term Mike Dukakis, a smart, cautious practitioner of the
possible rather than a determined reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to set modest, achievable goals, around which there
exists a preordained consensus so he doesn't have to do much
persuading,'' said Bruce Buchanan, professor of government at the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Which is apparently the way he intends to run for president. As
he comes to New Hampshire, Bush says he will focus on four issues:
tax cuts, free trade, beefing up the military, and improving
education.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some of Bush's stands, such as his 1995 support
for an NRA-backed ``right to carry'' law overturning a long-time
ban on concealed weapons, will certainly provide general-election
fodder. In an era when HMO has become a dirty word, his 1995 veto
of a patients rights bill might even hurt inside a Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   And though it would have been a net tax cut, his 1997 tax plan _
in which he proposed raising the sales tax and taxing professional
services to finance a property tax reduction _ could lend itself to
the sort of distorted attacks President Bush launched against Bill
Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, George W. seems to have some of the true Texas grit
that eluded his father. State Representative Tommy Merritt, a
Democrat, loves the Republican governor because he has put himself
on the front lines in the citizens' war against drugs, twice coming
to Kilgore in northeast Texas to join a group of activists
targeting drug dealers in their neighborhoods. The activists gather
outside crackhouse and drug dens to shout slogans and keep watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only does the talk, he walks the walk,'' enthuses
Merritt. ``He actually puts his feet in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But on other high-profile issues, Bush has struck a low profile
in courage. Take this year's attempt to pass a hate-crimes bill.
That legislation, named after James Byrd Jr., the African-American
whose June 1998 murder by being dragged behind a truck horrified
the nation, would have stipulated stepped-up penalties for crimes
motivated by animus against one's race, ethnicity, gender,
religion, or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Signing such a law, with the sexual orientation clause, would
have angered religious conservatives, an important GOP primary
voting bloc. But vetoing it would haved angered moderates (one
Texas poll showed 70 percent of Texans favored the bill.)
</P>
<P>
   So Bush temporized, trying to duck while his Senate allies
worked to keep the bill bottled up in committee. That stance led to
an uncomfortable meeting with Darrell Verrett, Byrd's nephew, and
Renee Mullins, Byrd's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional Mullins appealed to Bush for help with the bill.
``I would hate to see my father die in vain,'' she said, her cousin
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Distant and seemingly ill at ease, Bush was noncommittal, saying
there were some parts of the bill he objected to.
</P>
<P>
   Which ones? Bush said he would have to read the bill before
specifying. Verrett produced a copy, handed it to the governor, and
asked again what bothered him. Surprised, Bush set the bill aside,
making it clear he wouldn't read it then and there, and politely
ended the meeting, Verrett says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole meeting was just a political strategy
move,'' he said. ``He had to say he had met with Byrd's family and
was somewhat sympathetic . . . but it was an empty meeting that
didn't resolve anything. He was very vague, defensive and
unemotional.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the bad side of cautious incrementalism, others say
Bush also has those qualities so missing among the the GOP's
Washington wing in recent years: An willingness to work with the
opposition. Norman Newton, executive director of the Associated
Republicans of Texas, remembers that immediately after his election
in 1994, the new goveror walked the Capitol halls in Austin,
meeting with legislators of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went into virtually every legislative office, Democrat or
Republican, just to find out what their concerns were,'' Newton
said. ``He is very good at sitting down with the Democrats and
working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet beneath that storied geniality, there is a steely side to
Bush. Thomas Pauken, a former Texas Republican Party chairman who
served as executive director of ACTION, the federal volunteer
agency under Ronald Reagan, was a Bush family friend until he
decided to support Bob Dole for president in 1988. He recalls an
encounter with George W. Bush in the early summer of 1988, at a
Texas Republican barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Bush had vanguished Dole, the nomination was
wrapped up, and the Bush forces could afford to be magnanimous. But
George W. Bush wasn't. Making a beeline toward Pauken, he delivered
a stinging message.
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing what he recalls Bush saying, Pauken says: ``It was
like, `Pauken, you have burned the bridges . . . you have broken
with the family, and you are going to play a price.''' That said,
Bush turned and stalked off, Pauken said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary pique? The old George W.? Well, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pauken says that Bush and his top operatives opposed him
when he ran, successfully, to be Texas Republican Party chairman in
1994, and worked behind the scenes to help his opponents last
spring when he ran, unsuccessfully, for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets very personal,'' said Pauken. ``He has a very thin
skin and a very short fuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush claims to have doused that fiery temper, though others
wonder if he's simply grown better at banking the ire. Either way,
a presidential campaign will test will try his temperament the way
Texas's good-old-boy politics haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and what does it suggest?
</P>
<P>
   Just this: In market terms, what New Hampshire will see this
week is George W. Bush's initial public offering. Unless the
product proves compelling, don't be surprised if his political
stock falls.

HOW DEEP CAN DIVERS GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What are the depth limits for an aqualung, and the old time
canvas and brass-helmet diving suits?
</P>
<P>
   A.A., Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, the records. Then a firm word of warning from Dr.
Peter Vann of the Divers Alert Network, an internationally
recognized dive safety organization.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an aqualung, or SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus) and breathing regular air, a diver made it to
525 feet. And then he blacked out. When he floated back up to 440
he realized how lucky he was to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Using SCUBA and breathing a special mix of oxygen, nitrogen and
helium, called trimix, a diver made it 925 feet. Vann says another
diver who tried that, died.
</P>
<P>
   Vann warns that the recommended maximum depth for recreational
divers is 130 feet, whether you're using SCUBA or a helmet and
suit. Beyond that, no matter how you're getting your air, you start
facing trouble, depending on how deep you go AND how long you stay
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the way down, the first problem is nitrogen narcosis. As you
descend, the water pressure pushing in on the air-filled spaces in
your body _ the lungs, sinuses, and ear cavities _ increases. At
100 feet, all that extra water over you pushing down is equivalent
to four times the air pressure at the surface. The rest of your
body is mostly water and doesn't mind the increasing pressure. But
the air-filled spaces do. To compensate, SCUBA gear includes
regulating devices that push enough air from the tanks into your
lungs to match whatever the outside pressure is. The deeper you go,
the greater the pressure of air from your tanks being supplied to
your lungs, provided through the regulator (that big chunky thing
in a SCUBA divers mouth that makes you sound like Darth Vader).
</P>
<P>
   What that means is the deeper you go, the more molecules of
oxygen and nitrogen you're getting per breath. The oxygen is used
up by your body. But nitrogen is inert. It's not consumed by human
metabolism. The extra nitrogen builds up in your blood. But at
higher-than-normal levels nitrogen acts like a narcotic, though
researchers don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the martini rule,'' Vann says.
</P>
<P>
   Every fifty feet down you go is like drinking one martini. The
deeper you go, the ``drunker'' you get. Feeling drunk underwater
can make you do stupid, even fatal things. Dive safety books say
nitrogen narcosis starts to get serious around 90-100 feet,
although Vann says there is wide variation among individuals, the
same as varying individual reactions to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Go a little deeper and oxygen can start to be a problem. Too
much oxygen can cause convulsions and seizures, and death, by
interfering with brain chemistry. Regular air, with it's 21 percent
oxygen content, can be toxic at 218 feet as greater pressures push
more oxygen molecules into your lungs with each breath.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the effects of nitrogen and oxygen, technical divers,
like those who work on drilling rigs, or military divers, use
special gas mixes like trimix, which replaces nitrogen with helium,
or nitrox, which boosts the oxygen and reduces the nitrogen. With
these mixes commercial divers can operate at 1,000 feet. But they
still face the problem all divers face in coming back up.
Decompression sickness, known as the bends
</P>
<P>
   You consume greater and greater amounts of nitrogen the deeper
you go and the longer you stay down. As the nitrogen builds up in
the blood it behaves just like carbon dioxide in a soda bottle.
Under pressure the nitrogen stays dissolved. But swim back up and
it's like popping the cap on the soda bottle. The pressure release
lets the nitrogen turn to bubbles, which can cause not only pain,
but death.
</P>
<P>
   The bends got it's name from the old time hat and suit divers
who built underwater caissons for bridges. They breathed in too
much nitrogen, came up too fast, and walked around bent over from
the excruciating pain of those bubbles, concentrated mostly in
their joints.
</P>
<P>
   Dive charts tell recreational divers breathing regular air how
long they can safely stay down, at various depths, before they have
to do one or more decompression stops on the way back up. Since the
blood is constantly carrying excess nitrogen to the lungs, we're
breathing some of it out with each breath. Decompression stops
allow divers to hover in the water and just by breathing, rid
themselves of the excess nitrogen so it cannot turn into bubbles
when they surface back into regular atmospheric pressure.

PROVINCETOWN FINALLY GETS ITS PREMIERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an event most would believe has a natural home in
Provincetown, Mass, the international film festival took its time
coming to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, various people and organizations tried
unsuccessfully to mount a film festival in Provincetown. Though
each attempt was thwarted, usually by lack of planning or financial
backing, it never ceased to seem a logical fit _ cutting-edge films
presented in a town renowned as a community for the more creatively
inclined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any event takes the right synergy, and particularly an event
of this magnitude,'' said P.J. Layng, a Provincetown businesswoman.
``It took a long time, but finally the stars lined up, the right
people got involved, and we had ourselves a film festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Provincetown International Film Festival begins
Friday, about two years after Layng, the festival's executive
producer and an avid film fan, got it in her head that she could
succeed where so many others had failed. With Connie White and
Marianne Lampke, the festival's co-producers, Layng garnered the
community's support and energy for the event, which concludes next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the offerings are Gregg Araki's latest trippy outing,
``Splendor''; Rose Troche's ``Bedrooms and Hallways''; ``Run Lola
Run,'' a German thriller that snagged a share of the audience prize
for best foreign film at this year's Sundance Film Festival;
Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Besieged''; ``The Red Violin,'' starring
Samuel L. Jackson; Francisco Manso's ``Testamento''; and ``The
Source,'' an exploration of Beat generation writers William S.
Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Jack Kerouac.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two restored classics: ``A Hard Day's Night,''
celebrating its 35th anniversary as the first Beatles romp, and
Billy Wilder's ``Some Like It Hot,'' starring Jack Lemmon, Tony
Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   All films will be shown at the New Art Cinema on Commercial
Street.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the festival honors John Waters with its first
Filmmaker on the Edge award. ``An Evening with John Waters'' is a
celebration of the deliciously tasteless filmmaker who unleashed on
the world the late 300-pound transvestite Divine, star of such
Waters films as ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Polyester,'' and
``Hairspray.'' There is also a ``director's cut'' showing of
Waters's 1975 film, ``Female Trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, the latest edition of ``Towniewood Squares,''
styled on television's ``Hollywood Squares,'' will be played at the
Mews restaurant with comedy writer and ``Hollywood Squares''
regular Bruce Vilanch in the center square. Vilanch is also the
subject of the film ``Get Bruce,'' which details his life as one of
Hollywood's best comic writers.
</P>
<P>
   When Layng moved from Boston to Provincetown four years ago, she
wasn't thinking about film festivals. A former health-care
administrator, she wanted to try her hand at the antiques and
retail business and opened two stores _ Roots for the Home and
Garden, and Roots Furniture and Rug Gallery. While the main
in-season months of July and August were good, she found business
slow in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``June is a difficult month to have a business here because
you're competing with graduations and weddings,'' she said.
``You've already hired everyone for the season, and they just sit
there. You've got a big payroll, big rents, big bills, and no
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A draw for June
</P>
<P>
   What Provincetown needed, Layng decided, was a June event to
draw people into town.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more through the years it became clear to me that we
were an arts community, but with no film. And I love film,'' she
said. ``Watching movies is what I do for my fun and relaxation, and
I just felt like it was missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Layng was introduced to White and Lampke, who lease and operate
Cambridge's Brattle Theatre and also founded Boston's International
Festival of Women's Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been conversations between people about this sort of
idea for years, and because Marianne has a home down there, every
now and then she would get pulled into the conversations,'' White
said. ``We never believed things would come to fruition, but this
time it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the town's sizable lesbian and gay population, most
assume any film festival in Provincetown would be a lesbian and gay
film festival. True, there are a number of gay-themed films in the
festival, such as ``Better Than Chocolate,'' ``Leather Jacket Love
Story,'' and ``Golden Threads.'' But the organizers were quick to
point out that this is not a festival for just one part of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do something for everyone,'' White said. ``If you
try to do something for everyone, then you fail. But we did try to
take an overview of Provincetown. This has been an arts community
for 100 years, it has a gay and lesbian population, and that's all
kind of intrinsic, being out on the edge and taking artistic
chances. So we used that as a starting point, and we're really
pleased with how things went.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to forgo a gay and lesbian film festival was ``not an
easy decision,'' but it was the correct one, Layng said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was certainly divided, and it basically came
down to what we _ me, Connie, and Marianne _ wanted. I was the most
vocal on insisting that this not be exclusively gay and lesbian,''
she said. ``My personal opinion is it just doesn't matter. What
matters first is that this is a film festival that celebrates
filmmaking on the edge, and celebrates the community as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film festival should reflect the magnificence of
Provincetown, which is its diversity, acceptance of lifestyles, the
arts, the overall beauty of the environment, the Portuguese
community,'' Layng said. ``This is what makes Provincetown
Provincetown. That's why it's so special, and we wanted the film
festival to reflect that.''

OUTRAGE GROWS AMID HIGH-PROFILE CRIMES IN MEXICO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In two weeks of sensational crimes in Mexico, a
jovial television host was gunned down at high noon, masked pirates
seized a tourist boat in the seas of Cancun and robbers held up a
subway car in a posh Mexico City neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the incident involving presidential candidate
Vicente Fox, whose chauffeur was robbed and wounded. That prompted
his campaign to ask the federal government for a security detail of
at least 18 guards.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they said, the ruling party presidential contender,
Leopoldo Labastida Ochoa, has more, compliments of President
Ernesto Zedillo's secret service.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Labastida said he couldn't be too careful. Look
what happened in 1996 to presidential front-runner Luis Donaldo
Colosio, assassinated on a campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   But while the grisly crimes were being committed, restaurants in
this capital burst with patrons and culinary treats, nightclubs
with song and dance and museums with fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't what they seem in Mexico City, capital of
contrasts, where some 22 million people work, eat and love. Lately,
they argue about the lack of security in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared to go to the bank, scared to take a taxi, scared
to go home at night,'' said a young executive, who was too scared
to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of violence came to a head June 7, when television
host Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley was killed in a hail of machine-gun
fire at midday outside a popular eatery. Stanley was traveling with
four bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of outraged people clamored for justice and blamed the
tide of violence on Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the irony of the moment, an editorial cartoon in the
newspaper Reforma showed a television anchor carrying a sign: ``No
more violence. Lynch Cardenas.'' The nation's two main television
networks, Televisa and TV Azteca, also demanded action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hostages of delinquency,'' Televisa anchor Jacobo
Zabludovsky told the audience in round-the-clock coverage of the
Stanley murder. ``In every place of the city, even in the airport,
people are kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The anchor was referring to a newspaper report that a
businessman had been recently kidnapped for ransom at the crowded
Mexico City airport. The police denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy died down when it became evident that Stanley, who
was part of TV Azteca's ``Live Without Drugs'' campaign, had a
penchant for cocaine and had a false government credential that
allowed him to carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   While sensitive about their image abroad, people here are the
first to tell outsiders the perils of their streets: Don't hail a
cab, remember your credit card personal identification numbers,
watch out for carjackers and even kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, say some experts, is that crime is down, and it's
not even as bad as it seems, not as bad as other large urban areas,
including New York City, Paris or Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Experts trace the rise in criminality to the 1994 peso
devaluation that greatly diminished the buying power of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is delinquency in the capital from 1994 to 1996 grew
immeasurably. It doubled,'' said Rafael Luis Harrell, a
criminologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have not had a chance to become accustomed to those
statistics,'' he said. ``While crime is a common factor in every
major urban city, we are not used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime, said Ruiz, was once limited mostly to working-class
neighborhoods. Today, it also affects those with the loudest
voices: the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is affecting the middle-class, the wealthy,'' Ruiz said.
``There is a great hysteria, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said the same phenomenon existed in other Latin-American
countries at the end of authoritarian dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   Ruled for most of the century by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, Mexican society is experiencing flashes of democracy in
elections and in its news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say crime is a product of democracy as a society
opens up,'' Ruiz said.

REPORT SAYS EX-SOVIET WEAPONS SITE POSES SERIOUS MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buried bacteria at a former Soviet biological warfare site are
potentially so dangerous that the United States should consider
playing a closer role in the cleanup, researchers say in a new
report.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight years of the Cold War, in a top-secret operation
on an island in the Aral Sea, Soviet soldiers hurriedly buried one
of history's scariest weapons: killer anthrax bacteria, according
to researchers at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
The soldiers assumed that the buried bacteria _ having been soaked
in bleach, then entombed underground _ would eventually die off.
</P>
<P>
   The menacing bacteria didn't. Now the institute, based in
Monterey, Calif., is helping figure out how to prevent a potential
environmental cataclysm _ the leakage of anthrax via ground water
into the ecosystem of Kazakhstan and neighboring Uzbekistan, and
perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Stored inside 66-gallon containers, the bacteria were originally
buried under several feet of sand on the island. But erosion has
reportedly worn away the sand and exposed at least some of the
containers.
</P>
<P>
   And the risk is literally growing with time. Because of poor
irrigation practices in the former Soviet Union, the Aral Sea is
quickly disappearing. As the sea level drops, Vozrozhdeniye Island
expands. In little more than a decade the island might reconnect
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthrax spores can survive in soil for decades, creating an
enduring source of contamination,'' according to an advance copy of
the institute's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contamination of Vozrozhdeniye Island presents a growing
threat to the nearby population and the environment because of the
desiccation of the Aral Sea, which has increased human and animal
access to the formerly isolated island.''
</P>
<P>
   The sea is an inland body of salt water located east of the
Caspian Sea in the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   There's a danger of animals and insects crossing a land bridge
and contaminating the Uzbekistan mainland, said Jonathan C. Tucker,
director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation
Project at the Monterey Institute.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``let's not panic,'' said Eric Croddy, a
senior research associate at the Monterey center. ``The whole place
is cordoned off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hopes for a cleanup have been stymied by the regional
administrative chaos following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a cleanup ``shouldn't be that big a production,
really,'' Croddy said. But the physical state of the bacteria
remains uncertain because the authorities in the region have
refused permission for Monterey Institute officials to get a close
look. That makes it impossible for them to tell whether the
bacteria exist in a powdery form that could easily be blown around
by the wind or in a sludge or cake-like form that is likely to stay
put, Croddy said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is a private graduate school for people planning
careers in international fields ranging from business to diplomacy.
The Center for Nonproliferation Studies is a branch of it that
trains people, up to the master's degree level, who plan to enter
the field of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989, the institute is funded mainly by organizations
such as the Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur, W. Alton Jones and
Plowshares foundations. It also gets grants from the U.S.
Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The institute report _ by chemist Gulbarshyn Bozheyeva,
biologist Yerlan Kunakbayev and physicist Dastan Yeleukenov, all of
whom work at the institute's Kazakhstan branch office _ provides
insights not only into the causes of the Vozrozhdeniye Island
crisis but into the history of the Soviet Union's biological
warfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet troops buried the anthrax on the island in a desperate
attempt to prevent it from being discovered by international arms
control inspectors, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ``admitted that
the Soviet Union and then Russia had conducted a top-secret
offensive biological warfare (BW) program in violation of the 1972
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (treaty) banning the
development, production, stockpiling, and transfer of these
weapons.''

</P>
<P>
   The Monterey report says that as early as the 1950s,
Vozrozhdeniye Island was a leading Soviet center for biological
warfare research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The island was apparently chosen for open-air testing of
biological weapons because of its geographical isolation,'' the
report says. The Aral Sea is ``surrounded by large, sparsely
populated deserts and semi-deserts. ... The island's sparse
vegetation, hot, dry climate, and sandy soil that reaches (140
degrees Fahrenheit) in summer all reduced the chances that
pathogenic microorganisms would survive and spread.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the Vozrozhdeniye Island facility was a sort of
Soviet version of Los Alamos, the top-secret community in the New
Mexico desert where the United States developed the atomic bomb.
Vozrozhdeniye Island had hundreds of employees, even families,
living in a community.
</P>
<P>
   The institute said that biological warfare agents tested on
Vozrozhdeniye Island included anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis,
plague, typhus, Q fever, smallpox, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan
equine encephalitis.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meteorologists are not quite ready to predict the weather in
your own backyard, but they're getting closer.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ever more powerful computers that can quickly digest
billions of pieces of weather data and turn them into easily
understood graphic images, commercial forecasters are increasingly
able to predict weather conditions in a particular city
neighborhood _ and one day hope to forecast it in an area as small
as a picnic table.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there appears to be an insatiable consumer
appetite for weather information. Since its 1982 launch, the cable
TV Weather Channel now reaches an audience of up to 1 million
viewers a day.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Web sites, meanwhile, are getting hundreds of millions
of ``hits'' each month, including services with forecasts by zip
codes or predictions tailored to golfers, sailors and private
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, hundreds of thousands of Americans have
purchased weather radios from electronics stores that sound an
alarm when the National Weather Service issues severe storm
warnings for county-sized areas programmed into the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Shack, which began selling the radios last year for $79,
was swamped at first but this year has finally been able to keep
enough in inventory, said Rick Borinstein, senior vice president
for merchandising with the chain.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida has purchased more than 15,000 radios and
handed them out to schools, day-care centers, nursing homes, and
local emergency-management officials. Former service director Joe
Friday has called the system a key part of its goal to have ``a
weather radio in every home, just like a smoke detector, and in all
schools, hospitals, and other public gathering places.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the radios has been much higher in the Deep South and
Tornado Alley states like Oklahoma and Kansas than in
Massachusetts, which had 74 severe weather warnings in 1997 and 73
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Massachusetts has only 10 summer days with
sufficiently violent thunderstorms that merit a severe weather
warning, and a handful of days with flash flood risks.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn A. Field, who coordinates weather warnings at the
Taunton weather service office, said lives could probably be saved
if more Bay State residents owned the radios. Worcester County, for
example, has seen 36 tornadoes since 1950, and statistically is
well overdue for another one.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts over 100 m.p.h. have been recorded in both Worcester
and the Brockton-Whitman area in the last three years. Although
this kind of weather is much less likely to occur in Massachusetts
than in Alabama or Oklahoma, ``I wouldn't want to downplay the
importance of having (a weather radio),'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   On the commercial side, weather forecasting is becoming a
booming business. Billerica-based Weather Services International
Corp., for example, is rolling out new products for local cable
television franchises that could produce specific forecasts for,
say, Brookline, Cambridge, and Newton, or show the day's predicted
highs in one-degree increments. A Tampa cable system is to begin
broadcasting super-local forecasts this month.
</P>
<P>
   And IBM's ``Deep Thunder'' forecasting system, which grew out of
forecasting innovations for the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games, has
been improved to the point where _ at least in theory _ it could
generate meaningful forecasts for areas as small as 17 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clemson University researchers in South Carolina are
perfecting a model to predict maximum hurricane wind speeds by zip
codes. And an Arizona company has during the last five years
completed a system of sensors _ initially developed around the
Space Shuttle launch pad in Florida _ that shows nearly
instantaneously, within a quarter mile, anyplace in the US where
lightning is striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just starting to realize these capabilities,'' said Jim
Brihan, senior meteorologist and marketing director for Weather
Services International in Billerica. ``You've got to believe that
what we're now doing on a 5-to-10-kilometer scale we're going to be
doing on an even smaller scale in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest limitation to the development of ever more localized
forecasts is the variable quality of weather data coming in. While
models are constantly being tested against actual weather
conditions and refined, companies generally are reluctant to
publicize scorecards that show how well their systems are working
because forecasting is still a less than precise science.
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasts _ for all of New England or a single town _ use
the basic building blocks of global weather models developed by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or a similar
European Community forecasting center in England.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting how much rain will fall in each of several coastal
communities two days from now may depend heavily on accurately
measuring cloud cover and moisture over areas far out in the
Atlantic Ocean where storms develop. Much of that information is
derived from satellite observations that have gotten markedly
better in recent years, but are still frustratingly far from
perfect for meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   A forecast model that aims to predict weather for, say, the area
covered by the Boston phone book will start by ``initializing'' the
model, or loading it with data from areas north, east, south, and
west of the forecast zone that are derived from a government-run
global or continental weather model.
</P>
<P>
   Once the storm is over, say, in Connecticut, where there is
abundant data from radar installations, observation stations, and
airplanes, predicting where it will go in the next several hours
becomes more feasible because there is much more accurate baseline
data than can be derived from out at sea.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Deep Thunder system, for example, ``works well when you
have a lot of meteorological observation stations,'' says Zaphiris
Christidis, an IBM researcher who helped develop it. ``If the
infrastructure is not good to support it, then it's not going to
work as well, and you are going to have `garbage in, garbage out.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Deep Thunder _ the name is a play on ``Deep Blue,'' the IBM
chess-playing computer that analyzes millions of moves each second
_ got its start with the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Weather Service officials took a modeling system
developed at Colorado State University and plugged it into an
ultrapowerful supercomputer with advanced three-dimensional
visualization systems. The system was capable of producing 6- to
24-hour forecasts in areas as small as 1.5 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   In an early test during the August 1995 Olympic Sports Festival,
IBM researchers scored a coup that reflected at least as much good
science as good luck: At 5 p.m. one  &UR; afternoon &LR; , they warned that
violent storms were going to sweep through the Aquatic Center at
the Georgia Institute of Technology at 5:45 p.m. Venue managers
quickly evacuated the stands and the thunderstorms roared through
at 5:46 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the system gave managers 32 minutes warning
before a windy storm blew down a tent at the track and field
trials. And it also gave them confidence that rain would hold off
long enough to go ahead with the closing ceremonies at the new
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   To feed the forecasts, the Weather Service upgraded nearly 100
observation stations to report data four times an hour instead of
once, and added more ocean buoys and weather balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accuracy of environmental forecast models is reaching
levels undreamed of 10 years ago,'' said D. James Baker,
administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which last October signed a $35.6 million,
four-year contract with IBM for a Deep Thunder system at its
Maryland prediction center.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Deep Thunder, here are some other commercial efforts
underway:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Weather Services International product called StormCast can
merge weather information with street-level maps to show the
location of violent weather cells in a given neighborhood or the
difference in current rain intensity in downtown Boston compared to
Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
   As storms sweep over a region, the system can show where within
a pie-shaped area a storm cell might pass in the next 30 minutes,
with an up-to-the-minute prediction for different cities _ a big
help if you are trying to decide, for example, when to leave the
office to go buy a sandwich, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of the art is not perfect yet, but at least it gives
us a rough order of magnitude when it might affect you,'' Brihan
said. Several big electric utilities use a similar system to
determine where to dispatch repair crews during major storms.
</P>
<P>
   In another application called PrecisionCast, the system will
produce maps showing the predicted daily highs to the degree in a
zone extending from, say, Ipswich to Boxford _ a big leap over the
traditional ``highs in the upper 80s, cooler at the coast'' summer
forecast usually heard on local TV and radio forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ This month, Time Warner Cable will be rolling out
24-hour-a-day forecasts specific to local communities on its Tampa,
Fla., cable systems, not just a Central Florida overview. Time
Warner news vice president Kirk Varner calls it ``the next
generation of local weather coverage on television.''
</P>
<P>
   _ AccuWeather, through its corporate Web site, offers a forecast
for every zip code in the country, which will include slight
differences in projected highs and lows in, for example, Yarmouth
versus Wareham versus New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   A rival site developed by Weather Services International called
Intellicast.com offers forecasts tailored for golfers, sailors,
skiers, and even kite flyers, as well as local forecasts for 150 US
cities, drawing 2 million visitors a month. Intellicast is also
being marketed to cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clemson University researchers are developing a model they
hope to unveil next year that will predict maximum hurricane wind
speeds in each of several zip codes during storms.
</P>
<P>
   A lead researcher on the project, associate professor of civil
engineering David Rosowsky, said his team hopes to produce a model
that would incorporate insurance industry data to produce estimates
of the likely dollar damage of a coming storm in a given zip code.
</P>
<P>
   Field said given the vagaries of the weather, he would be
extremely uncomfortable for the foreseeable future using a model
that attempted to predict the exact path of a violent storm rather
than just a likely ``swath'' it might hit.
</P>
<P>
   But given the relentless march of technology, meteorologists are
confident they will continually get closer to being able to make
more precise and reliable _ and ever more local _ forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all has to do with computer power,'' said Lans P. Rofthusz,
the government meteorologist who headed the Olympic forecasting
office. ``The more computer power you get, the more specificity you
can get in your computer model.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Jeff Gluck said, ``The dream is to be able to say what's
the weather going to be like in my back yard at 3 o'clock, because
that's when we're going to have our barbecue.''

COOL PLACES FOR THE HOT SUMMER IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the weather finally turns hot, or at least
warm, California has sensational houseboating, boat-in camping,
rafting, water skiing and water's-edge camps that are beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my picks for the best of the best in each prominent
category at lakes, rivers and the coast:
</P>
<P>
   RAFTING
</P>
<P>
   Main Stem Tuolumne River: When it comes to rafting, ``The T'' is
simply the best. Many rafters are baptized by the cool, clear,
pounding waters of the Tuolumne River. Here you'll find one of
California's most thrilling rapids, Pinball, and one of the most
terrorizing, Clavey Falls. The 18-mile run, from Meral Pool
downstream to Ward's Ferry, is rated Class IV-plus. Anybody who
runs it will have experienced the true essence of exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Echo, 800-652-3246; California Outdoors Rafting Hot
line, 800-552-3625.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSEBOATING
</P>
<P>
   Shasta Lake: This is the boating capital of the West. Giant
Shasta Lake has 365 miles of shoreline and 22 species of sport
fish. From a houseboat, it takes about five or six days to see the
whole thing. With all the houseboaters on the water, it can seem
like one big party of happy people. The water skiing and swimming
are excellent, with surface waters ranging 75 to 80 degrees. The
fishing now is also excellent for salmon, trout and bass.
Meanwhile, if you want peace and quiet, or a parking spot for the
night, just head into one of the coves.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Holiday Harbor, 530-238-2383; Shasta Cascade,
800-474-2782.
</P>
<P>
   BOAT-IN CAMPING
</P>
<P>
   Bullards Bar Reservoir: This is a big, beautiful lake set at
2,000 feet in the Sierra foothills, and get this: Not only are
there two boat-in campgrounds at Bullards Bar, but boaters are
allowed to create their own primitive campsites anywhere along the
lakeshore (a chemical toilet is required). The lake also has great
fishing for small but tasty kokanee salmon. When compared with the
other reservoirs in the Central Valley foothills, Bullards Bar
Reservoir stands out like a silver dollar in a field of pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Emerald Cove Resort, 530-692-3200.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY DESTINATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Edison Lake: Here is one of the great summer family camping
destinations in California. Edison Lake is set at an elevation of
7,650 feet in the central Sierra east of Fresno, and it has
everything you could ask for: Four lakeside camps, a resort, a boat
launch, boat rentals, horseback riding rentals, a nearby trail head
to the Pacific Crest Trail, and yes, good fishing. A 15-mph speed
limit keeps the water quiet, and there's twice-daily ferry service
across the lake to the trail head at the head of the lake. The lake
is fed by Mono Creek, a cold, pure, and pristine trout stream, with
a good trail alongside for access.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Vermillion Valley Resort, 559-855-6558; Pine Ridge
Ranger District, 559-855-5375.
</P>
<P>
   WATER-SKIING
</P>
<P>
   San Joaquin Delta: Yeah, it gets insane here, and that's exactly
why so many people like the San Joaquin Delta. There are boats,
boats, boats everywhere, not to mention boat owners who are on
weekend vacations trying to escape the reality of their
Monday-to-Friday lives. And the waterskiing? You've never seen so
many boats ripping up and down, with happy (and somewhat insane)
folks aboard and bright white wakes trailing behind. The best areas
here are out of Bethel Island, with access to the Delta's quietest
waters, and also at Brannan Island State Recreation Area, where
there are docks and campsites available.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Brannan Island State Recreation Area, 916-777-6671;
Bethel Harbor, 925-684-2141; Discovery Bay, Byron, 925-634-5928.
</P>
<P>
   SCENIC DESTINATION
</P>
<P>
   Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe: One of the premier outdoor experiences
in the world is boating in Emerald Bay, which brings you right into
the heart of Tahoe's incomparable scenic beauty. No matter where
you go in the bay, you'll be floating on clear, cobalt blue waters
and surrounded by a mountain rim that is often topped with bright
white snow. The sight is always remarkable, often breathtaking.
There are 20 boat-in campsites to make it work. Precise advance
planning with reservations are a must; expect tons of people in
summer, of course, and competition for the best spots.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 530-541-3030 or 530-525-7277; reservations at
800-444-7275.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Santa Rosa Island: This is my favorite of the Channel Islands.
Because the boat ride to Santa Rosa takes longer than the one to
Santa Cruz Island, this place is often overlooked by visitors who
are on a one-day, round-trip adventure, making it extra special.
The ``Painted Caves'' of Santa Rosa Island make this a world-class
destination for kayakers, as well as a great spot for hiking and
exploring. A great trip, well worth the effort.

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' _ Pat O'Connor's
respectful adaptation of Brian Friel's play concerning five Irish
sisters in the '30s features a crafty performance by Meryl Streep.
It's a bit too sentimental, but the acting is superb, and O'Connor
wisely cut the play's length down to a manageable size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' _ Michael Caine deserved the
best-supporting-actor Oscar for his portrayal of an ambitious and
shady yet touching theatrical agent. Jane Horrocks shows off her
gift for vocal mimicry in the title role, as the reclusive girl who
may have a career reproducing the sounds from the records who have
been her only friends. But it's worth the price of the rental to
hear Caine's rendition of Roy Orbison's ``It's Over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane Doe'' _ ``Ally McBeal'' fans might be curious to see
Calista Flockhart in this downbeat tale of drug addiction.
Self-destructive Jane (Flockhart) starts going down from the
beginning, so there are no surprises. A claustrophobic rendering,
with much of the dialogue boring and tedious.

REGIONAL PUBLIC RADIO NETWORK TO LAUNCH NATIONAL WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This summer, WAMC Northeast Public Radio will
launch a new national radio station that broadcasts solely over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, called ThePublicRadioStation.com., is intended
to help the network keep listeners as new technology threatens to
further fragment the radio audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will be getting their radio through their
computer,'' said Alan S. Chartock, WAMC executive director. That's
increasingly possible as audio speakers are routinely sold with
computer systems. Motorists with cellular phone may even listen to
Internet radio broadcasts using their cell phone as a receiver in
the future, Chartock said.
</P>
<P>
   ThePublicRadioStation.com will ensure that WAMC has an audience
among future listeners who may abandon current radio technology or
want to supplement it, and who may live outside WAMC's broadcast
signal, Chartock said.
</P>
<P>
   WAMC, like many other radio broadcasters, already operates its
own site on the World Wide Web that allows listeners to tap into
some of the audio content of the station through personal computers
equipped with speakers. But not many radio broadcasters have yet
started an operation whose broadcasts are made solely over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right at the beginning of this technology,'' said David
Galletly, WAMC assistant executive director. However, National
Public Radio, which provides WAMC with national news coverage and
programming, also plans to launch an on-line network. And in the
Boston market, some commercial radio stations have added
Internet-based broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   WAMC Northeast Public Radio, which is based in Albany, is a
regional network that serves parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ThePublicRadioStation.com will have some content that differs
from what is broadcast on WAMC, Chartock said. Some programs
produced here that cover topics of national interest, such as an
education show, ``To The Best of Our Knowledge,'' will be broadcast
over both WAMC and ThePublicRadioStation.com. But
ThePublicRadioStation.com will also offer fare including
English-language coverage of world news events from Radio
Netherlands, and probably other broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Internet station can be a broadcast outlet for the
many radio producers nationally who are seeking forums for their
independent programs and documentaries, Chartock said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, WAMC will use its traditional radio broadcasts to the
regional audience to publicize the launch of the Internet station,
Chartock said. He acknowledged it will be a promotional challenge
to get the Internet station noticed nationally, but would not
divulge the strategies he intends to pursue. No specific launch
date has yet been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ThePublicRadioStation.com will be able to accept advertising
banners on the Internet page the audience will actually see,
Chartock said. However, the Internet radio station won't start
making a lot of money for WAMC soon, Chartock said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added: ``The name of the game is to get there
first.''

   There's no doubt the Internet is a compelling communication
medium, said Jack Kelly, president of Albany Broadcasting, whose
properties include WROW in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not even clear to all commercial stations how they
can successfully expand their advertising revenue base by having an
Internet-only station, Kelly said. The consumer market would be
geographically scattered, and that can make it hard to woo any
particular advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   So WROW, like many other stations, has confined its Internet
presence to audio broadcasts from its Web page, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to get someplace, we just don't know where we're
going,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is technical. The modems most people have now
don't allow for high quality sound of Internet broadcasts,
particularly on portable devices such as laptop computers, said
Rick Miller, a senior Internet analyst with the Boston-area market
research service Cahners In-Stat Group. For that reason,
traditional radio will be around for a long time, Miller said.

IT'S THE SAME OLD LOINCLOTH ON A NEW TARZAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seems he has graced the screen forever _ swinging
through the trees, fighting leopards and crocodiles, and emitting a
scream to make the elephants stampede. Raised by apes, and
believing he is one them, despite his hairless skin and loincloth,
Tarzan is one of the most indelible images on film.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1918, just six years after Edgar Rice Burroughs sold his
first version of the story, there have been more than 40 movies
based on the character, from the silent ``Tarzan of the Apes'' to
last year's ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' (which might have worked
better with no dialogue). But ``Tarzan,'' which opens Friday, marks
the first time the oft-told tale has been brought to feature-length
animated life. It was something Burroughs always wanted; he
expressed his desires in a 1936 letter to his son. Any animated
film of his most famous creation, Burroughs wrote, would have to
``approximate Disney excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily we didn't get that letter until a few months ago, when
the film was almost finished,'' joked Chris Buck, the film's
codirector. ``I'm pretty confident this film will do more than
approximate Disney excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is a Disney film, the studio's latest traditionally
animated movie. With a soundtrack by Phil Collins, it features the
voice talents of Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan,TARZAN, Page N4 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver as Jane, and Glenn Close, Rosie O'Donnell, Nigel
Hawthorne, Brian Blessed, Lance Henriksen, and Wayne Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film, Disney's big entry in the summer movie
sweepstakes, wasn't something Buck or codirector Kevin Lima were
originally interested in pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first approached with the material, I thought, `I
don't want to make this _ I don't want to do a Tarzan film,' ''
said Buck, during an interview in a hotel smack-dab in an urban
jungle otherwise known as midtown Manhattan. ``I had Johnny
Weissmuller so stuck in my mind. But when we went back to the book
and found there was a wealth of material for this to be done in
animation, we wondered why anyone hadn't done this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs himself tried and failed in the 1930s, the height of
cinema's Tarzan fever. The first film, the 1918 ``Tarzan of the
Apes'' (starring Elmo Lincoln) was fairly faithful to Burroughs's
book, but it wasn't until 1932's ``Tarzan, the Ape Man,'' starring
former Olympic swimming champ Weissmuller, that the story really
began to swing. It took extraordinary liberties with Burroughs's
novel, but it was a welcome, entertaining respite from the doldrums
of Depression-era America. Weissmuller's semiliterate, clean-cut,
well-sculpted man of the wild became an instant icon, spawning
several sequels including ``Tarzan and His Mate'' (1934), which
introduced Maureen O'Sullivan's Jane; ``Tarzan Finds His Son,'' in
which Tarzan and Jane complete a jungle adoption of an abandoned
child _ named Boy _ played by too-cute Johnny Sheffield; and
``Tarzan's New York Adventure,'' which found Tarzan trying to
negotiate indoor plumbing and rush-hour traffic while searching for
his kidnapped son.
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise proved so successful _ it's second only to
Dracula as filmdom's favorite suject _ that other actors such as
Buster Crabbe, Lex Barker, and Jock Mahoney donned the loincloth.
Even ``George of the Jungle'' is very loosely based on Tarzan.
Other entries include 1984's deadly serious but enjoyable
``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes'' and 1981's
laughable, soft-porn ``Tarzan, the Ape Man,'' memorable only for
its obsession with what Tarzan and Jane really did in the jungle
all those years.
</P>
<P>
   In most, the back story was the same. Tarzan was raised by apes
after his shipwrecked parents became a blue-plate special for a
leopard. But what all these films could never do was portray Tarzan
as Burroughs truly imagined him. Wrote the author of his hero: ``He
could spring 20 feet across space at the dizzying height of the
forest top, and grab with unerring precision and without apparent
jar, a limb waving wildly in the path of an approaching tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much Olympic glory and athletic prowess
Weissmuller and the other Tinseltown Tarzans possessed, there
simply weren't _ and aren't _ any actors who dare risk such
superhuman feats. But as anyone who's ever watched a ``Road
Runner'' cartoon can tell you, animated flesh and bones can do
absolutely anything.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Tarzan skids down a tree limb like a rollerblader
riding the rails of a street course. Watching his acrobatic turns
and twists is like watching a skateboarder pop 540s in the
half-pipe. He's skateboard master Tony Hawk in a lioncloth, with a
physique that will have South End boys doubling their reps at the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``We patterned him after an extreme athlete,'' Lima said. ``He's
a guy who had to survive to live in this jungle. He grew up with
the gorillas, but he also mimics other animals. So we thought of an
extreme athlete and his psyche, what's he all about. No live actor
can do what our guy can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief animator Glen Keane styled the character's movement on his
own son's skateboarding exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Glen, the inspiration for Tarzan was there in his house,''
Lima said. ``Those movements would make it a little different, and
give it that edge to make it speak to a contemporary audience. This
will be an introduction to a whole new generation of kids. We
didn't want it to take over _ we didn't want Tarzan to talk like a
surf dude. But we thought the living-on-the-edge physicality and
mentality could really pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   With an animated feature, Buck and Lima found they could more
fully explore Tarzan's ability to talk with his animal friends _
and what's a Disney film without wisecracking creatures?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can actually talk to the animals,'' said Lima, ``and they
can talk back, so we can have a sense of who Tarzan is as a person
and what it was like to grow up in the jungle with these
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan's best pal is Terk, a Mohawk-coiffed jokey gorilla who
looks like (and we mean this in the nicest possible way) the woman
who supplies his voice, Rosie O'Donnell. Many of the characters,
especially Driver's Jane and Hawthorne's Professor Porter, bear
more than a passing resemblance to those who lend them their
voices.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a coincidence. The characters are drawn after the voice
talent signs on, Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tends to happen is we cast the actors as we're doing
exploratory drawing, so we already have an idea of where we want to
go with the character,'' he said. ``We have a tendency at times to
pull facial expressions or attitudes into the character. Rosie
looks like Terk because we used her mouth, and the way she uses her
mouth as an actress is very specific. We also videotaped the vocal
recording sessions so the animator gets a copy of what the voice
talents did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was one particular aspect of Tarzan that Lima and
Buck refused to mess with _ that loincloth. No matter how skimpy,
that loincloth has always seemed out of place since Tarzan believes
he's an ape, and none of the other apes are so modest about their
nudity. (Of course, this being a family film, no one wanted to give
the notion of Tarzan swinging through the jungle a whole new
interpretation.) But Buck insisted that keeping Tarzan's
tried-and-true fashion sense intact was necessary for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the pop icons we associate with the character, and
I think we wanted to hold onto certain things, like the yell and
the stampede of elephants,'' he said. ``These were things we wanted
to see, and we felt an audience would want to see.''

   ``Not tonight, honey, I want to plant a shrub.'' That line of
dialogue is suggested by a survey of homeowners conducted for Home
&AMP; Garden Television. Among the results:
</P>
<P>
   _ For ``fun and enjoyment,'' more male homeowners prefer working
in the yard (52 percent) to having sex (47 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ More than a quarter of all homeowners (27 percent) find
gardening a way to relax, about the same percentage as cited
sports, exercise, eating and drinking as their preferred methods of
relaxation. People who call themselves gardeners would rather
garden (42 percent) than socialize (40 percent), eat in a
restaurant (37 percent) or go for a drive (34 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Female home enthusiasts would rather organize or decorate
their home (42 percent) than go to the movies (39 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   LONG, BROAD VIEW: The Bushnell company, maker of sport optics,
has introduced a binocular line called Xtra-Wide, aimed especially
at baseball fans. It promises a field-of-view three times as wide
as conventional binoculars and allows stadium spectators to see
more of the game magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell's research turned up the common complaint that fans
were frustrated by being unable to follow more of the action
through their binoculars and instead were using the magnification
to focus on a specific play or player. The Xtra-Wide series comes
in three powers of magnification: 4X (four times closer than the
naked eye, with a 900-foot-wide field of view at 1,000 yards), 7X
(700 feet wide) and 10X (500 feet wide).

   MILLENNIUM WATCH: This will be worth a bundle in 30 years, we
think, plus the hit of your millennial-eve party on Dec. 31: a neon
sign that alternately blinks ``1999'' in red and ``2000'' in blue
($169.50). It comes from a company called Idea Express, which is
marketing only millennium-related products. (What will they do next
year, we wonder?)
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other items are a candle shaped like Earth and
girdled by an equatorial band with ``2000'' on it ($12.49), candles
inside champagne glasses ($8.95), wristwatches ($24.95), a bear
that chirps ``Happy Millennium'' when squeezed and wears a hat with
the same sentiment (pictured; $10.95), and T-shirts emblazoned with

``Same (Excrement), Different Millennium'' ($13.95).

AMERICANS GROW FATTER DESPITE STEADY DIET OF ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cynthia Last doesn't believe in diets, especially
the ones that inundate the best-seller list during the summer when
many Americans are struggling to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those diets are demon diets where one food is the bad
guy,'' said Last, a Florida psychologist who focuses on food
issues. ``For virtually all of them, there is no scientific
proof.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop many people from buying into fad diets, which
typically promote quick weight loss with strategies that most
nutritionists say are less than sound.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Cabbage Soup Diet? More popular today are books
like ``Eat Right For(4) Your Type,'' ``Sugar Busters!'' and ``The
Zone.'' While different in the details, all of these books restrict
certain foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar Busters!'' goes a step further by restricting certain
combinations of foods, like forbidding a dieter from eating a piece
of naturally sweet fruit after dinner. The premise is that sugar,
not fat, is the cause of weight gain, so the sugar in the fruit
will encourage the body to store fat.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that these approaches eschew the best-known medical
advice. To lose weight, the best strategy remains to eat less and
exercise more. And a calorie is a calorie, no matter where it comes
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always looking for a new gimmick,'' said Kathy
Kane, a registered dietitian and nutritionist for the Kaiser
Permanente health plan. ``Weight loss is hard for people to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, some of these popular books offer traditional
weight-loss advice with an emphasis on cutting calories and
increasing activity. At worst, they can fuel frustration with the
yo-yo effect that often follows any quick weight loss scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Any diet, for example, that promises to help you lose more than
one to two pounds a week is unrealistic and, in some cases,
unhealthy for most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is when the diet is over, they don't keep the
weight off,'' said Nan Windmueller, a certified nutritionist with a
private practice in Albany. ``Ninety-five percent of people gain
the weight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statistics help explain how the diet industry continues to
get richer as the country gets fatter. More than half of the adults
in the United States, or 97 million people, are too heavy. That
represents a 50 percent increase since the 1970s, when the low-fat
diet craze first took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very lucrative business,'' Windmueller said. ``It's in
the diet industry's best interest to have people fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert C. Atkins in his best-selling and controversial book
``Dr. Atkins' New Revolutionary Diet,'' addresses that kind of
skepticism with a disclaimer about his own approach and a criticism
of the low-fat diet obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to fall into the error of the low-fat dieting
devotees who claim that their diet works for everyone,'' he writes.
``I would feel rather foolish if I did. No diet works for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the popular high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets espoused by
people like Atkins offer their own particular pitfalls. Besides
``Dr. Atkins' New Revolutionary Diet,'' consider ``Protein Power,''
another popular book that severely restricts carbohydrates and
starches but allow meats, egg yolks and other proteins, along with
saturated fats.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that you can eat as many calories from fat and
protein as you want as long as you eat very few carbohydrates, such
as pasta, breads and potatoes. The idea is that your body will turn
to its stored fat to make up for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, however, is much more complex, health experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While you will lose weight fast on such a diet, most of that
weight is apt to be water and lean tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, by severely restricting carbohydrates, the insulin
levels in your body drop. As Sharon Alger, a registered dietitian
at Albany Medical Center explains, one of the many things that
insulin does in the body is hold on to salt and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stop eating carbohydrates and those insulin levels
fall, you start losing water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diets that restrict all carbohydrates cause the body to produce
compounds known as ketones that accumulate in the blood and must be
removed. To achieve that, the kidneys must work overtime. Not only
will you go to the bathroom a lot, but you'll also risk
constipation, nausea, headache, fatigue and bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, eating high-fat foods on a regular
basis is a good way to increase your risk for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, both the American Dietetic Association and the
American Heart Association recommend diets that are high in complex
carbohydrates, such as whole grains, vegetables and fruit, and low
in fat derived from animal products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that appeals to people is they can eat as
much as they want,'' Kane said about diets like Dr. Atkins'. ``But
it can get pretty boring eating meat and fat all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In her practice, Windmueller puts an emphasis on helping people
make better food choices and on portion control, the same technique
used by many commercial weight-loss programs such as Weight
Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs generally get higher marks from nutritionists than
the ``fad'' diet books because they tend to emphasize lifestyle
changes rather than restrictions on specific foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem in the American diet is serving size.
Period,'' Windmueller said. ``People are members of the clean plate
club.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one is more frustrated with American's fascination
with the fad diet than Last, whose own book, ``The Five Reasons Why
We Overeat: How to Develop a Long-Term Weight Control Plan that's
Right for You,'' has yet to make it on the best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't eat out of hunger,'' said Last, who received her
doctorate in psychology from the State University of New York at
Albany in 1981. ``They're overeating because of behaviors,
attitudes and emotions. Most of us grow up thinking food is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why many health experts say the fad diet is doomed to
fail. Because many of the books don't talk about lifestyle changes,
people return to the behaviors that made them fat as soon as the
official diet is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make a change for one, two or three weeks and then
stop,'' Alger said. ``It's got to be something that's long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that lifestyle changes are the biggest
predictor of how successful someone will be over the long term in
keeping weight off.
</P>
<P>
   And of all lifestyle changes, ``exercise is really the key that
makes a difference,'' Alger said.

ROLLING THE FUZZY DICE FOR THE 50TH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For nearly two years we argued (and argued)
about where the Lake Ladies should meet to commemorate our
collective 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be something out of the ordinary: Four of us have
known each other since junior high school; all six of us go back
more than 20 years, and none of us will turn 50 more than once.
</P>
<P>
   I, in San Francisco, wanted an exotic destination that required
a passport. Barbara, in West Lafayette, Ind., wanted a beach to
walk on. Patty, in St. Louis, said she couldn't go any place where
people would be begging for money on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn, in Denver, was drawn to Puerto Vallarta, where she
rents a house each spring and choreographs her own fiesta caliente.
Helen, in Grand Rapids, Mich., wanted something ``resort-y,''
possibly a cruise. Joyce, in Phoenix, asked: How about the Grand
Canyon?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked as if we'd ax-murder one another, Joyce
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we go to Vegas?''
</P>
<P>
   We call ourselves the ``Lake Ladies'' because, every summer for
the past 20, we have gathered for a week in an A-frame wood cabin
on tiny Rocky Fork Lake in central Indiana. When we were kids,
learning to waterski and lie to our parents, Marilyn's mom and dad
owned the cabin. Now we own it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, we have collected dozens of ``team photos'' and
tons of Lake Ladies gear, from sweatpants to tank tops to fanny
packs. We've also collected about a million memories, transformed
our teen-age anecdotes into legends and amassed a series of
hilarious (to us) home videos. (``Helen and Marilyn Install the New
Toilet'' is one of my favorites.)
</P>
<P>
   But to say that the Lake Ladies move and think as a seamless
unit is like saying the Jackson Five had an idyllic childhood. At
one particularly low point during the 50th birthday negotiations,
Helen suggested we forget it and start planning our 60th.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for us, Bugsy Siegel had a crazy dream.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn and Joyce had visited Las Vegas enough to know their way
around, but the rest of us were Vegas virgins. When we arrived at
the teeming, slot machine-encrusted McCarran International Airport,
the temperature was 58 degrees and it was pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   As we would soon learn, in Las Vegas it matters not if Mom
Nature is in a bad mood. Real life (such as it is) goes on indoors.
One's environment _ or global hemisphere _ can be altered by
walking across a street or hopping an inter-casino tram.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, being a Macintosh genius, made each of us a replica of a
U.S. passport, navy blue with gold lettering. But ours says:
``Passport: Lake Ladies World Tour '99,'' and has our official logo
on it.
</P>
<P>
   To make Barbara's wish come true, we chose the $950 million,
43-story Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino as our home base.
</P>
<P>
   They have a real sand beach that _ when things are properly
working _ gets kissed by a 6-foot surf from an 11-acre freshwater
``bay.''
</P>
<P>
   But we loved the live birds in the lobby, the water-spouting
faux elephant heads all over the grounds and the aromatic bath
salts for the minispas in each room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite our, ahem, diverse interests, Vegas delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Following the designated destinations in Joyce's passports, we
clomped from Egypt (the Luxor) to Camelot (the Excalibur) to Lake
Como (the Bellagio) and passed Paris, Venice and Treasure Island
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, we even time-traveled back to our own teens:
Tom Jones at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Although we threatened every day, we never made it onto the
roller coaster at New York, New York. Patty and Helen tied for
first prize in our Vegas memorabilia scavenger hunt and received
bags full of chotzkhe _ like fur dice and painted shot glasses _
for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn groused about losing money every place she gambled, but
recouped some of her deficit at the airport while she waited for a
7 a.m. flight home.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara copped the ``best over-heard'' when a man next to her in
some casino snarled into a cellphone: ``I said I need you to send
me $77,000 and I need it NOW.''
</P>
<P>
   On our last full day, we piled into Joyce's minivan and drove to
Hoover Dam for a two-hour ``hard-hat'' tour. I had joked that we
ought to see at least one thing that was older than we were. But
that gorgeous concrete monument to human vision and American
ingenuity is a rarity that deserves the term ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, all Lake Ladies were back in their homes in six
states. The world tour was over, the collective 50th marked.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I imagine planning our 60th, I get a headache. Then I
remember: Macao, Montana or Mars, we'll be together. That's the
only thing that ever matters.

is chopped into shards that appear to copy themselves in an
infinite progression of steps to ever smaller scales. By Malcolm
Browne. (800 words)

<P>
   SCI-FOSSIL-THEFT (Undated) _ The theft of valuable fossils on

AS RATES FALL, DIGITAL CELL PHONES SWITCHING ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to look far to see that digital cell phones, as
opposed to the traditional analog ones, are fast becoming the most
popular type of wireless phone in this country.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny handsets are tucked into backpacks, briefcases, and
purses everywhere, and sales are brisk. In the first three months
of this year, 75 percent of the people who signed up for cellular
phone plans chose digital, not analog, service.
</P>
<P>
   There's good reason: Prices of the phones and plans are
dropping. And new plans come in simple bulk-rate packages _
hundreds of minutes at a flat monthly rate _ so people aren't so
anxious about each minute's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more people are addicted to the convenience of a cell
phone in their everyday life, no longer seeing it as something only
for an emergency. And the more you use the phone, the more
cost-effective it becomes to buy a digital plan.
</P>
<P>
   Analog phones remain a good buy for emergency users, largely
because the monthly cost can stay in the $15 range if you keep your
usage very low. But there's no question analog handsets are on
their way to extinction. In a few years, analysts say, analog
phones will be like black-and-white TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Analog service does have the benefit of being around longer.
There are more analog antennas up, offering superior coverage at
this time, particularly in rural areas. But analog relies on a
less-efficient technology: A person's entire voice is transmitted
across the radio channel, taking up more space along the channel.
With digital, a caller's voice is converted into a stream of binary
1's and 0's, which enables calls to be greatly compressed.
Per-minute charges with digital are generally cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Walton, an energetic 78-year-old, is among the new digital
converts. She just came to the end of a two-year contract with Bell
Atlantic Mobile, in which she had a clunky analog phone and paid
$15 a month for the service, as well as 35 to 99 cents a minute for
each local call. She wanted the phone for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But now she wants to use the phone more often, keeping her in
touch with family and friends regardless of where she is. After
looking around at all the carriers, she chose the Bell Atlantic
Mobile DigitalChoice plan that offers 200 minutes at $29.99, with
free nights and weekend calling. She also gets the entry-level
phone, a BAM300D, for $50 after rebates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convenience of these cell phones excites me,'' said
Walton, a retired school psychologist. ``It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to price for a moderate user, it's hard to beat
the Bell Atlantic and the Sprint entry-level digital plans. AT&AMP;T's
plans become more competitive if you are a more extensive user, and
Cellular One and Omnipoint offer cheaper monthly deals but with far
fewer minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond price, you have to consider what carrier offers the
best coverage for your needs. A cheap plan is useless if you can't
get a dial tone. Don't accept the mistaken notion _ often
perpetuated by cellular phone sales staff _ that your area is full
of cellular antennas providing blanket coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaps in coverage in the Boston area, for example, and
it's particularly noticeable if you rely on digital service only.
Carriers are scrambling to put up digital antennas, while facing
opposition from some communities.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what carrier is best for you, you have to do your
own homework. There's no simple chart available. It depends on
where you live and where you travel. Ask carriers for their
coverage maps and antenna locations, and talk to people who have
cell-phone experience in the areas where you travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``With competition and lots of choice, it requires people to do
a lot of research,'' said Mark Lowenstein of the Yankee Group, a
telecommunications research firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the maximum amount of coverage, it's best to stick
to dual-band phones, offering analog and digital service, and buy a
bucket of minutes that includes both types of calls. When you buy a
bucket of minutes with Bell Atlantic Mobile, AT&AMP;T Wireless, and
Cellular One, you get analog and digital types of minutes included.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's bucket only covers digital calls, with analog costing
extra. And Omnipoint phones can only handle digital calls, with no
option to roam onto analog service.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to consider is if you want a local or national
one-rate plan. Calls outside that area bring about extra per-minute
long-distance charges, as well as a deduction from your allotment
of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The national one-rate plans are more costly and require the
purchase of more minutes, but the amount you buy covers local and
long-distance calls. If you're a heavy long-distance caller, these
plans might be good for you.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating plans, think about what is truly important to
you. Some don't charge for the first incoming minute, which can be
a big benefit if you receive many calls that are only a sentence or
two. If you're unsure of how much you'll like the digital service,
you might want a month-to-month plan.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, take your time in doing your research and don't get
pressured into a deal because a sales person warns you a special
promotion is ending. Competition is fierce, and carriers want your
business badly. This week's Father's Day specials will probably be
next month's Fourth of July bargain.

STRONG ECONOMY STEALS GOP THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You are tired, says Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   You are ``exhausted and stressed,'' he says. ``You work hard.
You miss dinners. You miss breakfasts. Sometimes you skip your
child's play at school.'' And all because the government demands
that you work ever-harder to pay always-higher federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes puts it this way: Many of you are bankrupt,
``drowning in personal debt'' and in constant fear of creditors.
Many middle-class families are ``struggling to keep their heads
above water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lift up the hood on the American economy, and you will not find
the smooth-running machine that has made the United States an
island of prosperity in a turbulent world. At least, not if you are
a Republican candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   While much of America revels in a record-high stock market and
near record-low unemployment, the booming economy has become a
problem for Republicans as they try to dislodge the Democratic
Party from the White House. Traditionally, the party out of power
searches for some dissatisfaction among Americans and tries to turn
that feeling into votes.
</P>
<P>
   But voters are so content with their financial lives these days
that a whole range of familiar GOP themes has been blunted.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts? Americans are too busy earning money to worry about
trimming the government's share, a perennial Republican issue. In a
Gallup Poll last month, only 4 perecent of people cited the tax
burden as the nation's top problem _ down precipitously from 67
percent in early 1992, the last year Republicans held the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Improving the business climate, another common Republican
appeal, carries little urgency as the world pours money into US
stocks. Promises to create jobs mean little to a nation already at
work. And the balanced federal budget has made another GOP
evergreen issue _ cutting the size of government _ hard to get
passionate about.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more generous in their view of government when
they're doing well themselves,'' said Karlyn Bowman, a public
opinion scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ``There's not
the same opposition to federal programs as in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the general election is still 17 months away _
plenty of time for the red-hot economy to cool and for economic
complaints to take center stage. But for now, Republicans face a
challenge in raising some of their traditional themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency is to look to taxes and a balanced budget,'' said
Linda DiVall, a pollster working for GOP candidate Elizabeth Dole.
``But the robust economy means that Republicans have to deal with a
range of other issues that they were not as comfortable with in the
past, like education and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will it be easy for Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator, to use the economy to his advantage in chasing Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. ``I think he's
just going to have to find traction on other issues,'' said Charles
Cook, a political analyst and columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is often the overarching theme of an election.
President Clinton, for example, rode to power on the campaign
mantra: ``It's the economy, stupid.'' But for the party in power, a
strong economy will not always guarantee success. Richard Nixon cut
short an eight-year Democratic reign in 1968 despite a long-running
economic boom related to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore is not quite basking in the economic sunshine. Two
Republican candidates, Dole and Texas Governor George W. Bush, hold
significant leads on him in early polling.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans frequently vote their pocketbooks. A candidate who
can claim credit for putting money in the voters' wallets is in an
enviable position.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only a matter of time, many analysts say, before Gore
begins running TV ads promoting himself as the key architect, along
with Clinton, of the longest-running peacetime expansion on record.
The ads will probably brag that wages are up, unemployment is down,
and home ownership is at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will feature every leader of the Republican Party talking
in 1993 about how Clinton's plan for the economy will be the worst
thing in the history of mankind,'' said Cook. ``They will ask: Who
do you want? The team that did it, or the team that adamantly
opposed it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard for any Republican nominee to answer those
ads,'' acknowledges Jeffrey Bell, a policy aide to presidential
candidates Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Jack Kemp, who this year is
advising social conservative Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   So, what can a Republican candidate say about the economy?
``Change the subject in some way,'' advised Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just avoid it,'' said Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But that is nearly impossible for some Republicans. They are
running for two jobs at once: for president, and for heir to Reagan
as leader of the small-government, tax-cutting wing of the party.
That requires them to talk about how much those policy
prescriptions could do for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are trying a variety of strategies, often several at
once, to turn the economy to their advantage. Their tactics: &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Argue that times are not as good as they seem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The economy may look strong, but Representative John Kasich of
Ohio says that wage and productivity growth are ``far slower'' than
in past economic recoveries. Three-time candidate Patrick Buchanan
rails about the trade deficit, which he calls ``a malignant tumor
in the intestines of the US economy'' that is killing off US
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look behind the illusion of the Clinton and Gore magic show
and see what has happened in the years since they took over,''
urges Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor. ``Twelve more
countries have jumped over us in high school graduation rates; our
taxes are higher; the federal regulation book is thicker; our
national defense is weaker.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Deny the Democrats credit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The true hero of the economy is tax-cutter and inflation-fighter
Ronald Reagan, said Elizabeth Dole in a recent speech. She gave
credit for the current economy to Reagan, to the Republican
Congress, to Alan Greenspan, and to ``the powerful engine of
private enterprise.'' At the same time, she criticized Clinton and
Gore for raising taxes and adding burdensome federal regulations. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Cast taxes and prosperity as a moral issue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While polls show that Americans have few concerns about the
economy, they are greatly worried about the challenge of raising
children amid a perceived decline in ethics and parenting skills.
Republicans are trying to bring the two issues together.
</P>
<P>
   High taxes keep Americans on the job and away from their
children, says Forbes. Arguing for tax cuts, he says: ``Just look
at the explosion of teenage crime and violence and drug abuse _
look at the emptiness in the lives of so many young people today _
and tell me that we shouldn't be doing everything that we possibly
can to set parents free to spend more time with each other and
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Quayle, the former vice president, says that high
taxes keep parents on the job and out of the home. And Bush speaks
of ``prosperity with a purpose.'' The Texas governor has not
defined the concept in detail, but says it entails ``not just
material wealth'' but a chance to help the needy and ``to
strenghten our families, where we find love and values.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -Argue that they will be better stewards of the current
prosperity than Al Gore &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also adopted this strategy, highlighting his work as
a senator on the 1986 tax reform bill and on the mid-'80s debt
crisis in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all of these are ``secondary arguments'' that will carry
less punch than Gore's claim to be directly responsible for the
good economy, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American
University in Washington. ``You've got to hit people between the
eyes, given that half of the people don't even vote. None of these
arguments will go very far,'' Lichtman predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, said Bell and other Republicans, the party is
hampered because it has already won the debate on several important
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed on to welfare reform, long a Republican goal. The
federal budget is in balance, a preoccupation of many Republicans.
And Democrats have largely abandoned any talk of a federal
industrial policy, especially now that Japan has tumbled into
recession. The Japanese government's role in controlling bank
lending and industry is considered a chief culprit in the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have a great deal to run on with the
economy,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National
Committee. ``We have real bragging rights in reforming welfare and
other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bell, the aide to Bauer, doubted that argument would sell.
``There may be truth to it, but voters are not interested,'' he
said. ``They don't dwell on who has the best claim to some change
that they favor. They'll give the benefit of the doubt to the
people in the White House.''

ALBRIGHT'S TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Of Slobodan Milosevic's endgame canards, none is
sicker than his boast that his beaten armed forces never gave up
Kosovo, and never will give up Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The boast is understandable in the context of this murderous
loser's effort to stay in power. But its absurdity suggests an
awareness of the domestic consequences possibly in store for him
should the citizens of his shrinking ``country'' come to understand
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to see how they can be shielded from it, given what is
about to unfold. The NATO victors have yet to discuss Kosovo's
future in detail, mostly because Russia's large contribution to the
diplomatic side of the conflict merits a decent respect for its
concerns, but NATO's planning envisages a future where any notion
of Yugoslav ``sovereignty'' on paper will have no meaning on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the fact that sovereignty should not be permitted
is a major consequence of the end of the fourth conflict Milosevic
has started within what used to be a functional Yugoslav federation
of six republics plus the then-autonomous province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For this consequence, the world has Madeleine Albright to thank.
Unlike her counterparts and foreign policy establishments
throughout the West still mired in Cold War old thinking, she has
spent years thinking about the conflict between self-determination
of peoples and the sovereignty of states.
</P>
<P>
   I remember her euphoria in 1989 as European communism began to
shatter, especially as the Velvet Revolution of her friend, Vaclav
Havel, succeeded in her native Czechoslovakia; so was her concern
as Czechoslovakia split in two. Then the Soviet Union went through
the demise that spawned more than a dozen new nations. And, as the
1992 presidential campaign was still taking shape, she was positive
that the pivotal test would come as mass murder in the name of
virulent nationalism began under the guidance of Milosevic in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even before becoming UN ambassador, Albright had no illusions
about the conflict and the test. At its extreme, self-determination
could produce a phenomenon linked to the very region in flames _
Balkanization; and at its own extreme, respect for sovereignty
meant tolerance for the kind of mass murder within borders. She was
also realistic about the challenge of uniting Europe against even a
monster with the political genes of Hitler and Mussolini. She was
similarly aware of the difficulties in summoning US will against an
evil not widely seen as directly threatening. And she acknowledged
that there had to be a link between an effort to respond to evil
and an ability to make a difference, meaning the United States
could not act with force in every situation, and that it would
almost always need allies in situations where making a difference
was possible.
</P>
<P>
   But she was convinced that sovereignty could not be immune from
challenge in a post-Cold War world, and, above all, not in Europe's
still-unstable South. And so she went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was maddeningly slow, but military action from the air
leading to peacekeepers on the ground was at long last taken in
Bosnia in 1995 and now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's blather aside, consider the record: Slovenia, free;
Croatia, free; Bosnia, de facto partitioned, still a mess, but
independent and peaceful; Montenegro, its hold on autonomy from
Belgrade tenuous but real; Macedonia, free and probably out of
immediate danger of destabilization from Milosevic's assault by
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it is also impossible not to believe that ideals
of democracy and free markets haven't been strengthened in Albania,
Bulgaria, and Romania, and that Turkey and Greece don't have even
stronger reasons for settling their dangerous differences over
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Kosovo. As Albright said, Milosevic has lost his
control. The currency for the immediate future is most likely to be
the dollar and the mark; the new trade patterns will flow south and
west, not north to Serbia; and once the armed perpetrators of
murder and displacement are back in Serbia, their return becomes
inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the NATO, European Union, UN, and other plans for
reconstruction involve a gradual erection of civilian leadership,
beginning with local elections. But every so often an official will
slip up privately and refer to the next level of elections down the
road in Kosovo as ``national.'' If ever tears and blood can be said
to qualify a people for internationally sanctioned
self-determination, the Kosovars are entitled.
</P>
<P>
   When we spoke by phone from Cologne Thursday night, Albright was
totally focused on the enormous scale of her tasks ahead, but
obviously aware a major corner has been turned _ in this crisis and
in the broader friction between self-determination and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the false euphoria that produced ``new world order''
babble in the Persian Gulf period, she is wary of grand summary,
but also venue-shopping for a major speech soon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what has happened, Albright will get the hearing she
richly deserves.

EXPATRIATE FINDS HE'S A STRANGER IN HIS OWN LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Bryson is, once again, befuddled. He's
standing at the counter of a Sausalito coffeehouse, puffing out his
cheeks uncertainly and squinting at a menu that runs to
cappuccinos, Espresso Macchiatos, Caffe Americanos, Mocha Freezes,
Sumatra blends and Chai Lattes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like a cup of, uh ... regular coffee,'' he says. The
young man behind the counter purses his pierced lips and regards
Bryson with suspicion, as if he'd just requested a tankard of
hemlock.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson gets that look wherever he goes. The America he has
returned to on the eve of the new millennium is bewilderingly
different to him than the one he left in 1972 for what eventually
would become a career as a best-selling humorist and travel writer
in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if he's just been thawed out after having spent the past
couple of decades in a cryogenic freeze chamber, just like Austin
Powers _ except that Bryson spent his formative years not in
Swinging London, but in decidedly unswinging Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   He's chronicled the joys and tribulations of reacquainting
himself with his native land in his latest book, ``I'm a Stranger
Here Myself'' (Broadway Books, 288 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   A cross between de Tocqueville and Dave Barry, Bryson writes
about today's America in a way that's both trenchantly observant
and pound-on-the-floor, snort-root-beer-out-your-nose funny.
</P>
<P>
   sHe was astounded to discover that gas station road maps are no
longer free, and wonders why his dental floss needs to carry a
number for a 24-hour Floss Hotline: ``As a rule of thumb, I would
submit that if you need to call your floss provider, for any
reason, you are probably not ready for this level of oral
hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Des Moines Register sportswriter, Bryson, 48, left
Iowa in 1972 for a summer of European vagabonding and cashed in his
return ticket. Settling in Britain, he worked for several London
newspapers before moving to the Yorkshire Dales and establishing
himself as one of Britain's best-selling writers with such books as
``The Lost Continent,'' ``Neither Here nor There,'' ``The Mother
Tongue'' and ``Notes From a Small Island.''
</P>
<P>
   As his reputation grew, he was contacted by a film producer,
Uberto Pasolini, who wanted him to write the script for a movie
about a group of unemployed Manchester steelworkers who become male
strippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was so farfetched and unbelievable that I wanted
nothing to do with it,'' Bryson says, speaking in an unplaceable,
vaguely British accent that could be best described as
``Iowashire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until years later, when I saw Pasolini's name in the
closing credits, that I realized this was `The Full Monty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his large following in Britain, Bryson was virtually
unknown in his native land until the success of last year's ``A
Walk in the Woods,'' a hilarious account of his hike along the
1,800-mile Appalachian Trail that spent six months on the New York
Times bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he moved back to the United States with his wife and
four children, choosing Hanover, N.H., ``for no other reason than
it seemed an awfully nice place.'' He chronicled his efforts to
rediscover America in a weekly column for the Sunday Mail, and
those columns evolved into ``I'm a Stranger Here Myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, in 1972, Richard Nixon was still president, the
war in Vietnam was still going on and America was still in a time
of social ferment,'' he says. ``It could hardly be more different
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The America he remembers was a place of motor-court motels with
white-painted wagon wheels out front and diners staffed by
waitresses who refilled your cup with coffee _ regular coffee _ and
called you ``honey.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, even the most modest American eating establishment
describes its fare ``with a sumptuousness and panache that are
seldom less than breathtaking and always incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a restaurant in rural Vermont, he writes, the evening's
special sounded to him like ``a crepe galette of sea chortle and
kelp in a rich mal de mer sauce ... baked in an inverted Prussian
helmet and layered with steamed wattle and woozle leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   What astounds him most about today's America is the giddying,
bounteous abundance of just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more than you cope with _ too many books to read, too
many movies and TV shows to see, more videos than you could ever
rent, more items in the stores than you can possibly keep track
of,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Britain ``still has this sense of austerity, like
the war has just finished: `Can't have too many ice cubes until all
the boys are home.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bryson was startled when his eldest son went out to look for a
summer job in Hanover and landed one the next day. ``There's a
dynamism and energy in American society that we take for granted
here, but it really is dazzling,'' he says. ``To a European, the
words, `Can you start tomorrow?' are just never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   With a gifted eye for the absurd, Bryson notes that life in
America is every bit as dangerous as Europeans imagine it to be _
in part because harm lurks where it's least expected.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from the Statistical Abstract of the United States'
figures on injuries from consumer products, he notes that last year
``paper money and coins (30,274) claimed nearly as many victims as
did scissors (34,062). I can just about conceive of how you might
swallow a dime and then wish you hadn't (`You guys want to see a
neat trick?'), but I cannot for the life of me construct
hypothetical circumstances involving folding money and a subsequent
trip to the E.R. It would be interesting to meet some of these
people.''

IN AN ADVERTISING SHIFT, SIX FLAGS IS TARGETING `MOM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN WOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Last year, ads for Six Flags Over Texas
showed a long-haired kid in a T-shirt running toward a trash can
while music from ``Chariots of Fire'' played. As his friends
cheered him on, the boy threw up in the trash can after getting off
a thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   This year, grunge boy has been replaced with Disney-esque images
of children meeting Bugs Bunny and Foghorn Leghorn. There is
footage of roller coasters and stage shows and a singer urges
viewers to ``discover the magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of targeting teens and young adults in its ads, Six
Flags, like other businesses, is now aiming at the ultimate
guardian of the purse strings: Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Although the teen market is big _ teen-agers collectively spent
more than $141 billion last year, according to Teenage Research
Unlimited in Northbrook, Ill. _ the family market is bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Families with children ages 2 to 12 spent nearly $500 billion in
1998, said Traci Blanks, senior vice president of marketing for
Premier Parks, which owns and operates Six Flags Theme Parks. And
it's Mom who makes many of the spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moms have a major say in the family's activities,'' Blanks
said. ``So we advertise a lot to moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as important is the loyalty of the family customer base,
she said. ``They are not as fickle as the teen market is,'' Blanks
said. ``I think Nike found out how fickle that market can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike watched its sales plummet when teen-agers' ardor for its
shoes cooled, sending its stock price down and the company
searching for new products. Other companies also have experienced
the perils of marketing to teen-agers. Gadzooks, a Carrolton,
Texas, clothing company, watched its stock price plummet 80
percent, from a 52-week high of almost $30 per share to a little
more than $10 a share when teen-agers snubbed its private-label
line.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags parks found out firsthand about those perils last
year. Premier targeted teens and young adults with its ``You In or
You Out'' campaign. When attendance sagged at Six Flags parks,
Premier quickly returned to its traditional core audience,
marketing to families, and attendance rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premier has always been focused on family,'' said Gary Slade,
publisher of Amusement Today, an industry trade publication based
in Arlington. ``It's an important core. It gives you your base for
annual attendance. Then you can put the teens and the tourists on
top of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the amusement and entertainment industry have also
increasingly focused on marketing to the women who control the
family purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   One of Six Flags Over Texas' neighbors, the Texas Rangers,
unveiled a series of commercials this year designed to appeal to
women. ``Women control our leisure time in the entertainment
industry,'' Charlie Serapahin, vice president of marketing for the
Rangers, said recently. ``It is only logical to target our message
to the person who makes the entertainment decisions in the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags focuses on two things when marketing to Mom: value and
image.
</P>
<P>
   It has been hammering home the value message with season-pass
ads.''We've had a huge increase in season pass purchases across the
company,'' Blanks said. ``Most of our families are season-pass
holders.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, Blanks said, the season pass lets families visit
the park for three to four hours at a time and still feel like they
are getting their money's worth. Families who visit once a year
tend to feel like they have to spend an entire day to make it worth
their while.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a warm and friendly family image with a sense of
tradition is also important, Six Flags officials said. One theme is
the ``Magic of Six Flags'' and another ad, ``street party,''
focuses on the park's Texas heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Flags Over Texas is a tradition,'' said James Geiser, vice
president of marketing for the park. ``In the ads, you're watching
kids have a great time. It pulls on more of the emotional
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If all we showed is Batman the Ride, we'd be putting our eggs
in one basket,'' Geiser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Flags has built a reputation for thrills,'' Blanks said.
``But we believe thrill will mean different things to different
people. It is just as thrilling for a little girl to meet Tweety
Bird as it is for someone to ride Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   So one ad combines images of children meeting Looney Tunes
characters with some of the more thrilling rides like Batman, the
Texas Giant and the Flashback.

OLD LOOK FOR THE MODERN KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The kitchen has evolved into a very high-tech
environment, but many homeowners are adding a warm touch, by
stepping back to an earlier time and using natural materials, such
as stone.
</P>
<P>
   Granite and soapstone sinks were popular in 19th-century
farmhouses and Victorian town houses. Many of these hand-carved
sinks can still be found in older homes or historic parts
warehouses, or they can be purchased new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a few hundred soapstone sinks every year,'' said Glenn
Bowman, owner of Vermont Soapstone in Perkinsville, Vt. ``They can
be custom-manufactured in any size and cost approximately $800 to
$1,200 for an average-size sink. They are all constructed so that
the apron of the sink can be exposed. You find a lot of soapstone
sinks in butler's pantries and turn-of-the-century Victorians.''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Stone Forest in Santa Fe, N.M., has been making a
variety of innovative hand-carved granite elements for the home,
from garden ornaments to fountains and sinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stone sinks have been popular for about eight to nine years
now,'' said Peter Singdahlsen, manager of Stone Forest. ``But they
are not just limited to older home restorations, they are being
purchased for high-end homes, including luxury condominiums. This
type of sink lends itself to a wide range of styles, from adobe to
Victorian. Our farmhouse sink is modeled after a traditional
European design.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmhouse sink can be installed as a top mount, which sits
on top of the cabinetry, or as a self-rimming unit, where it's
recessed into the counter, which can also be of matching granite.
Sinks are available with a rough front apron, polished (or rough)
rim and polished basin. Stone Forest sinks, which are all made from
Asian granite, cost approximately $850 for a single bowl (175
pounds) to $1,400 for a double basin (330 pounds). Colors for Stone
Forest sinks are beige granite, rose, blue/gray and black (which is
a special order and $200 extra).
</P>
<P>
   Granite sinks are sealed with a stone tile sealer prior to
shipping and require resealing once a year. Any high-quality tile
cleaner can be used to remove hard-water deposits. Stone sinks are
made to accept most disposal drain assemblies and fixtures.

   DALLAS _ Glance into the stands at Reunion Arena, and they're
everywhere, screaming themselves hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   They're fervent followers of the Dallas Stars, cheering goalie
Ed Belfour's saves and chewing out the referees when defenseman
Derian Hatcher is sent to the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   They're wearing more green than the Irish on St. Patty's Day,
waving pompons and rally towels with abandon and comparing notes on
stick handling and power plays.
</P>
<P>
   Who are they? It's ``the girls,'' guys.
</P>
<P>
   Ice hockey has made ardent fans of many females, who say they
find the sport's aggressive action appealing and the game a
family-oriented affair with role models who haven't run afoul of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars battle the Buffalo Sabres in the Stanley Cup
Finals, the fans' interest only grows. The Stars lead the
best-of-seven series, two games to one, with Game 4 scheduled for
Tuesday night in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy game to understand,'' said Jean Nicolosi, 50, of
Flower Mound, who attended Game 2 on Thursday with her
daughter-in-law, Stephanie Nicolosi, 29. ``There's so much more
action, and you're part of the action. Maybe that's the thing _
it's more intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   But hockey has done more than turn women into statistic-spouting
fans who wile away the hours debating right-winger Brett Hull's
slap shot and Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek's shot-blocking ability.
</P>
<P>
   More women are taking to the ice to play on amateur women's
teams, such as the Dallas Banshees, an organization that just a
short time ago had trouble persuading women to pick up a stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Banshees, they play an extremely good game,'' said Jimmy
Newby, a retired Dallas truck driver who coaches the team. ``Their
skating abilities are phenomenal. Women are so meticulous about
getting it right. They're passing and shooting as good as any
player I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is viewed by many as a female-friendly sport,
particularly after Manon Rheaume briefly played goaltender for the
Tampa Bay Lightning in 1992, becoming the first woman to play in
one of the four major U.S. professional sports leagues. The
gold-medal success of the U.S. women's Olympic hockey team at the
1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan, also brought a higher profile to
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   National Hockey League research shows that women comprise 42
percent to 43 percent of arena attendance during hockey games,
which is about the same percentage of women attending major-league
baseball games but higher than that attending football or
basketball games, said Bernadette Mansur, the NHL's vice president
of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skill and the finesse, the quickness of the skating, the
color of the game ... it all appeals to them,'' said Mansur, adding
that 55 percent of employees in the league's New York City
headquarters are women.
</P>
<P>
   Some women said they like hockey because it seems more
family-oriented and fan-friendly than other professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, for the Dallas Stars at least, they seem to have more
of a family organization,'' said Janice Fallin, 40, a longtime
hockey fan and member of the Stars booster club who drives a green
car covered with the win-loss records from the Stars' postseason
play. ``That comes across somehow through the players and the way
they represent themselves. I think maybe that end of it is more
attractive to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallin said her feelings toward the players are maternal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for me, the way I feel about the Dallas Stars is
they're my babies,'' Fallin said. ``It's like a female tiger
defending her cubs. I don't have kids, but they're like sons or
brothers. I'm very protective of them.''
</P>
<P>
   While many women are content to experience hockey from the
stands, USA Hockey, an amateur hockey organization, reports that
more women are playing the game. Since the organization, which is
based in Colorado Springs, Colo., began tracking female
participation in the 1990-91 season, female membership in hockey
has increased 330 percent and the number of registered women's and
girls' teams has increased 619 percent, according to NHL figures.
</P>
<P>
   Newby's daughter, Melissa, 20, a University of Texas at
Arlington student, said she first became interested in hockey
during junior high, when her parents started taking her to
minor-league games. She learned to skate and started playing with
the Dallas Junior Hockey Association, where she was one of only two
or three girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forced me to learn a lot really quick,'' said Melissa
Newby, who now plays for the Banshees. ``A lot of the guys had been
playing longer. They were bigger than me. They actually hit you a
lot harder when you're a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving resident Scarlett Chambers, 26, another Banshees player,
said that although she initially struggled to get other women
interested in the sport, the team now has a player list of about 70
women, who range in age from 19 to 50, including one grandmother.
About 20 are part of the competitive team, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to get enough interest so we can have a
league,'' said Chambers, whose team traveled to Bethany, Okla.,
last weekend for a tournament. ``We want people so we can play
ladies on ladies. We play against the guys, and they get all
nasty.''

<P>
   As warm and wonderful as it feels to bask under the rays of the
summer sun, it is not very good for the body. In my teen-age years,
we had tanning contests to see who could get the darkest the
fastest. In my 20s, I slathered my bikini-clad body in baby oil to
attract as many tanning rays as I could in the little time I had
for sunbathing. Now, decades later, when I look at the spotted skin
that has begun to wrinkle on my arms and legs, I cannot help
wishing I had known then what I know now.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Americans still precede the word ``tan'' with
``healthy,'' it is anything but. A tan, which results from the
formation of the pigment melanin in skin cells called melanocytes,
is the body's attempt to defend itself against sun damage.
</P>
<P>
   Melanin absorbs some of the incoming rays to keep them from
harming other cells. But this protection is far from complete. I
only hope that by protecting my skin from further sun damage I will
not end up like my my grandmother, who lived on a beach and whose
skin resembled elephant hide by the time she reached 70.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, we all should know better, but I still see
sunbathers galore, mostly teen-agers and young adults and a fair
number of baby boomers minimally clad and well greased as they seek
a so-called ``healthy tan.'' Because it is unlikely that sun-loving
Americans will suddenly take to the shade, pharmaceutical and skin
care companies have come up with a host of new products that can
help to minimize _ though not eliminate _ the damage of sun
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   By now everyone knows that it is ultraviolet, or UV, rays that
both tan and damage the skin. The wavelengths of concern are UVB
(290 to 320 nanometers) and shorter and longer UVA (320 to 400
nanometers). The atmosphere's ozone layer blocks another type, UVC
(200 to 290 nanometers), as well as large amounts of UVB. But the
closer the sun is to the earth's surface and the more degraded the
ozone layer, the more UVB gets through.
</P>
<P>
   Although UVB has long been recognized as the cause of sunburns
and superficial skin cancers called basal-cell carcinomas, recent
studies have implicated it as a cause of melanoma, the most serious
form of skin cancer, as well. One or two blistering sunburns early
in life can greatly increase the risk of developing a potentially
fatal melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Also, those who are exposed to occasional bursts of sunlight,
like indoor workers who spend weekends and vacations in the sun,
appear to be at greater risk of melanoma than people who are
continuously exposed, like farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   However, farmers and fishermen and others who are always in the
sun get many basal-cell carcinomas on exposed parts of their
bodies. The fairer the skin, the more prone people are to
developing superficial skin cancers. A blond, blue-eyed friend just
had 14 of these lesions removed from his face and back. Though not
as deadly as melanoma, these cancers can eventually spread if not
removed, a process that can leave noticeable scars, especially on
the face.
</P>
<P>
   UVA radiation may also be implicated in cancer. It can damage
the genes, especially a tumor suppressor gene called p-53, and
impair the workings of the immune system. But the damage it most
commonly causes is premature aging of the skin, or photoaging:
wrinkled, leathery skin pockmarked with brown spots.
</P>
<P>
   The longer rays of UVA can penetrate the deeper layers of the
skin where they degrade the elastic fibers and collagen that keep
the skin smooth and firm. If you would like to know how young your
skin would look had it not been repeatedly exposed to UVA, check
your buttocks. Or compare the skin on the outside of your arms with
the side against your body.
</P>
<P>
   People who frequent tanning salons are assaulting their skin
with high doses of UVA radiation. UVA can also penetrate window
glass, including car windows. It passes through water and it is
released as well from fluorescent and halogen bulbs. Unlike UVB,
which is more intense in summer, at midday and at higher altitudes,
UVA radiation is much less affected by season, time of day or
altitude. It is present all day year-round everywhere and it
represents more than 90 percent of the UV radiation that reaches
the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone shopping for skin protection products is bound to be
confused. Labels state sun protection factors, or SPF, ranging from
4 to 60 and make claims like ``waterproof,'' ``water resistant,''
``sweat proof,'' ``all-day protection,'' ``complete protection''
and ``total sunblock.'' New regulations, which the Skin Cancer
Foundation worries will further confuse the public, will create
only three categories ``minimal'' (SPF 2 to 12), ``moderate'' (12
to 30) and ``high'' sunburn protection (30 or more).
</P>
<P>
   The first fact worth noting is that the rating refers only to
the product's ability to reduce exposure to UVB radiation.
Laboratory tests using liberal amounts of the product reveal how
much longer a person may be protected from sunburn than if no
sunscreen were applied. Thus, if you would normally burn in 20
minutes in the sun, using a product with an SPF rating of 15 would
theoretically keep you from burning for five hours.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are three important limitations. One, to be most
effective, sunscreens should be applied half an hour before
exposure. Second, most people do not apply nearly enough sunscreen
to achieve laboratory levels of protection. The amount an
average-size adult in a bathing suit should use is one ounce per
application, repeated every few hours. The way most people use
sunscreen the rating would be only half or less what the label
states, so you would be wise to choose a product with high sunburn
protection. Third, unless you use a product that offers good
protection against both UVB and UVA radiation, even if you do not
burn, you will be exposing your skin to a lot of UVA damage.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than two dozen new products available that offer
more complete UV protection. These contain either micronized zinc
oxide or titanium oxide or Parsol 1789 (avobenzone). Other products
containing benzophenone also reduce exposure to UVA but not as
effectively, studies have indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Women who wear face makeup would be wise to choose a product
that offers such protection, and everyone who is in the sun even
sporadically during the day can benefit from the use of a face
lotion that offers UVA and UVB protection; it should be applied
liberally and reapplied whenever the face is washed. Also apply a
lip balm with full protection repeatedly throughout the day. Note,
however, that it is not yet known whether products containing
vitamin E, vitamin C or other antioxidants enhance their sun
protection value.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best way to avoid sun damage is to stay out of it
as much as possible. When in the sun, wear a hat with a brim at
least three inches wide and protect your eyes with sunglasses (UV
light can cause cataracts). Relax in the shade, but since UV rays
scatter, use sunscreen even if you are under an awning or beach
umbrella. And, whenever possible, cover your skin with clothing.

CLINTON'S DIRECTION ON MENTAL ILLNESS IS THE RIGHT ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While growing up in a small town in Northeast Texas, I had one
persistent fear: that my mother would do something outrageous to
embarrass me.
</P>
<P>
   This fear was justified with devastating regularity.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time, for example, that I was playing touch
football with friends in my front yard. A stranger from out of town
stopped to ask for directions. For no apparent reason, my mother
stormed out of the house and cussed a blue streak at the man. I
stood there, red-faced and petrified, as my friends watched with
mouths agape.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my most terrifying moments came when my mother was
driving our Plymouth sedan and suddenly went into her A.J. Foyt
mode. When angered by something, and that was often, she could
instantly transform a 30 mph residential street into an 80 mph
autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   When in such a rage, she might pull up beside another car at a
stoplight, glare at its occupants and repeatedly honk her horn in a
menacing fashion. Some cowed individuals literally ran a red light
to escape her. I would bow my head in shame, waiting for my
mother's inexplicable fit to subside. Her local nickname was
``Runnin' Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, my mother spent much of her time sitting, staring
detachedly into space and slowly puffing a cigarette. She often
complained incoherently that our home was plagued by people trying
to ``line in'' controlling thoughts through telephone wires.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, Mary Elizabeth Swint Smith _ whose initials
ironically spelled ``M.E.S.S.'' _ was classified by the doctors as
``paranoid schizophrenic.''
</P>
<P>
   I can remember, with great sadness, visiting her in the stark
setting of a state mental hospital when I was in the fifth grade.
Years later, tears would stream down my cheeks as I watched movies
such as ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' or ``A Woman Under the
Influence,'' films that vividly depicted the tragedy of mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with no small pleasure that I read this past week how
President Clinton and Tipper Gore hosted a White House conference
at which they outlined various initiatives to help the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton notified the 285 health plans used by federal employees
that they must provide the same degree of insurance coverage for
mental illness and substance abuse as for other health problems. He
urged other employers to provide similar coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance plans provide more limited coverage for mental
illnesses than other health problems. And many people lack health
insurance or are reluctant to seek professional help because of the
stigma associated with mental illness. That helps explain why many
mentally ill people populate our homeless shelters and jails.
</P>
<P>
   There are staggering public misperceptions about mental illness.
These illnesses are not caused by weaknesses in personality or an
inadequate upbringing, as some believe. Mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia and severe depression are caused by defects in the
way chemicals transmit messages within the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Most mentally ill people can benefit greatly from medication and
psychotherapy. Many, provided with such help, hold jobs and lead
near-normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peggy Bailey, a psychologist and board president of the
Mental Health Association of Tarrant County, Texas, says more
understanding is needed to foster public support for the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response to a woman who has been diagnosed with breast
cancer is profound and comforting and deeply sympathetic,'' she
said. ``We don't find, for the mentally ill or for their families,
that type of response when there is a diagnosis of mental illness.
I think that would make a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Clinton's call for more parity in insurance coverage
for mental illness is ``wonderful.'' Access to good medical care is
``critical,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mental illness can destroy families. My mother's schizophrenia
contributed mightily to my parents' divorce when I was in junior
high. It crushed me when my dad remarried and moved to another
town. My mother was unemployable. My two brothers and I suffered
jolting financial and emotional hardships in my high school years.
</P>
<P>
   For most of my mother's adult life, she refused to take
medication that would have helped her (like many schizophrenics,
she was convinced that nothing was wrong with her). For 17 years, I
was her legal guardian, coping with some incredibly trying
situations as she continued declining mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of her life, we finally coaxed her into moving
150 miles from our hometown, Mount Pleasant, to an excellent
nursing home in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   She began taking medication, ate better and regularly visited
me, my wife and our two daughters. I recall her happily tapping her
feet to Frank Sinatra tapes I bought her and chatting with my
daughters, whom she came to greatly love. In that period before her
death in 1993, her true nature _ that of a gentle and incredibly
kind human being _ revealed itself as never before.
</P>
<P>
   In her early years, my mother was an attractive and bright young
woman, a Baylor University graduate who enjoyed good books and
loved the Big Band music of her generation. Then the curse of
schizophrenia struck in her late 20s. She would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   If family members and others had better understood her
condition, and if she had received better medical care, she could
have coped far, far better with the illness. Her life didn't have
to be the tragedy that it became.
</P>
<P>
   That's just as true today for the millions of Americans who
suffer from mental illness, many of whom are not receiving the full
help and understanding that they so desperately need.

HOCKEY NEOPHYTES JUMPING ON STARS' BANDWAGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey mania has struck deep and hard in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There's the neighbor who doesn't know icing from high-sticking
but who, nevertheless, flies a Stars flag. The friends who are
suddenly hunkering down for hours in front of their TVs or who
dicker with scalpers for expensive seats.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to explain, says historian Jerry Rodnitzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to identify with a winner,'' said Rodnitzky, who
teaches a course on 20th century popular culture at the University
of Texas at Arlington. ``I think it's a pretty common cultural
phenomenon in America.''
</P>
<P>
   And folks aren't embarrassed in the least to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm watching because they're winning,'' said Meredith
Mangum, 21, a Texas Christian University student and hostess at the
Blue Mesa Grill, who hasn't missed a game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it's a windfall for the Stars and the
networks that broadcast the games.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, Fox's television station KDFW/Channel
4 was lucky when the team drew more than 5 percent of the area's
viewing population. Tuesday night's broadcast of the first Stanley
Cup Finals game attracted 26.7 percent of the population and a 42
percent share of people who had their sets on, said Andy Alexander,
the station's vice president of research.
</P>
<P>
   But Nielsen and Co. might have missed Elaine Green.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old postal clerk in Bedford got so nervous, she
switched channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work so hard to get (the puck) down there, and then it's
gone,'' explained Green, who has never attended a game but misses
few on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Hordes of eager newcomers to the sport are just fine with the
team, which has seen 80,000 miniature, green-and-black Star flags
snapped up and displayed like it was a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of making fans, as opposed to getting
existing fans more excited,'' said Jeff Cogen, the Stars' vice
president of marketing and promotion since 1993. ``And it's clearly
easier when you're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The craze hits at a time when North Texas has been quietly but
heavily infiltrated by Yankee transplants. Many have been hooking
unsuspecting natives on the often violent contact sport for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great group to watch with, all our kids and
friends,'' said Wisconsin-born Rhea Noggle, who moved to the area
13 years ago and owns a skin care and ``body contouring'' business,
Ultimate Image, in Roanoke. ``I've always been a hockey fan and was
so glad when the Stars got here,'' the Trophy Club resident said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hockey zealots is Curtis Bogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk about it with the kids on my youth baseball team that I
coach,'' acknowledged Bogan, 42, of Fort Worth. ``I'm an old Iowan,
and I began following them in Minnesota when they were the good ol'
North Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hockey, more than a particular Dallas team, that
intrigues Bogan, insists his 14-year-old son, Robert, who is not a
Stars fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves hockey. He just doesn't like the Stars,'' the son
said of his father. ``He tends to follow players more than teams,
and the players he likes are not on the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even electronic geeks are pulling themselves away from their
computers long enough to form an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Al Chia's colleagues at Texas Instruments in Dallas can't stop
discussing the Stanley Cup competition, he said. It's reached the
point where ``we're planning our work schedule around games so we
can watch them,'' the 28-year-old engineering technician added.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Medina, 34, of North Richland Hills, works at night but
doesn't let his job keep him from following the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security guards have it on television,'' said Medina, an
employee at a Dillard's distribution center in Fort Worth. ``And
the drivers tell us what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Abernathy is an American Airlines pilot from Southlake who
acknowledges that he's following the Stars mainly because they're
in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abernathy said he was moved Tuesday night when, heading
into Minneapolis from Chicago, an air traffic controller told him
the results of the game between the Sabres and the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I just thought you would want to know that our Stars
lost in overtime,''' Abernathy said. ``I was kind of touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are just as willing to admit that they're fair-weather
fans, in it to share the heightened drama and the glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those playoff watchers,'' conceded Al Gonzales, 48,
owner of Grapevine's Main Street Barber Shop.
</P>
<P>
   But two colleagues _ Deanna Mesi, a Buffalo, N.Y., native, and
Mike Flores, a Houston native _ are serious enough to gamble more
than money on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Sabres win, Mike has to have a Buffalo emblem shaved
into the back of his head,'' Gonzales said. ``If Buffalo loses,
Deanna has to shave a star into her head. Everybody is excited
about the bet. The customers are really into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Armey, 30, a Denton County commissioner, insists that he's
been a diehard fan since the Stars moved to Dallas. But, still,
there's nothing like the Stanley Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys have been in Super Bowls, but the Super Bowls
haven't been in Dallas,'' said Armey, who was still hoarse after
yelling during Game 2. ``The Mavericks and Rangers haven't reached
their finals. This is the championship and it's right here in
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   There's remarkable candor among the newly frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the South, and this is relatively new to me,'' said
Mike Conrads, 38, of Southlake. ``I've watched a few games through
the season, but what has really gotten me excited is the
playoffs.''

TWO TEXAS BANDS WITH TIES TO SELENA HOPE TO ROCK THE SIZZLING LATIN
CROSSOVER SCENE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Chris Perez is standing in an upstairs lobby of the
Doubletree Hotel, reluctantly waiting to take his place during an
impromptu photo shoot. He smiles warily, plays with his fingers
nervously and looks around the room.
</P>
<P>
   An instant later, he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   A quick escape would seem a likely move for the admittedly shy
musician, but something has caught Perez's eye in a nearby hotel
laundry room. He sticks a quarter into the video game and takes his
mark. For a few minutes, Perez is transfixed by the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Though Perez's eyes still seem pained, even scarred by some
incomprehensible hurt, this is clearly not the same man who, just a
few years ago, hovered in the shadows while the media devoured
every bit of information about his late wife, Tejano superstar
Selena.
</P>
<P>
   Since Selena was murdered in 1995 by her fan club president,
Yolanda Saldivar, Perez and the Quintanilla family have relived
countless moments of joy and pain, thanks to a big-screen movie, a
flood of books, news reports and a seemingly endless catalog of
unreleased Selena music. (A recent-hits collection was certified
gold, proving the public still loves its Corpus Christi princess.)
</P>
<P>
   Selena's brother, AB Quintanilla III, has forged ahead musically
with AB Quintanilla y Los Kumbia Kings. The eight-member group
continues the fusion of cumbia, pop, reggae, rap and rhythm and
blues that helped put Selena on the map; its debut album, ``Amor,
Familia y Respeto,'' was released in March on EMI Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's own musical aspirations didn't vanish when his wife
died. He was a guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos, and now he returns
to music with the Chris Perez Band. The bilingual rock outfit
includes vocalist John Garza, keyboardist and former Dino Joe
Ojeda, bassist Adriel Ramirez and drummer Jorge Palacios. The
band's debut album, ``Resurrection,'' was released May 18 by
Hollywood Records. It features production from Julian Raymond, who
has worked with Fastball and the Wallflowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the CD's out, I'm really excited that people are
going to be able to find out who we really are,'' Perez, 29, said.
``I think with the media, a lot of the hype surrounding the movie
and these unauthorized books and whatever else, the focus of who I
really am as a person got shifted. They relate to the person in the
movie, they relate to the person in books. Sometimes I feel it's
been forgotten that, first and foremost, I'm a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Perez has read and written music since the age of 10,
and he played piano, French horn, B-flat horn, trumpet and snare
drum throughout his school years. He played in various rock and
Tejano bands before landing a spot with Selena y Los Dinos in the
early '90s. With Selena's death, however, Perez earned a new title:
widower.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing guitar at age 15, that was an awakening
of sorts. That was a way to express myself _ through that or
through the craft of songwriting,'' Perez said. ``I think all that
kind of was forgotten about, and I was just a widower. I'm more
than that. It's something I went through and all that, but it just
kind of seems to bring about all these dark feelings. I hope ...
maybe not that (the public) will forget about that, but it won't be
the first words out of their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   To help the process along, Perez and his band embarked on a
promotional tour that includes English and Spanish radio events and
in-store appearances in California, Florida, Illinois, Puerto Rico
and throughout Texas. A complete list of tour dates will be
announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exciting,'' Perez said. ``I've never been to any
rock stations, so to speak, in English, to do interviews and stuff.
It's something new to me, and I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two singles from ``Resurrection'' have been simultaneously
released. The scorching, shades-of-Santana title track is receiving
airplay on modern and mainstream rock radio, and the ballad ``Por
Que Te Fuiste?'' has been shipped to Latin pop radio stations.
Perez said the results have been unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they (rock stations) were going to be so
receptive of the music,'' Perez said. ``I just thought that we were
going to get a little bit more support from Tejano radio, but then
again, we're not playing Tejano. It's a business, and we're still
trying to find our place.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to ``Resurrection'' began in 1996, when Perez finally
decided that music _ specifically ``rock en espanol'' _ was
something he still wanted to pursue. He had been toying with the
idea before that, but he hadn't felt that the time was right for
him to venture back into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything happened with Selena, I couldn't. ... A
couple of months went by before I even picked up a guitar. Once I
did again, it wasn't the same,'' Perez said. ``It took me a while
to get back into the groove and start writing again and start
expressing myself in that way. Once that happened, everything just
kind of fell into place, almost like I was guided in this
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   During this time Perez met Garza, a local singer in Corpus
Christi. They began writing songs together for fun, with no
intention of forming a band or landing a record deal. Garza also
introduced Perez to Venessa Villanueva. The pair has been together
for more than two years and have a 4-month-old daughter, Cassie.
It's a fact Perez is content with, despite the rumors and
chastising he's received from fans and press.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've been through already with the media,
sensational-type media especially, I don't think they can say
anything that's going to shock me, that's going to hurt me, that's
going to make me angry,'' Perez said. ``I refuse to let my private
life be affected by that. I've been there, done that with Selena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to play the game. I lay my cards out on the table.
There's still my private life that I keep to myself, but I'm not
going to deny that I have a girlfriend and that I have a beautiful
baby and that I'm happy just to sell more albums. If people accept
it, cool. If they don't, too bad. I'm not here to please them all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As Perez and Garza's songwriting became more serious, the rest
of the group fell into place. They headed to Los Angeles in
November 1996 to cut a few demos and shop them around to labels.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, it was hard, man,'' Perez said. ``They were
willing to listen to it, but back then what was happening on the
chart was real ballad-types. You had your Enrique Iglesias ballads,
Ricky Martin ballads, Luis Miguel ballads ... all the way down the
charts. I guess that's what (record) companies were looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved our music, so they said, but they didn't know where
to take it. We could have sat down and written a whole album of
ballads, but we just didn't want to do that. So we kind of took our
chances and stuck with what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The perseverance paid off when the band landed a meeting with
Bob Cavallo, chairman of the Buena Vista Music Group. Cavallo flew
to Austin to hear the band during a rehearsal, and they signed a
deal in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the public (and fans of Selena), Perez's choice to
play rock music comes as a surprise, despite his penchant for
guitar solos and his rock-star looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people out there who think I'm coming out
with a Tejano album,'' Perez said. ``I could've done that, but I
didn't even go there. I figured I'd played with the best. I don't
know if I'd be able to handle being up onstage playing Tejano music
and not having what I had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The album features six tracks in English and nine in Spanish,
which Perez says is a good representation of the band's music. It
also begs the question of crossover appeal, a factor Perez was
conscious of long before Martin was livin' ``la vida loca.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin explosion,'' Perez said, with a hint of sarcasm in
his voice. ``These guys that are considered part of the Latin
explosion, you know they've been doing it for years. They deserve
the exposure they're getting, but it just sounds like such an
overnight thing, and it's not that at all. It might be an explosion
to people in the English mainstream part of the industry, but it's
been there all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the frenzy, however, Perez feels one name has been left
out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be this intense or popular if Selena
hadn't come along, and I don't think I've heard her mentioned in
any of this Latin explosion thing,'' he said. ``Really, I think
she's the one who kicked the door open.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AB QUINTANILLA Y LOS KUMBIA KINGS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AB Quintanilla III is also hoping to fulfill the dream his
sister never did during her lifetime: to bring his music to
English-speaking fans.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be be such a faraway fantasy, given the Kumbia
Kings' youthful image and energetic sound. The group's debut album,
``Amor, Familia y Respeto,'' features old-school R&AMP;B, salsa and
cumbia rhythms. Guests on the album include Perez (who plays guitar
on the new single, ``Fuiste Mala''), Sheila E., R&AMP;B group Nu
Flavor, reggae star Vico-C. and late R&AMP;B singer Roger Troutman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album that I put together for Kumbia Kings is using just
basically the same formulas that I used with Selena,'' said
Quintanilla, calling from his Kat Kave Studios in Corpus Christi.
``Everything I am is because of (Selena), and for me, I'm just kind
of continuing what I did with her. I've got a guy singer (Jason
``DJ Kane'' Cano), but he's an R&AMP;B singer, real soulful, like
Selena, and I apply it to cumbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintanilla's formula seems to be working. Since the album's
release in late March, it has already sold more than 100,000 copies
_ an impressive number in the Tejano market. The group has an
upcoming show with Earth, Wind and Fire in El Paso, and Quintanilla
recently produced three tracks for Latin dance singer Angelina's
upcoming album, which features the Kumbia Kings. That's a
much-needed shot in the arm for the ever-shrinking Tejano market.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Selena passed away, (Tejano) kind of took a little
slump. I'm not saying that she was the whole heart of the market,
but at the same time, she was bringing a lot of attention to the
market, and it was spilling over to artists like Emilio and La
Mafia. But now, all the power bands have disappeared,'' said
Quintanilla. ``I can't say that Kumbia Kings are the answer or the
solution to the market, but I'm just trying my hardest to do my
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is you went from (Selena's No. 1 hits) ''Techno
Cumbia`` and ``Bidi Bidi Bom Bom`` and your real pop-oriented
cumbia back to block one, with norteo music. You turn on the Tejano
radio station now, and all you hear is accordion, song after
song.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintanilla, who is reluctant to admit his age, was born on a
Friday the 13th on an Indian reservation in Washington state, and
he grew up listening to the Eagles and Van Halen before being
turned on to Latin and Mexican music. It was that fusion of sounds
that helped create Selena y Los Dinos' unique style. Along with
older brother Quintanilla and husband Perez, the group featured
older sister Suzette on drums.
</P>
<P>
   Quintanilla has also shared his producing talents with
international artists, including Thalia, Olga Tanon, Christian and
Veronica Castro. His work with Selena, however, remains most
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a little area where I didn't even touch cumbia,
period,'' Quintanilla said. ``Everybody goes through their
reflection of life. You've got to keep in mind that ... she was my
world, man. That's who I got up every morning for, and that's who I
was dedicated to writing for and producing. Other artists had
asked, but that's who mattered to me in my life, and all of a
sudden one day, it's not there. You kind of wonder, what are you
going to do with yourself. I wasn't sure where I was going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Quintanilla decided was to stick with EMI Latin, the
label that was home to Selena y Los Dinos. He was looking around at
record labels before finally deciding to stay with something
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I didn't want to do was just follow everything
the same as what I did with Selena,'' Quintanilla said. ``I still
go to my dad for advice, and I got a call from (EMI president) Jose
Behar, and they both said, `Why not stay with your family?' I'm 100
percent happy with EMI. They're making all my dreams come true with
the Kumbia Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected surprise on ``Amor, Familia y Respeto'' is ``Oh
No,'' a song originally written in English by Selena and her
brother for her planned pop album. It may eventually be recorded in
its original version by dance diva Taylor Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just held onto the song, and I recorded it in cumbia,''
Quintanilla said. ``We wrote the song, and, unfortunately,
everything happened. I love the song, and it ended up on my
album.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that touch of a Tejano legacy, Quintanilla isn't trying
to replicate his sister's success. He hopes old fans and new
listeners tune into his sound simply because the music is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be another Selena. Chris or I aren't trying
to re-create a Selena y Los Dinos. That was part of our life, but I
think we have to work double hard because we're coming out of
something very big,'' Quintanilla said. ``People don't realize that
this doesn't make it any easier. It helps if you have the last name
Quintanilla and you're AB and you wrote the hits for Selena, but
people want to know, what are you offering them now? It's a totally
different ballgame.''

NEW DOCUMENTARY REVISITS PLAYERS OF `BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crowd on the Havana street corner gathers around the vintage
convertible. As the camera rolls, 91-year-old Cuban guitarist and
singer Compay Segundo asks for directions to the building that was
home to the Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   Several people remember the place. The problem is, their
memories don't all agree. One person points this way, one person
points that way. Before long, the amazingly spry Segundo is out of
the car, puffing on a cigar and offering his sage advice on how to
cure a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   The actual Buena Vista Social Club may be but a fading memory.
But the album inspired by that semimythic musical meeting place has
become an international sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Produced in Havana by American guitarist Ry Cooder, ``Buena
Vista Social Club'' has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide
since its 1997 release. The success of the album has revived the
careers of the half-forgotten legends of prerevolutionary Cuban
music who participated, including Segundo, pianist Ruben Gonzalez
and vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, acclaimed German filmmaker Wim Wenders has directed a
documentary to accompany the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about telling the stories of these people; that's the
important thing,'' Cooder says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is great, but you have to vibe off these people,
pick up on who they are and where they're from. And then you learn
something that the records don't get across. You learn something
about what it is to be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooder has approached his recording career with a musicologist's
delight in unearthing obscure and forgotten folk forms. In addition
to the Depression-era blues and country songs found on his first
albums, he's introduced the roots-rock audience to Flaco Jimenez's
Tex-Mex accordion, Gabby Pahinui's Hawaiian guitar and Ali Farka
Toure's West African griot-blues.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing had the impact of ``Buena Vista Social Club.'' Now
he says he's been spoiled when it comes to working with other
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great players,'' he says. ``They're among the best
there are.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie was shot when the film crew accompanied Cooder _ who
has done scores for several of Wenders' movies, including ``Paris,
Texas'' and ``The End of Violence'' _ on a return trip to Havana.
The purpose of the trip was to record a follow-up to ``Buena Vista
Social Club'' featuring Ferrer, whom Cooder describes as ``a Cuban
Nat `King' Cole.``
</P>
<P>
   (The album ``Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer''
was released last week. Like its predecessor, it was recorded for
the European World Circuit label and licensed by Nonesuch for
American distribution.)
</P>
<P>
   While in Havana, Wenders filmed the recording sessions with
Ferrer and taped interviews with key participants in the original
``Buena Vista Social Club'' recording.
</P>
<P>
   Segundo, looking dapper in a checked sport coat, ever-present
cigar in hand, explains that he has five children and is hard at
work on the sixth. Gonzalez recalls his glory days with Arsenio
Rodriguez, the most popular Cuban orchestra of the prerevolutionary
era. Ferrer, who was shining shoes when Cooder's Cuban advisers
tracked him down, explains his devotion to his guardian saint, or
``orisha.''
</P>
<P>
   What comes across is the way music flows through these men,
despite the hardships of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, we see ourselves as vehicles for consumption
so much of the time,'' Cooder says. ```How am I supposed to look?
What car am I supposed to drive? What do I do with myself?' It's
all out there on a menu for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing is to see somebody who you connect with,
just because they seem so interesting. They have this inner life in
them, and I think that's what's compelling about these people.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Wenders keeps his arty, avant-garde
tendencies in check, although he alternates between grainy
black-and-white, colorized and full-color film. The contrast
effectively conveys a sense of traveling back in time when visiting
Havana's older neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the way through the film, the focus shifts as the
crew joins the members of the Buena Vista Social Club on tour in
Holland and New York's Carnegie Hall. The latter trip results in
some comic exchanges, as the elderly Cuban musicians _ most of whom
had never been off the island _ argue about the true location of
the Statue of Liberty and the identities of the John F. Kennedy and
Marilyn Monroe busts seen in a storefront window.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film opens with one of the musicians cracking a
joke about Che Guevara letting Fidel Castro beat him at golf,
Wenders largely avoids political issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cooder says he has no idea how the Castro regime regards the
Buena Vista Social Club project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their priorities are pretty great. I mean, they've got to get
thermometers into the hospitals, they've got to fix the streets,
they've got to try to get enough food for everybody, trying to get
computers into the country. They've got terrible priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do comes in pretty low on their radar, and that's
good, because we can work and no one has to pay too much attention
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the revival of interest in prerevolutionary musical
forms, sparked by ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' has generated a
backlash among some of the more ardent young supporters of the
communist revolution. Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, a younger Cuban band
leader who served as Cooder's musical consultant on the project,
stood up at a press conference in Havana and defended the music as
an essential expression of Cuban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brave guy because this has not necessarily been
politically correct down there,'' Cooder says.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Cuban-Americans remain adamantly opposed to any
cultural exchange as long as Castro is in power, Cooder said the
response from the Cuban-American community generally has been
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban people in the United States like this music, because
they remember this music. At least I think they think that. It
seems like they do. In fact, I've heard some of them they say this
is our music. They have no hatred or resentment for these musicians
in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, this is a volatile situation in this
country, and you never can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Maneiro, a local political consultant and past president of
the Casa Cuba board that produces the annual Festival Cubano in
Houston, said it's difficult for non-Cubans to understand how many
Cuban-Americans feel about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that we're almost anti-Cuban because we're so
steadfastly opposed to any kind of interaction with the Castro
government. So far as the musicians and filmmakers are concerned,
they're just doing what artists do, making art. But they're
allowing themselves to be used as propaganda by the government to
help soften its image,'' Maneiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Maneiro was born in Cuba and moved to Houston in 1972 when he
was 2 years old. He said he's heard the ``Buena Vista Social Club''
album and liked it, but he doesn't own a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're all great fans of the music. The only problem
I have with it is that it only presents one side of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ricardo, a local Cuban musician and music programmer for
Festival Cubano, said he thinks it's great that the ``Buena Vista
Social Club'' album and movie are introducing new fans to Cuban
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fantastic that they're able to travel abroad.
It's all Cuban music, whether it's done in Cuba or Miami or
wherever. I don't think we should bring politics into the
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of the Buena Vista Social Club, the key members
have been in demand for individual live appearances in Europe.
Cooder says Ferrer and Gonzalez are planning a joint U.S. tour in
the fall, operating under nonprofit rules for cultural exchange
between the U.S. and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cooder said he doesn't know how the increasing international
interest in Cuban music will impact the country's internal
political situation. But he hopes the cultural bond eventually will
help bring Cuban people together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the only way you're going to
reunite the diasporic Cubans and the national Cubans of Cuba is
through cultural identity. And what symbolizes that culture, more
than anything else, has got to be the music.''

TOTALLY GERMAINE: GREER IS ANGRY ALL OVER AGAIN IN FOLLOW-UP
TO  `FEMALE EUNUCH' 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An unlit Gitane in one hand and a glass of
champagne in the other, Germaine Greer is singing the Spice Girls'
``Stop'' in her rich, smoke-damaged Australian alto: ``Stop right
now/ Thank you very much/ I need somebody with a human touch.''
Laughing, she flops onto the couch of her hotel room and lights her
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite an interesting song,'' she says. ``It's saying,
`Just climb off. This may be hot, but it's inhuman. Just go.' The
Spice Girls get more interesting the more you listen to them. Quite
complex attitudes. They're a package, but what in the 1990s
isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's publishers have been trying to package the mercurial
author for almost 30 years, ever since her groundbreaking 1971
treatise on women's liberation, ``The Female Eunuch,'' became an
international best-seller and transformed her from a firebrand
academic into the most influential and controversial feminist since
Simone de Beauvoir.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's ignited a new controversy by doing what she swore she
never would: writing a sequel. ``The Whole Woman,'' published last
month by Alfred A. Knopf, re-examines many of the same topics as
``The Female Eunuch'' from a distinctly '90s perspective and with a
fresh dose of anger.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area as part of a promotional tour, Greer, an elegant
60 with gray eyes that match her gray suit, says she was compelled
to write ``The Whole Woman'' when she determined that younger
feminists weren't addressing the fact that so-called equality
hadn't translated into liberation. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``It just cut me to the ventricles to see that they were still
caring about the same s_: `You hurt me. You hurt me so much that I
become anorexic and tear my skin over you,''' she says, knitting
her brow and smoking fiercely. ``I thought, `Damn! Why is this
happening?' When I wrote `The Female Eunuch,' I thought women's
emotionalism was a sign of weakness or abjectness. But it won't go
away. We talk and talk and try to beef up women's independence, and
they're still being gutted by the same old knives. Now I've come to
the conclusion that we should just accept that. It's who we are.
We'll always be the ones who give a s_.''
</P>
<P>
   As a professor of English and comparative literary studies at
England's Warwick University, Greer has had ample opportunity to
watch young women mature and, in some cases, crash and burn, bogged
down by the weight of what Greer calls ``the same old crap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently I was giving prizes to a sixth-form class that had
just graduated from high school,'' she says. ``And up came all
these students with double-A grades with their little Ally McBeal
sparrow hands and little sparrow legs. They're my best students and
high achievers and completely anorexic. Then another bunch of girls
came up, and they were enormous. They came up clumping, walking
with their feet apart and making a big play out of being clumsy and
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two are opposite sides of the same coin, these two sorts
of people who are both apologizing for themselves. What I didn't
see was a girl who was just healthy, strong and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer sighs. ``It made me want to bang my head against the wall.
This is nonsense. It's not just to do with boys or fashion. It's
got a lot more to do with being full of anger and hostility and
having no way of expressing it. So they tear themselves to
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer was born in Australia and educated by Irish nuns before
pulling up stakes to attend England's Cambridge University. When
she wasn't living the academic life, she explored the fields of
'60s pop culture, hanging out with rock bands and chronicling her
adventures with the same boldly sexual approach that later ignited
a maelstrom of debate with ``The Female Eunuch.''
</P>
<P>
   An unabashed attack on sexual mores and feminine conventions,
the book got Greer labeled everything from ``a super heroine'' by
Vogue magazine to ``a bad feminist'' by peers within the women's
movement. The praise and furor calmed to some degree with the
publication of her later, less polemical books, including a
literary study on Shakespeare, a rumination on absent fathers and a
reassessment of menopause titled ``Change: Women, Aging and the
Menopause.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, on the cusp of more controversy, Greer says she's
disappointed in the way the sexual revolution gave men carte
blanche to pursue their passions while leaving women stranded in a
double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested to know just where women's bodies are going to
end up in the current panoply of pornography,'' she says. ``Do you
know they have cyber granny porn now? I wonder if I should pop in
there to get a few pointers. Maybe I could post a notice: Good
conversationalist seeks young, stupid stud.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who was briefly married in the '60s, is in the process of
recovering from a love affair that ended tumultuously shortly
before her book tour began. ``You have to eventually get to a point
where you just let each other live,'' she says with a shrug. ``And
passionate, stupid woman that I am, I never learned how to do that.
So I'm always the knock-down, drag-out mistress and never a
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   She chuckles and takes a long draught of champagne. ``God, I've
spent my whole f_ing life studying men, and they're still a mystery
to me. I'm sick of myself, really. I'm heterosexual to the point of
being a total pervert.''

OKANAGAN VALLEY SERVES ACCLAIMED VINTAGES AND A BANQUET OF
DIVERSIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKANAGAN VALLEY, British Columbia _ Labels on bottles at Gray
Monk Estate Winery reveal the first clue that folks in Canada's
Okanagan Valley eschew formality and relish a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, here's Pinot Noir. Merlot. Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   And Kerner.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Named for Doc Kerner from our old hometown in Germany,''
explains Gray Monk founder-owner George Heiss. ``He was a poet, a
doctor and the town drunk. And he chased everything that had a
pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   Any surprise that Kerner is a very dry wine? (It's also quite
tasty.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, mosey on down Highway 97 from Okanagan Center to Peachland
and pause at the Chinese Laundry. But don't count on dropping off
socks and shirts: Chicken Chili Laundry Style and Ginger Prawns are
on a menu, not a soiled-clothing list, at this restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   If the Laundry's soup leaves a hot-and-sour tingle in your
mouth, continue south to tiny Okanagan Falls, home of Tickleberry's
and ``the best darned ice cream you ever slung a lip over.''
</P>
<P>
   Just make certain you get back to the houseboat in time to savor
the sunset over Lake Okanagan. And keep a lookout for Ogopogo, the
sea serpent _ like the Loch Ness monster but friendlier _ said to
live 800 feet beneath the surface of this 82-mile-long, glacier-fed
center of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Barrels of wine. Barrels of fun. Take your pick. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers already have experienced the vitality of
Vancouver, the Old World charm of Victoria and the recreational
smorgasbord of Whistler Resort _ all justifiably renowned British
Columbia attractions.
</P>
<P>
   But, hush now, can you keep a secret? Though largely
undiscovered by Americans, the Okanagan Valley _ tucked between the
Cascade and Monashee mountain ranges 300 miles east of Vancouver _
is among Canadians' favorite summer playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to appreciate why so many people fall under its spell.
Some come to tour one of the world's newest but already acclaimed
wine regions, others to swim and sail and fish in a succession of
clear blue lakes or pursue dozens more outdoor activities, still
others simply to slow the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping the summer chill _ stumble over those last two words,
did you? _ is a top priority for many Canadians. With temperatures
reaching the 80s and 90s, the Okanagan is a far cry from the
``frozen North,'' and shorts and sneakers are standard attire this
time of year. But the stifling humidity of Houston summers is
absent here.
</P>
<P>
   With an exchange rate of $1 U.S. to $1.50 Canadian and few
tourist traps to inflate prices, this vacation retreat is easy on
Americans' pocketbooks, too.
</P>
<P>
   The region is compact enough for leisurely exploration. Its main
attractions _ wineries and orchards, lakes and parks, small cities
and don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them hamlets _ are situated along or
just off Canada 97 between Osoyoos, two miles from the U.S. border,
and Vernon, 115 miles to the north (though the valley itself
extends north from Vernon).
</P>
<P>
   In many stretches, especially a 26-mile segment between
Penticton and Peachland, this is a riveting drive, hugging the
water and proceeding up and down gently sloping hills dotted with
sagebrush and pine.
</P>
<P>
   The main roadway yields repeated glimpses of vineyards and trees
draped with fruits of the season: cherries, apples, peaches, pears,
apricots and others.
</P>
<P>
   At almost every turn, another recreational pursuit beckons:
Golfers choose among 19 courses beside the water or etched into
hillsides and canyon walls; anglers cast for 20-pound trout in Lake
Okanagan; and birders seek out the elusive burrowing owl and
Canada's largest concentration of golden eagles at Vaseux Lake
Provincial Park, next to a wildlife sanctuary near Okanagan Falls
(of Tickleberry's fame).
</P>
<P>
   Hikers and mountain bikers relish the challenge of the abandoned
Kettle Valley Railway trail in the central Okanagan, especially a
five-mile loop around horseshoe-shaped Myra Canyon that includes 18
wooden trestles _ with railings to guard against unplanned downward
detours _ and two rock tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Others delight in rafting and kayaking on rivers, rock climbing,
wind surfing, horseback riding or enjoying nature's serenity in one
of about 40 provincial parks.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, life on a houseboat can be yours. Though less focused
than Shuswap Lake to the north (the ``houseboating capital of
Canada,'' with more than 1,000 miles of shoreline to cruise), Lake
Okanagan, too, offers houseboat rentals.
</P>
<P>
   At the valley's heart is Kelowna, its largest town, with 100,000
residents and jet airplane connections from Vancouver and Calgary,
Alberta. Despite frequent traffic jams that remind too much of
home, this is a good overnight base with small orchard and wine
museums and a lovely lake-front park.
</P>
<P>
   The Okanagan's fruit-growing propensity dates to the mid-19th
century, when Father Charles Pandosy, a French priest, established
a mission near Kelowna and introduced apples. Today its orchards
are Canada's most productive, benefiting from more than 2,000 hours
of annual sunshine, mild winters and ample water pumped from lakes
to offset an average yearly rainfall of only 12 inches in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Want a taste? Consider a half-hour respite at Granny's Fruit
Stand beside the highway near Summerland; just keep your eyes
peeled for a driveway framed by an intoxicating rainbow of floral
and fruit baskets, then follow the scent.
</P>
<P>
   Or spend half a day exploring 75 acres of fruit orchards and
vegetable and flower gardens at Davison Orchards, a
third-generation family farm in Vernon. Walking paths are open free
of charge 8 a.m.-8 p.m.; signs along the route offer information on
crop technology and history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first grapes also were planted almost a century and
a half ago, the valley's wine industry has blossomed only in the
past two decades. Not until 1988 did most growers begin placing a
primary focus on quality. Two years later, the government
established the British Columbia Wine Institute, which adopted
strict control standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real revolution over the past five years,''
says Robert Simpson, a Vancouver wine specialist who created the
annual British Columbia Wine and Oyster Festival and who travels
internationally as a taster and judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only about 2,000 acres (of vineyards) in all of the
Okanagan, but the '98 vintage was fantastic, and there is great
potential,'' Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony von Mandl, proprietor of Mission Hill Winery near
Kelowna, has an even bolder vision. ``Our goal is to become one of
the top 10 wineries in the world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Hill wines have won several international awards,
including the 1994 Avery's Trophy, signifying the world's best
chardonnay as determined by the International Wine &AMP; Spirit
Competition in London, and gold medals for pinot gris, merlot and
two chardonnays in prestigious competitions last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pretty ideal climate for growing grapes,'' Mission
Hill executive Kevin Moul says of the Okanagan. ``We don't have a
lot of dampness, yet we have almost unlimited access to water. The
summer sun and heat develop the sugar. Our cool nights help. And
there aren't many enemies of the vine here (resulting in limited
usage of pesticides).''
</P>
<P>
   Limited production and restrictive export laws have kept most
British Columbia wines from crossing the border, but von Mandl
envisions increased exports to the United States in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a more idyllic backdrop for touring the
estates, even if you don't sip a drop.
</P>
<P>
   At Gray Monk, a 45-minute drive north of Kelowna, deli
sandwiches and award-winning wines are served on a patio surrounded
by bougainvillea, with panoramic views of vineyards along Lake
Okanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Heiss and his wife, Trudy, began planting government-approved
hybrid varietals in the early 1970s. Frustrated by a lack of
progress, they regrafted to European vinifera varietals, and in
1982 they established North America's northernmost winery on the
50th parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Complimentary tours provide insight into the production process.
As at other wineries, tastings are free. A large gift shop stocks
about 20 varieties, including a peach- and almond-tinged Pinot
Auxerrois and one of the world's rarest ice wines. (Yes, it does
get cold in winter.)
</P>
<P>
   Mission Hill's setting, high on a bluff in Kelowna's Westbank
suburb, is no less spectacular. A new wine shop and visitor center
help make this a popular stop.
</P>
<P>
   On the lake's opposite bank, the most striking sight at
Summerhill Estate Winery is a 3,600-square-foot (1/8-size) replica
of Egypt's Great Cheops Pyramid; its shape is considered ideal for
aging premium wines and champagne within. Just beyond, the
stone-and-cedar Champagne House stands amid a hot springs nature
preserve overlooking the water and city, with a restaurant on the
covered veranda.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Summerland, Sumac Ridge Estate shares a
hillside with a golf course. Next to its wine shop is the Cellar
Door Bistro, acclaimed for luncheons and dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The Okanagan region has more than 30 wineries, including Calona,
British Columbia's first, founded in 1932 in downtown Kelowna.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry if you are tempted to inspect several: Companies
gladly arrange tours for those wise enough not to sip and drive.
</P>
<P>
   Tuckered out by now? Your houseboat awaits.

CHECKING THE PULSE OF TRAVELERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely does a week pass that I don't receive notice of a survey
whose results purport to give a new perspective on traveler habits,
trends and needs.
</P>
<P>
   Some elicit a chuckle: for instance, the much-anticipated annual
Novotel New York study on whether more men or women accidentally
lock themselves outside of their hotel room wearing little or no
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls are blatantly promotional: Are we supposed to be
surprised that a ``scientific'' survey sponsored by a sunscreen
product determines that exposure to the sun is a main concern of
travelers in the tropics? Or that a roadside motel chain
``discovers'' that most travelers prefer to park vehicles close to
their rooms?
</P>
<P>
   But two new surveys provide intriguing food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUMMER DESTINATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 15 Houston-area agencies affiliated with Carlson Wagonlit
Travel were polled to determine their clients' 1999 summer vacation
plans. It's the first in a series of ambitious localized surveys
planned by the Minneapolis-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   And what destinations are we booking most? No surprise here: Las
Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and San Francisco, in that order, are our
preferences for domestic travel; Cancun, Paris and London are our
top three international choices.
</P>
<P>
   Value-priced tour packages to Cancun represent the ``best summer
deal,'' according to 64.3 percent of the Houston-area agents. Las
Vegas packages were mentioned second.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the most popular national park with clients, 28.6
percent named Grand Canyon, closely followed by Yellowstone. Rocky
Mountain, Yosemite and Zion also were named, but 50 percent of the
agents reported no national park bookings _ not so much an
indication of any waning interest in our parks but an affirmation
that those vacations are usually self-planned.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of the Carlson Wagonlit agencies said that the
NATO military action in the Balkans has had no impact on bookings
to Europe. None reported any cancellations; those experiencing a
decline in reservations compared with last year cited Greece,
Italy, Turkey and Mediterranean cruises. (Other reports indicate a
significant nationwide decline in European cruise bookings,
resulting in lower fares as lines scramble to fill cabins.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EUROPEAN ITINERARIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Weingart, president of Carlson Wagonlit Utopia in Houston,
says his agency's bookings to Europe are brisk. ``We've had nobody
cancel, and we're actually seeing an increased interest in Italy
this year,'' says Weingart. ``We've found Rome as popular as
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Weingart says cruise bookings in Europe and Alaska are slightly
down compared with 1998, but that Panama Canal and fall foliage
(New England/Canada) itineraries are growing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest trend we're seeing with cruises is toward more
upscale lines such as Windstar and Silversea,'' says Weingart.
``What's happening is that the lines have come up with creative
methods to maintain price stability while not sacrificing quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are at all flexible on your travel dates and
open-minded about destinations, you can save a minimum of 25
percent and up to 50 percent or higher off cruise brochure prices
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Weingart's agency also has seen increased interest in the
Canadian Rockies. ``The problem is that the resorts there are so
popular that they are already sold out for the summer,'' he says.
``Now is the time to book for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide concern about low bookings for year-end events
apparently is a factor here, too. ``We made our first millennium
booking last week,'' Weingart says. ``I thought we'd see a lot of
Holy Land 2000 interest by now, but it hasn't happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, following Cancun, Paris and London in the
Carlson-Wagonlit agencies' listing of international bookings are
(4) Rome; (5) Cozumel, Mexico; (6) Madrid, Spain; (7) Montego Bay,
Jamaica; (8) Nassau, Bahamas; and (9) a tie between Florence,
Italy, and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Following Las Vegas, Orlando and San Francisco as top domestic
bookings are (4) New York, (5) Honolulu, (6) Los Angeles, (7) San
Diego and (8) a tie among Anchorage, Alaska (primarily associated
with cruises), Miami and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing these results, it's important to remember that most
Houstonians don't use travel agents to assist with driving trips to
New Orleans, San Antonio and other close-to-home destinations. But
several agents, including Weingart, cite an increased interest in
combination air-land packages to Biloxi, Miss., and its new Beau
Rivage resort.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, sponsored by the industry publication Travel
Weekly, focuses on the services travel agents provide in comparison
with six other professional occupations.
</P>
<P>
   This nationwide survey of 250 travelers (54 percent male, 46
percent female, $77,000 average household income) ranked travel
agents higher than doctors, stockbrokers and lawyers with respect
to the value they provide for their work. Agents were ranked below
teachers, pharmacists and accountants in terms of value.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists scored highest in every other category:
trustworthiness, reliability, professionalism, knowledge,
friendliness and respectability. Lawyers ranked last in every
category except knowledgeability (in which they were rated ahead of
only stockbrokers).
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents' highest ranking, in the Travel Weekly survey, was
for friendliness (tied for second with teachers). Agents were
ranked fifth among the seven professions in all other categories.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just in case you are curious: More men are trapped
outside hotel rooms sans clothing.
</P>

TAKING A STAND: 
 
CHURCH CEASES ALL WEDDING RITES AMID AFFILIATION'S RULE AGAINST
SAME-SEX MARRIAGES  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ At Bering Memorial United Methodist Church, expect to
be greeted with open arms, regardless of your sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``reconciling congregation.'' Among Methodists, that
means a church that works to include everyone, whether gay or
straight. There is a handful of such churches in Texas and more
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At Bering, newcomers are drawn to a historic, picturesque church
in the heart of Montrose near downtown. It has a strong history of
advocating justice. It is admired for its outreach, including a
dental clinic for people with AIDS and support groups for people
with AIDS and their partners and families.
</P>
<P>
   What it doesn't offer are weddings. Not to straight couples
seeking to be wed in the stately sanctuary or gay or lesbian
couples wanting a union ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The church and its pastor, the Rev. Marilyn Meeker-Williams,
will hold no weddings as long as the United Methodist Church
prohibits clergy from officiating at same-sex union ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   For Meeker-Williams, the soft-spoken wife and mother of three,
including a gay son in his early 20s, preaching and living the
peace of Christ requires difficult decisions. Like speaking out for
what she believes when it would be easier to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a pastoral decision, but I would not make it
without extensive conversations with our congregants,''
Meeker-Williams said of the ban on weddings for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was talked about for 15 months, including two
wide-ranging discussions during meetings of the church's 90-member
administrative board.
</P>
<P>
   A letter signed by the 49-year-old pastor and her two associate
ministers, the Revs. Troy G. Plummer and Bruce Felker, informed
church members of the pastoral decision in February. In part, it
said: ``It is not acceptable, nor just, nor loving to offer God's
blessing for some couples when others are denied that holy
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeker-Williams, who has been at the church for three years,
said she has received mostly supportive letters and phone calls
from church members. Members who have disagreed have said they will
support her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has said I'm leaving the church over this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said fewer than 10 people in the predominantly gay
congregation have told the ministers that they were unhappy with
the decision. He described the decision as an act of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church needed to take a stand to say this is not OK and we
will not support this double-standard,'' Meeker-Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was not taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the problem to be the greatest challenge we have
faced in the United Methodist Church for some time,'' she said.
``The challenge is to differ in our understandings but be united in
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're united in the love of Christ. That's what we're doing
here as the church. To continue to live that out when we are very
diverse in our understandings of homosexuality is a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bering, the congregation turns theologically to Romans 8, the
apostle Paul's exhortation on the mind-boggling power of Christ's
love, she said. The passage is its recourse in the face of
opposition. Nothing, Paul asserted, ``will be able to separate us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TREATING EVERYONE THE SAME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with much Scripture, believers differ in how that passage
should be lived out. They also disagree on what the Bible in
general says about homosexual practice. To many Christians, a
homosexual lifestyle cannot be condoned in word, action or policy.
</P>
<P>
   At their General Conference, Methodists' highest legislative
body, delegates in 1996 adopted a resolution prohibiting clergy
from performing or participating in same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Such unions are not officially validated by the Methodist Church
nor by most other churches.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to some people in same-sex partnerships, being denied a
religious affirmation of a long-term commitment is like being
denied a funeral because of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, what we truly would love to have is a holy union in
our church with our senior pastor celebrating that union. That's
the ideal for us,'' said Bering church member Linda Enger.
</P>
<P>
   Enger, 46, and Eleanora Piombino, 55, have been together for 25
years. Nothing would give them greater joy than to affirm that
commitment in Bering's sanctuary, surrounded by friends in the
700-member church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel badly that the United Methodist Church has stood firm
in its decision to ban same-sex marriages,'' Enger said. ``But the
way we feel about Marilyn and our congregation's decision is, it's
an inclusive statement. In my mind, she's saying: `I'm going to
treat everyone the same.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other denominations have taken positions similar to the
Methodists' 1996 decision banning clergy from officiating at
same-sex union ceremonies. Churches are willing to sponsor
ministries to gay people, but refuse to ordain them or bless their
unions. The issue has polarized religious groups across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reconciling churches'' challenging the 1996 decision include
Trinity United Methodist Church in Austin, where the Rev. Sid Hall
and the congregation agreed that until a solution is found, both
opposite-sex and same-sex unions will be performed Quaker-style
without an officiant.
</P>
<P>
   Other clergy have gone a step further, challenging the national
prohibition by performing same-sex unions. The Rev. Jimmy Creech,
who now lives in North Carolina, violated church doctrine on the
matter two years ago, presiding over the marriage of two lesbians
while he was serving as pastor of First United Methodist Church in
Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost convicted in a church trial.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his acquittal, his Nebraska contract was not renewed.
Under the terms of his leave of absence from the 8.7 million-member
denomination, he cannot perform marriages. But this spring, Creech
performed a union ceremony for two gay men in North Carolina. He
has said he no has intention of refusing such requests.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`FAITH HAS BEEN RENEWED' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, it was the congregation's compassion that drew
Mary Parker to Bering when her grown son had AIDS. He had been
through a particularly difficult experience at an area hospital. A
nurse refused him basic care. A friend urged Parker and her son to
seek a support group. They found one at Bering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it was at a church kind of turned me off &UR;  &LR; (the
idea at first),'' said Parker, now 67 and an active Bering member.
``I hadn't given up on God, but I had given up on organized
religion years ago for reasons I won't go into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking: If my son and I go to this support group
and they tell me that they take the stance of love the sinner, but
hate the sin, we wouldn't stay. But it wasn't like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like that at all. Their AIDS support groups was very
nurturing and caring. They didn't bring religion into it. Before it
was over with, and when my son was well enough, we started going to
church. My faith has been renewed by the whole experience.''
</P>
<P>
   After her son died, Parker continued to attend the church. She
still does, often volunteering to help other parents and children
survive the grief she lived through herself. Her story touches
hearts, but it doesn't resolve the issues at stake at Bering _ and
across Methodism.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex unions are among topics being discussed this month as
Methodists hold regional sessions, called annual conferences,
across the country, according to a spokesman for United Methodists'
Nashville, Tenn.-based news service. He predicted the issue would
come up again next year when the church holds its
once-every-four-year national meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get a lot of petitions'' to the keep the ban on
clergy officiating at same-sex unions, the spokesman predicted.
Most Methodists do not want the ban dropped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, along with the ordination of gays, continues to be a
divisive issue in other denominations, as well.

<P>
   Hockey mania has struck deep and hard in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There's the neighbor who doesn't know icing from high-sticking
but who, nevertheless, flies a Stars flag. The friends who are
suddenly hunkering down for hours in front of their TVs or who
dicker with scalpers for expensive seats.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to explain, says historian Jerry Rodnitzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to identify with a winner,'' said Rodnitzky, who
teaches a course on 20th century popular culture at the University
of Texas at Arlington. ``I think it's a pretty common cultural
phenomenon in America.''
</P>
<P>
   And folks aren't embarrassed in the least to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm watching because they're winning,'' said Meredith
Mangum, 21, a Texas Christian University student and hostess at the
Blue Mesa Grill, who hasn't missed a game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it's a windfall for the Stars and the
networks that broadcast the games.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, Fox's television station KDFW/Channel
4 was lucky when the team drew more than 5 percent of the area's
viewing population. Tuesday night's broadcast of the first Stanley
Cup Finals game attracted 26.7 percent of the population and a 42
percent share of people who had their sets on, said Andy Alexander,
the station's vice president of research.
</P>
<P>
   But Nielsen and Co. might have missed Elaine Green.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old postal clerk in Bedford got so nervous, she
switched channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work so hard to get (the puck) down there, and then it's
gone,'' explained Green, who has never attended a game but misses
few on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Hordes of eager newcomers to the sport are just fine with the
team, which has seen 80,000 miniature, green-and-black Star flags
snapped up and displayed like it was a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of making fans, as opposed to getting
existing fans more excited,'' said Jeff Cogen, the Stars' vice
president of marketing and promotion since 1993. ``And it's clearly
easier when you're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The craze hits at a time when North Texas has been quietly but
heavily infiltrated by Yankee transplants. Many have been hooking
unsuspecting natives on the often violent contact sport for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great group to watch with, all our kids and
friends,'' said Wisconsin-born Rhea Noggle, who moved to the area
13 years ago and owns a skin care and ``body contouring'' business,
Ultimate Image, in Roanoke. ``I've always been a hockey fan and was
so glad when the Stars got here,'' the Trophy Club resident said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hockey zealots is Curtis Bogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk about it with the kids on my youth baseball team that I
coach,'' acknowledged Bogan, 42, of Fort Worth. ``I'm an old Iowan,
and I began following them in Minnesota when they were the good ol'
North Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hockey, more than a particular Dallas team, that
intrigues Bogan, insists his 14-year-old son, Robert, who is not a
Stars fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves hockey. He just doesn't like the Stars,'' the son
said of his father. ``He tends to follow players more than teams,
and the players he likes are not on the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even electronic geeks are pulling themselves away from their
computers long enough to form an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Al Chia's colleagues at Texas Instruments in Dallas can't stop
discussing the Stanley Cup competition, he said. It's reached the
point where ``we're planning our work schedule around games so we
can watch them,'' the 28-year-old engineering technician added.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Medina, 34, of North Richland Hills, works at night but
doesn't let his job keep him from following the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security guards have it on television,'' said Medina, an
employee at a Dillard's distribution center in Fort Worth. ``And
the drivers tell us what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Abernathy is an American Airlines pilot from Southlake who
acknowledges that he's following the Stars mainly because they're
in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abernathy said he was moved Tuesday night when, heading
into Minneapolis from Chicago, an air traffic controller told him
the results of the game between the Sabres and the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I just thought you would want to know that our Stars
lost in overtime,''' Abernathy said. ``I was kind of touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are just as willing to admit that they're fair-weather
fans, in it to share the heightened drama and the glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those playoff watchers,'' conceded Al Gonzales, 48,
owner of Grapevine's Main Street Barber Shop.
</P>
<P>
   But two colleagues _ Deanna Mesi, a Buffalo, N.Y., native, and
Mike Flores, a Houston native _ are serious enough to gamble more
than money on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Sabres win, Mike has to have a Buffalo emblem shaved
into the back of his head,'' Gonzales said. ``If Buffalo loses,
Deanna has to shave a star into her head. Everybody is excited
about the bet. The customers are really into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Armey, 30, a Denton County commissioner, insists that he's
been a diehard fan since the Stars moved to Dallas. But, still,
there's nothing like the Stanley Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys have been in Super Bowls, but the Super Bowls
haven't been in Dallas,'' said Armey, who was still hoarse after
yelling during Game 2. ``The Mavericks and Rangers haven't reached
their finals. This is the championship and it's right here in
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   There's remarkable candor among the newly frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the South, and this is relatively new to me,'' said
Mike Conrads, 38, of Southlake. ``I've watched a few games through
the season, but what has really gotten me excited is the
playoffs.''

FOR NEW DIRECTOR, THE DMA IS AN UNFINISHED MASTERPIECE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Twice before, in San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Jack
Lane has brought museums to the point of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   And in both instances, he left them so that his successors could
bring in that glorious harvest. Last December, however, trustees of
the Dallas Museum of Art asked Lane to address a slightly different
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees hired Lane, 55, after a yearlong search for a new
director. Their hope was that, under his leadership, they could
realize a dream of greatness looked for since at least the
mid-'80s, when the DMA moved from Fair Park to the Arts District
and hired a charismatic scholar named Rick Brettell as its new
director.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1903, the DMA is an anomaly in North Texas. Unlike
the privately supported and highly specialized museums in Dallas
and Fort Worth, the DMA relies on a mix of public and private
funds, and collects and shows an encyclopedic range of artworks.
Both factors have made it difficult for the DMA to consistently
build toward the kind of reputation enjoyed by the Meadows,
Kimbell, Carter and Fort Worth Modern, not to mention the equally
diverse (but privately funded) Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Dallas museum has presented a number of
important exhibitions _ of native North American Indian works, of
contemporary paintings, of decorative arts and other materials. An
O'Keeffe exhibition in the late '80s was its best-attended show in
the past 15 years. It has collected internationally recognized
masterworks by Jackson Pollock, Henri Matisse, Edward Hopper and
others.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Brettell nor his successor, Jay Gates, who served
from 1993 to 1998, turned trustees' dreams into reality.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Lane brings a balance of dynamism, discipline
and experience neither Brettell nor Gates could claim, his success
hinges on a handful of issues as yet untested.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his scholarly credentials and professional standing.
Lane is highly respected by his colleagues and holds a fistful of
degrees that would warm the collective heart of any search
committee: His B.A. is from Williams College (home of the so-called
Williams Mafia, whose members head a number of prestigious American
museums); his M.A. and Ph.D. are from Harvard University. Just for
good measure, perhaps, Lane also holds an M.B.A. from the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily his ability to raise money _ which he did
in both his previous posts, successfully overseeing capital
campaigns for new buildings in San Francisco and Pittsburgh. Or his
skills as a manager, as glowing reports from former employees
attest.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's acid test likely will have to do with his support for the
DMA's encyclopedic program. It is a museum that needs to be all
things to all people, but for too long has seemed to be about
nothing in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's scholarly background is in modern art, his experiences in
contemporary, his enthusiasms clearly disposed toward both. Modern
and contemporary are recognized areas of DMA strength. But so,
perhaps even more so, are African, pre-Columbian and Indonesian
art, and American furniture and decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lane exudes a forcefulness, sophistication and
charm that instills confidence. And he makes a point of reiterating
his desire, already expressed in the museum newsletter, to
``re-animate the idea of an encyclopedic museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense here the same energy and ambition that I felt at the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in the late '80s,'' Lane says.
``Dallas has a group of people who want to advance their museum _
and I just love that. It's hard for me to think of many, if any,
American art museums with as much potential as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lane effectively understates what could be the most
severe case of trustee frustration of any big metropolitan museum.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as he was hired, Brettell started stirring up
excitement. But he also built a massive addition to the new museum
without securing funds to operate it. After he departed, trustees
turned to Gates to put housekeeping in order. He did, but at the
cost of interesting acquisitions and shows.
</P>
<P>
   As such, no one mourned when Gates quietly left for another
directorship. The search committee went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Lane. As former director of SF MoMA and, prior to that,
the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, Lane had transformed those
institutions into players on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Search committee head and former DMA board President Deedie Rose
notes that her expectations of Lane were enormous _ and that they
thus far have been exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Current board President Jeremy Halbreich also paints a rosy
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping now is for the DMA to emerge as a respected
leader locally, regionally and nationally in three areas _
collections, exhibitions and education _ that are the focus of our
strategic planning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Lane envisions a detailed plan that exploits the museum's global
range and its spacious and flexible gallery spaces (the largest in
North Texas). He plans to bring to Dallas the sort of traveling
shows shared by major venues in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and
Washington, among others.
</P>
<P>
   He looks to capitalize on area collectors' passions for
contemporary, modern, impressionist, post-impressionist and
19th-century American art. He sees the planned Nasher sculpture
garden _ which will open next door _ as a means of bringing
international attention to the museum. Lane also wants the museum
to celebrate its centennial, in 2003, to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jack's vision is well-defined, the trustees will pull
together to bring it home,'' says Harry Parker, director of the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. As DMA director in the '70s and
early '80s, Parker steered the museum's move from Fair Park to the
Arts District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is capable of that,'' Parker says. ``And when Dallas
gets its act together to concentrate on a mission, it's something
to behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas museum is not the best,'' he concludes. ``But it's
a comer in the category that also includes Museum of Fine Arts,
Boston, the Cleveland museum and the Art Institute of Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane is the best man to take Dallas to the next level, says
Michael Auping, chief curator of the Modern Art Museum of Fort
Worth and a close colleague of Lane's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Jack saying to me once, in a moment of complete
innocence, `I really like being a museum director,''' Auping says.
``What that says about his overall sanity, I won't say. But that is
an attitude that makes for a great museum director.''

RETURN TO ROOTS: REFORM JEWS GOING BACK TO TRADITIONS TO RECAPTURE
IDENTITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rabbi Ralph Mecklenburger doesn't wear a
yarmulke, or skull cap, as he leads worship services at his Reform
Judaism temple in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more and more of my congregants are wearing traditional
head coverings, and that's just fine,'' said Mecklenburger.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cultural phenomenon of the times, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is changing so fast that people are looking for
roots _ for the warmth and stability of traditions to hold onto,''
said Mecklenburger, rabbi at Beth-El Congregation. ``This drifting
back to more tradition is happening in Christianity and Islam and
also in Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he and other members of the Central Conference of
American Rabbis last month overwhelmingly approved a revised
``Statement of Principles'' clearly pointing Reform Jews toward
more traditional Jewish practices.
</P>
<P>
   The new document, last revised in 1976, calls for study of
practices sometimes rejected by Reform Jews in the past _ praying
and studying in Hebrew, following kosher dietary laws and wearing
tallits, or prayer shawls, and yarmulkes to show reverence for God.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1.5 million Reform Jews in the United States _ the
largest and most liberal branch of American Judaism. By a 324-68
vote, rabbis representing that group affirmed the central tenets of
Judaism _ God, Torah and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Then they added: ``We are committed to the ongoing study of the
whole array of mitzvot (Jewish commandments), and to the
fulfillment of those that address us as individuals and as a
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Lance J. Sussman of Binghamton, N.Y., one of the
document's opponents, said the revision, though vaguely worded,
moves Reform Judaism away from the ``progressive theology'' on
which the movement is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have believed in changing certain practices of Judaism
because we felt it was what God expected of us,'' said Sussman,
rabbi of Temple Concord in Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   He cited such changes as allowing men and women to sit together
in synagogue and letting women sing during worship services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that this whole business of rediscovering old
Jewish traditions means we are no longer willing to talk about
progressive changes we may need in our faith,'' Sussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of Hebrew Union College in
Cincinnati, argued for the new principles during debates at the
meeting in Pittsburgh, saying Reform Judaism needs to recapture its
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, a former Dallas rabbi who now heads one of the
largest and most influential Jewish universities in the nation,
said that it is a blessing that Jews have become so accepted and
Americanized, but that Reform Jews now are struggling to define
what it means to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism first organized with the creation of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations in 1873. Its goals were to adapt and
change some trappings of the faith to fit into the American way of
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt Judaism had to change to exist,'' Zimmerman said.
``One thing we did was adopt the Western practice of taking off our
hats in places of worship, rather than the Eastern practice of
covering our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman never wore a yarmulke when he was rabbi of Temple
Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1996. It was almost a law that
rabbis did not cover their heads in the Dallas temple, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of showing we were different from other branches
of Judaism,'' he said. But he began introducing traditional Jewish
practices of emphasizing religious holidays and studying the faith
more intensely.
</P>
<P>
   Another Tarrant County Reform Judaism congregation, Congregation
Beth Shalom in Arlington, fully embraces the return to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing this all along,'' said Janet Aaronson,
executive director of Beth Shalom. ``Almost all of our congregants
wear prayer shawls and yarmulkes, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Arlington congregation also observe Jewish dietary
laws, and there has been some talk about putting in a kosher
kitchen at the temple, Aaronson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Golden, a member of Congregation Kol Ami, a Reform
congregation in Flower Mound, especially welcomes the trend toward
Jewish traditions because she grew up in an Orthodox congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen more and more people covering their heads when they
come to worship,'' she said. ``I always wear something on my head,
because I think it shows respect for God.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he doesn't wear a yarmulke or keep kosher dietary
laws, Mecklenburger said he favors returning to many traditional
observances. He has been leading his congregation in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   More Hebrew is spoken in Mecklenburger's worship services,
though English predominates. About a third of his congregants wear
yarmulkes, including some women. Also, both sexes often wear prayer
shawls. He wears a prayer shawl, but no yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived in town 15 years ago, I was told Reform Jews
don't have cantorial music,'' he said. ``But we experimented with
it and, lo and behold, we found this practice was spiritually
satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Another return to tradition is that a new temple being built for
Beth-El Congregation in southwest Fort Worth will face toward
Jerusalem. The current temple south of downtown Fort Worth does not
face toward that holy city.
</P>
<P>
   David Taffet, vice president of Congregation Beth El Binah, a
predominantly gay and lesbian Reform congregation in Dallas,
praised the document because it reaffirms Reform Judaism's
opposition to discrimination based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes there is a need to return to more traditional
Jewish practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents and grandparents were trying to shed the ghetto
image of Jews,'' Taffet said. ``Now we have been assimilated into
American life, and we feel a need to go back to our roots.''

 &HT;    Fagan-Martin manse placed on market _ for $3.5 million
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Mediterranean-style manse by the ocean
where convicted kidnapper Stephen Fagan lives could be yours.
</P>
<P>
   For $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Four bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths.
</P>
<P>
   An agent at Martha Gottfried Inc. of Palm Beach confirmed Sunday
the real estate company is listing the 6,592-square-foot dwelling
at 870 S. Ocean Blvd. at that price. He declined to offer further
details.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   He and his fourth wife paid $1.6 million for the property in
1996, according to the Palm Beach County property appraiser's
records. Two weeks after his April 1998 arrest, Harriet Golding
Martin bought out her husband's stake in exchange for $450,000, the
records show.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her lawyer said the transfer was made for ``estate
planning'' purposes.
</P>
<P>
   When Fagan and his wife bought the 19,166-square-foot property,
he used the name William S. Martin. The house was Pepto-Bismol pink
and William S. Martin was a popular Palm Beach socialite who had
claimed to be, among other things, a Ph.D., an international
consultant and a former presidential adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The house has since been painted pumpkin yellow. And William S.
Martin has since been unmasked as Stephen Fagan, in reality a
lawyer, a former bouncer and an accused art thief.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 57, was convicted last month of kidnapping his two
daughters 20 years ago in a custody fight with ex-wife Barbara
Kurth.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST, Okla. _ As the days turn hot and
evenings muggy, lowlanders dream of vacations near cool waterfalls
and on mountain slopes shaded by tall, leafy trees. The problem is,
they mournfully conclude, the family budget won't allow for trips
to the lush vistas of Washington State or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, however, is that waterfalls and mountain retreats
are closer than you think. For Texans, at least, they are just a
few hours' drive from downtown Fort Worth in neighboring Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The popular belief is that Oklahoma epitomizes the Dust Bowl,
miles of flat terrain for as far as the eye can see, with clouds of
swirling dirt whipped by the dry, hot winds. It is a view popular
with those whose exposure to the Sooner State has been limited to
excursions on Interstates 35 and 40.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another Oklahoma, one with idyllic settings tucked
away in corners of the state that are only a short drive from the
main highways. These mountains, lakes and forests rival the most
verdant areas of New Hampshire or Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, the motels and restaurants in these areas have not
become acquainted with the exorbitant prices for rooms and haute
cuisine like in the better-known escapes up north. For a few
hundred dollars, you can pack up the kids, water toys and hiking
boots and enjoy a cool, inexpensive getaway in a state close to
home.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry Museum
</P>
<P>
   Oklahomans like to pay homage to native sons such as Gene Autry,
Will Rogers, Sequoyah, Tom Mix, cowboys in general. This is a fine
museum, with exhibits chronicling the life of Gene Autry and other
singing cowboys such as Rex Allen. It will probably persuade you to
visit a few other Oklahoma museums as well.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Just follow the signs on Interstate 35 north
after crossing into Oklahoma from Texas. The museum is in the town
of Gene Autry.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Turner Falls
</P>
<P>
   The magnificent 77-foot Turner Falls roars majestically in the
hills outside the tiny town of Davis. This is nature at its best.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding public park is low-key and pleasant. For $6
apiece, you and your family can enter for a few hours of laid-back
fun. No thrill ride at a high-profile amusement park is quite like
wading in the cove where the waterfall meets a dark blue pond of
cool water. Toddlers can splash around in shallow adjacent streams.
</P>
<P>
   There are barbecue pits, picnic tables under shady trees, caves
to explore and vigilant lifeguards to keep tabs on the kids if Mom
and Dad decide to nap after lunch. It's a gorgeous spot.
</P>
<P>
   A round-trip visit to Turner Falls makes a perfect one-day
excursion and is a jewel in Oklahoma's geographic crown.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Soon after crossing the Red River, about an
hour's drive out of Fort Worth on Interstate 35, you'll be greeted
by road signs for Oklahoma attractions, among them Turner Falls.
Just follow the signs.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy has visited Oklahoma City twice in recent years.
Visitors are drawn to the Murrah Federal Building, which was
destroyed by a terrorist bomb. The area is fenced off now, and
construction is under way at the site to erect a permanent
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, parts of Oklahoma City and surrounding communities
were leveled when tornadoes cut a destructive path through the
area.
</P>
<P>
   But Oklahomans pride themselves on being resilient, and they are
determined to overcome any adversity they face.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedies have overshadowed the fact that Oklahoma City has
several tourist attractions that visitors may find intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   The Myriad Gardens on the southern edge of downtown are a visual
delight; the 17 acres of flora and fauna are protected from the sun
by a giant glasslike tube. You can walk around the outside gardens
for free. There is a $2 admission fee for a stroll inside.
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile away is Bricktown, a refurbished warehouse district
that now features a strip of snazzy restaurants. It is a culinary
delight and offers the widest assortment of food in the state.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Just take I-35 north.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Tahlequah
</P>
<P>
   This is where the U.S. government relocated the Cherokee Nation
after the tribe left its ancestral home in the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   You'll like Tahlequah. An interesting sight is the billboards
promoting candidates running for chief, not city council or
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction is the fabulous Cherokee National Museum,
open Tuesday through Saturday. The entry fee is $5 for adults and
$3 for kids. There are exhibits extolling the achievements of the
Cherokee as well as an account of the Trail of Tears that
chronicles the tribe's relocation to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Interstate 40 to Oklahoma 69; north to
Oklahoma 62 and follow signs for Tahlequah. You'll pass Henryetta
on the way, which avid Dallas Cowboys fans know is Troy Aikman's
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Indian mounds of Spiro
</P>
<P>
   This small town entices visitors with signs proclaiming
``Mysterious Mounds!!!'' and ``Wonder of Man and Nature!!!'' Follow
the signs until you reach a small, fenced preserve. There's no
charge to enter, but a $3 donation is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   After making your donation, you are given a trail map that shows
the way to the legendary burial mounds that supposedly hold
skeletal Indian remains. You look and look, until finally it dawns
on you that those lumpy little hillocks to one side of the path
are, in fact, the wondrous mounds.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: From Tahlequah, head south on County Road 82,
a lovely scenic route that encompasses hills, forests and massive
Tenkiller Lake. When County Road 82 intersects with I-40, take I-40
east again to U.S. 59. Travel south to U.S. 271 and follow signs to
the Indian Mounds of Spiro.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ouachita National Forest
</P>
<P>
   This is the oldest national forest in the South, and it
encompasses parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. There are 33 outdoor
recreation areas and more than 600 miles of hiking, biking and
equestrian trails. There are camping grounds and great fishing
holes. Ouachita is the French version of the Indian word
``Washitah,'' which means good hunting grounds. This remains as
true today as it was hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to do their hiking by car, the Talimena
Scenic Byway is a 54-mile road that provides travelers with
breathtaking views of the Ouachita Mountains and the national
forest. The drive is uphill, and you will not want to exceed 20
miles per hour on the twisting, turning road. You will probably
want to stop at more than one of the two-dozen scenic overlooks to
take photos or simply gaze at the beautiful panoramic view.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: From the Indian Mounds of Spiro, follow U.S.
271 south as it gently rises through the mountains until you see
signs for Oklahoma 1. At this intersection, there is a large
billboard announcing the start of the 54-mile Talimena Scenic
Byway.

 &HT;    AS SERBS WITHDRAW, DETAILS OF A MASSACRE EMERGE
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MEN; KOSOVO-RUSSIA; KOSOVO-RENEWAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   RACAK, Yugoslavia _ ``With my own eyes I saw 23 dead bodies,''
said Agim Kameri, 32, who slipped out of the woods Monday to
revisit the site of one of the most horrific massacres of the Serb
ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the corpses have no eyes,'' he said. ``Some of their
hearts had been ripped out. And most of them had their heads cut
off from their necks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ethnic Albanian farmer from this town, Shefqet Beqiri,
50, pulled out the identification card of his 20-year-old son,
Zehel.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my basement I saw a Serb policeman kill my son last
January about 6:45 in the morning,'' he said. ``About 8:20 a.m., I
had fled to the edge of the woods. I saw the same policeman come
back, pull out a big knife and cut out my son's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Beqiri told Cox Newspapers that he knows the killer by name and
has heard he still works as a policemen in the nearby town of
Stimlje.
</P>
<P>
   Ismet Aimini, 45, produced more grisly evidence. From the breast
pocket of his black leather jacket he pulled out a rounded bone
that he claimed was a piece of his dead brother's skull.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews by Cox Newspapers with eight surviving eyewitnesses
yielded similar stories, albeit with many details confused and some
in conflict. Their estimates of deaths ranged from 40 to 70.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to search for physical evidence to verify
their stories because both villagers and nearby British NATO
peacekeepers said that the trails and houses off the main road of
Racak are full of land mines.
</P>
<P>
   When rumors of the Racak massacre first reached Western ears
last January, the resulting indignation was an important factor in
convincing reluctant NATO countries that big-power intervention in
Kosovo was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence officials believe that Serb forces entered
the farming village, about 20 miles south-southeast of the Kosovo
capital of Pristina, in a failed search for rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, or KLA. Then, unable to find the rebel fighters,
the Serbs reportedly massacred up to 70 civilians as a gruesome
warning to the ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Until NATO moved in and the Serbs withdrew on Monday, the town
had remained all but empty and cut off from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days, Serb police have moved out, KLA groups have
taken control and departed villagers have begun trickling back on
foot and in tractors pulling carts.
</P>
<P>
   A Racak woman, Hajrie Ishmajli, 46, said after a bitter return
to her birthplace: ``When I saw my brothers without heads, without
eyes, without feet, I was emotionally destroyed and have been ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Her former neighbor, farmer Avdi Beca, 54, returned to the
village Monday, carrying a leather bridle and looking for a stolen
horse. ``There were 54 victims,'' he insisted. ``I saw them with my
own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many died in this village of about 2,000 people is
something international investigators may be able to determine. In
plain sight on a slope above the village is a cemetery with rows of
fresh mounds covering the victims. One of the graves is still open,
dug for a woman who disappeared and has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   After five months of hibernation, Racak was beginning to come
back to life. But the score of people who have moved back from the
wooded mountains of Kosovo are living on the edge of privation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough food, and the water is not safe,'' said
the town's only functioning authority, KLA commander Abdullah
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Racak has been designated by NATO as part of the British sector.
On Monday, British officers drove in armored vehicles to the edge
of Racak for ongoing informal talks with KLA commanders to
determine when the rebels would turn over the town to NATO
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Driving away from Racak, a reporter struck up a conversation in
Russian with the commander of a Serb army unit that had been caught
in a traffic jam while en route back to Yugoslavia in compliance
with the Yugoslav-NATO agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav officer smiled broadly and pressed a drink of the
fiery Yugoslav brandy called Rakia on the journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is all politics,'' the commander insisted when
asked about events at Racak. ``Serbian soldiers and NATO soldiers _
we can work together because we know how to follow orders.''

AN ACHILLES HEEL, IN THE KNEE

   (The Science Times)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Thursday, 43 seconds into the New York Liberty's home
opening game, Rebecca Lobo jumped for a rebound, pivoted and fell
to the floor clutching her knee and screaming in pain. An
off-balance landing resulted in a torn anterior cruciate ligament,
an injury that will require surgery and months of rehabilitation.
For the Women's National Basketball Association star it means
sitting out the season.
</P>
<P>
   The same day researchers and physicians from around the country
gathered in the Hunt Valley of Maryland for a symposium on ACL
injuries and the female athlete, sponsored by the American Academy
of Orthopedic Surgeons, and earlier this month, the American
College of Sports Medicine presented a half-day workshop on the
topic at its annual conference. The Journal of Athletic Training
has devoted its current issue to exploring the potential risk of
such injuries and possible preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
   Why all this attention? Knee injuries are a serious problem for
female athletes. According to the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, women playing soccer and basketball suffer three to
five times as many ACL injuries as their male counterparts.
According to the American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine,
10,000 women experience debilitating knee injuries a year at the
college level; on the high school level, the number rises to
20,000. Soccer, basketball and volleyball, sports that involve
pivoting, cutting and jumping, pose the most risk.
</P>
<P>
   The anterior cruciate ligament controls the pivoting motion of
the knee. With the hamstring and quadriceps muscles _ back and
front of the thigh _ the ligament helps stabilize the joint. If the
muscles are not up to the task, when an athlete jumps or twists,
the ligament may bear more force that it can handle, resulting in a
tear.
</P>
<P>
   To withstand the twists and turns of aggressive sports,
hamstring muscles should be 60 percent to 70 percent as strong as
the quadriceps, said Dr. Frank Noyes, director of the Cincinnati
Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center. In female athletes, the
ratio is actually 45 percent to 55 percent. Whether the difference
is cultural or anatomical, women tend to rely on their quadriceps
when jumping and pivoting, while men depend more on their
hamstrings. Since the hamstring muscles are more protective of the
ACL that muscular imbalance is considered a risk factor in knee
injuries, Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers speculate that women's wider hip-to-knee ratio
may be a factor in knee injuries. Other evidence suggests that at
certain times in a woman's menstrual cycle, hormones may cause her
ligaments and tendons to become more lax and more susceptible to
injury. Less early exposure to sports or less experience with
weight training may also make women more vulnerable to knee
injuries. The degree to which anatomical and hormonal differences
affect women's athletic development and likelihood of injuries
puzzles experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there are neuromuscular differences
between males and females,'' said Dr. Ed Wojtys, a professor of
surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School and team
physician for the university athletic department. ``Depending on
their sex,'' he said, ``athletes fire different muscles for the
same task. Women also tend to run, jump and land in a more upright
position than men.''
</P>
<P>
   While researchers are teasing out the hormonal, biomechanical
and cultural factors that cause this disparity in knee injuries,
Dr. Timothy Hewett and Dr. Thomas Lindenfeld and others at the
Cincinnati center, have shown that a preseason neuromuscular
training program can significantly reduce the number of injuries in
girls. They have developed a jump training and conditioning program
called Cincinnati Sportsmetrics, which is being adopted in hundreds
of high schools and colleges and is available by videotape. After
four players from the girls' championship high school basketball
team in Galesburg, Ill., tore their ACL's in 18 months, Ed Massey,
the coach, incorporated Sportsmetrics into his team's training
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati researchers have shown that by strengthening the
hamstrings and quadriceps, landing in a crouched position after
jumping and learning to fire the hamstring muscles, female athletes
can reduce their knee injuries to a rate comparable to that of
males. They also improve their jumping ability by 10 percent, said
Lindenfeld, the orthopedic surgeon who conducted the research.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years the Galesburg basketball team has followed the
program, players have improved their strength and have become more
agile and confident in their jumping ability, Massey said. ``The
team has been free of knee injuries and has fewer stress
fractures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest conditioning programs tailored for girls
and women. It is not a matter of female athletes' being deficient
in any way, said Dr. Patty Freedson, graduate program director of
the department of exercise science at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. ``There should be a focus on the specific
goals and needs of women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Woyjet: ``Women shouldn't accept ACL injuries as the price
they have to pay for being athletic.''

A COMMON LINK IN FAILED PREGNANCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Refining the understanding of a crucial step in early pregnancy,
researchers have pinpointed the time frame in which a fertilized
egg needs to implant itself into the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 221 healthy women who were trying to conceive,
researchers from the National Institutes of Health found that in
most successful cases, implantation occurred 8 to 10 days after the
women ovulated. Of perhaps more interest, they found that the later
the egg implanted itself, the greater the chance the pregnancy
would fail.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the current issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine, might influence the practices used at
infertility clinics that perform in vitro fertilization of fetal
transplants, experts said. It might also give pause to doctors
looking into ways to increase the window of time each month when
women with fertility problems can become pregnant, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen J. Wilcox, the principal author of the study and an
obstetric epidemiologist at the institutes, said the main
importance of the findings was the glimpse they provided into the
still little understood time when the newly fertilized egg attaches
itself to the lining of a woman's uterus. It then develops into an
embryo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the the most unobserved step in pregnancy,''
Wilcox said of implantation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was most struck by what appeared to be a strong link
between how late a fertilized egg attaches to the uterus and how
often the pregnancy has an early failure.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women studied, 82 percent had early failures when
implantation occurred more than 11 days after ovulation, when a
mature egg is released from an ovary. That was a failure rate
significantly higher than when eggs attached on the 11th day (52
percent), and more than three times as great as when they implanted
on the 10th day (26 percent). The rate of early pregnancy loss
through the 9th day after ovulation was 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One theory, Wilcox said, is that a woman's body may reject a
late-implanting egg because it might not be healthy. The window of
time in which a uterus will accept an egg may thus have a specific
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, then we may want to be careful about any
attempt to expand that window artificially,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph A. Hill, director of reproductive medicine at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the study added weight to the
theory that prospective mothers and fertilized eggs might
communicate with each other very early in the process, possibly by
sending messenger proteins to ``discuss'' things like where and
when to implant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing body of evidence that suggests that there's
a cross-talk between the embryo and the mom,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the study was also valuable because it was done on women
with normal fertility. Until now, most of the implantation research
has involved women receiving in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, women who experience early pregnancy loss do not
know they were pregnant. The study was conducted by having the
patients provide urine samples every day for six months.
Researchers then studied the samples for the hormones indicating
fertilization and, later, implantation.

<P>
   MODESTO, Calif. _ Even though the several men are in custody and
a key witness is talking, the FBI admits the homicide case of three
Yosemite tourists is so complicated that it could be months before
charges are filed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, old friends and associates of Eugene ``Rufus'' Dykes
said they were stunned at reports that the 32-year-old convicted
felon from Modesto admitted to involvement in the kidnapping and
murder of three women sightseers in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Rufus killing those girls,'' said Tommy, who asked
that his full name not be used. ``That doesn't seem like him. There
are a lot of things that wouldn't surprise me about him, but
killing some tourists like that is just not Rufus.''
</P>
<P>
   The friends and acquaintances all asked not to be identified in
print. They said they feared retribution from Dykes' associates and
harassment from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no good that can come from saying you know Rufus,''
said another man, who said he grew up with Dykes. ``His name is
trouble around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI won't say what Dykes has told them about the abduction
and killings of Carol Sund, 42, of Eureka, Calif.; her daughter,
Juli, 15; and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a family friend from Argentina.
The three were on a trip to the Yosemite National Park in when they
disappeared in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Modesto Bee newspaper that investigators are
frustrated by inconsistencies in statements Dykes made.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have had difficulty corroborating much of what Dykes
has told them, and his story apparently has changed several times
since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes was arrested March 5 during a parolee sweep in the small
community of Empire outside Modesto. He now is charged with being a
convicted felon in possession of drugs and a gun. He has prior
convictions for burglary, forgery and false imprisonment of a
17-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The top FBI agent on the case and the Tuolumne County district
attorney both said last week that they believe the principal
players in the case are behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build an airtight case,'' FBI Special Agent
Nick Rossi said. It is expected that the FBI will conclude its
investigation, then hand the case over to Tuolumne County
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have interviewed more than 1,000 potential
witnesses in the investigation, focusing on a loose-knit group of
parolees in and around Modesto, many involved in the
methamphetamine trade in the mountain counties around Yosemite
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   But agents have been somewhat stymied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're dealing with individuals in the crank trade or
circles, one of the byproducts generally is these people are not as
responsible or aware of details. We're not dealing with people who
have regular jobs and regular lives,'' said FBI Agent-in-Charge
James Maddock.
</P>
<P>
   Several acquaintances of Dykes said they were shocked when they
saw published reports that Dykes' girlfriend, Maria Ledbetter,
talked to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Ledbetter told the Associated Press that ``I know in my heart he
was involved.'' She said she gave investigators Dykes' gun and
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes and his half-brother, Michael ``Mick'' Larwick, 42, are
among a group of ex-cons with violent histories the FBI has been
scrutinizing since March.
</P>
<P>
   Larwick is a Modesto resident whose criminal record stretches
back to 1975 and includes convictions for the rape of a relative
while her children cowered nearby in a car, and separate incidents
of manslaughter, assault, drug possession and attempted escape.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 16, Larwick has been in the Stanislaus County jail
awaiting trial on charges of attempting to kill a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Larwick has proclaimed his innocence in jailhouse interviews and
offered to submit to a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   None of those interviewed in Modesto on Sunday said they knew
Larwick very well. Many of them said they know two other Modesto
men whose names have been publicly linked to the investigation:
Jeffery Wayne Keeney, 32, and Kenneth Alan ``Soldier'' Stewart, 24.
</P>
<P>
   Keeney, who faces drug charges, was arrested March 26. Keeney
denied any involvement in the killings. Stewart was arrested June 7
and charged with attempted murder in an unrelated case.

   NEW YORK _ It seems he has graced the screen forever _ swinging
through the trees, fighting leopards and crocodiles, and emitting a
scream to make the elephants stampede. Raised by apes, and
believing he is one them, despite his hairless skin and loincloth,
Tarzan is one of the most indelible images on film.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1918, just six years after Edgar Rice Burroughs sold his
first version of the story, there have been more than 40 movies
based on the character, from the silent ``Tarzan of the Apes'' to
last year's ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' (which might have worked
better with no dialogue). But ``Tarzan,'' which opens Friday, marks
the first time the oft-told tale has been brought to feature-length
animated life. It was something Burroughs always wanted; he
expressed his desires in a 1936 letter to his son. Any animated
film of his most famous creation, Burroughs wrote, would have to
``approximate Disney excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily we didn't get that letter until a few months ago, when
the film was almost finished,'' joked Chris Buck, the film's
codirector. ``I'm pretty confident this film will do more than
approximate Disney excellence.''

   ``Tarzan'' is a Disney film, the studio's latest traditionally
animated movie. With a soundtrack by Phil Collins, it features the
voice talents of Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan, Minnie Driver as Jane, and
Glenn Close, Rosie O'Donnell, Nigel Hawthorne, Brian Blessed, Lance
Henriksen, and Wayne Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film, Disney's big entry in the summer movie
sweepstakes, wasn't something Buck or codirector Kevin Lima were
originally interested in pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first approached with the material, I thought, `I
don't want to make this _ I don't want to do a Tarzan film,' ''
said Buck, during an interview in a hotel smack-dab in an urban
jungle otherwise known as midtown Manhattan. ``I had Johnny
Weissmuller so stuck in my mind. But when we went back to the book
and found there was a wealth of material for this to be done in
animation, we wondered why anyone hadn't done this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs himself tried and failed in the 1930s, the height of
cinema's Tarzan fever. The first film, the 1918 ``Tarzan of the
Apes'' (starring Elmo Lincoln) was fairly faithful to Burroughs's
book, but it wasn't until 1932's ``Tarzan, the Ape Man,'' starring
former Olympic swimming champ Weissmuller, that the story really
began to swing. It took extraordinary liberties with Burroughs's
novel, but it was a welcome, entertaining respite from the doldrums
of Depression-era America. Weissmuller's semiliterate, clean-cut,
well-sculpted man of the wild became an instant icon, spawning
several sequels including ``Tarzan and His Mate'' (1934), which
introduced Maureen O'Sullivan's Jane; ``Tarzan Finds His Son,'' in
which Tarzan and Jane complete a jungle adoption of an abandoned
child _ named Boy _ played by too-cute Johnny Sheffield; and
``Tarzan's New York Adventure,'' which found Tarzan trying to
negotiate indoor plumbing and rush-hour traffic while searching for
his kidnapped son.
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise proved so successful _ it's second only to
Dracula as filmdom's favorite suject _ that other actors such as
Buster Crabbe, Lex Barker, and Jock Mahoney donned the loincloth.
Even ``George of the Jungle'' is very loosely based on Tarzan.
Other entries include 1984's deadly serious but enjoyable
``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes'' and 1981's
laughable, soft-porn ``Tarzan, the Ape Man,'' memorable only for
its obsession with what Tarzan and Jane really did in the jungle
all those years.
</P>
<P>
   In most, the back story was the same. Tarzan was raised by apes
after his shipwrecked parents became a blue-plate special for a
leopard. But what all these films could never do was portray Tarzan
as Burroughs truly imagined him. Wrote the author of his hero: ``He
could spring 20 feet across space at the dizzying height of the
forest top, and grab with unerring precision and without apparent
jar, a limb waving wildly in the path of an approaching tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much Olympic glory and athletic prowess
Weissmuller and the other Tinseltown Tarzans possessed, there
simply weren't _ and aren't _ any actors who dare risk such
superhuman feats. But as anyone who's ever watched a ``Road
Runner'' cartoon can tell you, animated flesh and bones can do
absolutely anything.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Tarzan skids down a tree limb like a rollerblader
riding the rails of a street course. Watching his acrobatic turns
and twists is like watching a skateboarder pop 540s in the
half-pipe. He's skateboard master Tony Hawk in a lioncloth, with a
physique that will have South End boys doubling their reps at the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``We patterned him after an extreme athlete,'' Lima said. ``He's
a guy who had to survive to live in this jungle. He grew up with
the gorillas, but he also mimics other animals. So we thought of an
extreme athlete and his psyche, what's he all about. No live actor
can do what our guy can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief animator Glen Keane styled the character's movement on his
own son's skateboarding exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Glen, the inspiration for Tarzan was there in his house,''
Lima said. ``Those movements would make it a little different, and
give it that edge to make it speak to a contemporary audience. This
will be an introduction to a whole new generation of kids. We
didn't want it to take over _ we didn't want Tarzan to talk like a
surf dude. But we thought the living-on-the-edge physicality and
mentality could really pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   With an animated feature, Buck and Lima found they could more
fully explore Tarzan's ability to talk with his animal friends _
and what's a Disney film without wisecracking creatures?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can actually talk to the animals,'' said Lima, ``and they
can talk back, so we can have a sense of who Tarzan is as a person
and what it was like to grow up in the jungle with these
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan's best pal is Terk, a Mohawk-coiffed jokey gorilla who
looks like (and we mean this in the nicest possible way) the woman
who supplies his voice, Rosie O'Donnell. Many of the characters,
especially Driver's Jane and Hawthorne's Professor Porter, bear
more than a passing resemblance to those who lend them their
voices.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a coincidence. The characters are drawn after the voice
talent signs on, Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tends to happen is we cast the actors as we're doing
exploratory drawing, so we already have an idea of where we want to
go with the character,'' he said. ``We have a tendency at times to
pull facial expressions or attitudes into the character. Rosie
looks like Terk because we used her mouth, and the way she uses her
mouth as an actress is very specific. We also videotaped the vocal
recording sessions so the animator gets a copy of what the voice
talents did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was one particular aspect of Tarzan that Lima and
Buck refused to mess with _ that loincloth. No matter how skimpy,
that loincloth has always seemed out of place since Tarzan believes
he's an ape, and none of the other apes are so modest about their
nudity. (Of course, this being a family film, no one wanted to give
the notion of Tarzan swinging through the jungle a whole new
interpretation.) But Buck insisted that keeping Tarzan's
tried-and-true fashion sense intact was necessary for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the pop icons we associate with the character, and
I think we wanted to hold onto certain things, like the yell and
the stampede of elephants,'' he said. ``These were things we wanted
to see, and we felt an audience would want to see.''

   THERAPIES: A Fountain of Youth, in Music Class
</P>
<P>
   A new study has found that teaching healthy elderly people to
play music decreases their anxiety, depression and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   The study, undertaken jointly by the universities of Miami,
South Florida, Kansas, Western Michigan, Michigan State and the
Karolinska Medical Institute in Sweden, examined 130 retired people
in an effort to link learning music with wellness. Sixty-one of the
retirees learned to play the organ over a period of two 10-week
semesters while 69 other participants did not.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers ranked the participants according to the Mental
Health Inventory Anxiety Scores, the Profile of Mood States
Depression/Dejection Scores and the UCLA loneliness scale before
and after the semesters.
</P>
<P>
   They noted a marked decrease in anxiety, depression and
loneliness among those retirees who were attending the music
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is the oldest method of relaxation in the world,'' said
Mahendra Kumar, professor in the department of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at the University of Miami School of Medicine
and one of the contributors to the study. ``We've studied the
effects of music on patients who suffer from dementia. Music
therapy seemed to help. We thought if healthy elderly people
learned music, they may not have as much depression, anxiety or
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also took blood samples from the participants
before the first lesson and after the participants completed the
last lesson in order to monitor any changes in hormone levels that
may be associated with wellness. They found that elderly
participants who received group music lessons increased their
levels of human growth hormone (hGH).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say this hormone is the source of eternal youth,'' Dr.
Kumar said. While there was no doubt that when the elderly
participants learned to play the organ hGH levels increased in
their bodies, there was debate over the effect this hormone had on
well being. Although the indications are positive, some researchers
say more research is needed
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pauline Maki, a fellow at the National Institute on Aging,
said, ``We're far from being able to say that hGH is something you
could give to elderly people to enhance their well being because we
haven't established similar results in large-scale clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we can say we've found the fountain of youth, we have
to test the water.''

   NOSTRUMS: Poor Grades for Thigh-Reducing Creams
</P>
<P>
   The act of slathering on expensive thigh-reducing creams may
provide an upper body workout, but users should not expect to see
weight loss in their thighs, a new study reports.
</P>
<P>
   The research, presented recently at the annual American College
of Sports Medicine conference in Seattle, showed no significant
reduction in thigh circumference when overweight and normal-weight
women applied the creams for six weeks. Unlike previous research in
which the subjects, who were obese, also dieted and exercised, the
11 women in this small study were asked not to change their
exercise or eating routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did we find no difference in each volunteer's thighs
at the end, but the volunteers themselves said they could see and
feel no difference either,'' said Dr. Bonita Marks, assistant
professor of exercise and sport science at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that the active ingredient in thigh-reducing
creams, aminophylline, dissolves some fat cells. With that in mind,
manufacturers began putting it in creams.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Peters, owner of Alchemy Health and Beauty Products in
Las Vegas, sells four ounces of a sculpturing cream for $19.95 and
contends that it works. ``I personally tried it and lost half an
inch in the thigh area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About $17 million worth of such firming cream products were sold
in the United States last year, according to NPD Beauty Trends,
which tracks sales of beauty products.

   &UR; SAFETY: When Children and Guns Live Together &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners who are parents tend to be more careful about storing
their weapons than gun owners without children _ but both groups
are more careless than they should be, according to a recently
published study.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 survey of 5,285 households by researchers from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, about
one-third reported having at least one firearm at home or in a car.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, whose results were published this month in the
Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, found that 21
percent of the gun owners kept at least one firearm loaded and in
an unlocked setting. Thirty percent kept the guns unloaded and
locked up, and the rest fell somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   In households with children, 41 percent kept their weapons
unloaded and locked and out of reach, while 11 percent left them
loaded and unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Guns rank high among hazards to youngsters in the United States,
the researchers wrote, citing previously unpublished C.D.C. figures
that list firearms as the second-leading cause of death to children
between 10 and 14, and the eighth-leading cause for those ages 1 to
4.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elise Becher, an assistant professor of pediatrics and
health policy at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,
who did not take part in the study, said that previous research had
established that the presence of a gun raises the household's risk
of a death by homicide, suicide or accidental discharge. ``You
don't make your family safer by getting a gun to protect against
intruders,'' she said. ``You make your family safer by keeping any
gun you have locked in one place and the ammunition locked up
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate recently passed, and the House will soon begin
considering, gun-control measures, including a requirement that
handguns be sold with trigger locks to reduce the risk of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead researcher, Dr. Gail Stennies, said the article
had been accepted for publication last fall and that its appearance
now was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stennies said she hoped the study would underscore the need
to treat gun injuries as a preventive health issue. ``We hope it
would be on the checklist of routine preventive messages, like
bicycle helmets, boat safety and vaccinations,'' she said.

   Revenge of the Bugs
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain sense of satisfaction that comes from
plugging in the electric bug zapper on a hot summer evening, the
knowledge that every zzzzzzzzzttt! means one less fly to flit on
the potato salad, one less mosquito to feast on a forearm.
</P>
<P>
   But the bugs, it seems, may be getting their revenge _ going
out, if not in a blaze of glory, then at least in a shower of
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of a team of researchers at Kansas State
University, who studied what happens when an insect is electrocuted
in a bug zapper. In brief, the heat from the electrical charge
causes the insect to explode. It is not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a particularly healthy one either, because the heat is
not enough to kill all of the bacteria and viruses on and in the
bug. So the result is a cloud of insect particles that, depending
on where the bug has been spending its time, could be more or less
contaminated. The researchers recommend that the zappers not be
used near food.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dusty Solar System &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The solar system could stand a good dusting. There are tiny
grains everywhere, many of them concentrated in the ring systems of
the larger planets.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have long thought that this dust is created by other
dust _ interplanetary particles that hit moons or other bodies in
the solar system at high speed, ejecting puffs of debris into
space. Now, measurements from the Galileo spacecraft orbiting
Jupiter have provided the first direct evidence of dust begetting
dust.
</P>
<P>
   The research, by scientists from Germany, Russia and the United
States, used data from a detector aboard the spacecraft taken as it
drew near Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede. The instrument, kind of
a high-tech dust mop, measures the mass of grains as well as their
direction and speed.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who reported their findings in the journal
Nature, found that the source of the dust around Ganymede was the
moon itself. The data are also consistent with the dust being
created by high-speed impacts of other particles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dust forms a thin cloud around Ganymede, but some of
it is ejected at high enough speeds to escape the moon's gravity
completely, and is then drawn into Jupiter's ring system. The
researchers note that the planet's larger moons supply less dust
than the smaller ones, because the larger moons' stronger
gravitational fields allow fewer grains to escape.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Underwater Arsenic &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hydrothermal vents, those fissures in the sea floor that spew
scalding water laden with minerals and chemicals, create some of
the most inhospitable environments anywhere. And among vents, few
could be worse than those in the shallow waters of Tutum Bay, off
Ambitle Island in Papua New Guinea, which produce the highest
concentrations of arsenic found in any marine setting.
</P>
<P>
   The vents pump about three pounds of arsenic into the small bay
every day. Since, as fans of murder mysteries know, arsenic is
highly toxic, it might be expected that marine life in the bay
would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by scientists from the University of Ottawa and the
Geological Survey of Canada found that this was not the case. The
diversity and health of the coral reef at Tutum Bay is
indistinguishable from similar reefs that do not have hydrothermal
vents. The researchers found that coral skeletons and clam shells
did not even contain elevated levels of arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described their work in the journal
Environmental Science and Technology, determined that the arsenic
was controlled by dilution, and by incorporation into iron
compounds that precipitate out of the seawater when the fluid from
the vents mixes with seawater. The findings, they suggest, could
help in developing new methods to treat arsenic contamination in
other settings.

HARDLY OUT OF DIAPERS AND NOW INTO YOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By RANDI HUTTER EPSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I was the oldest one in the exercise class by nearly
30 years, and I'm only 36. As a yoga novice, Jack, my 5-year-old,
was allowed to bring his mother along.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga for kids, I soon learned, is a burgeoning industry _ a
recent outgrowth of the latest adult trend. There are courses for
children and mommy-and-me yoga classes. There are books galore and
video tapes. We now own the video, ``E-i-E-i Yoga.'' It is of the
Barney ilk with farmer Yogi Oki Doki replacing the purple dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors say that the increased flexibility and strength yoga
provides improve children's abilities in other sports. I was even
told about toddlers who, through yoga lessons, learn to take deep
breaths instead of throwing tantrums and kindergartners who put
themselves to sleep by imagining gardens. Teachers say yoga helps
pre-teen and teen-age girls feel comfortable with their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   I was skeptical but figured even if these claims were only
partly accurate, I had a lot to gain. I envisioned a calm, peaceful
household. After a few sessions, my children would live in peace
and serenity. My body-mind-connected children would take deep
breaths, do a yoga pose and learn to share.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and I started with a class just for children at Jivamukti,
a yoga studio in Manhattan. I was told that these kids-only classes
were more playful than courses with parents, which are geared
toward ``family bonding.'' Our class was in a large lavender room
with photographs of Indian yogis.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's enthusiasm plummeted as soon as he realized he was the
only boy and the only beginner in a class with five lithe, giggly,
blonde girls, ranging in age from about 6 to 9. Their mothers
either took classes for adults in nearby studios or waited in the
neighborhood until the class ended. As a first-timer, I was allowed
to stay and take the class with Jack. The teacher, Kate Donovan,
assured us that no level of fitness was necessary to do yoga. The
only requirement is comfortable clothing and bare feet to avoid
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   We sat in two rows facing each other, sitting with our legs in a
pretzel, as one instructor gave commands and the other helped us
get in proper form. ``We need a really cool thing to inspire us,''
Ms. Donovan said. ``Ganesh is powerful,'' she said, pointing to the
Indian god on her T-shirt. ``Whenever we think we have a problem,
we can think of Ganesh. We can also chant.''
</P>
<P>
   Next she told us to cup our hands over our ears and listen. That
sound of nothing is ``om.'' Jack giggled. One of the girls said she
chanted with her family at home.
</P>
<P>
   Then we started our poses, the Asanas. They are derived from
yogis' in India mimicking animals. That fact offered a twist for
children. We got on all fours, yelled, ``moo,'' we arched our backs
and ``meowed.'' There was also a ``downward dog'' pose, known as
``adho mukha svasana.'' We made our bodies into an upside-down
``V'' _ our legs straight, buttocks in the air and palms on the
ground. We arched our heads upward.
</P>
<P>
   We did a tree pose, also called ``virksasana.'' That was the
easiest one. We balanced on one leg, toes spread apart, and the
other leg bent so that foot would rest on our thigh. Then we
extended our arms, like branches, and faced our palms upward.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donovan started slowly and then increased the pace. Our
classmates, ever so flexible, were an intimidating bunch. Jack took
his mat and dragged it far away from the girls. I started to regret
that I had lured him here. I realized quickly that I should have
brought Jack with one of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   After a few more animal poses, we did some deep breathing and
then headstands against the back wall. Then we lay on our backs
while Ms. Donovan told us a Hindi tale and gave each child a head
massage. Finally, we placed our palms together pointing upward and
chanted a final ``om.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack whispered, ``I'm not coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   As newcomers, we were sent home with the video, ``E-i-E-i
Yoga,'' which, surprisingly, Jack and his younger brother and
sister watch repeatedly. Though he says he will not go back to that
class, he does yoga poses around the house, lectures to his
siblings about its benefits (he has memorized the video) and even
asked me to take him to another class with school friends.
</P>
<P>
   My second yoga class was for parents and children at the Reebok
Club, also in Manhattan. Jack backed out so I brought my twin
3-year-olds, Martha and Joseph. It was quite a contrast to the
downtown class. The instructor was a sliver of a woman who played
the popular '70s cassette of Marlo Thomas singing ``Free to Be, You
and Me.'' We did a few poses that required two people and were told
to feel free to make up our own movements around the room.
</P>
<P>
   There were about four other girls, ranging in age from about 8
to 12, and their mothers. It seemed more like a stretching class
than yoga. Most of the participants had never done yoga before and
did not seem very interested. Maybe they were killing time before a
spinning class.
</P>
<P>
   We started the class sitting with with our legs in a pretzel,
palms facing upward. Then we did some basic poses, including
``downward dog.'' Then we did poses with our children. We sat on
the floor with our legs spread apart facing one another and holding
hands, rocking back and forth. During the free-form time, I just
could not get myself to frolic around the room like the instructor.
My children went right for the crayons and coloring books in my bag
and proceeded to color in the middle of a gym mat. I think they
were bored and so was I.
</P>
<P>
   After two classes and weeks of the yoga for kids video, I am
starting to become convinced that yoga can aid children physically
and emotionally. Mine have fun stretching and mimicking animals.
They try to make up their own poses. But my house with three yoga
kids is no calmer than in our pre-yoga days. But then, again, we
are just novices. There is still hope.
</P>
<P>
   Many yoga studios and some health clubs offer classes for
children or classes for parents and children, usually costing about
$10 a session. Having your child watch a video or read a book about
yoga before the class will acquaint them with poses.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ It must be maddening to be a Republican in Congress
these days.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers' near-universal loathing of President Clinton
drives them to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   They agree on no principles or policies. Gun control? Chaos.
Social Security? Ditto. Budget priorities? Double ditto.
</P>
<P>
   What they have aplenty is pure petulance.
</P>
<P>
   Their only common bond is their unconcealed distrust of a
president they have been unable to destroy. What passes for a
governing philosophy is automatic opposition to anything Clinton is
for, no matter how meritorious.
</P>
<P>
   Their selfish reaction to the Serbian troop withdrawal from
Kosovo was shameful. They acted as though the success of NATO's
bombing campaign was a personal insult. Once again Clinton had
slipped through their fingers just as they were about to close
their hands around his throat.
</P>
<P>
   What sore losers. Throughout the crisis they had grumbled that
Clinton was going about things all wrong, calling it ``Clinton's
war'' and blaming him rather than Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for the torture and destruction of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They predicted Clinton would fold and NATO fly apart. They
didn't support the air strikes and they didn't want to send in
ground troops either. They didn't vote to finance the bombing until
it was practically over.
</P>
<P>
   They displayed little pity for the Kosovo refugees but groused
endlessly about NATO bombing errors that killed Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., was typical. After the Serbian
retreat began, he condemned Clinton for having ``destroyed a
country.'' Funny, we thought it was Milosevic that destroyed the
country with his campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' by killing,
raping and driving Kosovars from their homeland. NATO airstrikes
did not trigger that campaign. Milosevic had been secretly working
up to it for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a humanitarian disaster,'' harrumphed Assistant Senate
Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla. We know that. But we also know
it would have been worse had NATO not forced Milosevic to pay such
a heavy economic and political price that he finally gave in. We
were slow to move, and Milosevic held out longer than we had
anticipated, but we did stop the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans never put forth a realistic alternative of their
own. They saw all sorts of problems but offered no good solutions.
They talked stupidly about making ever more diplomatic overtures
while the Kosovars were being slaughtered. ``Give peace a chance,''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., whined long after it
was clear that Milosevic understood only force.
</P>
<P>
   They simply didn't want to have anything to do with the Balkans,
regardless of the consequences for the inhabitants and the rest of
Europe. Foreign policy is Clinton's responsibility, and by golly
they weren't going to give him a hand. So much for the good old
days when partisanship ended at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   As the cease-fire was reached, House Republicans wanted to cut
off funding for peacekeeping forces in Kosovo by Oct. 1, abandoning
the refugees to their cruel fate just to spite Clinton. But after
the president sent an urgent letter, common sense prevailed and the
proposal was hastily killed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton deserves credit here for standing tall and doing the
right thing, however messy and inept the handling of it. His
stomach for military fire was put to the test, and he passed. ``The
dangers of acting,'' he had said, ``are far outweighed by the
dangers of not acting.'' Despite the GOP's carping, he did not
fold.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had backed the NATO mission, was
one of few Republicans to concede that Clinton had won a victory.
So was Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
who credited Clinton with holding NATO together and getting
European leaders to promise they would bear the major cost of
rebuilding Kosovo. Warner predicted that NATO's toughness will
contribute to stability in Europe and ``deter anyone else from
trying to duplicate what Milosevic did.''
</P>
<P>
   But their voices were drowned out by all the Republican
sourpusses. What they think they gain politically by refusing to
acknowledge the obvious is a puzzlement. They look cranky,
small-minded and unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the 2000 GOP presidential
frontrunner, tried to diminish Clinton's success by raising new
questions he knows perfectly well the president cannot answer at
this point. ``We need to hear from him when the troops will be
coming home,'' Bush said. If that is the new GOP line, it won't
sell. Americans will come home when the job is done, and no one can
say now how long that will take.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself is being cautious about his victory because
there is much left to be done to restore decent living conditions
and sanity to the Balkans. Besides, Milosevic remains in power
although he is now an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But unless some dramatic disaster intervenes, Kosovo will not be
the political burden for Clinton and Vice President Al Gore that
the Republicans had hoped. It may even be a plus as the memory
fades of the tactical mistakes and the wisdom of the strategic
policy of a new internationalism sinks in.

A SHINY GADGET CAPTURES CHAOS IN LIGHT BEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (nk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The apparatus is simple enough for a child to construct, and the
kaleidoscopic images it generates fascinate onlookers with their
dazzling complexity. But this is not a toy; it is a tool for
studying the effects of chaos on light beams.
</P>
<P>
   The device, assembled by three physicists at the University of
Maryland, is little more than a stack of four reflective balls
similar to Christmas tree ornaments. In their study of stacked
balls, published recently in the journal Nature, Dr. Edward Ott,
Dr. James A. Yorke and a graduate student, David Sweet, described
an experiment with their shiny gadget as ``a simple laboratory
demonstration of an interesting type of fractal geometry.''
</P>
<P>
   When a light beam enters the array of balls, its image is
chopped into shards that appear to copy themselves in an infinite
progression of steps to ever smaller scales.
</P>
<P>
   Fractal geometry is a field of mathematics founded in 1975 by
Dr. Benoit Mandelbrot. Since then, many mathematicians and
scientists have professed to see fractal patterns almost everywhere
in nature.
</P>
<P>
   A fractal is a pattern that is irregular, but self-similar at
all size scales; for example, a small patch of ground may have the
same general appearance as a larger patch or even a huge area seen
from high above. Mountain ranges, in which small piles of rocks may
look like diminutive versions of the peaks towering above them, are
often cited as examples of fractals in nature.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland fractal generator consists of four
mirrored balls, each of them one foot in diameter. (However, Ott
said in an interview, the original version was assembled from
ordinary Christmas-tree decorations.)
</P>
<P>
   Three of the balls are placed in a triangular pattern on a flat
surface, each one touching the other two. A fourth ball is placed
on top, in contact with the first three, making a simple pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The ``inner chamber'' bounded by the balls was specified by the
scientists as a tetrahedron (a solid with four sides, each an
equilateral triangle) defined by imaginary straight lines between
the centers of all four balls. When a flashlight with a
high-intensity bulb is aimed from the proper direction at one of
the faces of this imaginary tetrahedron, the light is reflected by
all four balls, and a viewer looking into the tetrahedron sees a
spectacular fractal light pattern.
</P>
<P>
   To improve contrast between the shards making up the fractal
image, the physicists assembled the array on top of a sheet of
white paper lighted from beneath. Blue paper was then placed
against one side of the pyramid of stacked balls and red paper
against a second side. The red and blue paper was illuminated by
reflections of the light coming up through the white paper. By
turning off the laboratory lights, the remaining side of the
tetrahedron produced black reflections, giving the resulting
fractal patterns a mixture of four colors _ red, blue, white and
black.
</P>
<P>
   A viewer (or camera) looking into the black face was then
treated to a beautiful fractal array, in which slivers of color
appeared in ever receding patterns, created by the almost endless
reflective bounces light undergoes inside the chamber bounded by
the four balls.
</P>
<P>
   The image captured by a camera exhibits many boundaries between
different colors, like those between states on a map, Ott said. But
in the fractal pattern created by the four balls, he said, a tiny
circle placed astride any boundary between colors will always
contain all four colors, however small the circle is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   In both experiments and computer simulations, it is possible to
calculate the complicated paths that light beams take as they
bounce among the four silvered balls. But beyond a certain huge
number of reflections, Ott said, it becomes impossible to predict
the path the light will take.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the beam becomes a victim of chaos, and its path
can be computed again only if it chances to leave the trap.
</P>
<P>
   Chaotic scattering is a subject that interests topologists,
mathematicians specializing in the nature of shapes. But the
mathematics, Sweet said, apply not only to topology theory but to
chemical reactions, celestial mechanics, fluid flow and quantum
cosmology, among other fields.
</P>
<P>
   One of the objects of their project, Ott said, is to compare
details of computer simulations of light paths with actual
laboratory experiments. The team intends to experiment with other
reflective systems, including a tube with a square, mirrored
interior containing a reflective ellipsoid.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeline Albright will meet with Russian counterparts in coming
days to attempt to resolve the dispute over Russia's role in the
NATO-led peacekeeping campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a small but politically significant contingent of Russian
troops continued to maintain control of the Pristina airport,
President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke by
telephone for the second day in a row about the impasse over
Russia's role.
</P>
<P>
   But with no end in sight to the impasse, NATO generals
downplayed the significance of the Russian military presence and
decided not to deploy British and French troops at the airport
occupied by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, asserting that it played a significant part in
brokering an end to the war and the withdrawal of Serb forces from
the Kosovo province, wants a more prominent peacekeeping role not
bound by the command structure of NATO. Russia, a traditional ally
of the Serbs and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, wants its
troops to patrol a separate enclave of Kosovo, in addition to the
five that have been divided between the NATO forces of the United
States, Britain, Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia must have ``a considerable role in the political
resolution of the Kosovo conflict, including the international
peacekeeping operation under the U.N. aegis,'' Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin told a security council meeting called to discuss
the standoff with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told reporters at the White House that she and Cohen
would travel to Helsinki, Finland, ``in the next few days'' for
meetings with Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev and
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she and Cohen would seek to ``work out the
longer-term issues about the participation of Russians'' in the
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott left Moscow on Sunday
after three days of unsuccessful talks.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin spoke with Vice President Al Gore. No details of the
conversation were available.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian force of about 200 troops, which had been on
peacekeeping duty in Bosnia, entered Kosovo early Saturday before
the first NATO troops and took control of the small airport in
Pristina, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news media also reported that Yeltsin and his generals
took the decision without informing his defense and foreign
ministers. Nor did he consult Viktor Chernomyrdin, presidential
aspirant and special Russian envoy to the Balkans who helped
negotiate an end to the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sending a signal to the West about Russia's
desire to play a prominent role in the Balkans, a region Moscow
once dominated during the Soviet era, the move was widely viewed in
Moscow as a domestic power play by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president, dogged by illness and fading political
power as he enters the final year of his second term as president,
sought to remind Russia's political circles that he is in charge
and maintains close ties to the country's military command
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin meant to explain who is the master in the house,'' the
newspaper Noviya Gazeta wrote on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry expressed concern Monday that the
NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo were not disarming members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin complained to Clinton about KLA threats against Russian
troops and continuing ``provocations'' that were causing Serbs to
flee the province. He said this threatened to unravel the whole
process of regulating the crisis, his press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has about 10,000 troops, including airborne and special
forces units, standing by at air bases to travel to Kosovo to join
the peacekeeping mission. But the troops will not move until a
political decision is reached to define Russia's role, according to
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unclear whether Russia could afford to supply and
maintain a large peacekeeping contingent under its current budget
woes. Russia is currently negotiating with the West for financial
assistance to help it recover from an ongoing economic crisis that
hit last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generals are breaking their lances over the question of
whether there will be a separate zone of responsibility for the
Russian contingent. But at the same time, the Defense Ministry has
no money for the maintenance of the contingent in Kosovo. This
means that, in addition to asserting their right to play the
decisive role in the peacekeeping, we have to ask the aggressors
for money,'' Sevodnya newspaper wrote.

THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER LEARNS TO THINK IN REVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When people hear the words ``computer scientist,'' they might
imagine a white-coated figure carefully arranging chips into
circuitry. Or they might picture a bleary-eyed programmer trying to
exterminate a bug from glowing lines of code on a video screen. But
at the upper reaches of the craft, computer science can be as
ethereal and abstract as theoretical physics, driven by thought
experiments as bold as those of Einstein, who imagined what it
would be like to ride a light beam through the sky.
</P>
<P>
   What is the most powerful computer the laws of physics would
allow? When computer scientists entertain this question, they are
not simply wondering how great a machine mere mortals might build
someday. They are imagining an almost angelic device that meshes so
perfectly with the very structure of nature that it works with the
highest efficiency possible, an ideal the engineers can then strive
to match.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the universe itself can be thought of as a giant
computer, orchestrating the movements of the stars, the planets,
even the subatomic particles. The goal then is to learn to compute
the way nature does.
</P>
<P>
   An important step toward this goal was recently taken at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, where scientists have developed a radically different
kind of experimental computer chip called Flattop. In the device,
named after a local pool hall, Flattop Johnny's, the problem to be
solved is converted into a vanishingly tiny billiard game. Bits of
information bounce around like billiard balls, carrying out
calculations far more efficiently than in an ordinary computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a lie to say it's bug free,'' said Dr. Tom Knight,
the leader of the project, which also included Dr. Norman Margolus
and MIT students Michael Frank, Carlin Vieri, M. Josephine Ammer
and Nicole Love. ``But it's a convincing enough demonstration. It's
a stake in the ground. It says, `Here, look, you can do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing thing about billiard ball computers _ first
envisioned in the 1970s _ is that they are, like the universe
itself, reversible. If you observe the solar system, you can work
backward from any point and determine where the planets were days,
centuries or millennia ago. The information is conserved. The same
is true of perfectly elastic billiard balls on a frictionless
surface. At any moment, you can reverse the action, re-creating the
starting position of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But an ordinary computer is irreversible, grating against the
natural grain of the universe. Once it churns out an answer, there
is no way to go back and find out what the question was. Suppose
you pick up a pocket calculator someone has left on a table and the
display says ``4.'' Did someone punch in 2 plus 2, 3 plus 1,
438,988 minus 438,984, or 239,465 times 0 plus 4? There is no way
to know. The information describing the history of the calculation
has been discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The data have not disappeared from the universe, which would
violate a law requiring that information be conserved. According to
the second law of thermodynamics, every one of those lost bits is
shed as a minuscule puff of heat. The information is out there in
the air somewhere but beyond any reasonable hope of retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   In a modern digital computer, this shedding of information
occurs at every step in the long, rapid chains of calculations.
Seemingly useless, intermediate results are discarded to reset the
memory registers, adding to the heat that must be removed from the
machine to keep the parts from malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources of heat _ like that caused by the drag of
electrical resistance on electrons moving through wires _ can be
reduced indefinitely as technology improves. (In superconducting
components, electricity moves unimpeded.) Or one can reduce
resistance simply by running a machine more slowly. But in the
early 1960s, Dr. Rolf Landauer of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., proved that no matter how close
engineers come to eliminating these other sources of waste, a
minimal, irreducible amount of heat must inevitably be shed
whenever a computer clears its memory by erasing a one or a zero.
Landauer, who died in April, showed that this loss per bit, the
``thermodynamic cost of forgetting,'' is required by the laws of
physics.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1973 that Landauer's colleague, Dr. Charles
Bennett, found a way around this problem. If the unwanted bits were
never discarded, then this final source of waste would disappear. A
specially designed computer could grind through a chain of
calculations, saving every intermediary result in its memory. There
would be no heat-wasting erasures.
</P>
<P>
   Unless such a machine had an infinitely large memory, however,
it would eventually become clogged with this extraneous data. To
continue, the computer would have to be reset. That is where
reversibility comes in. The computer, having saved everything,
would have a complete record of its history, how it got from the
beginning to the end of the calculation. So, one could simply run
it backward, rewinding the machine to the beginning of the problem,
without erasing a single bit.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time as Bennett's insight, an MIT scientist,
Edward Fredkin, realized a particularly elegant way to think about
reversible computation _ as a cybernetic billiard game. The essence
of any digital computer is its ability to convert a problem into a
sequence of ones and zeroes, shuffling them to produce the answer.
In the imaginary Fredkin machine, the green felt of the billiard
table is scored off into a grid. At each intersection, the presence
or absence of a ball represents a one or a zero. A problem to be
solved is converted into a pattern of balls, which then ricochet
off one another and bounce against reflecting ``mirrors'' like
those in a pinball machine. The final configuration represents the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   If the balls were perfectly elastic and the table surface
friction-free, then the billiard ball computer would operate with
no loss of energy whatsoever. That is impossible, of course. But
the point was that, through clever engineering, there was no limit
to how closely one could approach this ideal. Because the system
was reversible, the mandatory energy loss from erasing bits would
not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Efficient as such a system would be, there would still be
drawbacks. In a complex calculation, the extra memory needed to
save all the intermediary ``garbage bits'' can grow wildly. As a
compromise, Bennett devised a memory-saving method in which a
computer would carry out a few steps of the calculation, copy the
result and rewind. Then, starting with the copied result, it would
take a few more steps. He likened the method to crossing a river
using just a few stepping stones: one must backtrack to pick up the
stones left behind, placing them in the path ahead. While the
procedure would consume less memory, it would require more
computational steps, slowing down the calculation. To computer
scientists, this was a classic tradeoff: pay the computational cost
with either memory space or processing time.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the idea of reversible computation was further
developed by other researchers, including Margolus and Dr. Tommaso
Toffoli at MIT. But even with the refinements, reversible computers
remained academic. How would you actually design a billiard table
that computed? The problem was to map the metaphor of ricocheting
balls onto the fluctuating voltages inside a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   Small strides have been made in recent years with so-called
adiabatic circuits, which cleverly avoid some of the costly
erasures. (In thermodynamics, ``adiabatic'' refers to reactions
that happen without the loss or gain of heat.) If a computer needs
to clear a register that says ``1,'' for example, it might simply
subtract the digit instead of erasing it and expending the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reversibility felt like an austerely beautiful thing,''
Bennett said. ``It seemed like almost a math game that had its own
elegance. Then people started building real computer circuits.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the recent development of Flattop that a fully
reversible chip existed. The device, only about as complex (and not
as powerful) as the 8080 chips that drove the first PC's, is purely
experimental, an ``existence proof'' that such things can be made.
But the scientists have plenty of time to tinker with improvements.
Today's inefficient computers cast off far more heat than what is
lost from the thermodynamic cost of forgetting. Reducing this waste
will occupy engineers for at least another decade.

CAN'T GET ENOUGH JERKY? THERE IS A CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Codee Hayes, 9, doesn't invite her little friends
over for tea parties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the girls like to make up a fresh batch of beef jerky,
discussing the latest trends in Barbie while the family oven slowly
dries meat into a succulent snack.
</P>
<P>
   Why go out for jerky when you can make it at home?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Codee's father, Mike, thought when his son, Casey,
24, became overwhelmed with orders for wild-game jerky at his meat
processing plant in Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' wife, Cathy, began to help out as Casey fell behind in
production during last fall's elk season. The plant does custom
butchering for hunters who bag deer, elk, buffalo and even the odd
zebra and want it turned into steaks, chops, sausages and salami.
</P>
<P>
   And jerky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much demand for jerky, he couldn't keep up with
production,'' says Hayes, a retired detective sergeant for the Mesa
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In stores, good beef jerky can cost as much as $2 an ounce,
Hayes says. Now he and his wife have started packaging the
seasonings and curing ingredients to turn 25 pounds of raw meat
into jerky for a fraction of that cost.
</P>
<P>
   Made from commercially manufactured spices, Jerky At Home comes
as a kit _ a bag of spices and a bag of cure packed in a box
suitable for gift-giving. It is sold at $13.95 a pack by mail with
no additional cost for postage and handling.
</P>
<P>
   The price is strictly an introductory offer, Hayes says. Once
the company starts rolling, the price will increase.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes touts the simplicity of his recipe. A lean cut of meat,
such as boneless round or London broil, is cut into strips. Any
length will do, but the strips must be one-quarter inch thick for
optimum results.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonings are sprinkled on both sides of the strips. The cure,
which is made of sodium nitrate, can be used to preserve the jerky.
Jerky that will be eaten within a few days need not be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Cured meat could last almost indefinitely, Hayes says, or
``until the mice eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the meat has been seasoned and refrigerated overnight, it
goes into a warm oven, not more than 200 degrees, spread out on the
metal rack. Drying will take about four hours in a convection oven,
six to eight hours in a regular oven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so simple. It's effortless,'' Hayes says. ``The hardest
part of making this jerky is parking in the parking lot of the
grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes makes frequent batches to keep on hand when friends stop
by. He doesn't know how long it stays fresh. It's eaten too fast to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   Intense flavor is what makes the product so good, he says. Jerky
At Home comes in five varieties: regular, Cajun, pepper, teriyaki
and hot teriyaki. The spicy pepper flavor is his favorite.
</P>

   Made from lean meat, jerky is also a more healthful snack than
cookies and candy, Hayes says. It can be made from almost any kind
of meat, including beef, game and turkey. Hayes, a recreational
fisherman, once made jerky from striped bass. It wasn't bad, he
says, but he hasn't been tempted to try fish jerky again.
</P>
<P>
   His son has made jerky from caribou, bear and a zebra one hunter
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Pork should not be used, because the meat is not cooked at a
high enough temperature to kill trichinosis, a disease caused by a
tiny nematode worm.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlesnake? Too small. Too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Beef is best, Hayes says, and the leaner the meat, the better
the jerky.

   Jerky At Home can be ordered via the Internet by logging onto
www.jerkyathome.com or by writing to M&AMP;C Hayes Enterprises Inc. at
P.O. Box 22067, Mesa, AZ 85277-2067.
</P>
<P>
   Jerky's reputation as being tasty but tough need not intimidate
customers who no longer have their own teeth, Hayes says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit there and gum it,'' he promises denture wearers.
``Eventually, it will dissolve.'' &QL;

IMPLANT TRANSFORMS PARKINSON'S SUFFERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When she gets married this fall, Paige Bremer wants to
release butterflies at the ceremony to remind her friends and
family of the power of change.
</P>
<P>
   With a tiny device placed inside her brain, Bremer is undergoing
a transformation of her own as her body's tremors and rigidity from
Parkinson's disease are electrically lulled into calmness.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer, 31, is the first Arizonan to have a stimulator implanted
4 inches deep into her brain to control her body's movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has made all the difference in my life,'' said Bremer,
who is no longer physically exhausted by trying to fight her body's
errant movements.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer, of Scottsdale, underwent surgery in early May at Barrow
Neurological Institute. Last week, she went in for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   But she already knew how much she had improved.
</P>
<P>
   She recently hiked five miles near Carefree, Ariz. It was the
first time in 18 months that she had been able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had done that before, I would have been physically
exhausted for days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can definitely say that it is worth the risk. Anything that
helps give you control back is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bremer is used to being at the forefront. Parkinson's affects
500,000 Americans but only a handful of people younger than 30.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle-control disorder is caused when the brain doesn't
produce a chemical called dopamine. Without it, the brain sends out
jumbled messages, causing the body to have tremors, rigidity, slow
movement and balance problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer remembers attending one of her first Parkinson's support
groups and being asked if she was there for her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   At first, even she had a hard time believing it herself. At 21
years old, while she was attending Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff, her left hand started to shake. Bremer convinced herself
it wasn't important. She continued working, hiking, rock-climbing,
even though her hands shook and her feet dragged.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until three years later, when her family stepped in,
that she finally went to a doctor and was told she has Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer was put on medication that began to supply her body with
dopamine. Eventually, side effects from the drug caused her body to
have different kinds of uncontrollable movements.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer's condition worsened. It took her 20 minutes to pull her
hair back into a ponytail. She couldn't cut her own food and found
it excruciatingly difficult to open a can of soda.
</P>
<P>
   During her exams, her neurologist, Dr. Mark Stacy, would conduct
a ``pull test'' in which he would tug on her shoulders. It only
took a mere touch to throw Bremer off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be so sad we didn't even do the test anymore,''
Stacy said.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy, who is the director of the Muhammad Ali Parkinson
Research Center at Barrow, told Bremer about the possibility of
implanting electrodes into her brain _ in essence a brain
pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow surgeons had already performed about 35 operations,
implanting the device into the thalamus, which acts as a relay
center for movement.
</P>
<P>
   The thalamic implant was developed in Europe when surgeons
realized they already knew which part of the brain controlled
movement because they operated on it to minimize tremors. Instead
of cutting that piece of the brain, why not figure out a way to
permanently stimulate it?
</P>
<P>
   But Stacy wanted to go deeper into the brain _ about one-half
inch deeper into the subthalamus, an even more specialized area for
movement. Going deeper would help Bremer with her rigidity and
movement problems as well as her tremors, Stacy told her.
</P>
<P>
   Either surgery would have its drawbacks. The implant in her
brain would be connected by a thin wire to a pacemaker about 1.5
inches wide and 2 inches long implanteded near her collarbone. The
connecting wire would run along the side of her face, behind her
ear and down her neck. Bremer would have to turn the device off and
on by waving a magnet over her chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of mechanics to fool around with,'' Stacy said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a thalamotomy _ a procedure involving burning out of
brain cells that was performed on actor Michael J. Fox to control
his Parkinson's _ the implants can be reversed. They can be easily
removed without hurting the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Stacy's cautions, Bremer wasn't scared off by the
newness of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Bremer said, she decided to face her diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Once, a counselor told her to lie about her physical
difficulties if she didn't want to explain them to strangers.
Forget that, Bremer said. She didn't have anything to apologize
about.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the operation, doctors took an MRI _ a
snapshot of Bremer's brain in action _ locating the exact spot for
the implant.
</P>
<P>
   Then they fitted Bremer with a ``halo,'' a structural device to
prevent her head from moving. The halo was attached by screwing the
frame against her skull.
</P>
<P>
   Next, surgeons drilled a hole into her skull, exposing the top
of her brain. Since there are no sensory nerves inside the brain,
Bremer couldn't really feel anything.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hole, surgeons implanted a four-headed device, with
each head being about one-eighth-inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer was fully awake so the doctors could determine whether
the high-tech version of blind-man's buff in the brain was working.
When the electrode was properly placed, doctors told her, she'd
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer was awake during the entire surgery. As they were
inserting probes inside her brain, Bremer said she could
immediately feel tingly, a fuzzy warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good tingle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the implant, surgeons turned off the operating-room lights
to get a better look at the monitor measuring the brain activity _
similar to turning off the lights in order to see the television
better.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness, Bremer could hear the ``music'' inside her head
better. Putting in the electrode was like putting a needle into the
groove of a record, Stacy said. The electrodes read the electronic
discharges made by brain cells and turned them into sound.
</P>
<P>
   For Bremer, hearing her brain cells fire was like hearing
``thunderstorms when you are standing outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to her brain in action was thrilling, but the bigger
excitement came three days later when Bremer returned to Barrow to
have the pacemaker adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy and other physicians dialed into the frequency of the
devices inside Bremer, trying to figure out which level of
electrical stimulation would block the signals that cause the
shaking and rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bremer's hands showed no sign of improvement. Her
engagement ring clattered against the wooden arm of her chair; her
Parkinson's seemed to be barely affected. But slowly, subtly over
20 minutes, her hands became more steady and less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such an awesome feeling. This tingly feeling happens
and you look down and everything is so much more controlled,''
Bremer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how good it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   The device's manufacturer, Medtronic, which is based in
Minnesota but has operations in Tempe, wants to see if it can be
used to treat epilepsy and other brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy, who says he is delighted with Bremer's progress, plans to
test the device on patients with dystonia, a rare muscle disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of good news: insurance carriers, such as Bremer's
group, CIGNA Healthcare of Arizona, are willing to pay for the
$30,000 to $50,000 implant. Only Medicare is dragging its feet on
the covering the procedure, Stacy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer is beaming after the operation. But her experience with
Parkinson's has taught her there are more important things inside
her than mechanical devices. Living with the disorder has made her
appreciate others, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from this. God only gives you as much as you
can handle.'' &QL;

   A Confrontation With the Pope
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II was back in his native Poland again, this time
to focus attention on the 20th-century martyrdom of Christians and
underline the broad themes of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   The visit took a bizarre turn when the chief rabbi of Poland,
Pinchas Monachem Joskowicz, introduced himself on a receiving line
and addressed the pope directly, saying: ``I have a favor to ask
Mr. Pope'' _ to seek to remove a cross at the walls of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, broadcast live on Polish television, shocked many
Polish viewers and embarrassed leaders of Poland's Jewish
community, who said the setting was inappropriate and the form of
address scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear was that the incident would undermine their own more
diplomatic efforts to find a compromise over the visibility of the
cross at a site of great Jewish suffering. It was put up to
commemorate the pope's 1979 visit to Auschwitz, and as a memorial
to Christian victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   How 'Bout Those Cubs, er, Yanks?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton took her most decisive step yet toward
running for the Senate from New York, declaring her lifelong
allegiance to the Bronx Bombers. At a White House ceremony honoring
the 1998 World Series champs, she got a Yankees cap that she tugged
over her forehead as she posed with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In this initial skirmishing over the Senate seat, Mrs. Clinton's
declaration amounted to a Bronx cheer to New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely rival and a diehard Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's sense of loyalty,
since she was born and bred in Chicago and had worn her love for
the Cubs on her sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Mrs. Clinton said. Because the Cubs were in the
National League, she has needed an American League team to root for
too.
</P>
<P>
   Play ball!

   Goodbye, TV. Hello, Net
</P>
<P>
   When Lou Dobbs, whose name is synonymous with televised
financial news from his 15 years anchoring CNN's ``Moneyline'' and
his founding of the CNNfn network, resigned to join an Internet
start-up called Space.com, his colleagues were baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Some said he had tired of ego-clashing with other top executives
at CNN. Some said he saw the money some Web entrepreneurs were
making, and wanted his chance to make a mint.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked, Dobbs said, was a simpler notion: He is a space nut.
</P>
<P>
   He is also fully Net-savvy, having helped create CNNfn.com, the
leading business-news Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs denied interest in another television job, saying, ``My
full commitment is to the launch of Space.com on July 20 and to the
operation of the best Internet site on space.''

NEW JERSEY WOMAN CAN'T SAVE SISTER FROM LIFE ON STREETS OF FORT
WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: The names in this story have been changed for reasons of
privacy.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY ROGERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ She crumples the cigarette package in her
tiny fist and refuses to sit down. Her hair is a tumble of dark
ringlets and her eyes are clear and black, but troubled _ guarded.
She stares straight ahead, often ignoring my questions, sometimes
giving me a patronizing smile, occasionally telling a transparent
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time she stands very still, daring me to trespass
into her secret life. I think of a wounded deer ready to run at the
slightest movement. I hold my breath, willing her to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I be dismissed?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   She might have been a college coed in olive-green thigh-high
jumper and brown hiking boots. She certainly doesn't look 34. It is
easy to see that once she was a pretty little girl with round, dark
eyes and a shy smile.
</P>
<P>
   She is pretty now; but she wears paranoia like a stained
overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest sister, Alicia Martin, of Freehold, N.J., remembers
that when Amy was small, she liked ruffles and bows in her hair and
tea parties with her dolls.
</P>
<P>
   She was quieter than her two sisters. They thought she might
have been their mother's favorite child. Maybe she was only the
child who needed a mother's love the most, Martin says now.
</P>
<P>
   Once Amy was a college student, then a glowing bride, a happy
romantic who could brave any world for love's sake. She kept a
spotless house and became an excellent cook.
</P>
<P>
   So how did Amy end up homeless in a land of abundance? For each
of the millions of homeless Americans who drift across the land
like sand driven before a hot wind there is a friend, a neighbor or
a onetime business colleague who has wondered what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a family that frets and cries and carries the
stigma of homelessness. No one is proud to say their parent, their
sibling, their child is on the street _ and so they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Martin doesn't ask why her sister is homeless. She doesn't
wonder how this happened. She is matter-of-fact and no-nonsense.
She never panders. She is frustrated and disappointed and sometimes
angry with her sister, but she is a ferocious advocate for family
unity and she won't let Amy go.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Martin, 47, agrees to tell her story in hopes that
it will dispel some of the myths about homelessness and strip away
some of the guilt families feel. She knows that for the homeless
there is no safety net, no safe harbor _ and sometimes no escape.
</P>
<P>
   SPLINTERED FAMILY: When Amy was 24, she had a baby boy, Johnny,
a beautiful child who gurgled and cooed. Later she had a daughter
and three years ago another son, but she doesn't read to them or
kiss away their hurts.
</P>
<P>
   She's never there when they run a fever or need to be corrected.
The last three years must be like a confused watercolor for her,
with no hard edges, no resemblance of truth. Amy can't remember
that Johnny is 10. She says he is 7.
</P>
<P>
   That's how old he was three years ago when they showed up
together at the Presbyterian Night Shelter just east of Fort
Worth's central business district. Night Shelter director John
Suggs remembers that in less than a month, Amy brought all three of
her children to the shelter, and her hold on reality was slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is adrift and bewildered, so disconnected that she can't
maintain any relationship for long _ and still her sister won't let
her go.
</P>
<P>
   The Martins have no children of their own and have welcomed
Johnny into their home. They would like to keep all the children
together, she says, but the court awarded custody of Johnny's
half-sister and half-brother to their father. Martin shares legal
custody of Johnny with Amy, who is her half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   Determined that Johnny and his siblings won't grow up strangers,
the Martins have all the kids at their New Jersey home on holidays
and summer vacation and put them together in hotel rooms on quick
visits to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin sees to it that Johnny writes to his mother at least once
each week. He faxes the letters to the Presbyterian Night Shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our family,'' Martin declares. ``In this case, mental
illness is part of the deal. My sister is just as sick as if she
had cancer. There's no secret about it. It's the secret that
creates the shame, so we are very open about all of it. Johnny has
nothing to be ashamed of,'' she says. The boy joins her on a couch
in an Arlington hotel lobby. She puts her arm around him and pulls
him close. He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that Martin loves Johnny and that the affection is
returned _ but she is careful not to call him ``son.'' She
introduces him as her nephew.
</P>
<P>
   She says Johnny is strong enough to handle the truth: She is not
his mother. His mother is homeless and mentally ill and getting
more troubled by the day. It is better for Johnny to live in New
Jersey, but he cannot _ must not _ forsake his mother.

   PRISTINA _
</P>
<P>
   Kfor died Monday morning. She was only two days old and lay
inside a colored dishcloth in the arms of a relative as her father,
Mehdi Lahu, walked up the filthy laneways of Vranjevac on his way
to the little makeshift graveyard beneath the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was conceived when the Serb police were oppressing us,''
he wept. ``She was carried inside her mother for two months on our
flight through the forests. And she died after her mother had to
hide with me for two hours in the basement while the police raided
our home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the very last raid by the Serb police, on the night
British troops of KFOR arrived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi and his wife Hajrie had wanted to celebrate the child's
birth as a moment of liberation but the baby came late and _
because of the last Serb looting spree _ was born without medical
aid. Mehdi's elderly mother had to cut the umbilical cord with a
Gillette razor sterilized in boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it happened this morning. She just died. We wanted to
name her Kfor and we wished to ask Mr. Jackson to be the godfather
but this could not happen. We hope that the life of KFOR is longer
than this little girl's life and that they will bring us freedom
for the first time in 120 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant every word he said. He did believe that NATO General
Sir Michael Jackson would be his child's godfather. And all the
while that we talked, little Kfor lay under the dishcloth in the
arms of Lutfi Lahu, the father-in-law of Mehdi's sister. It was
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kfor is the last Albanian victim of the war. Or maybe
she is the first to die in the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi, standing beside his wife with his hands clasped in front
of him, had no doubt who was to blame. ``We are refugees from
Glamnik,'' he said. ``The Serbs ordered us from our homes the day
the OSCE delegates left Kosovo in March and we walked the forests
in hiding for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hajrie was very pregnant. She was not in good condition and
the baby was five days' late when she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a relative's house here in Vranjevac and every day
the police would break into our home. And each day we had to hide
in the cellar. We'd been there for two hours on Saturday and after
the police left, our baby was born.''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd of Albanians had gathered round us in the cobbled
roadway with its open sewer, a burned Albanian home behind us, the
trees of the graveyard just up the street. Mehdi's tears trickled
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go home to Glamnik. There were many houses there
that were burned. We had one of the three that were still
undamaged. But we've heard now that the police were living in it
and they burned it when they left.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man in a pink shirt asked if he could speak. ``I am
Mehdi's brother Nexhmi,'' he said. ``I arranged my brother's
wedding on May 24 last year and I want to tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our tradition, the bridegroom's friends and family all
travel to the bride's family to collect the girl on the day of the
marriage. That day we could have had a hundred cars to go there.
But the Serb police would not allow it. We were so afraid. We could
send only two cars. And we couldn't fly our flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi listened to all this, wiping away his tears all the time.
From time to time, Nexhmi gently took the almost weightless bundle
in the dishcloth from Lutfi and held it to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our baby was born at nine o'clock in the morning,'' Mehdi kept
repeating. ``We had electricity but no water _ only enough to
sterilize the knife. I helped my wife to give birth but my mother
is too old and could not help much. Now my only concern is to find
medicines for my wife. I have lost my baby but I still have her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Lahu is 30 and a mechanic by profession. Hajrie is just
24. It was their first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't blame NATO for the suffering of our people,'' he
said. ``We only blame them for starting the war late. Our baby
didn't die because of NATO but because of the lack of medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Nexhmi interrupted him. ``Our people have a belief about life,''
he said softly. ``We say that it's never too late.''
</P>
<P>
   We all shook hands and they walked away beneath the trees, Mehdi
with clasped hands in front of him, Nexhmi clutching the bundle.
And then they disappeared around the corner of the burned house. &QL;

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ She crumples the cigarette package in her
tiny fist and refuses to sit down. Her hair is a tumble of dark
ringlets and her eyes are clear and black, but troubled _ guarded.
She stares straight ahead, often ignoring my questions, sometimes
giving me a patronizing smile, occasionally telling a transparent
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time she stands very still, daring me to trespass
into her secret life. I think of a wounded deer ready to run at the
slightest movement. I hold my breath, willing her to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I be dismissed?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   She might have been a college coed in olive-green thigh-high
jumper and brown hiking boots. She certainly doesn't look 34. It is
easy to see that once she was a pretty little girl with round, dark
eyes and a shy smile.
</P>
<P>
   She is pretty now; but she wears paranoia like a stained
overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest sister, Alicia Martin, of Freehold, N.J., remembers
that when Amy was small, she liked ruffles and bows in her hair and
tea parties with her dolls.
</P>
<P>
   She was quieter than her two sisters. They thought she might
have been their mother's favorite child. Maybe she was only the
child who needed a mother's love the most, Martin says now.
</P>
<P>
   Once Amy was a college student, then a glowing bride, a happy
romantic who could brave any world for love's sake. She kept a
spotless house and became an excellent cook.
</P>
<P>
   So how did Amy end up homeless in a land of abundance? For each
of the millions of homeless Americans who drift across the land
like sand driven before a hot wind there is a friend, a neighbor or
a onetime business colleague who has wondered what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a family that frets and cries and carries the
stigma of homelessness. No one is proud to say their parent, their
sibling, their child is on the street _ and so they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Martin doesn't ask why her sister is homeless. She doesn't
wonder how this happened. She is matter-of-fact and no-nonsense.
She never panders. She is frustrated and disappointed and sometimes
angry with her sister, but she is a ferocious advocate for family
unity and she won't let Amy go.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Martin, 47, agrees to tell her story in hopes that
it will dispel some of the myths about homelessness and strip away
some of the guilt families feel. She knows that for the homeless
there is no safety net, no safe harbor _ and sometimes no escape.
</P>
<P>
   SPLINTERED FAMILY: When Amy was 24, she had a baby boy, Johnny,
a beautiful child who gurgled and cooed. Later she had a daughter
and three years ago another son, but she doesn't read to them or
kiss away their hurts.
</P>
<P>
   She's never there when they run a fever or need to be corrected.
The last three years must be like a confused watercolor for her,
with no hard edges, no resemblance of truth. Amy can't remember
that Johnny is 10. She says he is 7.
</P>
<P>
   That's how old he was three years ago when they showed up
together at the Presbyterian Night Shelter just east of Fort
Worth's central business district. Night Shelter director John
Suggs remembers that in less than a month, Amy brought all three of
her children to the shelter, and her hold on reality was slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is adrift and bewildered, so disconnected that she can't
maintain any relationship for long _ and still her sister won't let
her go.
</P>
<P>
   The Martins have no children of their own and have welcomed
Johnny into their home. They would like to keep all the children
together, she says, but the court awarded custody of Johnny's
half-sister and half-brother to their father. Martin shares legal
custody of Johnny with Amy, who is her half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   Determined that Johnny and his siblings won't grow up strangers,
the Martins have all the kids at their New Jersey home on holidays
and summer vacation and put them together in hotel rooms on quick
visits to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin sees to it that Johnny writes to his mother at least once
each week. He faxes the letters to the Presbyterian Night Shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our family,'' Martin declares. ``In this case, mental
illness is part of the deal. My sister is just as sick as if she
had cancer. There's no secret about it. It's the secret that
creates the shame, so we are very open about all of it. Johnny has
nothing to be ashamed of,'' she says. The boy joins her on a couch
in an Arlington hotel lobby. She puts her arm around him and pulls
him close. He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that Martin loves Johnny and that the affection is
returned _ but she is careful not to call him ``son.'' She
introduces him as her nephew.
</P>
<P>
   She says Johnny is strong enough to handle the truth: She is not
his mother. His mother is homeless and mentally ill and getting
more troubled by the day. It is better for Johnny to live in New
Jersey, but he cannot _ must not _ forsake his mother.

   A Confrontation With the Pope
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II was back in his native Poland again, this time
to focus attention on the 20th-century martyrdom of Christians and
underline the broad themes of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   The visit took a bizarre turn when the chief rabbi of Poland,
Pinchas Monachem Joskowicz, introduced himself on a receiving line
and addressed the pope directly, saying: ``I have a favor to ask
Mr. Pope'' _ to seek to remove a cross at the walls of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, broadcast live on Polish television, shocked many
Polish viewers and embarrassed leaders of Poland's Jewish
community, who said the setting was inappropriate and the form of
address scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear was that the incident would undermine their own more
diplomatic efforts to find a compromise over the visibility of the
cross at a site of great Jewish suffering. It was put up to
commemorate the pope's 1979 visit to Auschwitz, and as a memorial
to Christian victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   How 'Bout Those Cubs, er, Yanks?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton took her most decisive step yet toward
running for the Senate from New York, declaring her lifelong
allegiance to the Bronx Bombers. At a White House ceremony honoring
the 1998 World Series champs, she got a Yankees cap that she tugged
over her forehead as she posed with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In this initial skirmishing over the Senate seat, Mrs. Clinton's
declaration amounted to a Bronx cheer to New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely rival and a diehard Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's sense of loyalty,
since she was born and bred in Chicago and had worn her love for
the Cubs on her sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Mrs. Clinton said. Because the Cubs were in the
National League, she has needed an American League team to root for
too.
</P>

   Goodbye, TV. Hello, Net
</P>
<P>
   When Lou Dobbs, whose name is synonymous with televised
financial news from his 15 years anchoring CNN's ``Moneyline'' and
his founding of the CNNfn network, resigned to join an Internet
start-up called Space.com, his colleagues were baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Some said he had tired of ego-clashing with other top executives
at CNN. Some said he saw the money some Web entrepreneurs were
making, and wanted his chance to make a mint.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked, Dobbs said, was a simpler notion: He is a space nut.
</P>
<P>
   He is also fully Net-savvy, having helped create CNNfn.com, the
leading business-news Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs denied interest in another television job, saying, ``My
full commitment is to the launch of Space.com on July 20 and to the
operation of the best Internet site on space.''

<P>
   If, as social scientists sometimes insist, the best predictor of
future behavior is past behavior, then Dr. Steven Hyman was an
unlikely candidate when the National Institute of Mental Health was
searching for a director three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other psychiatrists who had filled that post were clinical
psychiatrists. But Hyman, though he saw patients one morning a
week, was a bench scientist at heart, at home with pipette and
petri dish, deeply immersed in the molecular underpinnings of
addiction and mood disorders. And he was only 43, much younger than
previous directors.
</P>
<P>
   There were other anomalies. He had little administrative
experience. The interdisciplinary Mind, Brain and Behavior program
he ran at Harvard University could hardly compare to a government
agency with a budget close to $900 million. Nor did he walk and
talk much like a Washington bureaucrat. Bearded, genial and often
missing a tie, he answered direct questions directly, thrived on
intellectual argument, could discourse as fluently upon Descartes
as upon dopamine receptors, and he had an alarming habit of
speaking his mind, even when what he had to say was unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was these attributes that convinced Dr. Harold E. Varmus,
director of the National Institutes of Health, that Hyman was the
person for job, though some doubted the wisdom of the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   A revolution was taking place in the neurosciences, advances in
genetics and technologies like PET and MRI scanning offering
unparalleled opportunities for understanding the workings of the
human brain. But psychiatry, Varmus felt, had been slow to take
advantage of these new tools. The mental health institute was
trailing behind when, as the nation's major underwriter of research
on mental illness, it should have been leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   What was needed, he thought, was a leader who was younger, in
touch with the cutting edge of molecular science, someone who could
bring together mind and brain and had a strong commitment to public
health. ``I was searching for somebody out of the ordinary,''
Varmus said. ``Steve was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward: it is close to 90 degrees in the director's
office. The ventilation system in the institute's shiny new
headquarters still does not work properly. But Hyman does not seem
to notice.
</P>
<P>
   He has just emerged from a meeting and will soon run to a job
candidate's colloquium, followed by more meetings and two precious,
late afternoon hours spent in his lab. An official dinner, the
latest in an endless series, means it will be late when he finally
goes home to his family. His staff says that he seems tireless:
that they are used to receiving e-mails at three in the morning,
that he recently gave a lecture an hour after breaking his leg on
the ski slopes. ``Nobody was surprised,'' said David Shore, the
institute's associate director of clinical research. ``Nothing
stops him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years into his tenure, there are many who believe Hyman
has proved the perfect antidote to a flagging institute, exerting
strong leadership at a time when mental health is attracting
unprecedented public attention. At the White House Conference on
Mental Health last week, President Clinton announced the start of a
$7.3 million institute study of the prevalence and severity of
mental disorders in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's supporters use terms like ``tough but fair'' to describe
him. They credit him with raising the scientific bar for research,
taking strong stands on issues like psychiatric research ethics,
serving as an eloquent ambassador on Capitol Hill, building bridges
between basic scientists and clinical researchers, and extending a
welcoming hand to advocacy groups, like the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has been refreshingly open and available, not only
accepting critical feedback but actually looking for it,'' said
Laurie Flynn, executive director of the alliance. ``I would not
have expected this from someone who was a classic bench scientist.
He has stepped up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also irritated more than a few people in the process.
Some longtime researchers have been encouraged to seek work
elsewhere. Well-known investigators who once had their grant
applications rubber stamped now find they must actively defend the
importance of their work. ``It's not enough with Steve to say `Oh,
these people are doing cutting-edge research and we've been funding
them for 20 years, so let's fund them,''' said one institute
official.
</P>
<P>
   Even close colleagues are not immune. Charles Nemeroff, chairman
of psychiatry at Emory University School of Medicine and a member
of the institute's National Advisory Mental Health Council, who
supports Hyman, recalled a grant application he submitted last
year. ``I'm as close to him as anybody,'' Nemeroff said, ``and he
looked me right in the eye and said, `We're not going to fund
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's critics are happy to list their complaints, though few
will do so on the record. They assert that his conception of
psychiatry is too narrow, limited to molecular genetics on one hand
and ``cookie cutter'' clinical drug trials on the other. That he
has dismantled the institute's internal research program. They
think that when advocacy groups criticized the ethics of studies
involving human subjects, he should have defended the field and its
researchers instead of halting 29 studies and establishing a
Federal committee to oversee all experimental protocols. ``Why is
it that only NIMH is putting in this extra level of bureaucratic
review?'' asked Dr. Donald Klein, director of research at New York
State Psychiatric Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, others suggest, is ambitious, a ``Varmus clone,'' who
hopes to inherit the institutes' top job.
</P>
<P>
   He is aware that he is not universally applauded. ``I'm perhaps
a little too impatient and demanding,'' he said. ``I've always just
been very direct with people. If you do it in a way where people
realize that there's no malevolence or ulterior motive, I think
most people respond very well. But obviously, some people remain
upset.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hyman makes no apology for tightening ethical controls on
psychiatric research. Not to do so, he argues, would be to lose the
public's trust. ``Good ethics and good research are inseparable,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The large-scale clinical trials he has initiated are important
because they address questions the drug industry neglects, or has a
vested interest in, he says. ``Investigators don't want to do
clinical trials. They think it's not creative, it's `dog work.' But
there is an important role for the federal government in being an
impartial, unbiased investigator of certain sensitive areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The last criticism, that he is too ambitious, makes him laugh.
``I do have an enormous ambition,'' he said, ``which is to return
to academia and to my lab.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4 o'clock, ensconced in his laboratory, the director of the
N.I.M.H. is more relaxed than he has been all day. He jokes with a
graduate student, proudly shows off a gene gun that shoots DNA into
cells, sits in the coffee room trading stories.
</P>
<P>
   Though his passion is basic science, it was patients who drew
him to psychiatry. In medical school, he was moved by seeing
``young people who were as psychotic as you could imagine a human
being to be'' transformed, with the help of lithium and
anti-psychotic drugs, into ``someone you would enjoy having a
conversation with.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this intersection of mind and body that has always
fascinated him, fueling his dual passion for the sciences and the
humanities in high school, and later at Yale University. He began a
graduate degree in philosophy, but then applied to Harvard Medical
School. Eventually, he focused on molecular science because it
seemed to him that it was such research that would make the biggest
difference in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   His choice was not a popular one at the time. His advisers told
him that ``molecular biology has nothing to do with psychiatry''
and warned that he would ruin his career. He did it anyway. ``I
think that illustrates some strength in Steve's character,'' said
Dr. Eric Nestler, Jameson professor of psychiatry and neurobiology
at Yale and a fellow resident in the 1980's at MacLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For Hyman, speaking out is just something he has always done.
Perhaps it is the influence of his grandmother, a Russian immigrant
who survived the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, and
testified against the factory's owners. Perhaps it is a matter of
genes and neurotransmitters. ``I could be less outspoken,'' he
said, ``but I would have needed a brain transplant.''

   PRISTINA _
</P>
<P>
   Kfor died Monday morning. She was only two days old and lay
inside a colored dishcloth in the arms of a relative as her father,
Mehdi Lahu, walked up the filthy laneways of Vranjevac on his way
to the little makeshift graveyard beneath the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was conceived when the Serb police were oppressing us,''
he wept. ``She was carried inside her mother for two months on our
flight through the forests. And she died after her mother had to
hide with me for two hours in the basement while the police raided
our home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the very last raid by the Serb police, on the night
British troops of KFOR arrived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi and his wife Hajrie had wanted to celebrate the child's
birth as a moment of liberation but the baby came late and _
because of the last Serb looting spree _ was born without medical
aid. Mehdi's elderly mother had to cut the umbilical cord with a
Gillette razor sterilized in boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it happened this morning. She just died. We wanted to
name her Kfor and we wished to ask Mr. Jackson to be the godfather
but this could not happen. We hope that the life of KFOR is longer
than this little girl's life and that they will bring us freedom
for the first time in 120 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant every word he said. He did believe that NATO General
Sir Michael Jackson would be his child's godfather. And all the
while that we talked, little Kfor lay under the dishcloth in the
arms of Lutfi Lahu, the father-in-law of Mehdi's sister. It was
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kfor is the last Albanian victim of the war. Or maybe
she is the first to die in the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi, standing beside his wife with his hands clasped in front
of him, had no doubt who was to blame. ``We are refugees from
Glamnik,'' he said. ``The Serbs ordered us from our homes the day
the OSCE delegates left Kosovo in March and we walked the forests
in hiding for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hajrie was very pregnant. She was not in good condition and
the baby was five days' late when she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a relative's house here in Vranjevac and every day
the police would break into our home. And each day we had to hide
in the cellar. We'd been there for two hours on Saturday and after
the police left, our baby was born.''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd of Albanians had gathered round us in the cobbled
roadway with its open sewer, a burned Albanian home behind us, the
trees of the graveyard just up the street. Mehdi's tears trickled
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go home to Glamnik. There were many houses there
that were burned. We had one of the three that were still
undamaged. But we've heard now that the police were living in it
and they burned it when they left.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man in a pink shirt asked if he could speak. ``I am
Mehdi's brother Nexhmi,'' he said. ``I arranged my brother's
wedding on May 24 last year and I want to tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our tradition, the bridegroom's friends and family all
travel to the bride's family to collect the girl on the day of the
marriage. That day we could have had a hundred cars to go there.
But the Serb police would not allow it. We were so afraid. We could
send only two cars. And we couldn't fly our flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi listened to all this, wiping away his tears all the time.
From time to time, Nexhmi gently took the almost weightless bundle
in the dishcloth from Lutfi and held it to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our baby was born at nine o'clock in the morning,'' Mehdi kept
repeating. ``We had electricity but no water _ only enough to
sterilize the knife. I helped my wife to give birth but my mother
is too old and could not help much. Now my only concern is to find
medicines for my wife. I have lost my baby but I still have her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Lahu is 30 and a mechanic by profession. Hajrie is just
24. It was their first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't blame NATO for the suffering of our people,'' he
said. ``We only blame them for starting the war late. Our baby
didn't die because of NATO but because of the lack of medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Nexhmi interrupted him. ``Our people have a belief about life,''
he said softly. ``We say that it's never too late.''
</P>
<P>
   We all shook hands and they walked away beneath the trees, Mehdi
with clasped hands in front of him, Nexhmi clutching the bundle.
And then they disappeared around the corner of the burned house. &QL;

FORT WORTH, Texas: his mother. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUSTODY BATTLES: Amy is leery of everything, especially her
sister. She is certain Martin means to steal her children.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Amy phones Martin in New Jersey. If it's a good day
she is flip. ``Hey, Nikoroonie. I'm letting you know I'm off the
streets and still at the PNS,'' she'll say. If it's a bad day, she
is cool _ suspicious if an answering machine picks up the call.
She'll say she wants to see her children and asks Martin to give
her a ``real phone number and a real address.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin shrugs off her sister's mistrust. It is not so easy for
her to lay aside the suspicions of the legal system, she says.
Working to protect the children, fighting to get them out of the
Night Shelter, offering her home as a refuge, flying back and forth
from New Jersey to Texas, she is surprised that some
child-protection advocates also question her motives and even
suggest that she wants her sister's children because she has none
of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Martin shakes her head in a gesture of disbelief. ``Johnny will
say, `How come you and Uncle Tim don't have children?' I'll say,
`Well maybe God knew we needed to be here to help take care of you
and your brother and sister. Maybe we wouldn't have been able to do
that if we had other children of our own,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Martins have fought a legal battle to keep Johnny out of the
foster-care system. ``Once Amy was picked up on a mental warrant
and put at John Peter Smith Hospital. She was out in 24 hours, but
we got a call saying Johnny was going to a foster home. It didn't
make any sense. Here we were blood relatives who wanted him, and we
had to fight to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   FRANTIC: There was a time about four years ago when Amy tried to
get Martin to keep the boy. Martin remembers desperate calls in the
night. Her sister was frantic. There was no food. No money. They
had no place to stay. Help. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   Airline travel was arranged. Amy arrived with all the children
in tow. They were thin, dirty and frightened. Her life was out of
control. Could Martin keep Johnny? Just Johnny? Please?
</P>
<P>
   Why not the other two? Who knows. Maybe she felt responsible to
their father, to whom she was still married. Johnny is not his
child. Maybe she felt she had complete custody of him, says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Johnny wouldn't stay. Would you?'' Martin says, hugging
him again. He looks down and shakes his head. ``You were worried
about your mom?'' she asks. He nods. ``Well, you're a good son,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   There were other trips. Amy grew more fragile, more fragmented
with each visit. Just one phone call from her husband would send
her hustling back to Texas and an uncertain life.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Amy's marriage ended in divorce. Her life seemed to
splinter into tiny fragments. Now she is too fractured to keep a
roof over her head, too emotionally unstable to care for her
children.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny loves her still.
</P>
<P>
   THE COMING STORM: Martin remembers the earliest markers of the
emotional storms that were to devastate their family. Amy had
married and was pregnant with Johnny when their mother died of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that marriage was pretty much on track, and then my
mom died. She was pregnant with Johnny. Amy took her death very,
very badly. She seemed to become a little withdrawn, and then we
learned that her marriage was falling apart. She became very quiet.
The family didn't know how bad things were. She lived in South
Carolina. I lived in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes a deep breath and looks around the hotel lobby as if
the right words are hiding in the corners there. ``In the
beginning, you don't think anything is too wrong,'' she says at
last.
</P>
<P>
   Amy's depression spread like poison ivy in summer, and in the
late spring of 1989 she agreed to a short hospital stay _ six weeks
and she was out. That's about the time she met her second husband.
They married, and though the doctor advised them to wait several
years before having children, Amy became pregnant very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was concerned, but she hoped for the best. ``Looking back
on all this now, I think she was overwhelmed. She had a little girl
and then another little boy, and that marriage wasn't working out
either.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of arguments and lost jobs. The family moved
often. One minute Amy wanted Martin's help. The next minute she
resented the intrusion. One winter night she ran out of Martin's
house with no shoes, no coat. ``She'd just panic and run,'' says
Martin, who begged her sister to see a doctor again. Amy said she
didn't need medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTING A GROWN WOMAN: Amy doesn't think she needs medical
help now, either. When she arrived at the night shelter three years
ago, Amy believed money _ money and breast-enlargement surgery _
would solve all her problems, says Suggs.

FORT WORTH, Texas: says Suggs. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suggs has witnessed Amy's slide down the rabbit hole into a
world of fantasy. ``When she first came, I thought she didn't
belong here. I thought we could help her. She kept clean then. She
always was dressed nice, always fixed up. Now she smells, a lot of
the time. Sometimes she wears crazy clothes, you know, a dress over
pants over shorts, three shirts even if it's 100 degrees outside,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Every day she steps a little further from reality. For a time
she used powdered Kool-Aid to color her lips. She'd lick her
finger, dip it into the powder, then smear the goo onto her lips.
``Her lips were a mess. Cracked. Dry,'' Suggs says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very secretive, too. She talks in circles. She doesn't
want anyone to know her business.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggs is so concerned about Amy he has given her a special pass
so she can stay inside the shelter even during the day, when others
must leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really afraid she'll be hurt,'' he explains. Amy is pretty
despite her days on the street. She is petite and mysterious, a
magnet who attracts men _ often abusive men. Suggs even barred one
man from the shelter when he tried to choke Amy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't do anything to defend herself,'' Suggs says.
``She's not going to commit suicide or hurt someone else, but I
think it's dangerous here for her. She's not exercising any
judgment about these guys she's hooking up with. She does pickup
work, things like cleaning up The Ballpark (in Arlington). But she
can't make a sensible decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggs estimates that at least 50 percent of the Night Shelter
population is mentally ill, incapable of making sound life
decisions. He believes many would benefit from a prescribed regimen
of medication. He knows the administration of such medication would
have to be supervised and enforced. Amy is one who would benefit,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Martin agrees. She thinks Amy could function if she lived in a
controlled environment where someone saw to it that she took the
proper medication. Martin believes it is her sister's only hope for
a real life. With the right medication and supervision Amy could
hold a little job, keep her house clean, even take care of her
children some of the time, says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Suggs know Amy would not agree. Amy thinks everything
is fine. ``She's a grown woman. She's 34 years old. How do you make
someone get help if they don't want it? What do you do if they
don't believe they need it?'' asks Martin.
</P>
<P>
   This disturbing question cuts to the heart of the problem of
homelessness created by mental illness. Texas judges are reluctant
to commit people to a mental facility against their will, says
district probate judge Pat Ferchill, who is one of two Tarrant
County judges who has jurisdiction over civil commitment for the
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   A person must pose a clear danger to themselves or others before
a judge will even consider forcibly putting a citizen into a mental
facility, he says. ``The burden of proof on the state is high, and
the ultimate result is a deprivation of liberty,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Americans value liberty above all else, and so it is no surprise
that over the last three decades there has been a trend toward
making it more difficult for the mentally ill to be committed, he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of what's in the best interest of the
proposed patient, says Ferchill. Courts must ask, ``Is there clear
and convincing evidence that the proposed patient is likely to
cause serious harm to himself or others?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of stripping a person of their civil rights.
Americans are reluctant to take away someone's rights,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Suggs has come to accept the complex maze of the legal system as
almost hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Amy _ like many of the homeless _ has chosen her
life on the street, but Suggs discounts that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her right mind, Amy wouldn't live here,'' he declares.
``It's like falling off a cliff. She's in a different world, and
from what I've seen, it gets progressively worse, just like any
other illness that's untreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who tries to examine her sister's condition without
passion, doesn't know what to call Amy's mental illness, but she
knows pity or anger or withdrawal won't solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that when she leaves the Night Shelter, she
cries. ``Amy is a prisoner. She's in the box and she can't get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy's family is stuck, too. ``We live so far away. Maybe if we
lived in the area; maybe if I wasn't a working person too. ...''
her voice trails off. She takes a deep breath. ``So we do what we
can.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The elusive neural stem cell, the founding cell from which
perhaps the whole brain develops, has at long last been discovered
_ again.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually direct disagreement, two scientists say they
have discovered the site in the brain where neural stem cells lurk,
but each has a different candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells can both renew themselves and generate the more
specialized cell types of the organ to which they belong. Though
the adult brain was long thought to be incapable of repairing
itself, biologists found in 1992 that the brain can generate new
neurons in some cases, so must possess a hidden reservoir of neural
stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The nature and hiding place of the neural stem cells at once
became questions of high interest. The cells might help replace
those that are lost or damaged in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and
other brain diseases. And study of the stem cells' ability to
generate the brain's many different cell types could help tease out
the blueprint for the brain's extraordinary architecture, a
precisely wired mechanism of 100 billion neurons and at least 1
trillion supporting cells.
</P>
<P>
   So there was considerable excitement among brain biologists in
January when Dr. Jonas Frisen of the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm reported that he had found the source of the neural stem
cells in rats' brains, assumed to be typical of all mammalian
brains in this respect, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   The stem cells known from other organs are plain, featureless
blobs of protoplasm that show no signs of differentiation, the term
for when a stem cell's progeny assume their mature roles. But the
neural stem cells discovered by Frisen were differentiated. Not
only that _ and maybe only a trained developmental biologist can
appreciate the full shock and horror of his finding _ the cells
sported long, active hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides this clever disguise, the cells were occupying the most
menial role in the brain's grand electrical house: They were lining
the ventricles, the fluid-filled central chambers of the brain. The
cells' waving hairs project into the fluid and keep it moving. When
a living cell is isolated and placed in fluid, it will scoot around
the dish, propelled by its beating hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprise that a differentiated cell could repeal its
fate and become a stem cell again _ imagine a pensioner growing
back into a teen-ager _ Frisen's result was generally accepted. It
was published in Cell, a journal known for its high standards.
</P>
<P>
   But last week Cell published a second paper with an explicitly
contradictory result. It came from Dr. Arturo Alvarez-Buylla at
Rockefeller University in New York. And it said the neural stem
cells were not the ventricle liners but rather the star-shaped
cells called astrocytes that lie one layer in from the ventricle
lining.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a scientific journal publish two articles saying
different things? Essentially because both seem to be carefully
done experiments and it is too early to tell which is right. Both
authors did extra tests to address the skepticism of reviewers,
said Dr. Benjamin Lewin, the editor of Cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should of course have liked to resolve the differences
between the papers,'' but the two scientists' work was hard to
compare, Lewin said. ``Finally we decided that each paper has to be
judged on its own merits _ that is, in effect, to ask whether it
makes a good case for the validity of the proposed stem cells,
irrespective of the other paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts who have read both articles say their apparently
discrepant results may prove reconcilable. It could be the brain
has more than one type of stem cell, or that Frisen's liner cells
turn into Dr. Alvarez-Buylla's astrocytes and then into neural stem
cells. Frisen also believes some kind of reconciliation is likely
to emerge. `'I think we are both right and both cells are involved
in this process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez-Buylla, however, believes his result is right and
Frisen's is not. He said he had tried to induce the liner cells to
make the three main lineages of brain cells, the best current test
of neural stem cells, but could not even get them to divide.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of the two competitors in the neural stem cell race,
Alvarez-Buylla has probably been under greater stress. Frisen's
paper was published first, so the Rockefeller group came from
behind. ``It has been a very hard four months for us,''
Alvarez-Buylla said. ``I guess the reviewers thought his data were
more convincing than ours and that's why we had to do these extra
experiments.''.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez-Buylla had been studying the regenerative capacity of
neurons in the mouse's olfactory bulb, the part of the brain that
registers smell. Under the microscope he noticed trains of new
neurons traveling into the bulb from the layer behind the ventricle
lining. It was his interest in finding their source that led him to
the astrocytes.
</P>
<P>
   He and Frisen agree on the surprising fact that the stem cells
are hiding out as differentiated cells. Both the liner cells and
the astrocytes are mere support cells, a class known as glial cells
and dull cousins of the neurons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle against two fronts, against the dogma that
glial cells are far removed from working as a progenitor, and also
against the other group,'' Alvarez-Buylla said.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling of Frisen's tests was that he could isolate
a single liner cell and show that it could be made to develop into
the three main lineages of brain cells, as would be expected of a
stem cell. Although Alvarez-Buylla could not make the liner cells
divide at all, he kept them under test for only two weeks, whereas
Frisen's recipe called for six weeks, said Dr. Ben A. Barres of the
Stanford University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Derek van der Kooy of the University of Toronto said neural
stem cells originate not in the liner cell layer but in the layer
behind it, as Alvarez-Buylla asserts. But he is not persuaded that
the astrocytes are the neural stem cells. ``I am leaning toward
Alvarez-Buylla's story but I'm not convinced of his either,'' he
said. Van der Kooy's results were published last month in the
Journal of Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter who is right? Yes, because figuring out the
precise lineage of the brain's various cell types is essential to
learning how it is constructed and how to heal it, said Dr. Evan Y.
Snyder of the Harvard Medical School. ``This is not an arcane
battle between neurobiologists fighting over definitions but will
reflect on how we can harness this to the repair of the brain,''
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   But figuring out the tree of brain cell lineages may require
tools that are not yet in hand. Biologists like to identify cells
through unique proteins on their surfaces, known as markers. But no
markers unique to neural stem cells have been found. So neither
Frisen's nor Alvarez-Buylla's work is decisive, said Dr. Fred Gage
of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. ``They are both good
experiments but they are both, by the absence of definable markers,
inconclusive,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even the assumption that the brain has a single kind of
originating stem cell, as does the blood-forming system of the bone
marrow, may be incorrect. Maybe primitive cells from different
tissues combine to form the brain, meaning that it is generated
from more than one kind of stem cell. And a difficulty with tracing
cell lineages is that for every cell a more primitive ancestor can
be found until one reaches the egg cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So while it's an important exercise in understanding the
origins of cells, the answer may not be as definite as the question
implies,'' Gage said.

   KOSOVO POLJE _ Kosovo Polje is not known for its cuisine. The
heartland of Serbism, site of Serbia's 1389 battle with the Turks _
the greatest defeat (so far) in Serbia's history _ and the location
of one of the country's ugliest Tito-style railway stations; Kosovo
Polje is all that. And, currently, parts of it are on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But anything is worth escaping from the cockroach-haunted
restaurant of the Grand Hotel in Pristina. We set off, therefore,
with something approaching desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop _ a pleasant garden pizzeria which I had
regularly visited last year _ was closed, its gate padlocked, its
owner already fled to what is now called ``Serbia proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a street away, there was a house on fire, its roof slowly
crumbling into blazing rooms, its tiles exploding in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In any other country, there would be crowds, fire engines,
tearful homeowners. But all we found outside the crackling building
was a boy on a bicycle, practicing how to backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   I walked up the driveway and saw a figure retreat into the next
door house. And a pile of bottles and food cans _ military rations,
I suspected _ beneath a tree in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb owner _ or the policemen who had taken over his home
after his departure _ had simply torched the place to prevent
anyone else living there, in the same way that you or I might lock
the front door when we left.
</P>
<P>
   But where could we eat? There was a bar 400 yards away where
soldiers were drinking Sprite; or at least it looked like Sprite.
They gave us an address and the conversation went like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down that street past the burned houses, take the
first turning to the left where there is a building on fire and a
bit further on, on the right, there's a good restaurant which
serves pork lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   We followed the directions to the letter and there was the
Zhivil Gaj taverna, an astro-turf terrace beside a real garden of
brilliant yellow and red roses.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Valikojic was a thin young man, not at all nervous of
all the fires, nor, it seemed, the cascades of rifle fire that
sprayed into the sky from every soldier's rifle in Kosovo Polje.
</P>
<P>
   He served a Serbian salad (too little cheese, far too many
onions) and hunks of pork that could have satisfied an army.
</P>
<P>
   Our fellow guests were an interesting bunch. There was a
Yugoslav army colonel and his pretty wife at one table while at
another sat three men, one with shoulder-length hair and a beard.
</P>
<P>
   All with knives in their belts, another with half a bottle of
brandy pushed into his camouflage trousers. Other patrons arrived
in black shirts and head scarves with pistols tucked into their
belts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bright sunny day, despite the drifting smoke haze, and
we asked for mineral water and red wine. At this point a spent
round _ fired into the air no doubt by a celebrating Yugoslav
soldier half a mile away _ cracked onto the terrace floor beside
us.
</P>
<P>
   A militiaman picked it up with amusement. Just outside, 20 yards
away, two drunken soldiers were brawling, one of them beating the
other over the head with the butt of his Kalashnikov rifle until a
comrade intervened to prevent both men shooting each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wine _ it's against the law,'' Bratislav announced. Against
the what? ``There are very strict rules against selling alcohol in
Kosovo,'' he replied. Government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. The Yugoslav authorities, anxious to prevent ``unruly
elements'' committing crimes, banned the public sale of alcohol in
Kosovo some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the road, a Yugoslav armored column moved sluggishly
past our restaurant, tanks and artillery and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the other guests had left that Bratislav
invited us inside and said that we could ``order freely now.'' He
served the finest chilled red wine _ far too much of it _ and more
pork and salad.
</P>
<P>
   And he wanted to tell us about the local Serbs. ``If people from
(Kosovo) Metohija start leaving, no one is going to remain,'' he
said. ``But here in Kosovo Polje, the Serbs are the toughest. We'll
keep all this. The area is almost `etnicki cisto' (ethnically
clean).'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He talked about casualties. His nearest neighbor had been killed
by a landmine set by the Kosovo Liberation Army (who had in turn
stolen it from the Yugoslav army) along with 19 other Serb
soldiers, including the son of a woman who used to work in the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav's brother-in-law was killed by a sniper on his way to
a funeral in Glogovac. Again by the KLA. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav had few thoughts about the Albanians, no knowledge, it
seemed, of what every guest in his restaurant must have known, or
even _ the thought often crept through my mind _ participated in.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't see the young man with the knife and the long hair or
the guy with half a bottle of brandy in his pocket standing guard
duty in a barracks.
</P>
<P>
   We had sat, I'm sure, among the bad guys, among some of the
``cleansers'' in this town which was ``almost ethnically clean.''
</P>
<P>
   So we asked whether he realized how much the Albanians had
suffered, and he said this: ``Be sure that they did not. They were
harmed in a different way, forcing them to go out (of their homes)
but physically they weren't maltreated...
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be on good terms. Albanians helped to build this
house. Albanians came to my parents' wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lies and half-lies and _ about the house and the wedding long
ago _ probably the truth. And the first will outlive the second. &QL;

<P>
   The federal government tells us there are 520,000 children in
foster care, enough to fill the entire city of Seattle. And given
the AIDS epidemic, that number grows daily.
</P>
<P>
   As a former foster child myself, perhaps in telling my own story
I can shed some light on the needs of those half-million children
whose stories remain untold.
</P>
<P>
   My troubles began when I was 3 years old and living in the South
Bronx and my father died abruptly of a brain tumor. My older
brother was 5, and my mother was pregnant with my younger sister.
My maternal grandparents moved in to help my mother support and
care for us. Two years later, my grandfather died suddenly when he
hemorrhaged from a stomach ulcer, and a few months after that my
mother was found to have breast cancer. She struggled for six years
with her illness and died when I was 11. Of the four adults who had
raised me, only my grandmother was now left.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother, who spoke only Yiddish and never learned to
read, was becoming increasingly forgetful, which further restricted
her already limited ability to negotiate the world.
</P>
<P>
   Watching so many people die was frightening, sad and confusing.
Still, the most traumatic event of my childhood was my placement
into foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Although my aunts and uncles hinted at the possibility, I never
believed they would really give me away. I figured we would just
live with them. But I figured wrong.
</P>
<P>
   My family concluded that my grandmother was no longer able to
care for us, but none of them wanted to take us in. One day the
uncle who had been designated my legal guardian took my sister and
me to some mysterious office where a woman I had never met before
announced that we were being placed into foster care. That was in
1958, when I was 13 and my sister was 9. My 15-year-old brother had
already been placed separately from us, and we never lived with him
again.
</P>
<P>
   I was taken to a series of appointments with various strangers,
until I eventually met the couple selected to become my foster
parents. I tried to be polite and show a little enthusiasm, but it
was a half-hearted and unconvincing act. I didn't want to go
anywhere with these strangers.
</P>
<P>
   On the day my family carried out its final act of abandonment, I
was taken to the foster agency headquarters for a physical
examination. I felt humiliated as I took off my clothes. It
reminded me of movies I'd seen of horses on the auction block, the
customers looking for defects before they decided to put down their
money. I certainly felt like damaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow we passed inspection. My sister and I were ushered to a
car, and a mysterious driver and social worker smoothly swept us
away from everything familiar. We arrived at a gray stone house in
the suburbs of Long Island where the little private dwellings and
sparsely populated streets seemed a world apart from the colorful
South Bronx neighborhood I had grown up in.
</P>
<P>
   My foster father, Jack, a shoe salesman with a gravelly voice,
kept a low profile while his lively, talkative wife, Erma, stayed
home and ran the show. They didn't have biological offspring, but a
year earlier they'd taken in another pair of children, a sister and
brother who were then 2 and 4. Erma figured we'd be like them,
needy children who were looking forward to having new parents to
replace the ones we had lost.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd had enough of the cycle of attachment and desertion.
After two weeks, Erma felt hurt and rejected. The more angrily she
demanded that I treat her like my mother, the more I recoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I fell into a fragmented and unfamiliar state. Toward the
outside world I was withdrawn and detached, and when the foster
care agency scheduled visits with my aunts and uncles, they seemed
distant relatives I had once met but barely knew.
</P>
<P>
   Erma spoke repeatedly of her disappointment in me and angrily
talked about sending me away. I knew from my brother that foster
children often go from place to place and that being physically or
sexually abused was common, so it seemed less frightening to stick
it out with her even if she didn't want me. I was relieved when
after about a year Erma decided to let me stay.
</P>
<P>
   During the following years, I continued to float through time
and space in a state of numb, disorganized misery, going through
the motions but not really alive. I believed I was peculiar, and
had no idea that my feelings were a common response to trauma. At
17 I developed the sensation of a lump in my throat and became
convinced that I was about to choke to death. I was afraid to go to
sleep, terrified that once I dozed off, I would stop breathing
forever. I had no labels for any of my experiences, so I didn't
realize this latest state was a form of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these years, I remembered my mother's primary lesson:
it is essential to function no matter what goes wrong. So I always
followed her stoical example, worked after school to help pay my
expenses, and graduated from high school as an honor student. By
that time, Erma and I had reached a state of truce, even had some
appreciation for each other. Still, I was far different from the
happy child I had once been.
</P>
<P>
   Placement in foster care is always traumatic, and the long-term
consequences severe. In many ways, I grew up in a fortunate time
and place. Various kinds of public benefits _ low-cost housing,
low-cost health and mental health care, and free education through
college _ allowed me to keep on going.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is good reason to wonder whether the disadvantaged
children in foster care will be given the same chance to survive
and prosper that I was given. There is considerable doubt whether
these children in need can find, anywhere, the kind of help that
was essential to my recovery.

away, two drunken soldiers were brawling, one of them beating the
other over the head with the butt of his Kalashnikov rifle until a
comrade intervened to prevent both men shooting each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wine _ it's against the law,'' Bratislav announced. Against
the what? ``There are very strict rules against selling alcohol in
Kosovo,'' he replied. Government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. The Yugoslav authorities, anxious to prevent ``unruly
elements'' committing crimes, banned the public sale of alcohol in
Kosovo some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the road, a Yugoslav armored column moved sluggishly
past our restaurant, tanks and artillery and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the other guests had left that Bratislav
invited us inside and said that we could ``order freely now.'' He
served the finest chilled red wine _ far too much of it _ and more
pork and salad.
</P>
<P>
   And he wanted to tell us about the local Serbs. ``If people from
(Kosovo) Metohija start leaving, no one is going to remain,'' he
said. ``But here in Kosovo Polje, the Serbs are the toughest. We'll
keep all this. The area is almost `etnicki cisto' (ethnically
clean).'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He talked about casualties. His nearest neighbor had been killed
by a landmine set by the Kosovo Liberation Army (who had in turn
stolen it from the Yugoslav army) along with 19 other Serb
soldiers, including the son of a woman who used to work in the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav's brother-in-law was killed by a sniper on his way to
a funeral in Glogovac. Again by the KLA. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav had few thoughts about the Albanians, no knowledge, it
seemed, of what every guest in his restaurant must have known, or
even _ the thought often crept through my mind _ participated in.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't see the young man with the knife and the long hair or
the guy with half a bottle of brandy in his pocket standing guard
duty in a barracks.
</P>
<P>
   We had sat, I'm sure, among the bad guys, among some of the
``cleansers'' in this town which was ``almost ethnically clean.''
</P>
<P>
   So we asked whether he realized how much the Albanians had
suffered, and he said this: ``Be sure that they did not. They were
harmed in a different way, forcing them to go out (of their homes)
but physically they weren't maltreated...
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be on good terms. Albanians helped to build this
house. Albanians came to my parents' wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lies and half-lies and _ about the house and the wedding long
ago _ probably the truth. And the first will outlive the second. &QL;

CRAFT TO TRACK CLIMATE-AFFECTING LINK OF SEA AND WIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The continuous interplay between wind and ocean,
whether as gentle as a kiss or as harsh as a slap, eventually
affects almost everything else on earth through its influence on
weather and climate. Yet, except for occasional sampling, this
crucial interface between sea and sky goes mostly unmonitored.
</P>
<P>
   This should change later this week when a new ocean-observing
satellite goes into orbit to begin at least two years of daily
measurements of this critical wind-sea boundary area.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Quick
Scatterometer, or Quikscat, satellite is to be launched on Friday
on a Titan 2 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite's sole instrument is a radar device called a
scatterometer, which will continually sweep the ocean tops that
cover two-thirds of the world and measure the speed and direction
of the winds that stir them. The dividends from these measurements,
picking up where similar readings from earlier satellites left off,
will be both immediate and long-term, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Without satellite measurements, only limited and often
inaccurate wind-sea data are available from ships, aircraft and a
few ocean buoys, scientists said, and even these readings are not
available for huge areas of the world's oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ghassem Asrar, head of NASA's Office of Earth Science, said,
``Knowledge about which way the wind blows and how hard is it
blowing may seem simple, but this kind of information is actually a
critical tool in improved weather forecasting, early storm
detection and identifying subtle changes in global climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Cayan, director of climate research at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said satellites provided
information about conditions in Southern Hemisphere and other
less-well-traveled oceans that was not available elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winds over the oceans are the key to how oceans evolve and
produce big changes, such as El Ninos and other widespread
effects,'' said Cayan, who is not involved in the Quikscat project.
``Winds are important in understanding how heat and moisture are
exchanged between the air and water, and the effect this has on
large-scale climate change.''
</P>
<P>
   Asrar said Quikscat was unusual in that the satellite was built
in record time because scientists felt there was an urgent need for
the wind-sea measurements after the failure of an earlier satellite
providing them. Using many readily available satellite components,
the spacecraft went from conception to completion in about a year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is part of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, had designed an
advanced scatterometer called Sea Winds for a future mission.
Engineers there were able to build a Sea Winds instrument early and
the Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation of Boulder, Colo.,
moved quickly to integrated it into the 1,910-pound Quikscat
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was to have been launched last November, but the
flight was delayed because of a recent series of rocket failures
that grounded the Titan launcher fleet. After a giant Titan 4
exploded during launching last August, and two other Titan 4
launchings went awry in April, failure reviews delayed further
flights of this type of booster. Quikscat, atop a smaller Titan 2,
could not be launched from Vandenberg until a Titan 4 on a nearby
launching pad flew first, which it finally did last month.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Graf, the Quikscat project manager based at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, said the launching delay added $5 million to
the $93 million cost of the Quikscat mission, a price that includes
the satellite, its rocket and mission science support, and would
prevent the spacecraft from being fully operational during the
current hurricane season, as was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Scatterometers are instruments that transmit high-frequency
microwave pulses to the ocean surface and measure the
``backscattered,'' or echoed, pulses that bounce back to the
originating satellite. These signals give an indirect measurement
of the speed of wind near the water in clear or cloudy weather.
</P>
<P>
   By taking readings from pulses fired at slightly different
angles, scientists can also use the backscattered signals to
calculate the direction of the winds.
</P>
<P>
   Scatterometers of increasing sophistication have flown in space
since the early 1970's. The first, demonstrating the feasibility of
the instrument, flew aboard NASA's Skylab space station in 1973 and
1974. The European Remote Sensing Satellite, still operating since
its launching in 1991, carries a radar instrument that works part
time as a scatterometer and has provided limited but continuous
sea-wind data for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced instrument until now was the NASA
Scatterometer, or Nscat, launched aboard the Japanese Midori
satellite in August 1996. Nscat made more than 190,000 wind
measurements daily as it mapped more than 90 percent of the world's
oceans every two days. But the satellite suffered a solar power
failure in June 1997, and scientists lost this critical stream of
data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Freilich of Oregon State University, the principal
investigator of the Sea Winds instrument, said the Midori failure
spurred the rapid development of Quikscat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will pick up basically where Midori left off,'' Freilich
said. ``We have a more advanced instrument that will make more
refined measurements than before, seeing more small-scale wind
variabilities than was previously possible.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Quikscat will cover 90 percent of the earth's ice-free oceans
each day, a job that took Nscat two days, and will cover a
1,120-mile swath during each orbit, one-third wider than its
predecessor, Freilich said. To cover such a wide area, signals will
be sent from the satellite using a dish antenna that rotates 18
times a minute to continuously sweep across the broad track.
</P>
<P>
   For winds moving at 7 to 45 miles per hour, the wind speed
measurements are expected to be accurate within 4.5 mph, and for
winds of 45 to 70 mph, the measurements are expected to be accurate
within 10 percent. Ninety-nine percent of all ocean winds fall
below these speeds, Freilich added. Scientists cannot accurately
predict weather without good wind data, and lacking such
information for the 70 percent of the world covered by water
hampers everyday forecasting, Freilich said. ``The difficulty in
predicting future weather is that we don't really know what the
weather is today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Combining Quikscat's wind data with information on ocean height
from another satellite, the American-French Topex/Poseidon
spacecraft, will give scientists a more complete look at wind
patterns and their effects on sea waves and currents, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Winds instrument will be turned on about 18 days after
the launching, and scientists will spend another four months
calibrating the instrument and verifying the mathematical formulas
used to interpret the data. After that, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, a major partner in the project, will
distribute the wind information to weather forecasters and climate
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, the Quikscat project manager, said the spacecraft would
travel in a 500-mile-high orbit that crosses close to Earth's North
and South Poles. Although the satellite's mission is scheduled for
a minimum of two years, Graf said the spacecraft was designed to
operate for four to five years.
</P>
<P>
   A second Sea Winds instrument is being built and is to fly on a
Japanese satellite that will replace the lost Midori spacecraft in
November 2000. The two scatterometers are to fly in slightly
different orbits that allow them to make complementary
measurements, Graf said.

 &HT;    Industry execs not ready to bury two-way T.V.
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Two-way television, thought to have been killed off by
the Internet, is rising from the dead here at the annual convention
of the cable television industry.
</P>
<P>
   Top industry executives are now saying they are ready and
willing to use two-way technology. And equipment makers such as
Atlanta-based Scientific-Atlanta say they have the technology ready
for installation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, TV programmers such as Atlanta-based Turner
Broadcasting are ready to embrace two-way technology and the
Internet to make their shows interactive.
</P>
<P>
   What a change in attitude from last year, when two-way
television was considered the false promise of the early 1990s. No
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactive television didn't flop,'' said AT&AMP;T Chairman C.
Michael Armstrong. ``It just didn't get rolled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's company, when it completes its acquisition of
MediaOne, is expected to become the nation's largest cable
operator. And as such, AT&AMP;T will aggressively roll out interactive
television, said Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way TV, which requires cable television's new digital
networks, lets viewers use their sets to send e-mail, buy
merchandise, respond to a program or play a game against somebody
across town.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong expressed his support for two-way television in a
press conference Monday here at the National Cable Television
Association convention, held through Wednesday. His press
conference came after Armstrong delivered the keynote address to
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 industry executives are attending the convention,
including Scientific-Atlanta, Cox Communications, Turner
Broadcasting and the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T can't roll out two-way television without the right
equipment. An increasingly big manufacturer of two-way systems for
television is Scientific-Atlanta. Indeed, Scientific-Atlanta has
staked its future on the acceptance of its digital two-way network
called Explorer 2000. It is a bet that is starting to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced here Monday that it was increasing
production of the two-way Explorer 2000 systems to 500,000 a
quarter from 250,000. The systems include set-top boxes, software,
networking equipment and servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Explorer 2000 set-top is now in commercial deployment in
nearly 40 systems throughout the United States and Canada,'' said
Greg Taylor, Scientific-Atlanta's vice president of worldwide
manufacturing. ``It is evident that we are entering the phase where
demand for our product will be driven by consumer interest and we
need to increase our production.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scientific-Atlanta is dividing its Explorer line
into three models. The most powerful will be the Explorer 6000.
Next in line comes the 3000 and then the 2000S, which will be a
low-priced model.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment manufacturers aren't the only ones noticing the
growing interest in interactivity among viewers. Turner
Broadcasting says it is designing its latest cable television
channel as a multimedia effort that will extend to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The channel, as yet unnamed, will cater to upscale women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and its interactivity has changed how we do our
networks,'' said Terry McGuirk, Turner Broadcasting chairman and
chief executive . He explained that Internet sites tied to TV
channels generate additional revenue, through advertising and
electronic commerce and help promote new channels. And the channels
help promote the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the blend of the two businesses that make new channels
profitable,'' said McGuirk.

 MODEST DiMAGGIO HOUSE HAS FEW POTENTIAL BUYERS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Descending the stairs of the Marina District
home owned by the late Joe DiMaggio, a prospective buyer said
Saturday, ``Joe was definitely a better baseball player than
decorator.''
</P>
<P>
   The modest, two-story house on Beach Street, bought by the
Baseball Hall of Famer for $14,600 in 1937, is listed at $1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   It's a price that astounds real estate agents and might be
deterring the expected hordes of buyers. Real estate agent Joan
Smith of TRI Coldwell Banker, who snagged the listing through a
personal friendship with DiMaggio, feels the price is out of the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida lawyer in charge of DiMaggio's $30 million estate _
who already sold the ball player's 1991 $18,000 Mercedes for
$75,000 _ set the price, believing in the allure of the Yankee
Clipper legend.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio, the gawky Italian-American kid from the San
Francisco area who performed magic on the field and became the
nation's most enduring sports hero, would be hard-pressed to turn
this highly spun offering into a financial home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love having this listing, and I want to sell the house,''
said Smith, who was wearing a Yankees T-shirt. ``I'm trying to sell
the DiMaggio name, but the house is ... in its original form.''
</P>
<P>
   In real estate parlance, ``original'' is a euphemism for
outdated.
</P>
<P>
   There is a two-car garage where DiMaggio parked his Toyota. The
garage door opens manually. The floors are said to be a beautiful
hardwood. But they're covered by beige carpeting. The linoleum is a
pattern Smith describes as ``what my mother picked out in the
'70s.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no dishwasher, garbage disposal, washer or dryer.
</P>
<P>
   There is a back yard, where Marilyn Monroe supposedly sunbathed
while she was married to DiMaggio. But it is currently a concrete
slab. There is a small ``knotty-pine bonus room,'' where DiMaggio
reportedly kept his trophies. Now there are only a few nails on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan was telling us about the little bottles Joe collected on
planes and the room off the laundry where he kept his trophies,''
said a prospective buyer from Connecticut who declined to give his
name. ``Other than that, there was nothing to suggest Joe DiMaggio
lived here. Strange.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who grew up in San Francisco, bought the Beach Street
home for his parents. It has been occupied since then by various
DiMaggio siblings, most recently his sister. DiMaggio, who retired
from baseball in 1951 and married Monroe in January 1954 at San
Francisco City Hall, lived there off and on until the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In March, DiMaggio died at his Hollywood, Fla., home. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   His 56-game hitting streak remains unsurpassed. His house was
put on the market May 25, and listed in the Wall Street Journal
last week. Smith said she's even considering contacting eBay, the
Jose on-line auction company. So far, she hasn't received many
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``As great as he was, I don't think the Joe DiMaggio name is
going to sell that property,'' said Terry Chaffee, an agent with
McGuire Real Estate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even in San Francisco's heated real estate market, buyers will
not make offers on homes that are overpriced, said Laurie
Nierenberg, who is with TRI Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Joe DiMaggio house, it's in its original condition,''
Nierenberg said. ``If it were beautifully renovated, and in the
highly desirable blocks of the Marina neighborhood, and had a buyer
who admired Joe, perhaps he or she would be willing to pay a little
premium. But, it's still all about location, condition and,
ultimately, the price.''

   KEMMERER, Wyo. _ By way of introduction, Vincent Santucci patted
his belt and said, ``As you may know, I'm the only pistol-packing
paleontologist in the National Park Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Santucci is the chief ranger and resident paleontologist at
Fossil Butte National Monument in southwestern Wyoming, where he
patrols over 8,000 acres of seemingly barren land that is actually
home to some of the best preserved plant and animal fossils in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The gun, he says, is not only to help protect visitors from
troublemakers but to deter looters from stealing fossils, often 50
million years old, for private collections or for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more criminal activity on public
lands,'' he said, adding: ``We have to be careful out there because
we are often alone. With the values so high for these rocks, there
is a real motive and incentive to collect these things.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a long history of theft at prehistoric graveyards like
Fossil Butte, Badlands National Park in South Dakota, Petrified
Forest National Park in Arizona and other public lands. During the
1980s, Santucci and other researchers set up a sting operation at
Petrified Forest to measure the resource loss. Dozens of pieces of
fossilized wood were marked with invisible paint and put in
discreetly roped off areas. After six weeks, visitors had removed
over 32,000 pounds of wood from the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Recent events have only made matters worse, preservationists
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing was `Jurassic Park,' '' Marianne Mills, chief
of resource education at Badlands National Park said, referring to
the 1993 movie about dinosaurs recreated through cloning. The movie
created a new generation of fossil lovers. ``Then the finding of
Sue in South Dakota and the selling of Sue, those things created a
lot more interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue, the 67-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton
purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago for a
record $8.36 million at Sotheby's in 1997, showed just how valuable
old bones could be.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the commercial market for fossils is booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently on the Internet, you'll see ammonites, those are
prehistoric snails, for $1,000 to $3,000,'' Ms. Mills said. ``Or
baculites, a precursor to the squid which left a
mother-of-pearl-like impression, can get over $3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those fossils are legally obtained, but not all. Hard
figures are not available, but Santucci, who has been involved in
cases all over the country, said fossil poaching was way up. ``In
the 1980s, it was just a handful,'' he said. ``In the 1990s, it's
in the thousands, and it has not plateaued yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And laws against fossil theft have not kept up with the sizzling
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is legislation for everything from wildflowers to
grizzly bears, but not for fossils,'' he said. ``There are specific
laws for archeological theft, but not for paleontological.
Oftentimes it is just a misdemeanor for years of public theft.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a case in South Dakota that illustrated the disparity
between penalty and value and which led Santucci to his dual
vocation.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a seasonal volunteer in Badlands National Park in the
early 1990s, Santucci stumbled across an elderly man who freely
admitted he had been taking fossils from the park for more than 25
years and said he had been able to raise a family on the sale of
what he took.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw himself as almost heroic because the park was letting
these fossils `erode,' '' Santucci recalled. But after months of
investigation, when it came time for prosecution, the man was
convicted of a petty offense, given a $50 fine and probation.
``That's when I decided to pursue law enforcement before my
Ph.D.,'' Santucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Fossils do not have specific federal protections; the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act, for example, does not
include fossils. Instead, fossil poaching is punished under laws
dealing with theft of government property, with a $50 to $500 fine
possible if the specimen is valued under $1,000. The charge is a
misdemeanor. If the value is more than $1,000, it can be treated as
a felony, punishable with jail time and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, someone can be jailed for stealing ancient Indian
bones or pots, but it is unheard of for someone to spend time in
jail for stealing dinosaur bones or fossilized fish.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, Santucci and members of other public land agencies
will participate in a public meeting in Virginia to discuss fossil
management and to pursue stronger penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Santucci acknowledges that not everyone who takes a fossil is a
criminal. ``A lot of people say, `Well, my grandma used to come out
here and bring some home,' '' he said. ``But these fossils belong
to us all, and no one has the right to take them to their castle in
Germany or their underwear drawer in Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At most federal parks, signs are posted on trails and at
visitors center, warning visitors that it is illegal to remove
fossils. Still, at the end of May, two people were caught stealing
ammonites from Badlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were charged with theft of government property,
destruction of natural resources, and the specimens were
retrieved,'' Ms. Mills said. ``It was like the seven stages of
denial _ they didn't know it was our land, they didn't know it was
wrong, they were sorry, then they were angry and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual to catch thieves red-handed, though, because there
are so few law-enforcement officers for so much land. In Badlands,
there is one law-enforcement ranger for every quarter million
acres, and they are not trained scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Another element that makes protecting fossils a challenge is the
divided land interests. Fossil Butte National Monument is one
fraction of the Fossil Basin in Wyoming which during the Eocene
Epoch, some 40 million to 60 million years ago, was much like
southeast Asia today, with palm trees, towering vegetation,
crocodiles, lizards, monkeys and numerous other mammals, and huge
lakes full of fish.
</P>
<P>
   The land that borders the monument is also fossil rich, but it
is owned by private landholders, the Bureau of Land Management and
other public agencies with differing interests. Some of the private
land is even leased to quarry companies which often use bulldozers
to work through the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some cases, some of those agencies other than the park
service may be involved in prosecuting fossil theft. An agent with
the Bureau of Land Management was responsible for the case brought
against David A. Hutchison of Richmond, Va.,, who for 20 years
stole turtles for his private collection. After pleading guilty to
theft of federal property from Bureau of Land Management areas that
border Fossil Butte National Monument, Hutchison was sentenced on
Thursday to two years' probation, fined $5,000 and ordered to pay
$10,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's lawyer, Frank Dunham of Arlington, Va., said the
effort to charge his client with a felony was punishment enough.
``It's like using a sledgehammer to go after a flea,'' Dunham said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that in this case there was something of a
happy ending because the fossils _ estimated to be worth $220,813 _
had not been sold. Instead, the rare specimens were the best
evidence and may now end up in museums.
</P>
<P>
   However, the loss of scientific data during amateur removal of
the rocks may never be fully recovered. ``It's like tearing the
pages out of a book, and then that book is unreadable,'' said Dr.
Laurie Bryant, regional paleontologist for the Bureau of Land
Management in Cheyenne, Wyo. ``Even in the best-case scenario, we
may only know 10 percent of the history of the Earth. So with
everything removed, we know less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Santucci agrees that researchers and scientists need to view the
fossils in their setting to learn more about the ecosystem that
existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a needle in a haystack to discover the mysteries of
the past,'' he said. ``But the real thing is that we owe it to the
kids; we have an obligation to the kids of the future to learn as
much as we can about these fossils and the world they lived in.''

 &HT;    Love flourishes in Carolina
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Maybe by Sunday night, they will be calling
him Davis Love No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Love will feel a definite comfort level at Pinehurst No. 2 this
week during the 99th U.S. Open. His roots grow deep into the North
Carolina sandhills. Born in Charlotte and schooled at Chapel Hill,
Love won Pinehurst's 1984 North-South Amateur at No. 2. He played
the course in his mid-teens with his late father, who regularly ran
a summer Golf Digest instructional school on the famous property.
</P>
<P>
   To win any U.S. Open would delight Love, a Sea Island resident,
who figured at 35 to have acquired more than one major championship
by now. After letting an Open title get away at Oakland Hills in
1996, to win one at Pinehurst might even rival the rainbow that
materialized above Winged Foot during his title run at the 1997 PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of great memories around there, especially
spending time with my dad there, growing up,'' said Love, ranked
third in the world rankings. ``No. 2 is kind of where I learned to
play a big course for the first time. It's a course that most
people hope to play someday, and I've been lucky that I've gotten
to play it a lot. I've been lucky to slip out there a bunch in my
formative years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at the 14th hole, Love remembered, that his long-time
teacher, Jack Lumpkin of Sea Island, ``taught me how to pitch the
ball.'' On a hole that runs adjacent to the road leading into the
village of Pinehurst, Love learned how to cut the ball off the tee,
knowing the ball would either fade or find asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Pinehurst is one of our U.S. homes of golf,'' Love
said. ``I'd like nothing better than to win my first U.S. Open
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Love will not be as disoriented as other players, who were
forced to finish a rain-delayed tournament on Monday in Memphis. He
already understands the perils of Pinehurst's crowned greens, which
cause errant shots to roll into collection areas, but he has not
experienced this U.S. Open setup.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be a traditional U.S. Open but more like a Masters,
where players must be creative. They will contend with deeper rough
than is normal for the course and greens that were made faster and
firmer with G-2 bentgrass not in place when the Tour Championship
visited in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course is going to be extremely difficult,'' Love
said. ``It's not going to be what any of us who've ever played it
in the past have been used to. You're not going to be able to get
the ball on the green as much as you want to. You're going to have
to be patient and hole a lot of putts for par.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst's Bermuda rough is not that thick, so players should
be able to play to greens. But shots from the rough, minus
backspin, will not stop on the crown-shaped greens. That could
change if thunderstorms, predicted for today and Wednesday, soften
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see some shots played around the greens a lot like you
see at the Masters -- bump-and-runs or putts from from just off the
edge of the green,'' Love said. ``The greens aren't very big, so
(the preference might be to) get it on the green front-middle and
try to two-putt. I think maybe it will be a little like Winged Foot
in that you're not going to want to land it back in the corners of
the greens. If you go over or to the sides, you're going to be in
deep trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Love hopes to avoid a repeat of his Open run in 1996, when he
bogeyed the final two holes after being tied for the lead with Tom
Lehman. He finished a stroke behind Steve Jones. After 3-putting
the 18th that day, he was caught on camera putting both hands to
his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are players who put themselves in position to win, and
they win,'' Love said. ``And there are guys who put themselves in
position to win, and it gets away from them. . . . I need to get
there enough times where I win them from ahead, I win them from
behind, when somebody gives it to you and when you snatch one away.

JAZZ REVIEW: IDEALISTIC AS EVER, WITHOUT THE SHOCK VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over time old avant-gardes become less fearsome than
they were on arrival. Yet an avant-garde that does not depend on
shock value need not become obsolete. Instead, it turns into both a
messenger from the era that shaped its attempts to break free and a
guardian of its favorite extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival ended on Sunday night at the
South Street Seaport Atrium with representatives of two
avant-gardes: free jazz from the New York Art Quartet, which formed
in 1964 and disbanded in 1966, and avant-rock from Sonic Youth,
which formed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Each group was of its time. The New York Art Quartet held the
anarchic idealism and racial ferment of the 1960s, while Sonic
Youth reflected the rock experiments, minimalism and arty
strategies of the 1980s. Each group was also making vital music in
a language it had pioneered and mastered, creating effects that
could be achieved no other way.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Art Quartet had not rehearsed for its first New
York show since 1965. But it fell right back into the headlong free
improvisation that had made it so fondly remembered. The quartet _
John Tchicai on saxophones, Roswell Rudd on trombone, Lewis Worrell
on bass and Milford Graves on drums, with Amiri Baraka (then called
Leroi Jones) intoning poetry on one piece _ made one album for the
quixotic ESP-Disk label in 1964 and another in Holland before its
members scattered. Worrell disappeared from jazz; he was replaced
in 1965 and on Sunday by Reggie Workman.
</P>
<P>
   From the first note, the music was all ferment and rush. Graves
bound the group together, pacing the 90-minute set with gusty,
continuous motion as his cymbals whispered and splashed and his
bass drum created an almost melodic counterpoint to Workman's bowed
meditations, throbbing drones and scampering lines. Tchicai was the
earnest voice, playing terse, rifflike lines and then racing up to
whorls and cries. Rudd was a jokester, using his plunger mute to
play elbow-in-the-ribs hoots and whinnies, or sparring with Tchicai
in quick lines, or playing alongside him in not-quite-unisons
suggesting a drunk leaning on a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Baraka joined the musicians through the entire set. He declaimed
percussive or rolling phrases as an auctioneer, preacher or cantor
does, hurling accusations and aphorisms against racism. Yet the
music was less a protest than an affirmation of liberty and
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Youth, joined by Ikue Mori on synthesized percussion,
played a sublimely otherworldly set, as carefully plotted as the
New York Art Quartet was free-form. Its music is based in the
physical and acoustic properties of guitars and drums. But long
stretches of Sunday's set had little to do with rock.
</P>
<P>
   The music was a meditation on consonance and dissonance, each
within the other. James Tenney's ``Having Never Written a Note for
Percussion'' was a long metamorphosis, hovering and swelling to a
grand clatter, then slowly evaporating. The next piece was all
choppy noise: feedback, static, sudden rending guitar swoops.
</P>
<P>
   The band grew more earthbound, paradoxically, when it paid
homage to spiritually-tinged 1960s jazz, with Thurston Moore
playing a long, raga-tinged guitar lead; the background drone,
magnificently calibrated, was more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   For its final pieces, Sonic Youth returned more or less to rock,
strumming recognizable chords in songs like ``Expressway to Yr
Skull'' and dwindling in the end to a single folky bit of
finger-picking. After all the band's enthralling abstractions,
suddenly a guitar just sounded like a guitar.

TURN TO CABLE FOR SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The major broadcast networks continue to hurt themselves by
filling their summer schedules with reruns, interrupted by
commercials for their fall series that are still months away.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder cable viewership is growing? Pay channels like
HBO and Showtime have garnered praise for their original series,
which are more daring than those on broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   HBO is winning new viewers thanks to its dramatic comedy ``The
Sopranos,'' about a troubled Mafia family and probably the best new
show of the season. (HBO is rerunning the first 13 episodes. New
episodes begin next winter.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Showtime launches a series that may have more limited
interest but has a similar creative spark. ``Beggars and Choosers''
was created by the late Brandon Tartikoff, longtime president of
NBC. Sure enough, it's about a network president. The two-hour
premiere airs at 10 p.m. Saturday, followed by 60-minute episodes
at 10:30 p.m. Saturdays beginning June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Though physical violence isn't on view as it is in ``The
Sopranos,'' ``Beggars and Choosers'' is just as much about
back-stabbing, power-grabbing and greed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's a satiric look at the cut-throat television
business, focusing on Rob Malone (Brian Kerwin), president of the
struggling LGT network, which is in the ratings cellar. Watching
him deal with constant problems makes you realize why network
presidents often don't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's daughter, Cary, is dating the network's biggest star
(played by Paul Provenza), who has been pressing Malone for a huge
raise. The network's biggest new show, a Thoreau-inspired drama
called ``The Mountainmen,'' is an instant hit with viewers, but
advertisers are furious when the characters burn the products that
help pay for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Ross plays a vice president angling for promotions
while making sure she doesn't fall if Malone fails. Tuc Watkins is
the vice president of talent, a closeted gay man who is accused of
sexual harassment by a spurned actress. He's also asked to hire a
prostitute for the wheelchair-bound network owner.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin plays the role with strength, worry, fear and power in
every breath. He tries to act on top of things even when they're
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strong language and brief nudity in the premiere,
directed by Michael Ritchie, seems extraneous, but this is pay
cable after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beggars and Choosers'' may seem too inside for some viewers,
but those with an interest in how television is run are sure to
laugh their way through the show.
</P>
<P>
   A different sort of audience may find humor in Comedy Central's
``The Man Show,'' an intentionally insulting and disgusting comedy
that premieres at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's part sketch comedy and part talk show, hosted by Adam
Carolla (from MTV's ``Loveline'') and Jimmy Kimmel (from ``Win Ben
Stein's Money'').
</P>
<P>
   They have a clear purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to reclaim the airwaves. To take back the medium
that we (meaning men) invented,'' they boast. What do guys want to
see on TV? Apparently girls jumping on trampolines, monkeys,
flatulence jokes and the fastest beer drinker in the world. They
deliver that in each episode.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel has a wry sense of humor, but I'm not sure what Carolla's
appeal is supposed to be. Then again, you're supposed to be
watching those buxom girls bouncing around behind the beer-drinking
piano player.
</P>
<P>
   The show has one redeeming bit of satire. Kimmel and Carolla try
to get women's support on a petition against suffrage. Sadly, most
of the women think they're talking about women's suffering, not
their right to vote.

DANCE REVIEW: JAZZ AND MOVEMENT MINGLE AT A FESTIVE COCKTAIL
PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The American Dance Festival's new season, which
is devoted to an unusually large number of premieres (16) and
special events, has opened here with ``Out Some Place,'' a lively
and inspired collaboration between the choreographer Bill T. Jones
and the jazz pianist Fred Hersch.
</P>
<P>
   The entire piece is an urban poem, surprisingly deep in its
ruling metaphor of life as one big cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   But like Hersch's Gershwinesque score, the choreography Jones
has created for the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Co. is complex
and multilayered. The dancing on Saturday night in Page Auditorium
at Duke University repeatedly revealed dramatic incidents within
the consistently unfurling choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder of the piece is how truly choreographer and composer
have collaborated, with each allowing for some improvisation within
set structures. Hersch shuttles onstage between a grand piano and
an upright, and his score moves easily from progressive cool to
barrelhouse rhythms and to an ecstatic finale.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall look of ``Out Some Place'' is abstract. On
another level the piece has a larger theme: the use of jazz as a
meeting ground in social gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, Jones and Hersch remind us that the jazz
pianist, in speak-easy or cocktail lounge, is the mediator in a
human situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out Some Place'' is the fourth of six works commissioned
jointly by the festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts through the Doris Duke Millennium Awards for Modern
Dance and Jazz. The Pilobolus, David Parsons and Paul Taylor
companies created the earlier entries. Each commissioned premiere
is scheduled to be seen at the festival's home at Duke and at the
Kennedy Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz music has been foreign to virtually all the choreographers
involved until now , so the project has had some risk. Answering
questions after Saturday's performance, Jones referred to the
creation of ``Out Some Place'' as an assignment, adding: ``This is
a transitional piece for me. I don't know where I am going, but it
shows me a place where I can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Jones is going, in this work at least, is toward a
loosened-up style. (``I just wanted to play,'' he said.) The 10
cast members must move fast and athletically. There is an
exceptionally difficult combative duet for Eric Bradley and Daniel
Russell Kubert, who encounter each other head to head like young
stags and partner each other with changing wraparound lifts. At his
most typical, Jones likes to boil down or heighten gesture. Both
processes are at work here more strongly than ever, so that the
gestures are so abstracted that they are virtually erased of
literal meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the essence remains. One can spot a tipsy woman balancing a
glass on her knee, and raised beer glasses evoke a toast and
nothing else. Nonetheless the dancing is created out of isolated
movements of the body, reorganized and recombined.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of black costumes by Liz Prince are remote from
streetwear and all the better for darting into the wings. Robert
Wierzel's excellent lighting design, including projected spheres
and an onrush of white spots, suggests a cosmic disco. Drops of
sound on the piano bring forth a group emerging from the darkness.
The dancers raise their glasses and slap their laps, a percussive
motif enlarged later through stamping and clapping.
</P>
<P>
   Social contact evolves. The music meanders and grows assertive
as the dancers collide and spool off from one an other with lifts
and leg-swinging motifs. Hersch crosses over for his stride-playing
passage on the upright.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the grand piano he accompanies an exuberant ensemble
whose clapping and yelling leads into the climax of the brilliantly
performed male duet. As a tango seeps into the music, Jones plays
with propulsion: a woman uses two men as a springboard to push off
and land into the arms of another partner.
</P>
<P>
   When one group is silhouetted to a cocktail-lounge sound, the
image appears deliberate even if another group is on its knees and
four women execute a hiccupping stag leap until everyone undulates.
A man collects the drinking glasses, and Hersch raises his glass.
The party is over, and it is a model for others in the Duke dance
and jazz series.
 &UR;  &LR; The other admirable dancers were Miguel Anaya, Germaul Barnes,
Alexandra Beller, Stephanie Batten Bland, Catherine Cabeen,
Christian Canciani, Rosalynde LeBlanc and Toshiko Oiwa.
</P>
<P>
   All except Ms. Beller performed ``D-Man in the Waters,'' a
signature piece set to Mendelssohn's String Octet in E. Revised
last year, the work retains its life-affirming exuberance as a
delirious ovation demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Jones performed ``Etude,'' a new solo to music from Beethoven's
Quartet No. 16. A progression of isolated images, it is a showcase
for Jones as dancer and storyteller, even if the story consists of
fingers moving across an extended arm.
</P>
<P>
   The program was introduced by Charles L. and Stephanie Reinhart,
the festival's directors, and its dean, Martha Myers. The season is
dedicated to the benefactors Samuel H. Scripps and Luise Elcaness
Scripps, his wife. The annual $25,000 Samuel H. Scripps American
Dance Festival Award will be presented to the choreographer Pina
Bausch on Sunday by Harvey Lichtenstein, the president of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. Another highlight on campus is an
exhibition, ``Full-Bodied Expressions of Modern Life: Modern Dance
and the American 20th Century,'' which includes rare material from
the festival's archives and is organized by Laura Clark Brown. &QL;

   If your summer weeks away from work go beyond basking on a
beach, Dick Francis at hand, or lolling alongside a mountain lake
with Danielle Steel, you could learn about the Civil War or how to
cook haute or basse cuisine or even study real French. Thousands of

   I put in a request for any type of educational travel from the

at a bunch of them, including Holt's Battlefield Tours, an English

the Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, in Oregon. A typical listing
gives the program's Web addresses, though not all the entries are

</P>
<P>
   More than 300 ``learning vacations'' are offered by the
Smithsonian Institution and can be sampled at its Web site. The
site is clean and mercifully unexciting; design has matured in the
last few years. The vacations range from three days to three weeks,
and generally take 20-some people. The prices, which are not low,
include hotels (unless listed as optional), most meals,
sightseeing, lectures, tips and transportation on the tour;
transportation to the beginning of the vacation is often extra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web site sorts the trips into cat-egories. Family adventures
are aimed at parents and children or grandchildren. Four were
listed for this summer. One, Tuscan Summer for Families (children
age 7 to 18), cost $3,895 per adult and $2,995 to $3,395 per child,
depending on age, with accom-modations but not air fare. North
American Study Voyages offered two cruises on sailing ships, one to
Greenland, the Arctic and Maritime Canada, the other to Nova
Scotia, coastal Maine and New England. For those not worried about
Y2K problems, voyages in the year 2000 include Cajun and Creole
Louisiana, the Mississippi from top to bottom, and Baja California.
The featured international study tour was Opera Lover's France, 10
days in Paris and Lyons in November. The Odyssey Tours are for the
classically or traditionally minded: Treasures of Italy (starting
at $3,599); Christmas in London ($2,399), Coastal California
($1,949) and many more, with accommodations and air fare from
Wash-ington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trips are open to Smithsonian Associates _ members who, for
$24 a year, also get a subscription to Smithsonian magazine and
discounts at museum shops. You can join on line, of course, and
register for a trip at the same time.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THAT MAMET BOY SEEMS AT HOME ON UNEXPECTED
TURF 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN

<P>
   From its appearance on the London stage in 1946, to the opening
of a new movie version in April, ``The Winslow Boy'' has been a
victory of professionalism over improbability. What began as a
transformation of borrowed material by adroit stagecraft has lately
become a demonstration of a movie maker's finesse in adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   When, soon after the end of World War II, Terence Rattigan first
declared his intention to write a play based on a famous 1908
lawsuit, he was warned by Anthony Asquith, who would direct the
first movie version, that the required big trial scene would break
the production budget. Yet who would have predicted that a trial
play without a trial could be made to work for the West End?
</P>
<P>
   And a half-century later, who could have predicted that David
Mamet, poet of rough 20th-century American types, all those
unscrupulous, uncouth, expletive undeleted and shadily pathetic
characters, would turn his attentions to reworking an audience
grabber populated by an upstairs set of dignified, well-spoken,
clean-minded Brits?
</P>
<P>
   Both the play and Mamet's new movie proved surprising successes.
Rattigan, whose popularity as a facile farceur had been growing
even as serious critical attention remained elusive, received an
Ellen Terry award for the best play of the 1946 London season and
then the New York Drama Critics' Award. As for Mamet,
already-appreciative critics of his work have been impressed by the
new range and touch of his movie.
</P>
<P>
   Rattigan's inspiration was the case of Archer Shee, a British
cadet who was expelled from Osborn Naval College for stealing a
five-shilling postal order from another cadet's locker. When a
famous lawyer, Edward Carson, came to the boy's defense, the case
became a newspaper sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Rattigan's approach, to which Mamet has been remarkably
faithful, was pretty much to ignore young Ronnie Winslow, the lad
of the title, except for two strong made-for-the-stage
confrontations, one with his father and one with the barrister,
here called Sir Robert Morton. The focus instead is on the whole
family. One student of Rattigan's work credited him with developing
``for the first time characters, who, in spite of the melodramatic
qualities of their situation, are not only credible but
memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which covers the two years of the trial, is set
entirely in the Winslow drawing room. Courtroom developments reach
the audience at second hand. That can be stagy, as when a maid is
given the duty of imparting the court's final decision. But for the
most part Rattigan had the skill to turn his technical problems,
both of space and time, to his play's advantage. The audience finds
itself inside a warm household under increasing strain, and
sympathy flows readily to its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mamet, his camera can take us into Parliament, a
newspaper office and elsewhere. But home remains where the plot is.
</P>
<P>
   Rattigan played to the public appeal of respectable and likable
citizens who make big sacrifices in the interest not just of young
Ronnie, but of right being done as well. There is Arthur Winslow,
the boy's father, a banker of liberal temperament and sometimes
crusty disposition, with a commitment to justice; Catherine, his
prematurely liberated daughter, and Sir Robert Morton, the
sardonic-seeming, soft-at-the-center Conservative politician,
originally played by Emlyn Williams. A few subsidiary characters
are inserted to draw attention to the principals' sterling
qualities, and the dialogue is smartly paced.
</P>
<P>
   Rattigan confessed after the play's appearance that he was far
from true to the facts of the case. The real-life Catherine, for
example, was no suffragette. At the heart of ``The Winslow Boy,''
however, is an abiding faith in the course of British justice.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing odd about that, coming from a well-born Tory
like Rattigan, but such an acceptance of a higher authority is not
what one would expect from the street-smart American. Yet if Mamet
harbors any doubts about the British judicial system or class
system around 1908, he keeps them to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Much abetted by Sir Nigel Hawthorne, who carries the movie with
his portrayal of Arthur Winslow, we are returned to an ideal
Britain that might have produced Mrs. Miniver. Although ``The
Winslow Boy'' is melodrama, its world is without real villains. The
glimpses we get on screen of Sir Robert's opponents are relatively
benign, and the issues are cushioned in legalisms.
</P>
<P>
   Rattigan's England was being transformed after World War II,
when the Conservative Party was kicked out. But the playwright
understood that for the theater's purposes, the appeal of the
Shee-Winslows cut across party lines. If you were taking the play
more seriously than it can bear, it might be seen as a V-Day
tribute to British justice and fair play, a touch slow to assert
itself but finally triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   Even audiences who see through Rattigan's mechanics and who may
be let down by Mamet's Anglophilia can depart with a feeling of
uplift. Both men, and particularly Mamet, who has a reputation as a
poker player, managed to beat the odds.

   Hel-lo, Hel-lo: Austin Powers here. First up, baby, let me tell
you why I dig Jackie Collins' Hollywood. You know how they say
Hollywood is just high school with money? Well, to me, Jackie's
Hollywood is the 60s with money. Free love still reigns in Jackie
Land: people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous
partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting
with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment. My bag
exactly! And the babes are all so groovy: they've all got big hair
and tiny frocks, and they all shag like minxes. None of this PC
bull: what these chicks all want is a good-looking cat with a nice
set of twig and berries.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lucky Santangelo, the heroine of Jackie's latest gig,
``Dangerous Kiss.'' Yeah, I know, I know. Lucky's supposed to be a
legend in her own time _ this super-smart Hollywood fembot, the
mongoose to all snakes, the pit bull to all yorkies. She's supposed
to be what you 90s people call a feminist. Au contraire: she's
really just this switched-on babe with mojo. Her idea of running an
``equal opportunity'' studio means the guys, as well as the chicks,
have got to get naked in her movies: you know, equal time, equal
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky, I have to say, is pretty shagadelic herself, one smashing
baby, baby. Listen to this description: ``Lucky was a slender,
long-limbed woman with an abundance of shoulder-length jet curls;
dangerous black opal eyes; full, sensual lips; and a deep olive
skin.'' She likes to wear red dresses slit up to her heinie, and
her Dad calls her ``Miss Balls of Fire.'' A Bond girl by another
name _ am I right, or am I right?
</P>
<P>
   Steady now, don't have a thrombo, but practically every chick in
this book is a Bond girl. There's Lucky's frisky best friend, Venus
Maria, ``all platinum hair, luscious cleavage and glossy lids and
lips''; and Lucky's sister-in-law, Mary Lou, ``a glowingly pretty,
curvaceous black woman'' with ``huge brown eyes, shoulder-length
black curls and a totally captivating smile.'' Also, there's
Lucky's goddaughter, Brigette, who's ``blond and curvaceous, with
luminous peaches-and-cream skin, enormous blue eyes fringed with
the longest lashes, and full pouty lips''; and Brigette's best
friend, Lina, ``an incredibly exotic-looking black girl'' who goes
``through men at an alarming rate.'' Needless to say, Brigette and
Lina are both supermodels _ a caliber of chick I know only too
well.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, two of Jackie's girls get themselves into trouble. This,
baby, is where I've got a problem. You'd think Jackie could at
least give her chicks a worthy nemesis _ like my old friend, Dr.
Evil. But, no. No ill-tempered, mutated sea basses; no quivering
pools of liquid hot magma; no monstrously fat, bag-pipe-playing
henchmen. Just a rancid little bird who wants Mary Lou's jewelry,
and a conniving count named Carlo who's after Brigette's money. If
these two sniveling creatures aren't the Diet Coke and Fresca of
villains, then I'm not London's swingingest photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you know everything's going to turn out just fine. It
always does in Jackie's world, same as in mine. Since yours truly
isn't around to put things right, Jackie's No. 1 Bond Girl, Lucky
Santangelo, swings into action. Lucky, whose father was some sort
of gangster, believes in what she calls ``Santangelo justice'' _ in
other words, the old eye for an eye, the old break the other's
guy's twig and berries. Ouch, very ouch! She vows she's gonna
liquidate Carlo, the evil interloper who doped up her beloved
goddaughter, and she also vows she's gonna get that pathetic bit of
business who iced her sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   But then, baby, things begin to get weird. Turns out that
Lucky's husband, Lennie, hasn't come clean about his own past, that
he had a thing with this Italian chick when he was being held in
this underground cave in Sicily a few years back, and this chick _
who's dead sexy, by the way _ has now turned up on their doorstep.
An underground cave in Sicily? Crikey! That's a whole 'nother
story.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this producer cat named Alex is hitting on Lucky, and
Lucky's half-brother Steven _ yeah, the mourning widower of the
unfortunate Mary Lou _ is getting it on with Brigette's friend
Lina, who has been shagging a movie star named Charlie Dollar, who
is engaged to a chick named Dahlia. Like I said, everyone in
Jackie's world is so busy wearing fabulous clothes and partying
like it's 1969 that they don't even know it's the 90's.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, behave!

AIDS ACTIVISTS REFOCUS ON BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By Catherine Hollingsworth   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The epidemic of AIDS cases among African-Americans
throughout the country has AIDS activists _ from health officials
to black church leaders _rethinking how to better target blacks at
risk of contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gay black men are in the highest risk category, followed by
intravenous drug users. And black women who have sex with these
individuals are increasingly becoming infected with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services has grappled with the fact that the disease
disproportionately affects blacks. Now the department is refocusing
its efforts, trying new approaches to AIDS prevention in black
communities by requiring, for instance, that programs be
administered mostly by minority staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely looking for organizations to design their
programs with that cultural competence in mind,'' said Megan Foley,
an AIDS program analyst at the department's Atlanta-based Centers
for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   Foley added that the emphasis on African-Americans was warranted
because of the ``skyrocketing'' infections. ``It is clear a more
targeted effort is needed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is providing $9 million this year to faith-based
organizations and other groups that serve areas with the highest
number of African-American AIDS and syphilis cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Leon Seymore, pastor of a mostly black congregation in
Jacksonville, Fla., illustrates the kind of tailor-made approach to
AIDS prevention that health authorities would like to duplicate in
black communities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Giving no thought to his critics, Seymore established an AIDS
testing site and condom distribution center at his Pentecostal
church, Tabernacle of the Temples. He also extended the ministry
beyond the church walls to places where blacks might be most
susceptible to exposure to the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   With a team of volunteers, he canvassed housing projects and has
even crashed parties and made the rounds of local bars to warn
people about the threat of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're radical,'' Seymore said. ``The goal is to meet them
where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymore first got involved with AIDS victims four years ago when
he was sought out by relatives of two gay black males who were
dying of AIDS and in need of counseling. Other black pastors had
shunned the men because of their homosexuality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a concern of mine. The concern was that these
individuals needed pastoral support,'' Seymore said. Though the men
he counseled died after just two sessions, he continued his
outreach to AIDS victims through a church AIDS ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained an understanding that AIDS doesn't have a color, nor
does it have a sex,'' he said.
</P>

the companies received unsolicited bids totaling about $66.4
billion from Qwest Communications International Inc., the No. 4

ANALYSIS: PRACTICALITY IS BIGGEST FOE OF ID PLAN FOR R MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (With FILM-RATINGS-ENFORCE)  
(nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ How are theaters going to enforce the plan announced
last week at the White House to require teen-age moviegoers to show
photo identification at R-rated films?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion in Hollywood is quite simple: The overwhelming
number of them probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   William Kartozian, president of the National Association of
Theater Owners, which represents proprietors of about two-thirds of
the movie screens in the nation, said that each theater would
develop its own program to enforce the rating system, which has
been largely flouted by teen-agers under 17. But studio
distribution executives said that the effort faced two major
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, is that teen-agers manage to see R-rated films
by asking older friends to buy tickets for them, or by buying
tickets for, say, a Disney family film and then sneaking into
viewings at multiplexes that show R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   The other enforcement hurdle lies in the economics of the
theater business. Theaters earn most of their profits not from
movies, but from concession sales of popcorn, soft drinks and hot
dogs. As much as 80 cents of every dollar spent is pure profit to
the theaters, and managers reap a percentage of concession sales as
income.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners hardly dissuade teen-agers from hanging out in
lobbies all day to play video games, which are proliferating at
newer multiplexes, buy food, and glide from theater to theater. In
this atmosphere, theater owners quite naturally hire people to work
at concessions, not to check on teen-agers at individual screens.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Hollywood executives who deal with theater owners
daily said that the White House announcement by the country's
largest theaters and President Clinton was probably an ineffective
way to curb the availability of violent films to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unenforceable,'' a top studio distribution executive
said. Few executives would speak on the record because of the role
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Another studio distribution executive, who worked for years at a
large theater chain, said simply: ``It's unworkable. It's
impossible to police unless somebody is standing at the front door
and checking tickets stubs and ID's _ and that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Antonowsky, a veteran distribution executive for several
studios, said: ``It's specious. Kids can get into a multiplex.
They'll buy a ticket to `Tarzan' and see `The Matrix.' Who'll stop
them? You're talking about an honor system. Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ratings were set up by the Motion Picture Association of
America in 1968, a time of social and sexual turmoil, to replace
the prudish and archaic Hays Production Code, which controlled the
sexual content of movies for decades. (Under the code, generally,
film husbands and wives did not sleep in the same bed.) With the
endorsement of theater owners, the board created the ratings as a
guideline for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the ratings evolved into five categories: G, for
general audiences, usually cartoons or films for small children;
PG, meaning that parental guidance is suggested and some material
may be unsuitable for children; PG-13, meaning that parents are
strongly cautioned that some material may be inappropriate for
children under 13; R, for which youths under 17 must be accompanied
by a parent or adult guardian; and NC-17, a relatively new rating,
under which no one under 17 is admitted.
</P>
<P>
   (Last week's announcement by the president did not involve
R-rated video rentals, which some stores freely make to youths
under 17. Some chains require adult applicants for membership to
respond to a question about whether they want their children to be
able to rent R-rated movies.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require that a ticket taker or someone checking
stubs seek ID's from those in line, which would be time-consuming.
Even more daunting to owners, especially with the proliferation of
multiplexes with 14, 16 or 18 theaters under one roof, theater
employees would probably have to stand outside screens showing
R-rated movies to insure that no one under 17 slipped in.
</P>
<P>
   But any parent with a teen-ager knows that in terms of drinking,
smoking and movies, where there's a will, there's usually a way.
``It's like Prohibition, forbidden fruit,'' a studio chairman said.
``Whenever you set up rules for teen-agers, you're inviting them to
find a way around them.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the plan for ratings system enforcement will
probably prove more effective in smaller towns than in larger
cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Mike Patrick,
chairman of Carmike Cinemas, a Columbus, Ga.-based chain with about
2,700 screens in smaller cities, or what he called ``Hometown,
U.S.A.,'' said that it would be extremely difficult, but not
impossible, to enforce restrictions on teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is when you have an 18-year-old who buys four
tickets, and three of them go to his 16-year-old friend,'' Patrick
said. ``You have to police the auditorium as well as the selling of
tickets. Is it realistic? It's extremely hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick said he would impose some unusual restrictions on
the coming Stanley Kubrick film ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' an R-rated
movie with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman that has strong sexual
content. The film opens in July.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said he would place someone at the door of the theater
showing the film to bar anyone under 17 from seeing it unless
accompanied by a parent or a guardian adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive and a lot of trouble and it irritates
teen-agers, but it can be done,'' Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   But that plan seems to be an exception. Kartozian himself said
that the rating system was meant to advise parents, and that the
monitoring of what movies young people see rests in their hands as
well as those of theater owners. ``This is a shared
responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One studio distribution chief summed up the mood of many other
distribution executives. ``The dirty little secret of the
distribution business is that with 16, 18, 24 plexes, kids show up
and buy tickets for a PG-13 movie and see the one that's R-rated,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff is at the concession stand and the ticket office,
not the theater door. Kids will see whatever they want to see.''

<P>
   It was Saturday night, movie night, in the suburbs. And the
topic, aside from Austin Powers or ``The Phantom Menace,'' was the
much ballyhooed crackdown on keeping viewers under 17 out of
R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   It was a new chapter in an old game. Teen-agers from Los Angeles
to Long Island yawned, groaned and collectively gave their elders a
Poweresque ``Oh, behave.''
</P>
<P>
   At Roosevelt Field on Long Island, Billy Fumagalli, 16, of
Valley Stream, N.Y., waited outside the Loews sixplex. ``I go all
the time and have no trouble getting in,'' he said. ``This
enforcement is stupid. We know what's going on. We've seen it all
before. Most of us have seen a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by President Clinton, theater owners across the country
announced last week that they would increase checks of photo
identification cards to enforce the R rating. Under the movie
industry's voluntary rating system, those under 17 are supposed to
be allowed to see R-rated films only when accompanied by a parent
or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the hoopla over the announcement last week many
theaters already do their best to enforce the rating. But
interviews with dozens of teen-agers at movie theaters near Miami,
New York, Los Angeles and Detroit indicated that they had little
trouble getting around it. In its announcement the National
Association of Theater Owners referred only to ``enhanced
compliance'' of existing policies, compliance that can only be as
strict as the harried ticket seller or usher wants it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kartozian, president of the theater owners association,
said he expected most theaters to work on staff training and phase
in enhanced enforcement over the next 30 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt Field theater, for example, has a reputation among
teen-agers for enforcing the regulations more strictly than most
theaters in the area. But Joseph Choi, 16, and Brian Fang, 15,
showed up on Saturday to see the R-rated ``Instinct,'' figuring
that Choi would buy the tickets for them and for Brian Kim, 15,
using a fake identification card. As it turned out no one asked to
see identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be proofing us,'' said Fang, who said he had
recently seen R-rated films like ``The Matrix'' or ``Cruel
Intentions.'' ``I just go for the enjoyment of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In a film business increasingly geared to teen-agers _ who flock
to popular R-rated films like ``Scream,'' ``Varsity Blues,'' or ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer'' _ an R rating is the best
endorsement a movie can have.
</P>
<P>
   So 14-year-old Doron Stalowsky, who was leaning on his
skateboard with his friend Jeff Wayne, 15, outside the Century City
Shopping Plaza in West Los Angeles, said most of the movies he
wanted to see were R-rated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that aren't are Disney movies,'' he said
disdainfully. ``If a movie looks good, a real action movie, it's
probably rated R, like `Blade.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in suburban Miami and Detroit followed a similar
pattern, conveying a sense that in the porous membrane of
entertainment options open to teen-agers, even stepped-up
enforcement of the R policy would have a minimal impact on
shielding youngsters from objectionable fare.
</P>
<P>
   At the Muvico Paradise Cinemas in Davie, Fla., northwest of
Miami, almost all the teen-agers swarming around the theater poked
holes in the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Haldon Greenburg said he sneaked in all the time. Kelly
McQuilkan said she could see similar fare or the same films on
television. Jackie Ginsberg said she could rent the same movie at
Blockbuster, so what was the big deal about keeping teen-agers out
of theaters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to R-rated movies all the time,'' said Ms. Ginsberg, a
ninth-grader. ``I have been asked for my ID a couple of times. We
say we left it at home, and they let us in. We've seen every horror
movie that's been out. R-rated might be inappropriate for 10- or
11-year-olds, but we're more educated than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country a few generalizations seem to hold. One is
that the teen-ager contemplating the policy finds that the age
requirement should be a few years lower. A second is that nothing
makes things more enticing to teen-agers than a dose of adult
disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put more restrictions on it, kids will just want to go
even more,'' said Kristin Finamore, 14, of Floral Park, N.Y., who
said she had seen such R-rated films as ``Cruel Intentions'' and
``Jawbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   A third conclusion that getting around the rules requires a
little ingenuity, but not all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Most get in by buying a ticket to one movie and then slipping
into another. Some have someone else, an older friend or a parent,
buy the tickets for them. Others simply browbeat the theater
employees.
</P>
<P>
   So when Julia Roth, 16, of Hicksville, N.Y., wanted to see
``Halloween H20'' not long ago, she simply told the young ticket
taker, ``I want to see this movie, so get off my back,'' and
waltzed in.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, for the most part, applauded the new restrictive
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Rich C. Weir, who took his 13-year-old daughter, Heidi, to see
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' in Dearborn, Mich., said
he worried particularly about the violence in many R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that causes a lot of the school shootings,'' he said.
``It is just too much violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even theater personnel concede that enforcement will be
difficult, especially because many of the employees are teen-agers
supposed to be monitoring their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids ask other people to buy their tickets or they lie
about their ID's,'' said Raul Somarriba, assistant manager at Main
Street Cinema in Miami Lakes, Fla. ``We try to enforce the rule,
but it's difficult to enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, teen-agers are hardly a homogeneous group, and if 15-
and 16-year-olds find the upgraded enforcement something of an
affront, some younger viewers are not all that keen to see the
R-rated films anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the R-rated movies, I'm not interested in,'' said
13-year-old Lydia Ross of Los Angeles. ``It's too much violence and
blood.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even the younger ones seem a little baffled by the notion
that keeping them out of films will have much of an impact on their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who go psycho when they see the movies are still
going to go psycho,'' said Jenna Holtzman, 14, of Los Angeles. ``I
think we've seen more horror movies than the average person, and we
don't kill anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings at Colorado's Columbine High School, which helped
generate the new initiative, shocked students so much that some,
like Jessica O'Neill, 15, a student at Cooper City High School near
Miami, said that the new restrictions at least in theory made
sense.
</P>
<P>
   But as she discussed the policy with her friend Amy Solomon,
neither seemed to think it would have a huge impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for sex,'' Ms. Solomon said, ``you can see it on HBO and
stuff. And violence? You see it on the streets.''

ADVERTISERS STRIVE FOR MORE DIVERSITY

   LAKELAND, Fla. _ A woman in a wheelchair models a dress in a
Dillard's ad for new spring wear.
</P>
<P>
   A deaf actress uses sign language to tell a story about cake
decorating at Publix Super Markets.
</P>
<P>
   And employees from a variety of ethnic backgrounds at Wal-Mart
are interviewed for television commercials about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising agencies say companies are making a concerted effort
to bring more diversity to their commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think companies are more conscious of it, but I'd like to
see more diversity and use of people with disabilities,'' said Joe
Pisani, chairman of the department of advertising at the University
of Florida in Gainesville. ``After all, it is a part of life.
People relate to that more. They see that companies are trying to
do something that is socially responsible. I think it makes a big
difference. The more a company can make a situation believable and
more realistic, the more effective the advertising will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for McDonald's in Oak Brook, Ill., said
McDonald's began using ads showing ethnic diversity in 1965. And in
1986, the company aired ``Silent Persuasion,'' its first commercial
featuring people who were hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long been a part of our corporate philosophy,'' Ms.
Howard said. ``We've always been a part of the community in which
we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kilb, an attorney with the Disability Rights Education and
Defense Fund in Berkeley, Calif., said it was encouraging to see
companies incorporate people with disabilities in their ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition that people with disabilities belong in the
mainstream and are in fact functioning in the mainstream,'' Ms.
Kilb said.
</P>
<P>
   Heide Gardner, vice president of diversity and strategic
programs for the American Advertising Federation in Washington,
said it was still rare to see models in a wheelchair or with
prosthetics.
</P>
<P>
   The federation encourages advertisers and advertising groups to
hire more minorities and use more multicultural advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gardner said that only 1 percent of the $200 billion spent
annually in domestic advertising targets people of color.
</P>
<P>
   She said some companies are using montages in commercials to
incorporate various racial and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real opportunity for companies to look at how
they can grow their business by looking at the strategic value of
these markets,'' Ms. Gardner said. ``Brands have been known to go
from No. 3 to No. 1 in ranking when companies successfully target
demographic groups to their brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies just don't understand the value of targeting,''
Ms. Gardner said. ``They make the mistake of thinking they
automatically are selling to these customers through general market
advertising. While they might reach people of color, they are not
necessarily selling to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gardner said successful advertising goes beyond using
different ethnic groups in commercials. The message also has to
relate to the groups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. uses real associates in its advertising to
show diversity in its hiring practices and as a way to relate to
its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to worry about how they come across on
television,'' said Jessica Moser, spokeswoman for Wal-Mart in
Bentonville, Ark. ``We know that customer service will shine
through on our commercials. Our goal is that our associates reflect
our customer base, so we want that to be seen in our commercials as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart Corp. uses both models and celebrities and on some
occasions employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Jarvis, spokesman for Kmart, said the company has used
closed-captioning on its commercials for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to ignore any segment in our advertising,''
Jarvis said.

   TUSUS, Yugoslavia _ One man is ready to go home even though the
geography of his once-charming hillside suburb of Kosovo is scarred
by war and still fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down at the Spanish tile roofs and the flower gardens,
62-year-old Yasha Shala points toward the central mosque. That's
now known as the area where one neighbor was killed and mutilated.
The white house down to the right, that's where the troops burned
the paralyzed girl to death.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 homes -- in different areas of the neighborhood of
about 2,000 homes -- are empty hulks. The red roof tiles are caved
in and expose the remnants of the charred rafters.
</P>
<P>
   On the dirt road where little girls pick cherries, heavily armed
guerilla fighters now patrol and politely warn visitors that the
road they're on and the homes they see may be mined.
</P>
<P>
   Just a short walk from downtown Prizren, Tusus (pronounced,
``TOO-ses'') was emptied and nearly destroyed in the Serb campaign
of terror against Kosovar Albanians. But there are now small signs
of renewal, starting with the sturdy little Shala and his return.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of his family fled with other residents to refugee
camps in Albania, he and his wife stayed with cousins in Prizren,
Kosovo's second largest city. Older people were less subject to
arrest from Serb police and paramilitary forces. He checked his
house frequently and Monday, buoyed by the site of NATO helicopters
occasionally buzzing through the valley, he and his wife planned to
spend their first night back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what happened to all the people,'' he said.
``Starting today, maybe they will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, NATO troops are flooding into Prizren and Serb troops are
pulling out. But, these hills were the location for heavy fighting
between the Serbs and the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The
latter seeks Kosovo province's independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting increased during the 78 days of NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia. About three weeks ago, Serb troops told residents that
two of their soldiers had been killed and they were going to exact
their revenge on the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   They burned dozens of homes in different parts of town clearly
visible from the hill. According to residents, Serbs killed more
than two dozen people. Most homes were looted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sherif Barisha, an ethnic Albanian, works in a dilapidated
300-bed hospital nearly adjacent to the lower entrance to the
suburb. He remembers the day of the Serb attack. Afraid of being
found as a witness, he hid beneath his window sill, peeking at the
morgue where the Serbs left the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were throwing them like a log, like animals,'' he said,
adding that he saw several bodies but did not count them. He said a
relative i

   KOSOVO-MEN _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The missing men of Kosovo.
As hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees streamed
across the borders out of Kosovo during the 78-day NATO bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia, there was always one question people
watching the exodus would ask: Where are the young men? According
to several of these men interviewed by Cox Newspapers on Monday,
they were locked away in jails and prisons around Kosovo, being
starved and beaten mercilessly on a daily basis. They were released
on June 10 after the signing of the Military Technical Agreement,
but their skeleton-looking bodies remind you of death warmed-over.

continued to maintain control of the Pristina airport, President
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke by telephone for

`REAL WORLD' STILL GETS NO RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE REAL WORLD 
On: MTV 
Time: Tuesday at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now in its eighth year, MTV's ``The Real World'' can get no
respect. To some, the infamous docu-opera is little more than a bad
joke about Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation CU-SeeMe,
those media-savvy kids who'd sell their parents into indentured
servitude for 15 minutes of fame in the halls of America's malls.
To others, it's nothing less than the death knell of privacy,
mindless fodder for Our Nation of Peeping Toms, and further
evidence of the media manipulation that was condemned so poignantly
in Jim Carrey's cracked fairy tale, ``The Truman Show.'' Whew!
</P>
<P>
   So let's just forget about Sodom and Gomorrah for a few minutes
and squeeze the juice on this year's edition of ``The Real World,''
which is set in the eminently telegenic state of Hawaii. And a
juicy season it will be, if the latest hourlong premiere is any
indication. Indeed, the Honolulu crew promises to be the most
exhibitionistic cast of the series so far, a gathering of vigorous
egos who clearly know they were hired to make dishy revelation. Of
the seven 19- to 22-year-olds _ Amaya, Colin, Justin, Kaia, Matt,
Ruthie, and Teck _ only one, gay Harvard Law student Justin,
appears to have any resistance to the process of exposure. The
others fall more at the Teck end of the spectrum, Teck being an
aspiring filmmaker with a Dennis Rodman 'do who throws his arms
around each cast member arriving at the house. Looks like he'll be
the court jester and party dude, if he sticks to his favorite
motto: ``All day, every day.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just fun-loving feelings and flip philosophies that
this year's roommates are eager to bare. Less than 15 minutes into
the first episode of ``The Real World VIII,'' two of the gang peel
off their Gap wear for some euphoric skinny-dipping in the house's
glorious pool. And soon after that a third cast member, Kaia, the
Most Likely To Push People's Buttons, tugs off her blouse to share
her healthy self-esteem with millions of cable subscribers. (``I .
. . really, really like looking at myself,'' she says. ``Call it
narcissistic if you like.'') MTV calls it inappropriate, of course,
and blurs out all naughty regions. To be fair, Amaya, a UCLA grad,
does admit to some ``blazing insecurity'' about her body in
general, and ``the twins'' in particular, but her modesty promises
to dissipate in the coming weeks, as she'll be shacking up with
frat boy Colin in the series' first-ever on-screen roommate
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Usually it takes a few episodes for the heavy drama to kick in _
if it kicks in at all (see under: London). By the middle of last
season, the Seattle cast was a mire of bad behavior, with Irene
storming off the show, Stephen slapping her and tossing her beloved
teddy bear into the brine, and poor Nathan struggling with booze
and monogamy. Seattle became some pretty twisted theater, and
that's probably why it turned out to be the series' highest rated
year so far. But the craziness begins immediately in Honolulu, as
the roommates learn Ruthie's dark secret on the second night in
residence. A bisexual raised unhappily by foster parents, Ruthie
drinks herself not only into oblivion but into the hospital with
alcohol poisoning. It's not a pretty sight, watching her on the
bathroom floor with her eyes rolling up into her head, and she
appears to be a dangerous alcoholic. Later in the season, she'll
take a 30-day leave of absence from the cameras. Justin too will
leave the show, although he'll bolt permanently and for more
mysterious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Is it perverse to think ``The Real World'' is more fun in
proportion to how much the roomies suffer? Let's just say that no
one _ not even the most passive MTV viewer, not even the crustiest
TV critic, not even Malcolm McDowell in ``A Clockwork Orange'' _
should have to sit through a boring season of ``The Real World,''
the sort of sullen, attitude-heavy aimlessness that defined the
years in London and Boston. It doesn't matter how picturesque the
location is _ and the house in Hawaii is breathtaking _ if there's
no conflict and passion and engagement among the cast members. So
go ahead and edit that footage into a ``verite'' narrative, MTV,
and go ahead and show off for the camera, kids. You'll all end up
with improved career opportunities, and we'll enjoy 22 episodes of
sanctioned voyeurism. After all, we all take the bait in that
tropical aquarium they call ``The Real World.''

SHOES RECALL TIES OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN U.S., DUTCH CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After a half-century, Judy Meuwissen still
remembers the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Among Meuwissen's memories of World War II devastation in her
hometown of Nijmegen, the Netherlands, is a pair of sturdy brown
oxfords sent from generous Albany residents in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd only had hand-me-downs from my older sisters before. Those
were the first new shoes I ever had,'' recalled Meuwissen, who was
17 at the time. ``The leather soles didn't have a mark on them. I
was so grateful for those brown shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a thank-you note to Albany 52 years ago. ``I never
imagined I'd end up in Albany many years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Meuwissen, now 69, moved to the Albany area in 1970 with her
husband, Dr. Hilaire Meuwissen, an Albany allergist and
immunologist who is also a native of the Netherlands. The brown
shoes had been passed out at Meuwissen's high school in Nijmegen in
the fall of 1947, part of Albany's humanitarian effort to help the
Dutch city get back on its feet in the wake of catastrophic wartime
losses.
</P>
<P>
   An offensive the Allies had launched in September 1944, led by
the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, drove the Germans out of their
last line of defense in the strategic city of Nijmegen at the
confluence of the Rhine, Waal and Meuse rivers near the German
border. It was some of the heaviest bombing of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Allied victory and liberation for Nijmegen was
high: 800 U.S. soldiers dead and thousands more wounded; 2,200
civilians killed and 5,500 wounded; 2,260 homes destroyed and 1,300
damaged; three-quarters of the city center reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Although four years of German occupation had left the 120,000
residents of Nijmegen in dire straits, their resistance against the
Nazis was not broken. They sacrificed what little food they had for
themselves to keep the American soldiers fed. Nijmegen residents
risked their lives during bombardments to shuttle supplies dropped
by Allied planes to American troops pinned down during three days
of intensive fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the courage and collaboration of the people of
Nijmegen, Maj. Gen. James M. Gavin, commander of the 82nd Airborne
Division, suggested the relief campaign. Albany residents responded
in a major way to help a city with which they had 17th-century
ties: Some of Albany's earliest Dutch settlers had Nijmegen-area
roots.
</P>
<P>
   During a Nijmegen Week donation drive in the spring of 1947, a
house-to-house canvass was made across Albany. ``If no parcel is
found on the doorstep, we will ring the doorbell and ask for it,''
said Nijmegen Committee chairman John Davis Hatch Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Mayor Erastus Corning II, who served as an Army
infantryman in World War II, was a driving force behind the
adoption of Nijmegen.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's assistance in Nijmegen's postwar reconstruction
included a 300-ton shipment of donated medical supplies, food,
clothing, toys, window glass, building materials and other goods
valued at nearly $1 million. It was loaded onto the cargo ship
Westerdam at the Port of Albany on July 9, 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Included was a donation of 20,000 pairs of shoes and winter
overshoes from Swartz and Levison, an Albany shoe store. Shoes and
leather were among the most coveted items at the time in Nijmegen,
where some residents had to revert to traditional wooden shoes. The
Albany load of shoes included ``baby shoes and the soft type of
shoe worn by the elderly ... even ballet slippers for youngsters
with ambitions to be dancers,'' according to a story in the Albany
Times Union.
</P>
<P>
   The American city's generosity gained national attention. ``This
campaign was undoubtedly a unique success from the point of view of
one town in this country adopting a town abroad,'' Time magazine
reported in a December 1946 article.
</P>
<P>
   There were several byproducts of Albany's humanitarian effort. A
sister city relationship developed with Nijmegen. Formal exchanges
increased between the Dutch and the Dutch-settled capital city on
the Hudson. Albany's inaugural Tulip Festival took place in 1949.
And a subsequent visit by a Dutch princess inadvertently spurred
construction of the Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands visited Albany _
reprising a 1942 stop by her mother, Queen Wilhelmina _ and
received a downtown tour from Mayor Corning and Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller. Rockefeller was embarrassed to show the princess the
shabby streets and dilapidated buildings, Corning later recalled,
and vowed he would give Albany a major makeover. It was the
beginning of a vision that grew into the 98-acre state government
complex that bears Rockefeller's name.
</P>
<P>
   In gratitude for the Nijmegen relief, Queen Wilhelmina conferred
on Corning her country's highest citizen honor, making him an
officer in the Order of Orange. Nijmegen's burgomaster, or mayor,
Charles Hustinx, visited Corning in Albany several times after the
war, and the two politicians corresponded for years.
</P>
<P>
   Hustinx commissioned ``The Mayor Corning March'' from Nijmegen
composer A.H.J. Kotter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The close connection eventually faded between Albany and
Nijmegen, a prosperous city of 250,000 today. ``Mayor Corning would
occasionally mention Nijmegen and I dug into the institute files
once or twice for historical background,'' but the relationship had
dissipated when he arrived in Albany in 1953, said Norman Rice,
former director of the Albany Institute of History and Art. (Hatch,
the Nijmegen relief organizer, was a predecessor of Rice's in that
post.)
</P>
<P>
   The bond was revived for Mark Heller, an Albany attorney, during
a trip to Nijmegen six years ago. Heller retraced a visit by his
father, the late Julius J. Heller, a Knickerbocker News reporter
who accompanied an Albany goodwill contingent in 1947. The son
visited a cemetery for American soldiers, where Nijmegen residents
help tend the graves of their liberators.
</P>
<P>
   Heller saved several reels of 16mm film his father used to
document the devastation and reconstruction of Nijmegen. ``I
haven't seen those movies since 1947, when I was 13 and my father
told me the stories of his trip,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   Meuwissen is not sure what became of her shiny brown oxfords
from Albany. They were certainly durable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I outgrew them before they wore out,'' Meuwissen said.
Since she had no younger sisters to hand them down to, she figures
they had a second life somewhere _ passed on to a less fortunate
girl in her neighborhood.

   Glasgow Design Fete
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that Glasgow is the United Kingdom's City of
Architecture and Design this year. Will there be special events in
August? _ Robert Diffen, Newburgh, N.Y.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With more than 300 exhibitions, lectures and tours _ as well
as the unveiling of several urban architectural projects _ you
won't have a hard time finding an event related to Glasgow's
designation as the United Kingdom's City of Architecture and Design
for 1999. Among those you might want to check out are the
following, most of which are free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rennie Mackintosh's former Glasgow Herald Building on
Mitchell Lane has been redesigned by the Glasgow architectural firm
Page &AMP; Parks, and will reopen on June 25 with a new name, the
Lighthouse, and a new function _ instead of housing a newspaper,
which it did until the 1980s, it will be devoted to design and
architecture, with study centers and galleries. The redesign
includes the restoration of the building's tower and a new glass
and copper extension. Until Sept. 19, an exhibition called ``The
Unknown Genius,'' devoted to the Glasgow architect Alexander
(Greek) Thomson, will be on display. Another exhibition, ``Vanity
Cases by Philippe Starck,'' will feature miniaturized examples of
the designer's work. It closes Oct. 31. Information: (44-141) 221
6362.
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 5 to 22, the Art Gallery and Museum at Kelvingrove
will show ``Food: Design and Culture,'' which explores the
relationships between food and design, including meal presentation,
restaurant design and food shopping. Information: (44-141) 287
2699.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition called ``Home,'' which runs until Oct. 31 at
Greendyke Street, Glasgow Green, complements a $16 million
development, called Homes for the Future, in which a dozen
architects and developers have created 100 apartments and town
houses (one is a narrow, five-story tower) on a former factory site
in the East End of the city. ``Home'' traces the architectural
history of the private house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several tours have been organized, among them a three-hour tour
of Greek Thomson's buildings (including Holmwood House and St.
Vincent Street Church). The cost is $16; (44-141) 579 7976.
</P>
<P>
   For information on other programs, contact Glasgow 1999,

<P>
   Sicily Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in Sicily on business and have half a day to spend
in Agrigento. Which sites should I limit myself to? Are there
guided tours? _ Sylvan W. Kaplan, Miami
</P>
<P>
   A. In the 5th century B.C., the Greek poet Pindar called
Agrigento ``the fairest city of men,'' and even after several
decades of indiscriminate 20th century urban planning, the hilltop
Sicilian city and its nearby ruins merit more than a half day.
</P>
<P>
   But since your time is tight, start with the Valley of the
Temples, about two miles from the city proper. There are remains of
10 temples here and they are among the finest examples of Doric
architecture. Most of them date from the 5th century B.C., a period
during which the principal settlements of Sicily were Greek. There
is only one temple that is nearly intact, the Temple of Concord,
one of the best preserved Greek temples outside of Greece. One
section of the Valley of the Temples is free and is open daily 8
a.m. to 9 p.m. The area with the Temple of Jupiter and the
Sanctuary of the Chthonic Divinities is open daily 8:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. Tickets cost $2.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Regional Archeological Museum, has an extensive
collection of Greek vases and other artifacts. Open Monday to
Sunday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and Wednesday to Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m.
Telephone (39-09) 22401565.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the museum are the remains of the Hellenistic and
Roman quarter, which offer a glimpse of urban planning in the 6th
century B.C. The area is open daily 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. A ticket to
both the museum and this area costs $4.
</P>
<P>
   The Agrigento Tour Guide Association can arrange individual
tours of the Valley. A two-and-a-half-hour visit to the Temples is
$65. With the museum (a four-hour visit) the cost is $86; Telephone
and fax (39-09) 22608908.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway Key West Bash
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will there be events in Key West, Fla., to honor the
centennial of Hemingway's birth? _ Carol Race, Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ernest Hemingway, who was born in Oak Park, Ill., on July 21,
1899, spent most of the 1930s in Key West, where he wrote ``A
Farewell to Arms,'' ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' and other novels.
For nearly 20 years, Key West has been celebrating his stay with a
series of generally raucous summer events: arm-wrestling, key lime
pie-eating contests, late-night parties at Sloppy Joe's (a
Hemingway watering hole) and, of course, Hemingway look-alike
competitions. This year's 10-day festival, which begins on July 16,
will adhere to this schedule, although there are a few new and
expanded offerings. Organizers are expecting 25,000 Hemingway fans,
and accommodations are filling up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Unless otherwise noted, the following events are free.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m. on July 16, there will be a reception at the Hemingway
House, the author's Spanish colonial house at 907 Whitehead Street,
which will be officially added to the Literary Landmark Register.
On July 18, a photography exhibition called ``Hemingway in Cuba''
will go on display at the Sam Carlos Institute at 516 Duval Street.
Information: (305) 294-3887. Sloppy Joe's, 201 Duval Street, will
have a Hemingway birthday party on July 21, beginning at 9 a.m. and
lasting until 4 a.m. There will be live music and a 500-pound
birthday cake ($1 a slice). Information: (305) 294-5717. The
Hemingway Look-Alike Contest will be held at Sloppy Joe's
(preliminaries at 7 p.m. July 22 and 23, with finals at 7 p.m. on
July 24). The Running of the Bulls (with ``bulls'' made of beer
kegs and wood) will also be on July 24, at 2 p.m., as will a parade
to a twilight party at the Hemingway House, and an all-day
Caribbean Street Fair on Duval Street.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other events are a three-day marlin-fishing
tournament, beginning July 22; information (305) 292-2710; and a
series of literary workshops and readings by various writers
(including Lorian Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway's granddaughter) and
lectures on Hemingway and on writing in general. Information: the
Hemingway Days Festival, (305) 294-2918.

 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the South, it is said, there are more Baptists than people.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a bit of humor about how numerous they are, the saying
is a sly reference to the well-known Baptist practice of padding
the church roll, yielding a larger total in the local Baptist
association than there is in the census.
</P>
<P>
   But far from being a provincial denomination of rural churches,
the Southern Baptist Convention has evolved into an organization
that asserts its political clout and claims its prominence as the
largest Protestant denomination, with 15.7 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Now convention leaders admit that figure is inflated by as much
as a third. And since more reliable figures show that membership
has remained flat throughout the '90s, they are searching for ways
to start the church growing again.
</P>
<P>
   The 142nd Southern Baptist Convention begins Tuesday morning at
the Georgia Dome in Atlanta with 14,000 delegates, or
``messengers,'' expected for a two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting promises to be a quiet one _ the presidency is not
contested and there are no major issues or studies on the agenda.
Messengers are expected to ratify two recommendations _ to leave
the organization's name as it is, and to hold next year's meeting
in Orlando despite a boycott of the Walt Disney Co., which has a
large entertainment complex there.
</P>
<P>
   The messengers also will be told that there are fewer Baptists
than there were last year.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Southern Baptist Convention reported that in 1998
it experienced its first drop in total membership in more than 70
years. The loss of 162,158 members is a 1 percent drop from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Convention officials give several reasons for the drop,
including a change in computer software and data collection
procedures, and dissatisfaction with last year's declaration about
``wives submitting graciously to their husbands'' that prompted
some congregations to sever ties to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the drop is probably meaningless, since even Baptist leaders
admit the category of total membership is seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known for a long time the boasting numbers were
inflated,'' said Convention President Paige Patterson. ``Some of us
were having a hard time with our consciences about it. Churches
have been cleaning up their rolls, so I do not view the drop as
unfortunate. We needed to get more honest about the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Total membership includes ``nonresident'' members, people who
joined a local Baptist church but then moved away and never
transferred their membership elsewhere. Since congregations are
independent, and there is no rule that says they have to do
otherwise, most continue to carry these nonresident members on the
rolls and include them in their total membership.
</P>
<P>
   Membership statistics at the state and national level depend
entirely on voluntary reports of local Southern Baptist churches.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who is 56 and who is expected to be re-elected
without opposition this week, attributes some of the membership
drop to an attempt to make the reporting more honest.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the 15.7 million total members, Patterson said,
``As far as I'm concerned, it's accurate only to the degree it
represents people who have affiliated with Southern Baptist
churches. We probably couldn't find 3 million of them because
they're nonresident Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more like 5 million that couldn't be found. According to
Cliff Tharp, coordinator for constituent information for the
Southern Baptist Convention, the number of resident members in 1998
is 10.7 million, or 32 percent less than total membership.
</P>
<P>
   That is also fewer resident members than the convention had in
1991. While total membership figures did not drop until 1998,
resident members have fallen since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent religion scholar says the fate of other moderate and
liberal Protestant churches _ a long decline in membership and a
corresponding loss of public voice and influence _ could be in
store for the Southern Baptists as well.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the church's membership _ white and middle class _
is aging, said Robert Wuthnow, professor of sociology of religion
at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in demographics in the South in the past few decades
have also affected the church, including migration from the more
religious rural areas to cities, and from other, less religiously
inclined regions into the South, Wuthnow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For awhile, they were doing pretty well keeping up, but it
seems to be diminishing, especially among younger people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a figure of 10.7 million may be suspect, since it includes
inactive members _ people who are still in town but haven't
attended worship or contributed money to the church in years. No
separate figures are kept for inactive members.
</P>
<P>
   Since Southern Baptist congregations aren't responsible to a
higher church authority, the denomination has difficulties keeping
accurate records.
</P>
<P>
   Other Protestant churches have procedures in place and financial
incentives to keep their rolls accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the United Methodist Church in 1996 reported about
8.5 million members. Each local Methodist church's rolls are
reviewed annually and inactive or nonresident members are removed,
said Steve Zekoff of the denomination's General Council on Finance
and Administration. The process is overseen by district
superintendents. And since the church's contributions to regional
and national programs are based in part on membership figures,
``there's an incentive not to inflate membership,'' Zekoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson prefers to focus on numbers other than membership. He
noted that the number of baptisms _ a measure of new members _ was
higher than it has been in nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less concerned about the number of members than the number
of churches, the number of baptisms and worship attendance. If
those were in arrears, I'd be concerned,'' he said.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of concern for the future, however, is continued fallout from
the convention's 20-year turn to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by conservatives to control the convention, begun in
1980, were cemented about 10 years ago, and many moderates conceded
the field, ceasing to contest elections or attend convention
meetings. A group of several hundred moderate churches developed a
parallel organization, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which
operates mission programs and contributes to several new seminaries
that are independent of convention control.
</P>
<P>
   And since last year's annual meeting of the convention, there
has been a series of aftershocks. Several churches in North
Carolina, including First Baptist Church of Raleigh, as well as
First Baptist Church of Greenville, S.C., announced they were
leaving the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson called these departures ``a steady attrition'' and
predicted there would be others, though he said, ``it's not
substantive enough to be called a split.''
</P>
<P>
   The action by the Greenville church was mostly symbolic, since
it had not contributed to Southern Baptist causes since 1994. But
the symbolism was strong because the church's founder, William B.
Johnson, is generally considered the father of the Southern Baptist
Convention and was elected its first president in 1845.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hardy Clemons, pastor of First Baptist in Greenville,
said the 2,500-member church had considered the action for some
time and decided in May to make the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 150 years of the Southern Baptist Convention
having unity in diversity, it's become a fundamentalist
organization, more concerned with creedalism and politics, and
we're not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they added the statement to the Baptist Faith and Message
about submissive women, it was just one more in a long series of
incidents. We were still listed as a church cooperating with the
Southern Baptist Convention, even though we haven't been in some
time. We said, `Where's the integrity in that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A further rift took place in November when a small group of
conservative churches left the Baptist General Convention of Texas
to form a separate organization, Southern Baptists of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They left after the Texas convention, the largest of 40 state
and regional Baptist conventions with 2.5 million members, ratified
a credentialing formula that would make it more difficult for any
group to control the convention. Messengers also re-elected Russell
Dilday, a moderate, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have expressed frustration that the Texas
convention has not affirmed the theological position of the
Southern Baptist Convention and fear that it may be preparing to
break its ties to the national group.
</P>
<P>
   The continued independence of Texas Baptists potentially poses
what Patterson terms ``a threat'' to the Southern Baptist
Convention. Individually and collectively, churches in the Texas
convention sent about $40 million to Southern Baptist Convention
programs in 1997, more than any other source.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have the intention of breaking with the SBC, but
they'll be amazed at how many churches want to stay,'' said
Patterson, who is a Texas native and is now president of
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Baptist General Convention of Texas say they
are simply maintaining the independence that Baptists have always
had about matters of conscience and mission funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas convention's vice president, the Rev. Ed Hogan of
Jersey Village near Houston, said, ``In the Baptist General
Convention of Texas, people can be who they want to be and don't
feel coerced. For some, that was not enough. In some people's
minds, a choice had to be made. You were either pro-Southern
Baptist Convention or pro-Baptist General Convention of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, 38, agreed with Patterson that there could be
repercussions for the Southern Baptist Convention. He said after
the November meeting, the state convention office received numerous
supportive phone calls from churches in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a ripple effect. Our growth rate is
dramatically higher than the Southern Baptist Convention. We're
starting more churches, we baptize more. The reason is, we're
allowing people more freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wuthnow, future growth in the Southern Baptist
Convention may depend on reaching a variety of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they're holding their own is new immigration. One
of the largest Baptist churches in California is Chinese,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy the convention is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans and Hispanics are the two largest non-Anglo
groups in the convention and the fastest-growing, said Robert
Wilson, manager for the African-American planting unit of the
convention's North American Mission Board.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, there were about 1,250 black Southern Baptist churches.
Today there are more than 2,000, said Phil Jones, a researcher for
the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the convention does not collect racial information on
its members, but he estimated there are more than 700,000 members
in predominantly non-Anglo churches. And there are 25 ethnic
fellowships _ such as Korean, Russian and Hmong _ under the
Southern Baptist umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one of the most multi-ethnic denominations. We're not
stepping back from reaching Anglos, but we are stepping up our
efforts to reach ethnic groups because of the disparity for years
of not doing that,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   There are four teams that report to Richard Harris, vice
president for church planting at the North American Mission Board,
each of which is led by a member of a different ethnic group:
African-American, Hispanic, Asian and Anglo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those team leaders are representative of where the Southern
Baptist Convention is going. We're saying, `We believe in
inclusivity, but we believe in quality,' '' Wilson said.

 &HT;    Success smiles on nice guy Will Smith
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Smith, star of the highly touted summer movie ``Wild Wild
West,'' is riding high on the covers of Vanity Fair ($3.95) and
Ebony ($2.50). ``I'm probably the first black guy who ever saved
the world,'' quips the star of ``Independence Day'' and ``Men in
Black.'' You'll find nothing negative in either article. In fact,
says Vanity Fair writer Ned Zeman, Smith is such a nice guy that
when he approaches the film crew ``it's like de Gaulle returning to
Paris. Rarely do you see teamsters reach out for hugs, but they
can't help themselves when confronted with all that bright-eyed,
jug-eared Will Smithness.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Vanity Fair is a revealing article about Ernest
Hemingway and his affair with celebrated beauty Jane Mason.
(Especially revealing is a rear-view nude photograph of Hemingway
on a fishing boat.) When the affair ended, Hemingway portrayed
Mason as the character Helene Bradley in ``To Have and Have Not,''
and the thrice-married Mason took a fourth husband, Esquire founder
Arnold Gingrich. Hemingway's close relationship with the magazine
was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE SON ALSO RISES: In a cover story and interview, Newsweek
($3.50) attempts to find the real George W. Bush beneath the
well-orchestrated image. A son of privilege, Bush is campaigning as
a ``compassionate conservative.'' What that means is a mystery even
to his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  FUTURE FICTION: In a special double issue, The New Yorker
($3.95) showcases 20 young writers for the 21st century, from the
relatively unknown Jhumpa Lahiri to acclaimed authors such as Rick
Moody, Ethan Canin and Edwidge Danticat. The issue ``is a Polaroid
of this generation,'' editor Bill Buford writes, ``snapped as the
century turns.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SHYING AWAY: Shyness in moderation can be endearing, but
sometimes social anxiety can be debilitating. U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($2.95) delves into the mental disorder suffered by one out
of eight Americans. Some are so timid about meeting people that
they have panic attacks. It's difficult to become ``unshy,''
experts say, but there are ways to cope, such as focusing on others
rather than yourself. Besides, many famous people _ including
Eleanor Roosevelt and Robert Frost _ have suffered from shyness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  REVENGE OF THE NERD: In his ``Saturday Night Live'' years,
Adam Sandler got less respect than Rodney Dangerfield. Now, thanks
to hit movies such as ``The Wedding Singer'' and ``The Waterboy,''
Sandler is one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood.
Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) profiles the prankster and previews
his new film, ``Big Daddy,'' in which Sandler stars as an
irresponsible law school graduate who adopts a 5-year-old boy in a
ploy to win back his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BIG SPENDERS: F. Scott Fitzgerald was right. The rich are
different. This week's People ($2.99) looks at the shopping habits
of celebrities for whom spending money is a guilt-free pleasure. On
a recent spree, Goldie Hawn paid $3,000 for three sweaters, and
Jennifer Tilly slipped into a pair of $530 stilettos and a $6,420
silk-and-linen car coat sprinkled with plastic beads. ``Who needs
friends when you have clothes?'' Tilly asks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  UNFADED ROSE: In 1993, Axl Rose was one of the biggest rock
stars around. But after completing a world tour with Guns N' Roses,
he became a recluse. What happened? Spin ($2.99) tracks down the
latest rumors and reports that Rose is holed up in various Los
Angeles studios recording and re-recording what may be the most
anticipated comeback record of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A NEW LIST: Will the Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman movie ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' become the sexiest film of all time? US ($3) fuels the
speculation by polling readers on the sexiest movies to date and
asking the magazine's movie critic Peter Travers to pick the
sexiest movie rentals. Readers chose ``Basic Instinct'' and
``Titanic'' as their favorites, while Travers opted for
``Barbarella'' and ``Last Tango in Paris.''

EXPERTS SAY RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO WERE FOLLOWING ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The defiant occupation of Kosovo's main airfield by
Russian army troops was an impromptu effort by President Boris
Yeltsin to assuage anti-western nationalism at home rather than a
mutinous takeover by Russian armed forces, U.S. experts said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, seeking to downplay the incident, said
Yeltsin had given a ``general order'' to Russian commanders to move
troops from peacekeeping duties in Bosnia across Serbia into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin, in a sense, gave an order for the Russians to
participate _ and the generals took it from there,'' said National
Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the degree of Yeltsin's involvement in the surprising
maneuver, the Russian army leadership publicly promoted the
commander of the 50-vehicle Russian column that raced into Kosovo,
elevating Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin to colonel general.
</P>
<P>
   Russia experts, including scholars who have served in the
Clinton administration, said there was no evidence that Russian
armed forces' had defied Kremlin civilian leadership and raced into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, the troop movement reflected a response to
domestic Russian political sentiment and the Kremlin's bid to force
a better deal from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo H. Daalder, who served as Clinton's director of European
affairs at the National Security Council and has written, ``Getting
to Dayton: The Making of America's Bosnia Policy,'' said the
``pre-emptive troop deployment is forcing our hand to try to work
out a deal that gives Russians greater latitude in the Kosovo
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   James Goldgeier, Clinton's former director of Russian, Ukranian
and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council, said
Yeltsin's decision reflects the Russian president's ``balancing
act'' between cooperation with the West and Russian armed forces'
``anger and humiliation'' over NATO's expansion to the East and its
bombing of Yugoslavia, a long-time Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military leadership in Moscow really resents what is going
on in Kosovo where NATO is dictating the terms of Russian
participation,'' Goldgeier said. ``They wanted to change the facts
on the ground so they would be reckoned with _ and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Lambeth, a Russian military expert and author of a
forthcoming book on Russian air power, said the Russian military
remains subservient to civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military is a basket case economically and
socially, but it's still under pretty tight discipline and
leadership,'' Lambeth said. ``It is still a professional military
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's civilian leaders still retain direct control over the
arsenal of Soviet-era nuclear weapons, Lambeth added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things we can be certain about in post-Soviet
Russia, the command and control of their intercontinental nuclear
missiles is not a problem,'' Lambeth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Russian troops' swift invasion of Kosovo late
Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov first told Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright that he knew nothing about the
maneuver, then that it was a ``mistake'' and finally that the
Kremlin would order an immediate Russian troop withdrawal. Russian
officials said Monday the troops will remain.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart dismissed the Russian
airport takeover as ``not a militarily significant event,'' adding
that Russian commanders had merely ``jumped the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart warned: ``It's easy to make more of this than you
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has offered to send 10,000 troops into Kosovo but
independent of NATO command. NATO has insisted on a unified command
structure. The issue was still hanging when the Russian troops
raced into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered Albright and Defense Secretary William
Cohen to travel to Helsinki, Finland, to negotiate arrangements for
joint allied-Russian occupation of post-war Kosovo. The U.S.
officials will meet with Ivanov and Russian Defense Minister
Marshal Igor Sergeyev before an expected Clinton-Yeltsin summit in
Cologne, Germany, next weekend.

   Retired Army Maj. Gen. Edward B. Atkeson, a former top
intelligence officer for U.S. forces in Europe, said Yeltsin's
maneuver could pay huge political dividends back home.
</P>
<P>
   Atkeson, now associated with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, D.C., said: ``Yeltsin and his
military leadership are looking for superpower status _ and at
least for now they've got it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkeson said Yeltsin is trying to retain effective power in the
face of mushrooming anti-western sentiment before the Russian
parliamentary elections on Dec. 19 and the Russian presidential
election next June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communists and rightwingers are gaining strength,'' Atkeson
said.

   The Bosnia model for deploying Russian and NATO troops appeared
unworkable in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops now serve in Bosnia under the command of a
Russian general posted at NATO headquarters who reports to Gen.
Wesley Clark, NATO's top military commander and the commander of
all U.S. forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But since those arrangements were crafted in 1995, the 16-nation
western military alliance has expanded to the East to embrace
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ nations once allied with
the Soviet Union. NATO also has carried out the first offensive
military campaign of its history, conducting an 11-week bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia, formerly a Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bosnia model is insufficient for the Russians,'' Goldgeier
said. ``The politics are completely different. NATO has expanded;
NATO has gone to war. After that, the Russians are not going to
serve under NATO command.''

   The experts cautioned that the U.S.-led military alliance cannot
allow Russia to operate a separate zone in Kosovo because Serbs
might try to use the Russian-controlled area as a safe haven from
which to stage guerrilla raids on ethnic Albanian Muslims or the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   As Goldgeier put it: ``It's just too dangerous for NATO not to
be in control of the entire military operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright echoed the priority in remarks at the White House: The
Russians ``understand the unity of command and that every inch of
Kosovo has to be under KFOR'' _ the acronym for the Kosovo
international security force.

<P>
   No one has come down with smallpox for decades. But in some
respects it is potentially more dangerous than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox killed more people over the ages than any other
infectious disease. In the 20th century alone, experts estimate, it
took up to a half billion lives, more than all the wars and
epidemics put together.

   Its scars run deep. As long as three thousand years ago, Chinese
records tell of slow deaths and disfigurations. Signs of pockmarks
appear on the mummified head of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses V. The
disease decimated Europe and traveled with colonists to the New
World, laying waste to tribes and aiding British soldiers who
spread the virus as a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the high fevers, deep rashes and oozing pustules that
characterize smallpox are gone _ a feat of disease eradication so
far unequaled in the history of public health. This banishment is
so complete that recent medical textbooks often skip the disease or
give few details of its wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this triumph of modern medicine, Washington and key
allies now fear the scourge could strike anew sometime in the
future, unleashed by war or terrorism. And that worry is raising
new alarms and questions.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the virus so deadly? How well do old vaccinations
work? What about new drugs and vaccines? How likely is a smallpox
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Some answers are grim. For instance, troubles with quality
control are such that no stored smallpox vaccine in the United
States can now be used except in emergencies, Federal officials
say. Stoppers on vials are deteriorating and a vital ancillary
medicine is unusable.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point came on April 22 when the United States _ one of
two official smallpox repositories around the globe, along with
Russia _ announced that it would delay its intended destruction of
the virus, reversing years of planning and Washington's previous
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was to have been destroyed this month, the first
species driven to extinction by design rather than accident. But
the Clinton administration, after careful study, concluded that
clandestine supplies probably exist and could cause the disease to
emerge suddenly in war. And it reasoned that living samples might
aid the development of new treatments and antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that decision, a host of other actions are now
taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Most visibly, top scientists and health experts are now calling
for a federal program to produce new vaccine to protect up to 100
million people in the United States _ enough, in theory, to stop
any epidemic in its tracks. More quietly, American and Russian
scientists hope to embark on studies to better understand the
killer's ways in an effort to perfect a cure. And most stealthily
of all, intelligence agencies are stepping up their efforts to
better judge the threat of smallpox attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing, extremely disturbing,'' said Dr. Donald A.
Henderson, the scientist who led the global campaign that
eradicated smallpox and now is dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health. ``I thought the door had closed on
smallpox. I had happily put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises
Washington on germ warfare, called the eradication ``one of the
great humanitarian accomplishments of our century.'' But he added:
``We have no idea what may have been retained, maliciously or
inadvertently, in the laboratories of a hundred countries from the
time that smallpox was a common disease. These would be the most
likely sources of supply for possible bioterrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that past is prologue, the experts say, the
history of smallpox offers clues to the dangers and opportunities
that may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that if smallpox returns it could be more deadly
than ever. The effects of the disease on an unprotected population
were underscored by the experience of settlers who set sail from
Plymouth, England, landed on the Massachusetts coast in 1620 and
found the area remarkably free of Indians because a deadly epidemic
had just swept through. Early explorers had already spread the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, immunities built up slowly as people survived the
infection, with children usually faring better than adults. Later
on, vaccinations helped keep the scourge at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts say, such protections are all but gone and people
are generally more vulnerable to the disease, underscoring the need
for intelligent debate and possibly protective action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all Indians,'' said Elizabeth A. Fenn, a smallpox
historian at George Washington University. ``We're approaching 100
percent susceptibility.''

 &HT;    NHL expansion team might have first new face
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In the first of what figures to become a long
list of obscure-sounding names to Atlanta sports fans, the
Thrashers' original roster could begin with this one: Hugo
Boisvert.
</P>
<P>
   Boisvert, a 23-year-old center who just completed his junior
season at Ohio State, probably will become the first player to sign
with the Thrashers. Boisvert recently hired an agent, effectively
ending his college eligibility, with the intention of signing with
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some issues in the contract (about guarantees)
that we may not be able to agree to, but I feel pretty confident it
will get done,'' Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Boisvert, a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as college
hockey's top player, will be one of 15 to 20 unrestricted free
agents the Thrashers sign for their 40-man roster. The rest will
come from the expansion and entry drafts. Boisvert is a free agent
because he is over 21 and was not drafted when he played junior
hockey in Ontario for three years before enrolling at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-0, 200-pound Boisvert scored 147 points in 121 career
games, including 24 goals and 27 assists in 41 games as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting old, and I thought with an expansion team I would
have a chance to play in the NHL sooner,'' Boisvert said from his
parents' home in Quebec. ``If I signed with Dallas or Detroit, it
would've been pretty hard to get a chance.

<P>
   The Murderer
</P>
<P>
   As Viruses Go, Huge and Vicious
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where smallpox came from. Viral historians say it
probably began as an epidemic disease 10,000 years ago when human
populations first grew dense. The virus is unusual in that it
inhabits only humans, unlike many whose main home is in animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to have evolved from its natural forebears,'' said
Lederberg, a president emeritus of Rockefeller University. ``Close
relatives like monkeypox are still fairly prevalent in the rain
forests, occasionally reaching humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the disease has existed for at least three
millennia is found in the scars on the head and shoulders of the
Pharaoh Ramses V, who died as a young man in 1157 B.C., perhaps of
the disease. Deities in India and West Africa are devoted to
smallpox, attesting to ages of devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, probably spread by traders, is said by historians
to have reached Europe sometime in the first millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1520, Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conqueror of Mexico, is
believed to have unintentionally brought a smallpox-infected slave
with him to the New World. In the next two years, an estimated 3.5
million Aztecs died.
</P>
<P>
   In 18th-century Europe, smallpox killed 400,000 people a year,
peasants and monarchs alike, a toll proportionately equivalent to
more than a million deaths today. The disease in one 80-year period
is said to have taken the lives of a queen of England, an emperor
of Austria, a king of Spain, a czar of Russia, a king of France and
a queen of Sweden. And President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 was
probably feverish with the disease when he gave the Gettysburg
Address. Two days later, he broke out in the gruesome rash.
</P>
<P>
   Modern science has found that the smallpox virus, known as
variola, is a monster in size, possessing one of the largest
genetic blueprints of any virus. Whether that helps explain its
extraordinary lethality is unknown. What is clear is that, unlike
most viruses, it is highly stable outside its host and can retain
its powers of infection over long periods of time, aiding its
spread among victims.
</P>
<P>
   After a person is exposed, the virus multiplies rapidly and
spreads unobtrusively through the body's lymph system for about two
weeks. Suddenly the symptoms come on. The head, back and muscles
ache. The temperature spikes as high as 104 degrees, leaving the
victim drained. In these hours, little distinguishes smallpox from
garden-variety flu.
</P>
<P>
   In about two days, fever and aches give way to pockmarks. At
first they dot the tongue and roof of the mouth and then, over a
few days, break out over the face and spread to the arms and legs.
Flat and red at first, the pox over two weeks or so turn into small
blisters and fill with pus, after which scabs form. Sometimes the
entire rash becomes bloody.
</P>
<P>
   In its early stages, the disease is often confused with chicken
pox, and one way to distinguish them is that the smallpox rash
often spreads farther, covering the palms and soles.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the victims die, mainly from blood loss, low
blood pressure, cardiovascular collapse and secondary infections.
Many survivors are scarred and blinded. Others have shortened bones
and other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox spreads easily once the rash appears in the throat or
skin, and studies have shown that each infected person typically
passes the virus to three or four others in close contact, often by
coughing. In hospitals, the virus has been shown to travel
surprisingly far in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Eradication
</P>
<P>
   Hunting Down An Assassin
</P>
<P>
   In 18th-century Europe, one segment of the population _
milkmaids _ attracted medical attention because they escaped
smallpox. Surmising that these workers may have developed an
immunity from their association with cows, who were prone to a
related disease, cowpox, Edward Jenner, a British physician, in
1796 vaccinated a boy with material from an infected cow, Blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy with smallpox virus,
but the boy did not get sick. He was immune. Jenner had
successfully developed the smallpox vaccine. Jenner sent his report
on this breakthrough to the Royal Society, which promptly rejected
it. So Jenner published the historic paper on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like any vaccine, Jenner's worked by alerting the body's immune
system to the threat of microscopic invaders, prompting the
formation of antibodies to fight them off. The novelty was that
Jenner used one virus to protect against another, the first being
similar enough to trigger the body's defenses. Cowpox protected
against smallpox even though the two viruses, though clearly
related, are distinct species.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jenner dreamed of eliminating smallpox. But no serious efforts
were made until the 20th century. As late as the 1930s, smallpox
struck up to 50,000 people each year in the United States. The last
case occurred in 1949 in Hidalgo County, Texas. Although Jenner had
used cowpox virus, a third virus, vaccinia, became the standard
vaccine against smallpox. Experts say vaccinia is related to the
smallpox and cowpox viruses, but its origin is a major scientific
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Global vaccinations and quarantines began to be envisioned when,
after World War II, the World Health Organization was founded as an
arm of the newly established United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, WHO resolved to eradicate smallpox, largely at Moscow's
urging. But little happened until 1966, when the United States and
the Soviet Union proposed $2.5 million for an expanded effort. That
year 2 million people died of the disease, mainly in Bangladesh,
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and African countries
south of the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Mass vaccinations were not enough to stop all viral
transmission. So planners added strong measures to hunt down hidden
cases and quarantine victims in an effort to create transmission
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, tribal healers were hired to perform
vaccinations, eventually doing much good. ``They were soon out of a
job,'' recalled Henderson, who led the global campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Europe wiped out smallpox early on. But infected foreign
visitors still caused outbreaks so severe that hospitals
specifically for smallpox were built. As late as the 1960s, West
Germany constructed two such hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   India was one of the last major hurdles. In 1975 during a
two-week period, 130,000 workers visited 100 million homes there,
finding many smallpox cases. Cash rewards produced others. With
each sweep, the smallpox count dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Once India was free of the disease, attention turned to
Ethiopia. Counts fell and the global effort seemed over. But then
cases popped up in Somalia, on the horn of Africa. After another
push, WHO recorded the last case on Oct. 26, 1977, putting the
Somali victim in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the person-to-person chain was broken, defeating the
scourge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, WHO proclaimed the world free of smallpox and soon
asked for all laboratory samples of the virus to be destroyed or
sent to central repositories. But it had no inspection powers. The
heroes of the eradication effort had to take nations of the world
on their word when, one by one, they said the dreaded virus was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Threat
</P>
<P>
   Dark Evidence Of Hidden Arsenal
</P>
<P>
   The deadliness of smallpox has long beckoned to military minds
and was exploited in the New World with relative ease. Settlers and
soldiers from Europe often had immunity because of childhood
exposure. And Indians did not. So the virus tended to kill
selectively, overcoming a general drawback of germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   During an Indian uprising in 1763, Sir Jeffrey Amherst,
commander of British forces in North America (and namesake of the
Massachusetts city), suggested that the disease be sown
deliberately. ``Could it not be contrived to send the Small Pox
among those disaffected tribes of Indians?'' he wrote a
subordinate, encouraging the use of ``every stratagem in our power
to reduce them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his men at Fort Pitt, today Pittsburgh, had already
forged ahead without his encouragement, giving Indians infected
blankets and a germ-laden handkerchief. Epidemics ensued, but
historians are unsure to what extent the spread was due to natural
or deliberate exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fenn, the George Washington historian, who is finishing a
book on smallpox epidemics in America, said Amherst and his men's
independent pursuit of smallpox weapons showed the idea's
prevalence and wide appeal, which continued into the Revolutionary
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were willing to use it in nasty ways,'' she said of
British forces. ``But it's almost impossible to determine how
effective it was.''

<P>
   Still, she said, George Washington was suspicious enough of the
British using smallpox as a weapon, and had lost so many troops to
the disease, that in 1777 he ordered his men to undergo crude
inoculations. The Americans, in contrast to English soldiers, had
typically grown up without exposure to the disease. Thus, like the
Indians, they had no acquired immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its apparent disuse in the last two centuries, the idea
of smallpox as a weapon has never disappeared. Indeed, evidence has
recently surfaced that many such armaments were made, if not used.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Soviet official named Kanatjan Kalibekov, now known
as Ken Alibek, defected to the United States. In secret
debriefings, Alibek, formerly a top player in Soviet germ warfare,
told Washington that Moscow had made tons of smallpox for war, and
he suggested that the virus might have been sold or secreted away
as the Soviet state collapsed and Russian scientists sought new
ways to support themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he went public, and he followed this year with a
book, ``Biohazard'' (Random House), which details a nightmare of
smallpox weapons that he says the Soviet Union made, including
warheads for long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   WHO's announcement of the disease's eradication in 1980, Alibek
wrote, had prompted the Soviets to redouble their smallpox efforts.
``Where other governments saw a medical victory,'' he said, ``the
Kremlin perceived a military opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they have confirmed many of Alibek's
smallpox claims and have also found signs that the virus is now
hidden in Iraq and North Korea, although they report seeing no
evidence of smallpox arms or planned strikes. The intelligence,
they say, helped drive Clinton's April 22 decision to forgo
destruction of American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, destruction of the virus has been put off three
years, until at least June 2002, as world health authorities debate
the stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaccine
</P>
<P>
   Nagging Doubts About a Life Saver
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the United States stopped routine vaccinations of
civilians against smallpox, nearly a decade ahead of much of the
world. Thus, about 114 million Americans born since then, 42
percent of the population, are completely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For people age 27 and older who were vaccinated, the degree of
protection is unclear because scientists have never systematically
measured the duration of immunity. Protection probably drops with
time, but how much is unknown. Lifelong immunity is unlikely, some
experts say. But old vaccinations may lead to milder attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the eradication program, WHO and a number of
countries independently stored enough smallpox vaccine for 60
million people and kept a safeguarded supply of the vaccinia virus
to make vaccine in case more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   With its cache, the United States in theory could protect up to
14 million people if each vial of stored vaccine was used to its
maximum potential of 100 doses. The manufacturer, Wyeth
Laboratories, holds the supply of vaccine in Marietta, Pa., under
the control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox vaccine is still needed at CDC for scientists who work
with the virus. But serious problems with quality control have
stopped vaccinations, creating an acute problem for a very select
group of scientists in the United States and, in the event of an
emergency, a much wider group of people.
</P>
<P>
   Crumbling rubber stoppers on vials are letting in moisture, and
a brilliant green dye is inexplicably losing its color, but the
vaccine remains near normal potency, Federal experts say. The
bigger problem is that the American supply of a colorless liquid
medicine, known as vaccinia immune globulin, which is needed to
counteract adverse reactions to the vaccine, has turned pink for
reasons no one understands. Federal rules say the medicine must be
on hand before vaccinations are given, and the Food and Drug
Administration has barred its use until the mystery is solved.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication is that new batches of vaccine cannot be
made with the old process, since today that process would fail to
pass the FDA's more rigorous standards.

UNDATED: rigorous standards. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In late 1997, prompted in part by Alibek's revelations, the
Pentagon embarked on a $322 million program to make new vaccines
for the military, including smallpox. The earliest it will be
ready, officials say, is 2005 _ if it can pass FDA muster. That
will be difficult. Because the disease no longer exists and the
virus is too lethal to unleash on people, clinical trials cannot be
conducted to test whether or not the new vaccine actually helps
humans resist smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, they're going to have to make a fairly substantial
judgment call,'' Steve Pryor, president of Dynport, the Pentagon's
vaccine contractor, said of FDA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Civil authorities in Washington want at least 40 million doses
of new smallpox vaccine, and health experts like Henderson, who now
heads a center for the study of bioterrorism at Johns Hopkins, are
calling for 100 million. Talks are under way for Dynport to produce
vaccine for civilian use as well, but nothing to date has been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some experts question the whole vaccine approach as a
germ warfare safeguard. Foes, they say, knowing well in advance
about vaccinations, might counter them by switching to a different
germ or a different variant, perhaps genetically engineered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensive measures are much more difficult than offensive
ones,'' said William C. Patrick III, who made germ weapons for the
United States before President Nixon outlawed them three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such threats are helping fuel a search for new ways to combat
smallpox and related viruses, including the development of new
kinds of anti-viral drugs. Unlike vaccines, such drugs, if found
workable, might be administered long after exposure to save
infected victims, attacking the virus directly rather than relying
on the body's immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the National Academy of Sciences released a 108-page
report listing new research frontiers, many of which American and
Russian scientists are already pursuing, such as trying to
understand the genetic secrets that make the virus so deadly.
Combined with the intelligence assessment that other countries were
harboring smallpox for military use, the academy report influenced
the Clinton administration's decision to forgo destruction of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The great unknown, experts say, is whether the benefits of such
planning will ever be needed in a crisis and, if so, whether the
protections will work as envisioned. But the consensus is that
action is nonetheless needed.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, federal experts meeting in Atlanta reviewed
the germ threats facing the nation. Smallpox came out on top.
Second was anthrax, which causes high fevers and death but is not
contagious. In comparison, smallpox spreads like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unanimous that smallpox is the primary threat,'' said
Henderson, who attended the federal meeting. ``The likelihood of an
attack is small, but were it to occur it would be a real
catastrophe.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT PAINTS ITSELF AS A VICTIM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft sought to convince a federal judge Monday
that the secret dealings that led to America Online's $10 billion
buyout of Netscape create sufficient grounds to reject the
government's antitrust case against it.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Microsoft argued that the deal proves competition in
the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust to undermine the
government's charges. In addition, Microsoft's lawyers sought to
show that the company, far from being a predator, should be seen as
a victim.
</P>
<P>
   The company's attorneys presented the court with a seven-inch
stack of AOL documents, discovered under subpoena. They included an
internal memo by Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates, marked as
``highly confidential'' by AOL, that presented his analysis of the
Netscape deal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson admitted nearly all
the documents into evidence, although many of them, at AOL's
insistence, remained under seal. He rejected the Gates memo,
however, saying, ``it may very well be an interesting document. But
it was not sent to AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   When the AOL-Netscape deal was made public last November, during
an earlier phase of the trial, Jackson said it ``could very well
have some immediate effect'' on key issues at stake in the landmark
case.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to bolster Jackson's initial impressions, Microsoft
began its rebuttal by calling as a hostile witness David Colburn,
an AOL senior vice president who had testified last October as a
friendly witness for the government.
</P>

its browser (at least in the short term), the perception will be

 &HT;    MICROSOFT PAINTS ITSELF AS A VICTIM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft sought to convince a federal judge Monday
that the secret dealings that led to America Online's $10 billion
buyout of Netscape create sufficient grounds to reject the
government's antitrust case against it.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Microsoft argued that the deal proves competition in
the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust to undermine the
government's charges. In addition, Microsoft's lawyers sought to
show that the company, far from being a predator, should be seen as
a victim.
</P>
<P>
   The company's attorneys presented the court with a seven-inch
stack of AOL documents, discovered under subpoena. They included an
internal memo by Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates, marked as
``highly confidential'' by AOL, that presented his analysis of the
Netscape deal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson admitted nearly all
the documents into evidence, although many of them, at AOL's
insistence, remained under seal. He rejected the Gates memo,
however, saying, ``it may very well be an interesting document. But
it was not sent to AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   When the AOL-Netscape deal was made public last November, during
an earlier phase of the trial, Jackson said it ``could very well
have some immediate effect'' on key issues at stake in the landmark
case.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to bolster Jackson's initial impressions, Microsoft
began its rebuttal by calling as a hostile witness David Colburn,
an AOL senior vice president who had testified last October as a
friendly witness for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason for putting Colburn on the stand was to justify
the huge documentary dump, confided a Microsoft lawyer, Michael
Lacovara.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the government holds that Microsoft's keen
interest in AOL's purchase of Netscape is at best an irrelevant
sideshow, and at worst a deliberate effort to mask its many
misdeeds.
</P>

 The following article was reported by Lawrence K. Altman, William
J. Broad and Judith Miller; it was written by Broad.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one has come down with smallpox for decades. But in some
respects it is potentially more dangerous than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox killed more people over the ages than any other
infectious disease. In the 20th century alone, experts estimate, it
took up to a half billion lives, more than all the wars and
epidemics put together.
</P>
<P>
   Its scars run deep. As long as three thousand years ago, Chinese
records tell of slow deaths and disfigurations. Signs of pockmarks
appear on the mummified head of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses V. The
disease decimated Europe and traveled with colonists to the New
World, laying waste to tribes and aiding British soldiers who
spread the virus as a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the high fevers, deep rashes and oozing pustules that
characterize smallpox are gone _ a feat of disease eradication so
far unequaled in the history of public health. This banishment is
so complete that recent medical textbooks often skip the disease or
give few details of its wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this triumph of modern medicine, Washington and key
allies now fear the scourge could strike anew sometime in the
future, unleashed by war or terrorism. And that worry is raising
new alarms and questions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, troubles with quality control are such that no
stored smallpox vaccine in the United States can now be used except
in emergencies, federal officials say. Stoppers on vials are
deteriorating and a vital ancillary medicine is unusable.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point came on April 22 when the United States _ one of
two official smallpox repositories around the globe, along with
Russia _ announced that it would delay its intended destruction of
the virus, reversing years of planning and Washington's previous
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was to have been destroyed this month, the first
species driven to extinction by design rather than accident. But
the Clinton administration, after careful study, concluded that
clandestine supplies probably exist and could cause the disease to
emerge suddenly in war. And it reasoned that living samples might
aid the development of new treatments and antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that decision, a host of other actions are now
taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Most visibly, top scientists and health experts are now calling
for a federal program to produce new vaccine to protect up to 100
million people in the United States _ enough, in theory, to stop
any epidemic in its tracks. More quietly, American and Russian
scientists hope to embark on studies to better understand the
killer's ways in an effort to perfect a cure. And most stealthily
of all, intelligence agencies are stepping up their efforts to
better judge the threat of smallpox attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing, extremely disturbing,'' said Dr. Donald A.
Henderson, the scientist who led the global campaign that
eradicated smallpox and now is dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health. ``I thought the door had closed on
smallpox. I had happily put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises
Washington on germ warfare, called the eradication ``one of the
great humanitarian accomplishments of our century.'' But he added:
``We have no idea what may have been retained, maliciously or
inadvertently, in the laboratories of a hundred countries from the
time that smallpox was a common disease. These would be the most
likely sources of supply for possible bioterrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that if smallpox returns, it could be more deadly
than ever. The effects of the disease on an unprotected population
were underscored by the experience of settlers who set sail from
Plymouth, England, landed on the Massachusetts coast in 1620 and
found the area remarkably free of Indians because a deadly epidemic
had just swept through. Early explorers had already spread the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, immunities built up slowly as people survived the
infection, with children usually faring better than adults. Later
on, vaccinations helped keep the scourge at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts say, such protections are all but gone and people
are generally more vulnerable to the disease, underscoring the need
for intelligent debate and possibly protective action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all Indians,'' said Elizabeth A. Fenn, a smallpox
historian at George Washington University. ``We're approaching 100
percent susceptibility.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where smallpox came from. Viral historians say it
probably began as an epidemic disease 10,000 years ago when human
populations first grew dense. The virus is unusual in that it
inhabits only humans, unlike many whose main home is in animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to have evolved from its natural forebears,'' said
Lederberg, a president emeritus of Rockefeller University. ``Close
relatives like monkeypox are still fairly prevalent in the rain
forests, occasionally reaching humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the disease has existed for at least three
millennia is found in the scars on the head and shoulders of the
Pharaoh Ramses V, who died as a young man in 1157 B.C., perhaps of
the disease. Deities in India and West Africa are devoted to
smallpox, attesting to ages of devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, probably spread by traders, is said by historians
to have reached Europe sometime in the first millennium.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Modern science has found that the smallpox virus, known as
variola, is a monster in size, possessing one of the largest
genetic blueprints of any virus. Whether that helps explain its
extraordinary lethality is unknown. What is clear is that, unlike
most viruses, it is highly stable outside its host and can retain
its powers of infection over long periods of time, aiding its
spread among victims.
</P>
<P>
   After a person is exposed, the virus multiplies rapidly and
spreads unobtrusively through the body's lymph system for about two
weeks. Suddenly the symptoms come on. The head, back and muscles
ache. The temperature spikes as high as 104 degrees, leaving the
victim drained. In these hours, little distinguishes smallpox from
garden-variety flu.
</P>
<P>
   In about two days, fever and aches give way to pockmarks. At
first they dot the tongue and roof of the mouth and then, over a
few days, break out over the face and spread to the arms and legs.
Flat and red at first, the pox over two weeks or so turn into small
blisters and fill with pus, after which scabs form. Sometimes the
entire rash becomes bloody.
</P>
<P>
   In its early stages, the disease is often confused with chicken
pox, and one way to distinguish them is that the smallpox rash
often spreads farther, covering the palms and soles.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the victims die, mainly from blood loss, low
blood pressure, cardiovascular collapse and secondary infections.
Many survivors are scarred and blinded. Others have shortened bones
and other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox spreads easily once the rash appears in the throat or
skin, and studies have shown that each infected person typically
passes the virus to three or four others in close contact, often by
coughing. In hospitals, the virus has been shown to travel
surprisingly far in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In 18th-century Europe, one segment of the population _
milkmaids _ attracted medical attention because they escaped
smallpox. Surmising that these workers may have developed an
immunity from their association with cows, who were prone to a
related disease, cowpox, Edward Jenner, a British physician, in
1796 vaccinated a boy with material from an infected cow, Blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy with smallpox virus,
but the boy did not get sick. He was immune. Jenner had
successfully developed the smallpox vaccine. Jenner sent his report
on this breakthrough to the Royal Society, which promptly rejected
it. So Jenner published the historic paper on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like any vaccine, Jenner's worked by alerting the body's immune
system to the threat of microscopic invaders, prompting the
formation of antibodies to fight them off. The novelty was that
Jenner used one virus to protect against another, the first being
similar enough to trigger the body's defenses. Cowpox protected
against smallpox even though the two viruses, though clearly
related, are distinct species.
</P>
<P>
   Jenner dreamed of eliminating smallpox. But no serious efforts
were made until the 20th century. As late as the 1930s, smallpox
struck up to 50,000 people each year in the United States. The last
case occurred in 1949 in Hidalgo County, Texas. Although Jenner had
used cowpox virus, a third virus, vaccinia, became the standard
vaccine against smallpox. Experts say vaccinia is related to the
smallpox and cowpox viruses, but its origin is a major scientific
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Global vaccinations and quarantines began to be envisioned when,
after World War II, the World Health Organization was founded as an
arm of the newly established United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, WHO resolved to eradicate smallpox, largely at Moscow's
urging. But little happened until 1966, when the United States and
the Soviet Union proposed $2.5 million for an expanded effort. That
year 2 million people died of the disease, mainly in Bangladesh,
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and African countries
south of the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Europe wiped out smallpox early on. But infected foreign
visitors still caused outbreaks so severe that hospitals
specifically for smallpox were built. As late as the 1960s, West
Germany constructed two such hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   India was one of the last major hurdles. In 1975 during a
two-week period, 130,000 workers visited 100 million homes there,
finding many smallpox cases. Cash rewards produced others. With
each sweep, the smallpox count dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Once India was free of the disease, attention turned to
Ethiopia. Counts fell and the global effort seemed over. But then
cases popped up in Somalia, on the horn of Africa. After another
push, WHO recorded the last case on Oct. 26, 1977, putting the
Somali victim in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the person-to-person chain was broken, defeating the
scourge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, WHO proclaimed the world free of smallpox and soon
asked for all laboratory samples of the virus to be destroyed or
sent to central repositories. But it had no inspection powers. The
heroes of the eradication effort had to take nations of the world
on their word when, one by one, they said the dreaded virus was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its apparent disuse in the last two centuries, the idea
of smallpox as a weapon, however, has never disappeared. Indeed,
evidence has recently surfaced that many such armaments were made,
if not used.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Soviet official named Kanatjan Kalibekov, now known
as Ken Alibek, defected to the United States. In secret
debriefings, Alibek, formerly a top player in Soviet germ warfare,
told Washington that Moscow had made tons of smallpox for war, and
he suggested that the virus might have been sold or secreted away
as the Soviet state collapsed and Russian scientists sought new
ways to support themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he went public, and he followed this year with a
book, ``Biohazard'' (Random House), which details a nightmare of
smallpox weapons that he says the Soviet Union made, including
warheads for long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they have confirmed many of Alibek's
smallpox claims and have also found signs that the virus is now
hidden in Iraq and North Korea, although they report seeing no
evidence of smallpox arms or planned strikes. The intelligence,
they say, helped drive Clinton's April 22 decision to forgo
destruction of American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, destruction of the virus has been put off three
years, until at least June 2002, as world health authorities debate
the stay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the United States stopped routine vaccinations of
civilians against smallpox, nearly a decade ahead of much of the
world. Thus, about 114 million Americans born since then, 42
percent of the population, are completely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For people age 27 and older who were vaccinated, the degree of
protection is unclear because scientists have never systematically
measured the duration of immunity. Protection probably drops with
time, but how much is unknown. Lifelong immunity is unlikely, some
experts say. But old vaccinations may lead to milder attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the eradication program, WHO and a number of
countries independently stored enough smallpox vaccine for 60
million people and kept a safeguarded supply of the vaccinia virus
to make vaccine in case more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   With its cache, the United States in theory could protect up to
14 million people if each vial of stored vaccine was used to its
maximum potential of 100 doses. The manufacturer, Wyeth
Laboratories, holds the supply of vaccine in Marietta, Pa., under
the control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox vaccine is still needed at CDC for scientists who work
with the virus. But serious problems with quality control have
stopped vaccinations, creating an acute problem for a very select
group of scientists in the United States and, in the event of an
emergency, a much wider group of people.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, prompted in part by Alibek's revelations, the
Pentagon embarked on a $322 million program to make new vaccines
for the military, including smallpox. The earliest it will be
ready, officials say, is 2005 _ if it can pass FDA muster. That
will be difficult. Because the disease no longer exists and the
virus is too lethal to unleash on people, clinical trials cannot be
conducted to test whether or not the new vaccine actually helps
humans resist smallpox.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morning showers and thundershowers will cross the Northeast on
Tuesday ahead of a cold front. Breezes will increase from the
southwest until the front passes, then winds will blow from the
northwest. Drier air moving to the south behind the front will
bring mostly sunny skies from southern New England to the Ohio
Valley. In the wake of the front, cool air will bring an
unseasonable chill from New England to the Great Lakes Tuesday
night. Farther south along the front, a weak area of low pressure
will aid in the development of scattered thunderstorms over the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers will move into the northern Plains ahead of a
low pressure system sliding out of the Rockies. Warm, moist air
ahead of this low will provide the fuel for showers and
thunderstorms. A cold front trailing to the north and west will
direct flow up the east slopes of the northern Rockies, causing
more numerous showers and thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance at 18,000 feet over west Texas will trigger
showers and thundershowers. Weak flow aloft means that the storms
will be slow-moving, bringing torrential rain, possibly even
causing localized flash flooding. The Gulf Coast will be very warm
and humid with a few isolated thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure approaching the Pacific Northwest will usher low
clouds onshore. In addition, some locations very near the Coast
will experience a few showers. Other than some patchy low clouds at
the Coast, mostly sunny skies will be widespread over southern
California. The Southwest will remain bright, very hot, and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Presidential Warmth
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was one of the warmest June days in recent memory on
Mount Washington in northern New Hampshire. The mercury rose to 67
degrees just before 3 p.m. eclipsing a record that had stood since
1969. The warmth was associated with a large ridge of high pressure
that crested over New England this past weekend. The circulation
around the high brought ocean-cooled air to the New England coast
while drawing balmy air northward along the west slopes of the
northern Appalachians. A strong cold front will pass through the
region Tuesday with some snow likely on the peak later this week.

 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    All he ever wanted was to be a doctor.
 &HT;    And to millions of ``Star Trek'' fans around the world, DeForest
Kelley was exactly that. Even though his family couldn't afford to
put him through medical school, the actor made his mark as Dr.
Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy, the irascible medic aboard the starship
Enterprise.
 &HT;    Kelley played the role from 1966 to 1969 on the original ``Star
Trek'' series, as well as in six feature films and a guest
appearance in ``Encounter at Farpoint,'' the series premiere of the
show's first spinoff, ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
 &HT;    Kelley's journey ended at noon on June 11, when the 79-year-old
actor, who was a longtime smoker, succumbed to a lengthy illness at
the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and Hospital in
Woodland Hills, Calif. His wife of nearly 55 years, Carolyn, was at
his side when he passed away.
 &HT;    ``My legacy is that I have inspired a great number of people to
enter the medical world,'' he told ``Inside Trek &AMP; Sci-Fi'' last
August. ``These people are doctors now, all kinds of doctors who
save lives and help other people in other ways.
 &HT;    ``That's something that very few people can say they've done.
I'm very proud to say that I have.''
 &HT;    As McCoy, Kelley represented one-third of ``Star Trek's''
leading troika, which also included William Shatner as the heroic,
libidinous Capt. Kirk and Leonard Nimoy as the ever-logical Vulcan,
Mr. Spock. Millions for fans never tired of McCoy and Spock's
verbal sparring, and always welcomed the repetition of the doctor's
catch phrase, ``He's dead, Jim.''
 &HT;    Looking back over three decades of ``Star Trek,'' Kelley had his
favorites. He ranked the time-travel romance ``The City on the Edge
of Forever'' as the show's finest episode, and 1986's ``Star Trek
IV: The Voyage Home'' as the best of the original-cast features.
 &HT;    By the time he achieved fame as a futuristic good guy, Kelley
had already spent two decades as an actor, often playing villains
in films and television shows set in the Old West. Among his many
television credits were ``The Lone Ranger,'' ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Bat
Masterson'' and ``Bonanza,'' while his films included ``Raintree
County'' (1957), ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' (1957) and
``Apache Uprising'' (1966).
 &HT;    Kelley's last acting job was as the voice of a satellite, the
Viking I, in last year's direct-to-video release of ``The Brave
Little Toaster Goes to Mars,'' an animated children's film.
 &HT;    Offscreen, Kelley was considered by fans and friends alike a
warm and humble man who adored his wife. So low-key and beloved was
he that, in the many books written about ``Trek'' by his co-stars _
several of whom famously quarreled _ no one penned a negative word
about ``De,'' as he was called by friends.
 &HT;    ``It's nice to hear that people think well of you,'' Kelley said
last year. ``I knew about the feelings on the set, of course, but I
just divorced myself from that and tried to keep my eyes straight
down the road.
 &HT;    ``I've always tried to do my job without digging into somebody's
personal life, without making waves,'' he added. ``I'd like to
think that served me well.''
 &HT;    In lieu of flowers, Carolyn Kelley has requested that donations
be made to the Motion Picture and Television Fund, the North Shore
Animal League and the Harvard Medical School, which will soon
establish a DeForest Kelley Scholarship Fund for medical students.

 &HT;    Gamesmanship or land rush? Qwest move makes communications
picture blurryBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stunning attempt by Qwest Communications
International to snare two much bigger telecommunications carriers
has dragged BellSouth Corp. into a complex and uncertain game that
could turn into anything from a two-party bidding war to a five-way
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's hostile offers for U.S. West and Frontier
Communications, valued at $66 billion Sunday were worth only $53.2
billion based on stock values after Monday's trading. But Qwest
means to outbid the $52 billion proposal already mounted by Global
Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   That proposition comes after a series of multi-billion mergers
by telecommunications companies from upstarts like WorldCom, which
swallowed MCI, to giants like AT&AMP;T that have purchased a range of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Qwest bid pits two hard-charging executives against each
other: Qwest Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio and Global Crossing CEO
Robert Annunziata, who said Monday that he plans to brush past
Qwest and complete the takeover of the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely some gamesmanship going on,'' said analyst
Marc Bacurin of JC Bradford &AMP; Co. ``It could also be as simple as a
land rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecom analyst Jeff Kagan said the need for bandwidth _ the
lines that can carry huge amounts of data demanded by video _ is
behind the frantic buying. ``Customers will demand more from their
communications providers tomorrow. Today the Internet is pictures
and text. But tomorrow, video will play a large role in the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation could spin BellSouth in a new direction, only
two months after the Atlanta-based company paid $3.5 billion for 10
percent of Qwest, aiming for access to the company's high-speed
network and long-distance service. BellSouth's interest in
acquiring the rest of Qwest has been stymied by federal law that _
at least for now _ limits the ownership of a regional Bell in a
long-distance company to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Should Qwest's two proposals be completed, millions of Qwest
shares will be distributed to owners of US West and Rochester,
NY-based Frontier, so current shareholders in Qwest would find
their ownership diluted. BellSouth's portion of Qwest would shrink
to less than 4 percent, and BellSouth would then have the option of
increasing its investment, said Qwest Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very comfortable with BellSouth being a 10 percent
owner, (or) we wouldn't have done the original transaction,''
Nacchio said. ``I think we're just going to let this play out.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials would not say whether the company would make
that additional investment nor whether it approved of the Qwest
maneuver. ``We consider this a merger or acquisition on which we
wouldn't comment,'' said spokesman Jeff Battcher. ``But the
announcement they have made doesn't change anything for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Nacchio succeeds, quite a few things might change. For
instance, Qwest would morph from a company with revenue of $4.5 to
one with $22 billion _ nearly equal to BellSouth. The combined
company's stock value might also rival BellSouth's $87 billion
value, while employing 71,000 people _ about the size of
BellSouth's local phone unit. Qwest would also have a wireless
phone unit, one with technology that does not mesh with that of
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Nacchio nor BellSouth would discuss it, it
seems unlikely that Qwest would have pursued the double-bid over
strenuous objections from BellSouth. But it also seems possible
that BellSouth was less than enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials have repeatedly stressed that the company
does not view bigger as better, but in talking to reporters Monday,
Nacchio emphasized the advantages of scale.
</P>
<P>
   And in making its bid, Qwest is also proposing to reshape the
company in which BellSouth invested. From high-speed and
long-distance, its business would expand to include local phone
service through Frontier as well as in US West's 14-state turf.
</P>
<P>
   A rapid-growth company, Qwest would shift to much slower growth.
And that change drew immediate rejection from Wall Street, where
Qwest stock Monday plummeted 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. West is a profitable local phone company that may be ahead
of BellSouth in introducing new high-speed services. But the
company has a reputation for less-than-stellar customer service.
U.S. West also sits astride the weakest, smallest region of any
Bell, and it looks even smaller now that SBC and Bell Atlantic are
consuming other regional companies.
</P>
<P>
   While those mega-deals thundered around them, BellSouth
officials have scoffed at the notion of buying U.S. West. But Qwest
is now drawing BellSouth into a complicated version of that
purchase. And perhaps Qwest is setting the stage for a five-company
chain.
</P>
<P>
   US West has a pending investment in Global Crossing, even if
their deal falls through. So the Qwest proposal potentially links
BellSouth _ strong in local, wireless and Latin America _ with
Qwest's long-distance, US West's cash engine, Frontier's
smorgasbord of services and Global Crossing's high-speed oceanic
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing and Qwest might yet work out an amicable
settlement that pleases all the parties.
</P>
<P>
   And whether or not there is a five-way accord, BellSouth could
reassure investors and clinch a deal by entering the fray and
sharing the cost of Qwest's bid, said analyst James Hern of Olde
Discount Corp. ``They would add a more stable currency into the
mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the five could mean cheaper transport, making them
all more competitive, Hern said. ``Is it far fetched? Well, a
couple of years ago it would have been unthinkable.''

GAYS CALL SENATOR HYPOCRITICAL AFTER HIS STAFFERS COLLECT PORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's largest gay rights organization
attacked Sen. James M. Inhofe Monday after staffers for the
Oklahoma Republican were found to have downloaded pornographic
material from the Internet into the Capitol Hill computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate hypocrisy,'' said David Smith, spokesman for
the group, the Human Rights Campaign. ``The sanctimonious,
holier-than-thou veil was ripped from the face of Senator Inhofe.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator, a hero to the religious right, has infuriated gay
activists since last year when he and three other conservatives put
a so-called ``hold'' on President Clinton's nomination of San
Francisco philanthropist James Hormel to become ambassador to
Luxembourg. That action blocked a vote on the nomination, which
requires Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, while Congress was on a 10-day break, Clinton
announced he was giving Hormel a recess appointment, which will
allow him to serve without Senate approval until the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe has said he feared Hormel, who is homosexual, would use
his post to promote a gay-rights agenda and would not be a proper
choice to serve as ambassador to a predominantly Catholic country.
Hormel's critics have also attacked him as a purveyor of smut
because he has financed a collection of homosexual material at San
Francisco's Main Public Library. Hormel has pledged not to pursue a
gay agenda in his new diplomatic post.
</P>
<P>
   After a Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, revealed Monday that
Inhofe had taken action against some of his staffers for
downloading pornography from the Internet, the Human Rights
Campaign issued its attack.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Inhofe was hypocritical in blocking Hormel's
nomination because of what the senator ``perceives to be a lack of
morality,'' when ``his own staff is downloading pornography on the
Senate computer system under his own nose on the taxpayers dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe spokesman Gary Hoitsma said Monday that the senator
``doesn't tolerate this sort of thing,'' which was discovered last
week by experts making a Capitol Hill computer systems check.
</P>
<P>
   Hoitsma said the senator's office has ``taken immediate,
forceful and appropriate disciplinary action,'' against the
staffers, but he refused to disclose how they were being punished.
``We're not going to get into the specifics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Inhofe threatened to block all pending civilian
appointments by Clinton _ about 150 are pending _ unless the
president agrees to warn senators ``in advance of a recess'' that
he plans to make such an appointment while they are on leave.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Inhofe sent a letter to his fellow senators asking
them to support his plan as a protest against Clinton's recess
appointment of Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoitsma said the senator is not trying to force Hormel to
resign, ``We don't want to undo Hormel _ we understand that's a
done deal,'' Hoitsma said.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said in his letter that he is following a precedent set
by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., in 1985, when Byrd as minority
leader blocked President Ronald Reagan's appointments until Reagan
agreed to stop making additional recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said Lott was angered that the White House did not
notify him of Hormel's appointment until the evening before Clinton
announced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lott very much shares the same concerns that Inhofe has about
how this administration has handled this appointment,'' Czwartacki
said, but he added that he expects the issue will be resolved
before any nominations are blocked in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that this is going to be resolved,'' before
the dispute blocks key nominations, including Lawrence Summers as
treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke as ambassador to the
United Nations, Czwartacki said.

HYDE ATTACKS FIRST AMENDMENT AND PARENTAL AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper, Wyo., Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(mk) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who failed to lead his GOP cohorts to a
conviction of President Clinton on any articles of impeachment, is
now leading a charge against parents and the First Amendment. Let
us hope he has the same measure of success with this ill-conceived
effort.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, Hyde, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee,
introduced the ``Children's Defense Act of 1999''(H.R. 2036), a
bill with such broad language that newspaper carriers under 17
years of age (defined as minors in the bill) may be forbidden to
read the newspapers they carry.
</P>
<P>
   And the newspaper company that puts a newspaper into the hands
of minors may be fined _ if that newspaper contains ``detailed
verbal descriptions or narrative accounts of explicit sexual or
violent material.'' How does one cover a war without such violent
details, or report on the horrors of genocide without such
descriptions?
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not spell out the amount of the fine, but anyone
convicted of allowing a minor to read Stephen Crane's ``Red Badge
of Courage'' or letting a 16-year-old see the move ``Schindler's
List'' could be imprisoned for five years and fined. Yes, these
powerful tales of war and the Holocaust also fall under the
material prohibited to minors by Hyde's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill defines violent material as ``sadistic or masochistic
activity, including flagellation or torture by or upon a person,
acts of mutilation of the human body, or rape.'' That covers just
about all the inhumane acts that occur during war or are
perpetrated by dictatorial regimes. Shall we then hide these truths
from our 16-year-olds, when two years later, they could be faced
with fighting on some distant shore?
</P>
<P>
   Shall we keep them naive about the horrors of war, the violence
in inner cities, the history of genocide, the despicable acts of
torture done in dictatorships around the world?
</P>
<P>
   The material forbidden includes ``any picture, photograph,
drawing, sculpture, videogame, motion picture film, or similar
visual representation or image, book, pamphlet, magazine, printed
matter, or sound recording.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill uses a three-prong test to determine what sexual or
violent material is prohibited. If taken as a whole, the material
``1) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid
interests of minors; 2) is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is
suitable material for minors; and 3) is utterly without redeeming
social importance for minors.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is vague. How does an adult know what is ``utterly
without redeeming social importance for minors''? A bookseller
might purge his store of the Greek tragedies, Greek mythology, the
medieval epic ``Beowulf,'' Dante's ``The Inferno,'' Richard
Wright's ``Native Son,'' John Gardner's ``Grendel,'' Erich Maria
Remarque's ``All Quiet on the Western Front'' _ to name only a few
that might fall victim to this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   This bill and others like it have been sparked by the school
shootings at Columbine High School. The aim of these bills is
misdirected and based upon false premise. H.R. 2036 claims that
``hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that children who
are consistently exposed to violence on television have a higher
tendency to exhibit violent and aggressive behavior, both as
children and later in life.'' No so.
</P>
<P>
   Social scientists who conduct such studies about violence have
arrived at differing and mixed results. A child's aggressive
behavior is more a result of drugs, alcohol and physical or sexual
abuse within a family.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have also shown that males who have just completed some
aerobic exercise and then are angered will show more aggressive
behavior than they would had they not exercised. Shall we then
criminalize aerobic exercise?
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council, an agency within the National
Academy of Sciences, did an exhaustive study on the causes of
violence and aggressive behavior in 1993 and did not consider the
media a significant problem. Truth is, some test subjects do
exhibit more aggressive behavior for a short period of time after
viewing a violent movie or TV show _ some, but not most.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if parents feel that TV is contributing to the
aggressive behavior of their children, the solution is simple. Turn
the thing off.
</P>
<P>
   Pull the plug. Lock all the TVs in a room or a closet. We don't
need the government telling us what we or our children
``should''view.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's bill gives no latitude for parents to decide what their
children should read or see or hear. The government will do that
for us. If parents show any of the prohibited material to their
children, they can be fined or imprisoned. There is no parental
exception built into this proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   We're beginning to see the price we pay when we think of the
government as the Santa who will give us all we wish. When we ask
the government to help us raise our children, it will. And it will
tell us what is prohibited and what is best. It will force its
rules and regulations between parents and child. ``Government knows
best'' is the new TV show, starring Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems in H.R. 2036, no wonder that the bill is
not scheduled to have any public hearings. Not a single one. Keep
the public out. Keep parents from knowing how the Congress will
structure their lives. The House Rules Committee is expected to
send the bill to the floor of the House this week for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for members of the public to call their
representatives to object. Later will be too late. This bill is not
only an attack on the First Amendment right of free speech and
freedom of the press, it is also an assault on parental authority _
and the family itself.

REPUDIATED BY VOTERS, BELGIUM'S PRIME MINISTER RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium resigned
Monday after voters swept away his center-left coalition government
in elections on Sunday. The government had been heavily criticized
for its handling of a dioxin scare that cleared poultry, beef, eggs
and butter from food stores here and frightened countries around
the world into halting food imports from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dehaene, who was Europe's senior statesman after seven years in
office, said he was thinking of quitting politics. ``I think that
for myself it is time to start doing other things,'' Dehaene, 59,
told journalists in Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation European Union is unhappy with his decision late
last week to put food products certified as safe back on the
shelves and clear them for export. The union's agricultural experts
said they were not convinced by Belgium's assurances that it had
identified all the meat-producing customers of a company that
supplied them earlier this year with animal and chicken feed
contaminated by fuel oil that contained cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Dehaene, a leader from the Flemish-speaking northern part of the
country, said it was important to form a new government quickly to
deal with the crisis. But Belgian politics are so fragmented across
ideological, ethnic and linguistic lines that it almost always
takes months after an election to put a coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest regions, the prosperous north where the language
is close to Dutch, and the unemployment-ridden industrial rust belt
in the French-speaking south, are almost like separate countries,
each with its own political parties, labor unions, television and
radio stations. With Brussels and a small German-speaking region in
the east, they share passports, armed forces, a national railroad
system with trains going almost everywhere, and a king, Albert II,
who accepted Dehaene's resignation offer Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dehaene's Christian Democrat party in Flanders won 14 percent of
the vote, 3.2 percentage points fewer than it did in 1995. With the
biggest single share of the vote won by the pro-business Liberal
party in French-speaking Wallonia, with 24.3 percent of the vote
and 41 seats in the 150-member Parliament, there was speculation
that its leader, Louis Michel, could be the next prime minister.
Unlike many people in the southern part of the country, he is said
to speak good Flemish as well as French.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalist parties made gains, with 20 seats, but so did
the ultra-nationalist Vlaams Blok party in the Flemish-speaking
part of the country. It will have 15 seats and wants independence
for Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of the big parties is over,'' said Jacky Morael,
leader of the Ecolo party in the French-speaking region.

 &HT;    Tobacco branch of RJR Nabisco front and center _ and on its own
_ in NYSE
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Shares of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco begin
trading publicly today for the first time in 29 years, but Melrose
Stocks isn't buying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco is still under massive attack,'' said Stocks, a
retired Winston-Salem school teacher who inherited 403 shares of
RJR Nabisco stock from her deceased husband.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to ''play a wait-and-see game'' on the hope that the
new shares' value will increase. She added, though, ''If I were a
new investor, I probably would go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism among investors greets the return of America's
second-largest cigarette maker to the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s recent spin-off of its tobacco
business created two independent publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   Parent RJR Nabisco has been renamed Nabisco Group Holdings
Corp., and it remains the nation's largest cookie and cracker maker
with brands including Oreo and Ritz. It trades under the symbol
``NGH.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco spin-off is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc.,
trading under the symbol ``RJR.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the last day RJR Nabisco Holding's shares traded.
They reached a 52-week peak of $33.56 1/4 before finishing at $32,
down 43 3/4 cents. Nearly 30.6 million shares changed hands, or
about 15 times average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Group Holdings rose 37 1/2 cents to $21.81 1/4
in when-issued trading. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings fell $1 to
$32.25. Shareholders on Monday received one share of R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco stock for every three shares of Nabisco Group Holdings they
owned as of May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The stock last traded as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco in 1970. That's
when directors renamed the company R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc. to
reflect its 1960s diversification beyond tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Now standing on its own as a pure tobacco company for the first
time since 1963, Reynolds faces the full brunt of legal and
competitive threats, coupled with declining market share.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' share of U.S. smokers has fallen in recent years. It
ended the first quarter at 24.4 percent, compared with 25.2 percent
in 1998. By contrast, No. 1 Philip Morris boosted its share to 49.4
percent in the last quarter, up from 48.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this trend continues, it could adversely affect Reynolds
Tobacco's sales volumes, financial condition and/or results of
operations,'' a report warned last month.
</P>
<P>
   That potentially ominous outlook came not from a skeptical
analyst, but from Reynolds documents preceding its stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with drastically reduced debt, Reynolds is poised to
''reward shareholders'' and show investors that it can stabilize
and increase earnings, Chief Executive Andrew Schindler said in an
interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the spin-off, RJR Nabisco sold its international
tobacco business to Japan Tobacco Inc. for $7.8 billion. Part of
the proceeds reduced Reynolds' debt from $6.5 billion to $2
billion. Coupled with $1.1 billion in cash, Reynolds now figures
its debt at $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very, very strong balance sheet we are ending up
with,'' said Schindler, a 25-year Reynolds veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from paying an attractive dividend that over time could be
increased, Schindler said Reynolds now has the resources to invest
in its key brands, which include Camel, Winston, Salem and Doral.
The board also may consider acquisitions, said Schindler, a
54-year-old director.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recently wrapped up two weeks of meetings with
institutional investors, and he came away feeling ''very positive''
about the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In a skittish sign, however, the institutional investors were
most interested in how large a dividend the company will pay,
Schindler said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated that Reynolds could pay as much as
$3.60 a share in a yearly dividend, resulting in a yield of 9
percent to 10 percent. That would easily surpass the dividend of
No. 1 cigarette maker Philip Morris' dividend yielding 4.17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board of directors, still being assembled, plans
to set a dividend July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wasn't willing to characterize the company's
dividend as ''rich,'' Schindler said investors ''would buy Reynolds
stock for the purpose of getting a meaningful dividend and one that
produces a competitively high yield....More importantly, it would
be sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem, Reynolds' birthplace 124 years ago, brokers
were reluctant to talk publicly about Reynolds' stock. Some said
local interest in it had been scant.
</P>
<P>
   Such hometown reluctance differs sharply from a decade ago, when
townsfolk watched in amazement as the takeover fight for RJR
Nabisco vaulted the stock over $100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 merger of Reynolds and Nabisco Brands set the stage for
the $26.4 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1989 by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Co., at that time the largest leveraged buyout in U.S.
corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-fought deal, chronicled in the best-selling
''Barbarians at the Gate'' burdened RJR with $700 million to $800
million in annual debt. It weakened Reynolds against No. 1 Philip
Morris and made Reynolds more vulnerable to mounting health-related
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' problems dragged down the stock of RJR Nabisco, which
resumed trading in 1991. Directors faced nearly constant pressure
from shareholders to separate tobacco from the food and beverage
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco's board announced the spin-off in March. Even now,
some investors remain wary of Reynolds' prospects.
</P>
<P>
   There were 653 cases pending against RJR Nabisco and Reynolds
Tobacco as of May 14. The Justice Department plans to sue to
recover federal health-care costs associated with cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Jones broker Jim Barrett said some of his clients who
hold the stock are hoping for a big dividend, but he's seen little
interest from new buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are still shell-shocked by the modest
performance of RJR in recent years,'' said Barrett, of nearby
Kenersville, N.C.

CHINESE GOVERNMENT WARNS BUDDHIST SECT ON DISSENT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A senior Chinese government official met
representatives of the Buddhist Law spiritual sect Monday to deny
rumors of an imminent crackdown, but also to warn them sternly
against upsetting social stability, state television reported
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual report was clearly intended to caution the sect's
millions of ardent followers around the country, mainly retirees
and middle-age women who practice the group meditation exercises in
public parks every morning.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing group, known widely by the name Falun Gong,
shocked authorities in April by mustering 10,000 members for a
daylong vigil here that called for official recognition, which has
not been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Falun Gong members have been riled by reports
that there might be a crackdown and that China was seeking the
forced return of their leader from the United States. Members from
other provinces who apparently came to Beijing to protest have been
detained and then sent home.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting Monday, an unidentified leader from a joint
appeals office of the Communist Party and the State Council, or
Cabinet, met with the group to denounce the reports of imminent
suppression.
</P>
<P>
   Such reports have been spread by a ``small group of people with
ulterior motives,'' the official reportedly said, ``in the hope of
arousing practitioners of Falun Gong who do not know the truth to
join in mass rallies, provoke incidents, stir up chaos and destroy
social stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder and leader of the sect, Li Hongzhi, moved to the
United States last year, saying that he feared official harassment.
The official's reported statements Monday seemed implicitly to
attack Li, whose word is gospel in the sect, as one of those who is
spreading dangerous rumors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on June 2 posted on the Internet and in
advertisements in Hong Hong newspapers, Li said that his followers
were being ``treated unjustly'' and suggested that China was
negotiating with the United States to extradite him in return for a
$500 million reduction in China's trade surplus with the United
States. (His letter can be viewed at www.falundafa.org)
</P>
<P>
   The unusual meeting Monday and the news report reflected the
Communist Party's quandary. The party usually keeps control over
mass movements and religions and does not allow social groups to be
led from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As announced by Li in 1992, Falun Gong combines elements of the
traditional Chinese breathing and meditation exercises of qigong
(pronounced CHE-goong), said to have health benefits, with Buddhism
and Taoism and Li's mystical ideas. Among other activities,
followers are urged to harness cosmic forces rather than to use
modern medicines to cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the group, although secretive and, in critics' view, a
religious cult, preaches upright living, is not overtly political
and counts current and former officials among its followers. So
far, the authorities have avoided an open confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can practice qigong for health purposes,'' the official
reportedly said at the meeting Monday. ``But on no account can
anyone promote superstition, spread rumors, engage in sedition,
destroy social order or hold mass assemblies that affect social
stability using the disciplines of qigong as a pretext.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. first traded publicly in 1922 on the
New York Stock Exchange. At the time, the company's Camel brand
accounted for half of the cigarettes sold in the United States. But
trading ended in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened over the past 29 years. Here are some of the
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1970 : R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. changes its name to R.J.
Reynolds Industries to reflect America's largest cigarette maker's
diversification into food and beverages, including Hawaiian Punch
and Chun King.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1976: Philip Morris' Marlboro passes RJR's Winston as
America's favorite cigarette. Seven years later, Phillip Morris
passes Reynolds Industries as the nation's No. 1 cigarette
producer.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1985: Reynolds Industries acquires Nabisco Brands, bringing
the popular Camel and Winston brands together with Oreo cookies and
Ritz crackers. The company is renamed RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1987: Under new CEO Ross Johnson, RJR relocates its corporate
headquarters from Winston-Salem to Atlanta. The move outraged many
in the company's 1875 birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1989: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. acquires RJR Nabisco in a
$26.4 billion leveraged buyout, outdueling an investor group led by
Johnson. The headquarters moves to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1991: RJR Nabisco's stock resumes trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.

   LOS ANGELES _ Q. My manager just told me I have been spending
too much time on golf sites on the Internet. I admit that I
occasionally check out a couple of these sites, but I am more
concerned that the company found out about this. Don't employees
have some privacy? D.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. You will find a lot more privacy on a golf course, which is
where your employer would prefer you pursue your golfing links.
</P>
<P>
   In many companies, employee privacy is rapidly evolving into an
oxymoron. Increasing numbers of employers are not only monitoring
employee Internet activity, but they are also checking out employee
phone calls, e-mail and general work habits. When employees come
rolling into work, it is increasingly common to find that videotape
starts rolling too.
</P>
<P>
   The rights of employees and employers in these areas are still
evolving. If you are keeping score, the employers are definitely
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   From the employer standpoint, this monitoring is designed to
focus on key work-related matters, such as maintaining quality
work, preventing substance abuse and identifying questionable
performance. From the employee standpoint, this type of monitoring
is typically viewed as being somewhere between an institution and
an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you consider visiting your favorite golf sites on
company time and equipment, remember that there may be a gallery
watching you. Your Web site visits may help you shoot under par,
but to the company they may be an indicator of a different kind of
sub-par performance.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I work in a shop as a volunteer. People come in and bother
us, staying for hours, waiting to see if someone brings a donation
that they want. They try to get it before anyone else can have a
chance to look at it, and before it is even checked out and priced.
Our manager says, ``The buyer is always right.'' These people have
become friendly with the manager, stay as long as they want, and
nothing is said. What should we do? J.D.
</P>
<P>
   A. The customer is not always right, and neither is the manager.
There are real questions here regarding the shop's management and
mission.
</P>
<P>
   When customers are interfering with the work of the staff and
engaging in overly self-serving behaviors in a volunteer
organization, one has to wonder who is managing whom. How would the
founders of the shop feel if they knew that the same customers or
friends are hanging around and constantly grabbing the best items
for themselves? Perhaps they might feel that as long as the
merchandise is being sold, this makes no difference. Or, they might
be appalled. You need to discuss this with the manager.
</P>
<P>
   If the objectives of the shop are to work as efficiently and
professionally as possible, bring in many people from the
community, let them have equal access to a broad range of values,
and provide more than picked-over merchandise, then it is time to
clarify the mission and develop and enforce some policies that
support it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it may be helpful to have a policy that prevents
newly received items from being placed on the floors until they
have been fully checked and appropriately priced, and this can take
some time. If the friendly bargain-hunters sense that they can no
longer quickly pick up the best items, they may just as quickly
pick up and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently began a new job as an estimator. The owners of the
company are young and both lack formal education. One owner yells
and screams at his subordinates, and his words carry throughout the
building. Isn't there an appropriate method to inform employees of
errors or potential errors? M.A.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is remarkable that there are still so many topsiders who
believe that management is a scream.
</P>
<P>
   When employees make mistakes, which they are inevitably going to
do as they learn and grow, it is important that they be given
clear, instructive, supportive and timely feedback regarding the
causes of the errors and the steps to prevent a recurrence. Nowhere
in this approach do you find words like blame, reprisals,
chastisement, punishment or screaming.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor or manager should have regular contact with the
employees, as this leader's role is really one of a teacher or
coach, rather than a judge or critic. It is important for employees
to be setting some of their own objectives and standards,
identifying and correcting their errors when possible, and helping
to evaluate their own performance.
</P>
<P>
   In environments where employees have a great fear of making
mistakes, they tend to be less creative, less motivated and,
ironically, more likely to make errors. When it comes to screaming
at employees for their mistakes, the real mistake is the screaming.

COMMENTARY: NATO OR BATO? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ For many years the standard quip about NATO
was that NATO existed to ``keep the Germans down, the Americans in
(Europe), and the Russians out.'' In light of NATO's U.S.-led
victory in Kosovo, though, that old cliche is going to have to be
adapted. NATO's new mission is ``to keep the Balkans quiet, the
Americans in and the Russians sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   No one planned it this way, but managing the bloody turmoil in
the Balkans, not the Eastern Front, and managing the zany,
unpredictable weakness of Russia, not its strength, have now
emerged as NATO's primary missions. Ever since the Cold War ended,
NATO planners have been groping for a new mission, a senior NATO
official remarked to me at NATO's Brussels headquarters, and the
Balkans is turning out to be it.
</P>
<P>
   This shift from NATO to BATO _ the Balkan-Atlantic Treaty
Organization _ has been driven both by humanitarian demands and
institutional imperatives. ``In order to survive, an international
organization can't just have a conceptual mission,'' the official
said. ``Organizations seek out action. They need to do things.
That's why NATO needs the Balkans as much as the Balkans need NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkans is one security issue that NATO can actually do
something about,'' he added. ``We talked about dealing with drugs,
terrorism, proliferation and the mafia, but the truth is there is
not much we can really do about them. The thing about the Balkans
is that what NATO has to offer is exactly what they need. We have a
product that they want _ peacekeeping and providing security.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are a lot of customers. Once NATO forces are fully in
place in Kosovo, NATO's Balkan deployment will involve nearly
100,000 troops _ 30,000 in Bosnia, 57,000 in Kosovo, 7,000 in
Albania, 2,000 in Macedonia and 1,000 in Croatia. Many of those
troops are committed indefinitely. Indeed, the poor Albanians have
quietly told NATO they hope its troops  &UR; never  &LR; leave.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO official added that over the past six years he had
attended virtually all the high-level meetings of the NATO Council
in Brussels. ``I would say that 85 percent of those meetings dealt
with the Balkans one way or another,'' he said. ``Maybe once a year
we had a session on weapons of mass destruction or terrorism. Those
issues are the dessert, but the daily diet is the Balkans. We are
Balkan specialists now.''
</P>
<P>
   How should Americans feel about this? Well, they should feel
very good that NATO, using air power alone, and without a single
battle casualty, accomplished its basic humanitarian mission in the
Balkans _ halting the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs, containing
Slobodan Milosevic (and setting in motion what will be his
downfall) and bringing about the return of most Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. national security has never rested on the fate of the
Balkans. Does NATO's Balkan tilt have any wider strategic value?
Well, if NATO's presence in the Balkans ends up closing Europe's
last major open sore, and thereby promotes greater European
integration and stability, there's strategic value in that. It's
even worth contributing some U.S. troops already in Europe to
solidify.
</P>
<P>
   But we must be aware that this is going to be very costly,
particularly for the Europeans, at a time when their defense
budgets are already shrinking and they are spending virtually
nothing on military research. (Of the 2,000 NATO targets in Serbia,
1,999 were chosen through U.S. intelligence satellites and sources,
and exactly 1 by the Europeans.)
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the strategic sustainability of NATO's Balkan
operation will ultimately depend on how well Russia manages itself
and how well NATO manages relations with Russia. We should  &UR; want &LR; 
the Russians in Kosovo _ because peacemaking is not just about
deterrence, it's about reassurance. Give the Russians some dignity,
bring them onto the team, let them run a patch of Kosovo _ and
thereby give the Kosovo Serbs some reassurance to stay so that
NATO's Kosovo victory doesn't end in reverse ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia, NATO's historic enemy, can be integrated into Europe,
if its nuclear arsenal can be reduced through arms control, then
NATO can afford to run the Balkans for the next 50 years. But if
Russia collapses into turmoil, or returns to aggressive
nationalism, we will have to rethink BATO and get back to NATO.

NEW LAWSUIT TARGETS SUTURE MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nine Northern Californians who say they suffered
raging infections after routine operations in 1994 and 1995 are
blaming their ailments on improperly sterilized surgical sutures.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon Inc., a subsidiary of the giant Johnson &AMP; Johnson
medical supply company and the world's leading suture maker, has
denied that its products made anyone sick.
</P>
<P>
   But in a lawsuit filed last week in Alameda County Superior
Court, the nine patients charged that they had become ill because
Ethicon had distributed millions of its trademark Vicryl sutures in
1994 even though they were contaminated during processing in a
sterilizer unit prone to breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Ethicon downplayed the risks the
sutures posed to patients and failed to issue timely warnings to
doctors and hospitals. As a result, the nine patients said they had
become ill _ some for years _ without knowing why.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in February, they said in the complaint, when the
San Francisco Examiner published a series of stories on the
sterilizer breakdown and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The stories quoted from lawsuits and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration records indicating that more than 100 patients in
nine states had blamed the sutures for debilitating post-operative
infections _ from staphylococcus and a rare bacteria related to
tuberculosis _ in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The stories gave the nine patients their first clue as to why
they became ill, said Wendy York, the lead lawyer in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, Ethicon got caught. Now a lot of people
know why they got their post-op infections,'' the Sacramento lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by FDA inspectors, Ethicon in September 1994 issued a
voluntary recall of some 3.6 million sutures that had been
processed in a new sterilizer system at its San Angelo, Texas,
plant. About 25 percent were returned, the FDA now says, instead of
the 2 percent it earlier reported.
</P>
<P>
   The sterilizer had malfunctioned repeatedly, and the company
finally shut it down in May 1994, court records show. Since the
incident, the company has made confidential settlements in lawsuits
brought by 22 victims who blamed the sutures for their infections,
according to public records.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Odenthal, a spokeswoman for the company, said Ethicon had
no comment on the Alameda County lawsuit because corporate
officials had not had time to review it.
</P>
<P>
   In other lawsuits and in letters to Congress, Ethicon has
contended that its sutures didn't cause any postoperative
infections.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in Alameda County says Ethicon's insistence
that the sutures were basically safe despite the sterilizer
breakdowns misled doctors, causing them to ``misdiagnose or
inadequately treat'' their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The nine patients joining in the lawsuit had surgery for a wide
range of problems _ from back and shoulder ailments to breast
cancer _ but all allegedly involved Ethicon's Vicryl suture, which
is supposed to gradually dissolve as the surgical incision heals.
</P>
<P>
   The patients say their operations were routine, but that they
then developed infections.

 &HT;    Gore hits on gun control topics at mayoral conference
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Youths aged 18 to 20 make up 4 percent of the U.S.
population but commit one-fourth of the nation's gun murders, and
that's why Congress needs to raise the legal age for handgun
possession to 21, Vice President Al Gore said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the simplest terms, 18- to 20-year-olds represent the group
most likely to kill, the most likely to kill with a gun, and the
most likely to use a gun when committing a crime other than
murder,'' Gore told more than 300 mayors and other officials
gathered here for the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors. His
statistics came from a joint federal study released Monday by the
Justice Department and the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also called on Congress to pass a law requiring child
safety locks on guns and requiring background checks for people who
buy firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are fighting against closing this loophole are
fighting against common sense,'' he said. The Senate, thanks to
Gore's tie-breaking vote, passed a measure requiring background
checks at gun shows, but the legislation is meeting resistance in
the House. ``I had not reckoned on the power of the National Rifle
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals were welcomed with applause by the mayors. The
proposed legislation echoes proposals detailed in a letter sent
Monday by the mayors conference to House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
The House is debating gun control this week on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great speech,'' said Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, who
was in New Orleans for the conference. ``I'm delighted he's taking
such a strong position.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks Congress will pass tougher gun laws, Campbell
said Americans are demanding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that the same proposal failed in the Senate and then
passed after the carnage in Littleton and Conyers,'' he said,
referring to the two most recent school shooting tragedies. ``We're
closer than we've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial have joined leaders
in at least 17 other cities in filing lawsuits against the gun
industry. New Orleans filed the first such suit.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he thinks it's funny that people were shocked that
he filed Atlanta's lawsuit against the gun industry just as the NRA
was headed to town for a convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them to come back unless they have background
checks at their gun shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals for stricter gun laws were one part of a
three-pronged approach he advocates for creating more livable
communities. The second strategy is connecting Americans who
usually fall through the cracks to jobs and other opportunities,
and the third is to overhaul the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gore was host at a $1,000-per-person
fund-raiser in a Bourbon Street jazz bar. Gore staffers said the
event raised more than $250,000, more than twice the amount tallied
at a similar event for President Clinton four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's often painted as a robotic speaker, Gore broke with
tradition by strutting into the Storyville Jazz Bar in the city's
French Quarter district with a musical procession known as a Second
Line and took a few dance steps to the music.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches were Gore's last major addresses before he
officially announces his presidential candidacy Wednesday in his
hometown of Carthage, Tenn.

IF YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES, DON'T BULLDOZE THEIR LAIR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATOON, Ireland _ Eddie Lenihan, a smallish man with a dark
unkempt beard, a wild head of hair and an intense look in his eyes,
pointed to the high white-blossomed hawthorn bush standing alone in
a large field in this village in western Ireland and issued, not
for the first or last time, a warning to local officials:
</P>
<P>
   If they bulldoze the bush to make way for a planned highway
bypass, the fairies will come. To curse the road and all who use
it, to make brakes fail and cars crash, to wreak the kind of
mischief fairies are famous for when they are angry, which is
often.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is because this particular hawthorn is a fairy
bush, a favorite meeting place for supernatural folk, dating back
to the mist of pre-Celtic history. A local farmer, who said he saw
white fairy blood around the bush, told him the story.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer in charge of the bypass, around the County Clare
town of Newmarket-on-Fergus, says he will think it over. Lenihan
hopes that once construction workers know it is a fairy bush, they
will refuse to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Other highways in Ireland have been rerouted around fairy
locations in recent decades. People in Ireland, Lenihan said, say
they don't believe the old tales of the fairies and their
shoemakers, the leprechauns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laugh at you,'' he said, standing beside the gnarled gray
trunk of the 15-foot-high bush. ``It's not sophisticated. But
subconsciously, they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenihan, who grimaces and gesticulates and speaks in low urgent
tones, is dramatic but serious, a 49-year-old high school teacher
who is one of the few traditional storytellers _ seanchai in Gaelic
_ still working in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore experts at University College in Dublin say that
Lenihan's style is a touch theatrical but that he is an authentic
and competent folklorist, who has taped thousands of hours of the
old stories around the country by interviewing old Irish men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   He retells them at arts and culture festivals around Ireland and
before college students in the United States. Still, in the age of
radio, television and the Internet, his art seems to be in its
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   While many people in Ireland may still believe in the fairies in
a corner of their minds, they are more concerned with other unseen
menaces, like radiation from cell phones and from the nuclear waste
put into the Irish Sea by the British.
</P>
<P>
   There is also considerable belief in UFO's and aliens from outer
space who, like the fairies, are believed to steal babies and cause
sudden, apparently accidental deaths. The current invisible menaces
are merely an updating of the ancient ones, Lenihan said.
</P>
<P>
   The experts at the University College's folklore department
agree with Lenihan that while the people of modern Ireland scoff
publicly at fairy stories, ashamed to admit their beliefs and
superstitions to strangers, there is still strong vestigial belief
in the fairies.
</P>
<P>
   Baibre Ni Fhloinn, an archivist and fairy story collector in the
department, said: ``It's a passive belief, and it includes a lot of
young, well-educated people. There is a reluctance to interfere in
things which have an association with the fairies or with the other
world. We would all rather be safe than sorry. People are not
taking unnecessary chances. Life is complicated enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She would include herself, she said. She said Lenihan, though
theatrical, was a serious folklorist, not merely a performer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from a distance, as he stands under the hawthorn bush
and leans on its thick stems, Lenihan gives a distinctly leprechaun
impression, without the Kelly green suit, funny hat and buckled
shoes. He has appeared at many American colleges, but not Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Existence of the other-world fairies, Lenihan and the other
experts say, cannot, of course, be proved. But, they say, they do
not want to rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where a Christian afterlife in another world is a
certainty for most people, who can be sure about the other world of
the fairies? The stories of their mischief, and occasional good
works, abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in the other world of Christianity, how can you
attack belief in the other world of the fairies?'' he said.
Lenihan, who says he has never seen a fairy, believes that they
would be vexed by the removal of their bush here. And when they are
vexed, they have no mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have white blood,'' Lenihan said. ``The farmer who told
me the story said he saw it on the grass around the bush. Because
they have white blood, they can't get into heaven. That's what
makes them so vicious. Since they can't get in, they're out to do
as much harm and mischief as they can. They have nothing to lose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are perhaps 150 fairy-sacred locations in Ireland, some of
them bushes, some called fairy forts, the earth humps that remain
from Iron Age dwellings. Where fairy places have been destroyed, he
added, particularly in building roads, there has been an unusual
number of deaths and injuries among workers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also nonviolent fairy stories, including the
favorite of Lenihan's six children:
</P>
<P>
   A poor farmer, having lost in a card game in the pub, comes on a
leprechaun in a wood and throttles the little figure until he
reveals that there is gold under a bush. The farmer ties his
kerchief to the bush and goes home for a spade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came back with the spade, every bush in the field had
a kerchief,'' Lenihan said. ``He never got the gold.''

NIEUWENDYK A STAR AMONG STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Speed and youth have collided with age and
experience here in the Stanley Cup finals. The Buffalo Sabres, the
new kids on the block, have clashed three times now with the Dallas
Stars, the National Hockey League's playing tribute to the American
Association of Retired People.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart, Baby Boomers, thus far gray hair and wrinkles have
it all over Generation X. The Stars aren't old; they're
distinguished. The Sabres are young and have been made to look
foolish, their legs racing but going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the advantage lies in young legs right now,''
mused Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, his club in a 2-1 disadvantage
headed into Game 4 here Tuesday. ``If that was the case, the game
the other night, we should have looked a lot better against them _
because that was three games in five nights. I was thinking that
theory a lot earlier, but I'm not thinking it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece in Dallas's why-old-people-do-good-things
revival show is Joe Nieuwendyk. The 32-year-old pivot popped in the
winner in Game 3, a 2-1 triumph, giving him six winners this
postseason, tying the league record held by Joe Sakic. An
exceptional lacrosse player in his youth, Nieuwendyk scored the
winner with a menacing forehand lift to the top right corner that
not even the great Dominik Hasek could touch with his
lightning-quick glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more instinct and reaction,'' said Nieuwendyk after the
Stars' afternoon workout here at Marine Midland Arena, where the
best-of-seven series resumes at 8 p.m. ``In a situation like that,
you don't get much time to think about taking it upstairs. There's
not much room. Things happen pretty fast. I just went with my
instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's game of programmed defenses and strict adherence to
positional play at both ends of the ice, the instinctual,
spontaneous player has become a rarity. For the most part,
Nieuwendyk's game is based more on defense than touch. The Stars
have the talented Mike Modano and Brett Hull as their primary
creators and shooters. But Nieuwendyk, a key to the Calgary Flames'
Stanley Cup championship in 1989, is the best blend of offense and
defense rolled in the same Lone Star suit.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk now leads all playoff scorers with 11 goals and 21
points in 20 games. When the series with Buffalo began, he and
Sabres captain Michael Peca stood even as candidates to win the
Conn Smythe Trophy as postseason MVP. Headed into this game,
however, the 6-foot-1-inch, 195-pound Nieuwendyk stands as the
prohibitive favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt like he got cheated last year,'' said Dallas
defenseman Craig Ludwig, another of the Stars' oldsters. ``But he's
making the most of it right now. He's not just scoring goals, he's
scoring timely goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk exited last year's playoffs in the first period of
Dallas's first-round match against the San Jose Sharks, clobbered
from behind by one of Bryan Marchment's patented brutal hits. The
Stars went on to beat the Sharks, rubbed out the Oilers in Round 2,
and then folded up in the Western Conference finals. When the
playoff ride ended, Nieuwendyk already was almost a month into his
rehabilitation from surgery on both knees. Had he not been
disabled, the Stars might have made it to the finals last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult, not to be part of it,'' recalled Nieuwendyk,
who teams now on a line with Jamie Langenbrunner and ex-Bruin Dave
Reid. ``When you get to (the Cup finals), you realize what it takes
to get through the playoff run. To get to this point and not be
there last year was disappointing. I'm thrilled to death to be
healthy, playing, and doing what I can to help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, just two years removed from the Cornell campus,
Nieuwendyk hoisted the Cup high with his Calgary teammates. He was
not even 23 years old. Spiraling salaries and the imbalance between
the American and Canadian dollar hadn't yet crippled the
small-market Flames.
</P>
<P>
   As the years rolled by, though, the Flames found it tougher to
compete and tougher to pay. Eventually, Nieuwendyk was dealt to the
Flames (for Corey Millen and Jarome Iginla) after a protacted
contract holdout at the start of the '95-96 season. Nieuwendyk went
from '90 to '97 playing on clubs that didn't make it out of the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think it's going to be easy,'' said Nieuwendyk, reflecting
on the Flames' initial success when he arrived there, which
included his winning the Calder Trophy as the league's rookie of
the year in '88. ``You think this is going to be the way it is in
the NHL. You realize it can be tough to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's back now, playing longer and better than he has in the
playoffs in a decade. His presence makes Buffalo's defensive task
maddening. If Peca has to check Mike Modano's line, usually with
Jere Lehtinen and Brett Hull, he can't be rolled out to stop the
Nieuwendyk trio. The beat goes on for Nieuwendyk and the Stars, and
it has turned into a beating for the Sabres.

HIGH COURT RULING IS MAJOR WIN FOR CASINOS AND BROADCASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Miss., N.J., Nev., Conn.)  (See also SCOTUS-RDP) 
(mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously struck down
a 65-year-old ban on broadcast advertising of casino gambling,
ruling on First Amendment grounds that the federal law ``sacrifices
an intolerable amount of truthful speech about lawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, reflecting the court's growing solicitude for
advertising and other forms of commercial speech, was a major
victory for the casino industry and for broadcasters, who have
challenged the ban in cases from Atlantic City, N.J., to Las Vegas.
The case Monday was from New Orleans, where a group of broadcasters
sued the federal government for the right to carry advertising for
casino gambling in Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters, along with the commercial gambling industry, have
grown increasingly restive under the advertising prohibition
because Congress amended the law in 1988 to permit gambling
advertising by casinos owned by Indian tribes. That meant, for
example, that the Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Connecticut could
advertise gambling in their popular Foxwoods casino to the New York
radio and television market, but that the casinos in Atlantic City
could not advertise gambling. The restrictions permitted general
advertising of casinos as vacation destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the ban Monday, the court focused on the
irrationality of making distinctions among advertisers, while at
the same time suggesting that a more uniform and ``coherent''
policy of advertising restrictions might well have been upheld.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis, which ratified the court's current approach to
commercial speech, left the door open for the court to uphold, in
future cases, restrictions on the advertising of other lawful
products, like tobacco. In its next term, the court will decide
whether the Food and Drug Administration, which has proposed broad
restrictions on cigarette advertising, has jurisdiction to regulate
tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on casino advertising, part of the original
Communications Act of 1934, which prohibited advertising for all
forms of gambling, has had a mixed record recently in the lower
federal courts. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is
based in San Francisco and includes Nevada in its jurisdiction,
struck it down in a 1997 decision that the Supreme Court declined
to review. The U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., also overturned
the ban, in a case now on appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Orleans, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the broadcasters' attack and ruled last year that the ban
was a reasonable way for the government to control the demand for
gambling, and thus to limit the social ills that flow from it.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court on Monday, Justice John Paul Stevens said
that while the government's interests were valid, and theoretically
defensible, the law as it exists ``is so pierced by exemptions and
inconsistencies'' that good intensions could not salvage it or
``overcome the presumption that the speaker and the audience, not
the government, should be left to assess the value of accurate and
nonmisleading information about lawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that not only had Congress authorized broadcast
advertisements for tribal casinos, but that an earlier amendment,
in 1975, created an exception for state-run lotteries. In addition,
Stevens said, the Federal Communications Commission, in
administering the law, has interpreted it in ways that ``underscore
the statute's infirmity.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, broadcasters may carry advertising for
``Vegas-style excitement'' but not ``Vegas-style games.'' The court
noted that the commission approved a television commercial stating
that the ``odds for fun are high.'' Establishments that have
``casino'' as part of their name may use it in their
advertisements; for these and similar reasons, advertising for
casino gambling may in fact appear ubiquitous in many markets, but
what is now being advertised is not the gambling as such, but the
casino as an exciting vacation destination.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's primary focus, for reasons of both pragmatism
and First Amendment doctrine, was on the distinction between tribal
and non-Indian casinos. With 33 states now having tribal casinos,
compared with 11 that permit non-Indian casino gambling, it was
evident to the court that the exception was essentially swallowing
the rule. And further, Stevens said, ``decisions that select among
speakers conveying virtually identical messages are in serious
tension with the principles undergirding the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Had the federal government adopted a more coherent
policy, or accommodated the rights of speakers in states that have
legalized the underlying conduct, this might be a different case.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the court's recent commercial speech decisions, including
a 1996 ruling that struck down a Rhode Island law prohibiting the
inclusion of prices in liquor advertising, the government was
considered likely to lose this case, Greater New Orleans
Broadcasting Association vs. U.S., No. 98-387. The open question
was what analysis the court would use and what the implications of
the decision might be.
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping invitations contained in numerous briefs to revise
its approach to commercial speech and elevate it to the high level
of protection now accorded political speech, the court instead
applied long-settled law and broke no new ground. Notably, the
court did not adopt the categorical view, urged by Justice Clarence
Thomas in a separate concurring opinion, that the First Amendment
does not permit the government to restrict advertising about a
product that is legal to sell.
</P>
<P>
   That approach would have placed a daunting obstacle in the path
of regulating tobacco advertising. While a settlement last fall
between 46 states and the tobacco industry included an array of
advertising restrictions, accepted by the industry as part of the
agreement to terminate lawsuits by the states, the Food and Drug
Administration has proposed more sweeping restrictions that the
industry is challenging as unconstitutional. The question of their
constitutionality, however, will ultimately be decided only if the
Supreme Court finds, in a case to be argued next fall, that the
agency has jurisdiction over tobacco.

BLAIR REMAINS STEADFAST DESPITE SURPRISING CONSERVATIVE GAINS

<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday that his
government would stick to its pro-European stance despite the
apparent rejection of that policy by British voters electing the
country's 87 members of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, in their first success against Blair since he
became prime minister two years ago, won 36 seats to Labor's 29,
and the Tories' leader, William Hague, said it was his hardline
campaign to keep the country from adopting the euro as its currency
that was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struck a blow for the independence of our country and
the future of the pound,'' Hague said of the surprising Tory
showing. Pledging to intensify his anti-euro campaign, he said:
``Political parties who think they can bounce the people of this
country into abolishing their currency without debating it properly
have had something of a shock in this election, and I think they're
in for a bigger shock in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While the size of the Tory victory was surprising, its
importance was called into question by the low turnout, 23 percent
of the voters, the lowest figure ever recorded in a national
election.
</P>
<P>
   It fit into a pattern across the continent, where center-right
parties succeeded in overturning socialist and center-left
dominance of the European Parliament for the first time since the
Strasbourg assembly became directly elected in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Subdued and appearing chastened, Blair told a press conference
in the Rose Garden behind 10 Downing Street, the official
residence, that ``obviously these are very disappointing results,
and I don't pretend otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We have got to hold firm to the position we
have,'' saying that ``for this country to pull away from Europe all
together, when over 50 percent of our trade is with Europe, when
millions of jobs are dependent on Europe, would be a very big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's position has been to prepare British business and public
opinion for eventual entry into monetary union but to postpone a
promised referendum on the decision until joining would be more
economically advantageous to Britain, probably in two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   During Hague's embattled two years as party leader, he has
toughened the Conservative stance against the euro, saying Britain
should drop all ideas of joining anytime in the next eight years
and should maintain a dubious attitude about ever signing up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to furthering the anti-euro cause, the Tory
performance shored up Hague's ebbing leadership and threw on the
defensive critics within the party who had claimed his
uncompromising ``save sterling'' position was costing the party the
mainstream support it needs to get back into power.
</P>
<P>
   The general British unhappiness with the idea of integration
with the Continent was illustrated by the unexpected capture of
three seats by the new, single-issue U.K. Independence Party, which
is opposed to all relations with Europe except trade.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, the last area of Britain to report results,
the Rev. Ian Paisley of the militant Ulster Democratic Unionists,
was once again the largest vote-getter, with John Hume, the leader
of the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, coming in
second, and James Nicholson of the Ulster Unionists edging out
Mitchel McLaughlin of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, for the province's third seat.

John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina, Kosovo) _ NATO slowly expanded its control
over a central swath of Kosovo on Monday, pouring in thousands more

done the bulk of the fighting in Kosovo over the last year, has
been welcoming its boys home for several days now. By Carlotta
Gall.

COMMENTARY: LORDS AND JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Imagine that appointees to the Supreme Court of the
United States were first made members of the Senate. Imagine that
the justices heard arguments in a Senate committee room, announced
their decisions on the Senate floor _ and in addition to deciding
cases, could vote as senators on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   That fantasy is reality in Britain. The 12 Law Lords, making up
the country's court of last resort, are members of the upper
chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords; they sit as its Judicial
Committee. As part of the fiction that they are a mere committee of
the House, they do not wear robes and wigs as other English judges
do. They hear arguments in business suits.
</P>
<P>
   All that may change, and not just to straighten out the
confusion of appearance and reality that often marks British
institutions. The law has become a much more important factor in
the British system, and many believe it is time to have a genuine,
demonstrably independent supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, British judges performed a much narrower function
than their American counterparts. Because Britain had a unitarian
system of government and no written constitution, its judges did
not have to sort out intergovernmental conflicts or pass on claims
that constitutional guarantees had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Law Lords themselves restricted their role. In
interpreting legislation, they looked only at the face of the
statute, refusing to read legislative history. They had a rule
against reconsidering their own past decisions. And they rarely
reviewed what administrators had done; they were, Lord Devlin said,
``quite anxious not to tread on the executive toes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 30 years those traditional attitudes have undergone
what amounts to a revolution. Today the Law Lords look at
legislative history, reconsider past decisions and often stamp on
government toes by finding administrative decisions unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   And now the courts are about to perform something like American
constitutional functions. Scotland has been given its own
Parliament, so there will inevitably be conflicts between its
powers and the central government's _ conflicts to be resolved in
court. And next year the European Convention on Human Rights _ with
free-speech and other guarantees _ will become enforceable in
British courts.
</P>
<P>
   As presently constituted, the judicial House of Lords is ill
equipped to cope with these larger duties. The judges have little
if any support staff. They have no regular courtroom. They sit in
panels of five or occasionally seven, with retired judges
participating when needed; the accident of who sits can matter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the extraordinary position of the lord chancellor.
He is a member of the Cabinet _ that is, part of the executive. He
chooses the judges. He is the speaker of the House of Lords, so he
is part of the legislature. He is the head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, and can sit as a Law Lord whenever he wishes.
His multifarious character might have been invented by Gilbert and
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   A leading legal organization, Justice, has called for changes in
the position of the Law Lords and the lord chancellor. It urges
that the judges of Britain's highest court should not be members of
the House of Lords _ because it is inappropriate for them to look
like and sometimes act as legislators. They should form a supreme
court, with its own building and ``sufficient resources.'' The lord
chancellor should not sit as a judge and should cease being head of
the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Justice went to a royal commission that is
considering reform of the legislative House of Lords. The focus has
been on how to choose its members when hereditary peers, as
planned, lose their vote. But the potential is also there for a
significant change in the legal structure.
</P>
<P>
   The present lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, is likely to resist
change in his role. And he is close to Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend is toward what has been required by the U.S.
Constitution but has always been ignored here, the idea of the
separation of powers _ or at least the judicial power. The court of
last resort has become too important to be treated as an
afterthought.

   PRISTINA _ After allowing KLA guerrillas to brandish their
weapons at will in several areas of Kosovo, NATO troops shot dead a
Serb police reservist in Pristina Sunday afternoon, claiming that
they had come ``under unprovoked fire at close range'' from the
Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers of the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment, who were
responsible for the killing, prevented reporters from entering the
block of apartments on Cara Dusana Street where a witness had
earlier told a reporter that the Serb was drunkenly
``joy-shooting'' in the air when the British soldiers shot him four
times, once in the chest, after shouting at him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The death will serve only to convince the ever-decreasing number
of Serb civilians in Pristina, most of whom express contempt for
NATO, that KFOR troops have arrived here to protect the Albanians
rather than their own minority community.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, KLA men shot dead a Serb policeman, two
Yugoslav soldiers and a Serb civilian in the suburb of Vranjevac.
But no KLA men were arrested by British forces.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single Albanian will mourn the death of the police
reservist, who worked for an organization whose members performed
some of the most notorious war crimes in Kosovo over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement from Lt.-Col. Nicholas Clissett, which
followed the killing, was not entirely convincing.
</P>
<P>
   He began by stating that a KFOR patrol had come ``under
unprovoked fire at close range'' and that when the man responsible
had been ``repeatedly warned'' to stop, he ``continued to threaten
the soldiers'' and that fire was returned ``in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a touch of Belfast-speak about all this. After
initially refusing to answer questions, Lt.-Col. Clissett declined
twice to say whether the Serb aimed his gun at the soldiers; he
would say only that they ``came under fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said that the Serb ``fired at least one round'' _ which
sounded less threatening than the man's behavior in his original
account of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   During The Parachute Regiment's tours of duty in Northern
Ireland, there were countless incidents of Catholics being shot
dead by soldiers followed by British military statements that the
dead had ``opened unprovoked fire'' and were only shot dead after
``repeated warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the anarchy that NATO troops seem powerless to end here,
however, the death of a Serb policeman is not going to worry KFOR,
whatever the circumstances of his killing.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the man's demise, a black-painted hearse arrived
at the block of apartments where his body lay, with the company
name of ``Exitus'' written on the side with the undertaker's
telephone number: 038-48722.
</P>
<P>
   That is a number likely to be called many times in the coming
days. &QL;

earlier told a reporter that the Serb was drunkenly
``joy-shooting'' in the air when the British soldiers shot him four
times, once in the chest, after shouting at him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The death will serve only to convince the ever-decreasing number
of Serb civilians in Pristina, most of whom express contempt for
NATO, that KFOR troops have arrived here to protect the Albanians
rather than their own minority community.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, KLA men shot dead a Serb policeman, two
Yugoslav soldiers and a Serb civilian in the suburb of Vranjevac.
But no KLA men were arrested by British forces.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single Albanian will mourn the death of the police
reservist, who worked for an organization whose members performed
some of the most notorious war crimes in Kosovo over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement from Lt.-Col. Nicholas Clissett, which
followed the killing, was not entirely convincing.
</P>
<P>
   He began by stating that a KFOR patrol had come ``under
unprovoked fire at close range'' and that when the man responsible
had been ``repeatedly warned'' to stop, he ``continued to threaten
the soldiers'' and that fire was returned ``in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a touch of Belfast-speak about all this. After
initially refusing to answer questions, Lt.-Col. Clissett declined
twice to say whether the Serb aimed his gun at the soldiers; he
would say only that they ``came under fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said that the Serb ``fired at least one round'' _ which
sounded less threatening than the man's behavior in his original
account of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   During The Parachute Regiment's tours of duty in Northern
Ireland, there were countless incidents of Catholics being shot
dead by soldiers followed by British military statements that the
dead had ``opened unprovoked fire'' and were only shot dead after
``repeated warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the anarchy that NATO troops seem powerless to end here,
however, the death of a Serb policeman is not going to worry KFOR,
whatever the circumstances of his killing.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the man's demise, a black-painted hearse arrived
at the block of apartments where his body lay, with the company
name of ``Exitus'' written on the side with the undertaker's
telephone number: 038-48722.
</P>
<P>
   That is a number likely to be called many times in the coming
days. &QL;

<P>
   UROSEVAC, KOSOVO _ What was possibly the last war of the 20th
century drew to a spectacular, tragic and farcical end in Kosovo
this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   History will recall that on Saturday June 12, 1999, NATO at last
stormed into the Serbian province with 15,000 troops but that the
Russians got there first, and that the Serbs of Kosovo fled for
their lives from the vengeance of those they had persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Kosovo had waited for this day. In Pristina _ still
under Yugoslav army control _ my driver Goran had tanked up our
white BMW with enough precious fuel to take us to the British front
line east of Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn we were driving down a long, straight, empty road, past
dead animals, burning houses and wrecked cars. There was shattered
glass and overturned crates on the road, and a car parked in the
center beside a field of cornflowers, with clothes hanging out of
the driver's window.
</P>
<P>
   Every village _ Albanian and Serbian alike _ was a place of
sepulchral ruin.
</P>
<P>
   It was some while later, amid the fields and poplar trees and
rolling orange-green hills that looked like Wiltshire, when Goran
turned to me. ``There are men on the road,'' he said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead were three men squatting on the tarmacadam, rifles pointed
at our car. This was KLA country, the guerrillas' favorite ambush
location and our car had Belgrade plates.
</P>
<P>
   I recall, with that intense fascination which only anxiety can
produce, that a donkey was skipping between the gunmen, cantering
in front of them, heehawing as it galloped past our halted car and
looked at us with big, soft eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw the little poppy-red beret on the head of the middle
soldier. In my best Kentish accent, I said good morning to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' he replied. ``Nice day, isn't it?'' And thus,
in that uniquely bland manner that all dramatic occasions produce,
I met Captain Chris Gosling of the Paras (parachute regiment), the
very first Englishman in the most forward front line of NATO's
first advance into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Gosling comes from Swindon, England, his wife from
Yorkshire. He was a Bosnia veteran and thought of Kosovo ``like
most of the lads, that we should have gone in sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   He was worried about the car in the middle of the road, the one
with the clothes hanging out of the window. Two of his soldiers
pulled the crates to the hedgerow with ropes in case they concealed
mines. There was a smattering of very distant rifle fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about 200 KLA behind us and they're being negotiated
with now to keep them back,'' Capt. Gosling said. Did he know the
Russians had beaten him to Pristina? ``We were tasked to go in
there last night and take the airport,'' he said. ``But it was
cancelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there a tone of regret at a missed chance to biff the
Russians, perhaps? Maybe not. For Capt. Gosling was a friendly
soul, with a splendidly sunburned, weathered face and piercing blue
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His mates were infuriated at the preposterous delay which
allowed the Russians to reach Pristina while NATO leaders argued
about who should enter Kosovo first. ``They always do that, don't
they?'' one of them said.
</P>
<P>
   This was while we were plodding back towards Pristina along that
unpleasant road, across Serbia's sacred soil at around two miles an
hour. After just one hour, NATO was already falling behind
schedule. A Chinook helicopter thrashed over us and put more
paratroops on to the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, I said, the captain and his colleagues would like to come
by to see us at the Grand Hotel in Pristina when they eventually
hit town. There was a snort from a private. ``Some chance we're
going to have of going anywhere called the Grand,'' he said. But it
would be history on a grand scale in which they would be
participating.
</P>
<P>
   On an infinitely tragic scale, too. For on the approaches to
Pristina, a new army of refugees was gathering, hundreds of Serb
villagers from the abandoned hamlets on the road to Urosevac, all
sitting atop their family furniture _ chairs and beds and sofas and
cooking pots and toys and plastic bags of linen _ piled on to
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   The children were mostly asleep, the old men bent over and
weeping, the other men sitting mute on the tractors, driving away
from the white-painted houses I had seen burning.
</P>
<P>
   It was they _ the fleeing Serbs _ who had set them ablaze. They
did not want the returning Albanians to have them. So they
incinerated the rooms and walls and roofs that had witnessed
generations of their births and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   They were running from the fury of those whom their people had
murdered and raped and dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the ``ethnic cleansers.'' The young girls on the
tractor-trailers and the babies they tried to comfort were innocent
souls.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO was supposed to be coming to save Serbs as well as
Albanians. But NATO was late, the KLA was down the road and these
families preferred exile to death. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   At one corner, a Pristina Serb was desperately trying to
persuade the villagers to stay, at least in the provincial capital.
``Stay here _ we are going to share everything with you,'' he
shouted at the line of sunken-faced refugees. ``You will not go
hungry in Pristina. Stay here. Live with us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, ferocious town in which they were being
invited to stay, whose streets were now home to a variety of armed
men and yet whose rituals continued to the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburb of Kosovo Polje, I found the local 8:30 a.m. train
to the town of Djeneral Jankovic, right on the Macedonian border,
about to pull out of the station, five red-and-cream train cars
hauled by a diesel locomotive and nothing _ absolutely nothing _ to
suggest that within two hours this train would meander its way
right past the last retreating Yugoslav army truck and through
NATO's front lines.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few old women in the cars, their journey to NATO's
protectorate the price of a train ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Only half a mile away I saw the Russian army, an armored
personnel carrier and three trucks leading a black BMW with dark
windows and Russian registration plates at speed towards Pristina
military airport.
</P>
<P>
   There were already hundreds of Russian troops at the mighty air
base, and these additions were greeted with frantic waves by Serbs
standing outside their homes. When a Yugoslav military checkpoint
stopped the vehicles and a cop shouted that ``a Russian general''
was in the black BMW, I ran to the rear of the little convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, General!'' I greeted him. A paunchy man with
three stars on his shoulders and with a blue-and-white shirt
beneath his Russian battle dress stuck a big sweaty hand out of his
window.
</P>
<P>
   Was he going to stay at the airport? To NATO's fury and
humiliation, I might have added. While soldiers and policemen tried
to interrupt, I learned that yes, he would stay, ``a long time.''
Days, weeks or months? ``Years,'' he replied with a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   He would only give his first name _ Igor _ but he was pleased
with himself, dabbing at his perspiration with a thick handkerchief
and offering his beefy hand to shake once more.
</P>
<P>
   But what did this mean? If a general was moving into Pristina
airport, what chance that another general _ Sir Michael Jackson of
KFOR, no less, Capt. Gosling's commanding officer _ would be able
to set up his headquarters in the very same building?
</P>
<P>
   Was the Russian army humbling NATO? Or both NATO and their own
Russian government, made up as it is of corrupt, incompetent
buffoons?
</P>
<P>
   As I drove back into Pristina, it occurred to me how much the
Russians would like to control the air base, with its massive
underground runways and nuclear-blastproof conference rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And how easy it would be to open the base to Russian aircraft to
bring in thousands more troops, with not just the blessing but the
positive encouragement of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered what it said on the back of the Russian armored
vehicle leading General Igor's convoy. The word on the back was:
``Airborne.'' By Saturday night the British were in Pristina, too.
But they had come the slow way. &QL;

   CONCORD, N.H. _ Al Gore is walking up the path to a home here
where 40 people have gathered to listen to his pitch. He has shed
his blue suit (as per President Clinton's instructions) for a green
polo shirt, khakis and cowboy boots. Spotting his host, who is
wearing a tie and sports jacket, Gore calls out, ``I hope I'm not
too informal!''
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking. Even in his casual, earth-tone
clothes, Al Gore seems pressed and starched. His language, too, has
that same formal quality. ``I want to engage in a dialogue with
you,'' he begins, then jumps straight to what he alerts his
audience is ``my punch line: I want to be president and I need your
support.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sets the stage for the official announcement of his
candidacy Wednesday in Tennessee, the vice president still seems to
be painting by numbers, following the chalk while he is learning to
dance, telling his audience as much as reminding himself exactly
what he is doing and why.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his years of practice for the 2000 election _ he was
groomed in a political family in Washington, has already run for
president once, and has understudied with a political master for
the last seven years _ Gore seems oddly unprepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gore probably has a more extensive record on issues
than anyone else running for president. From his votes in 16 years
in Congress, his authorship of a book on global warming and more
than six years as Clinton's vice president, Gore has had to take
specific stands on hundreds of topics _ from abortion rights to
ethanol subsidies to trade with China (he favors them all) _ in a
way that few other candidates have.
</P>
<P>
   Still, voters do not know who Gore is and what he is about _ his
pollster Mark Penn calls him ``famous but unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign hopes to change that on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp views the announcement speech as an opportunity
for Gore to emerge from Clinton's shadow and begin to define
himself. The speech also gives him the chance to try to close the
book on a period in which most of the information seeping out about
Gore has been negative: his exaggerated claims about creating the
Internet, his questionable money-gathering at a Buddhist temple,
his steadfastness to Clinton during impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, it gives him a chance to present
himself in human terms _ he will talk a lot about himself and his
family _ and to try to overcome the perception that he is a wooden
technocrat, or, in the word that most people said in a Pew poll was
the one that immediately came to mind when asked about Gore,
``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With our announcement, we are now in the next phase of our
campaign,'' Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who is
chairman of the Gore campaign, said in an interview. ``The vice
president will be dealing directly with the American people on
specific issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for a presidential candidate to get as
specific as Gore intends to this early in a campaign. But Gore
aides believe this will help the vice president separate himself
from Clinton and show up the weaknesses in the two rivals he is
most worried about, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on the
Democratic side and Texas Gov. George W. Bush among the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While he has adhered to Clinton's policies, Gore is starting to
put his stamp on certain issues. He has already given a speech on
education and called for universal preschool. He wants to increase
the federal government's reliance on religious institutions to help
with social programs, like drug-treatment. He wants to revive the
fight for health-care coverage for people without insurance. He
wants to limit suburban sprawl and traffic jams as part of what he
calls his ``livability agenda.'' And he will be giving policy
speeches regularly from here on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing,'' Coelho said, ``is for Al Gore to
say who he is before the Republicans say who he is and before
Bradley says who he is, and to have the American people relate to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is also intended to smoke out Bush, whose inaugural
speeches this week have been broadly thematic. By being specific,
the theory goes, Gore will force Bush to take positions that might
reveal himself to be more conservative, on gun control and
abortion, for example, than swing voters are willing to tolerate;
if Bush does not get specific, the Gore camp says, he will appear
inexperienced and unprepared to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Specificity also helps Gore distinguish himself from Clinton.
Gore has a tricky task here. He wants to live up to Clinton's
successes, but he must also live down his failures.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring Clinton success is the economy. Gore is running as
the man who can continue the prosperity of the Clinton years. ``We
know what works,'' he assures audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring Clinton failure is on the character issue and the
extramarital activities that led to his impeachment. Pollsters say
that ``Clinton fatigue'' _ a weariness with the administration's
scandals _ has been sapping energy from the Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract that, Gore advisers said the vice president would
emphasize his family-man credentials _ married 29 years, father of
four, expectant grandfather. To reinforce the message, Coelho said,
Gore is to appear on the ABC program ``20/20'' on Wednesday, the
day of his announcement speech, and make it clear that he
disapproved of Clinton's personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore was hesitant to criticize his boss in public.
Forced by reporters to confront the issue last September, Gore
would only use the president's own words, ``I agree with him that
it's indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also declared Clinton a great president on the day in
December when the House voted to impeach him _ an image the Gore
campaign would like to erase, instead making it clear that Gore
condemns such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Romash, the deputy campaign manager, said that most people
do not know much about Gore and that at the top of her list of
qualities was this: ``He's a loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is mentioning his wife, Tipper, at every turn. This helps
him solidify the family image, puts some personality on his blank
slate and is intended to help him connect with women voters. As
Gore told his audience here, he had to cancel their anniversary
dinner last month because he needed to break a tie vote in the
Senate on a gun-control measure _ which, he added, was fine with
his wife. ``She is, if anything, more anti-gun than I am,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its increasingly extensive use of Mrs. Gore, the campaign is
also presenting her, subliminally, as the anti-Hillary. She has
said she would not be the same kind of first lady as Hillary Rodham
Clinton. She has acknowledged a bout of depression, giving her an
air of vulnerability and casting the Gore family as close-knit and
caring. The Gores have let it be known that during impeachment,
while Gore was backing the president, Mrs. Gore was unforgiving.

BUSH, ON FIRST OUTING, RUNS HEAD-ON INTO ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW CASTLE, N.H. _ Republican presidential front-runner George
W. Bush barreled into the first-primary state Monday and confronted
a series of controversial issues, refusing to rule out raising some
taxes or to impose an anti-abortion litmus test on judicial
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extended questioning by reporters since he
announced Saturday that he was definitely running for president,
Bush alternately appeared amused and irritated when faced with a
wide range of questions, including demands for details about his
early years, when, as he freely admits, he was ``young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game they played in Washington -- it is
called &UR;  &LR; `Gotcha,' '' Bush said. ``It's the game where they float a
rumor and make the candidate prove a negative, and I'm not playing
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his refusal to elaborate on his own past squares with
his call, in his campaign, for new era of personal responsibility,
Bush bristled a bit. ``You can ask all the questions you want,''
Bush said. ``That is my answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will venture into Massachusetts Tuesday on the arm of
Governor Paul Cellucci, visiting a charter school in Lawrence and
attending a luncheon fund-raiser in Boston. He will return to New
Hampshire July 4th to continue campaigning for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With fog horns sounding in the nearby Atlantic Ocean, and the
smell of sea salt pungent in the air, Bush greeted several hundred
supporters in this upscale community, gathering under a white,
big-top tent to the strains of Aaron Copeland's peppy Rodeo music.
The audience included several Democrats curious about the Texas
governor's campaign trail debut, including state Senator Burt Cohen
and Democratic National Committee co-chairman Joe Andrew, as well
as a top Elizabeth Dole supporter, Alec Koromilas.
</P>
<P>
   One nascent controversy Bush sought to squelch concerned taxes,
ever a tender topic in the Granite State. Bush was asked four
questions about taxes following his statement last week that he
would not raise tax rates, a pledge that echoed his father's
memorably broken vow to ``Read my lips, No new taxes.'' Bush said
that he promised only to cut income and corporate marginal rates
and refused to rule out the possibility of raising other taxes and
fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pledge on income taxes,'' Bush said, while declining
to provide any details. ``I know everybody's waiting with bated
breath for the specific tax plan,'' Bush said. ``And I will be
laying it out here on my timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with New Hampshire reporters aboard his bus
bound for Manchester, Bush also said he is working on developing a
federal budget, with prioritized spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Bush appeared before 900 people at the annual
Manchester Lilac luncheon sponsored by the New Hampshire Federation
of Women. Bush, whose top competitor in the polls is Elizabeth
Dole, did not use use the occasion to speak to women's issues.
Instead, he repeated his stump speech calling for ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Pappas, one of the relatively few people at the event who
wore a Dole button, said she was confident that a majority of New
Hampshire Republican women would end up supporting Dole. ``She has
all the qualifications to be president,'' Pappas said. ``The
country is ready for a female president.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steiner, another member of the audience, said he backed
McCain but added: ``If George Bush gets the nomination, I don't
have any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was welcomed into the state by a Manchester Union-Leader
editorial that declared ``beginning today, the free ride is over,''
calling Bush ``unknown and untested.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a related, if more bluntly partisan note, the DNC
passed out T-shirts comparing the air of insuperability about the
Bush campaign to the Titanic. ``The iceberg cometh,'' the shirt
read. Over the past week, DNC officials have been meeting with
reporters in New Hampshire, Iowa and Washington, D.C., trying to
pick apart the governor's record and saying they find little to
distinguish his philosophy of compassionate conservatism from
right-wing conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which part don't they get? Conservatism or compassionate? ...
They must be worried,'' said Bush, with no apparent concern.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his confidence may lie in his burgeoning campaign
organization here. Before Bush ever set foot in the state, Senator
Judd Gregg and his campaign co-chairs had already signed up 250
people from around the state to organize in every city and county.
The list includes activists from every ward in Manchester and
Nashua, the state's two largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a theme that many of his Republican colleagues have
already sounded as a post-Clinton theme, Bush promised to respect
the office of the presidency and to conduct himself appropriately
if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up his right hand to a bank of 29 television cameras and
150 reporters, Bush said he swore an oath as the leader of Texas to
uphold the constitution and to respect the dignity of the
governorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pledge I have upheld, so help me God,'' Bush said, his
right hand remaining in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the character theme, he added, to applause: ``I will
not use my office as a mirror to reflect public opinion...I want
you to know I do not run polls to tell me what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Bush said he would nominate judges who strictly
interpret the U.S. Constitution. He was asked whether he interprets
the Constitution to allow for abortions and whether he would
require his judicial nominees to hold the same view.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no litmus tests, except for whether or not the
judges will strictly interpret the Constitution,'' he said. ``I am
not a lawyer. My job is to pick judges who are qualified to serve
on the bench and that will be my criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   During his bus ride to Manchester, Bush said that he respects
people who hold a different view on abortion. ``I understand good
people can disagree,'' he said. But he said that he believes people
can agree on banning the so-called partial birth abortion procedure
and the importance of notifying parents of minors who seek
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a stab at taking away credit for the flush
economy from the Clinton-Gore administration, praising small
businesses and entrepreneurs for revitalizing the United States'
financial position.
</P>
<P>
   On trade, Bush said he favored free trade with no barriers. He
said the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been blamed
for job losses in the Northeast, has created more jobs in Texas. He
said trade with China should be free, but should be screened to
make sure items of national security are not exported.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that his free-trade philosophy stops at the shores
of Cuba. Bush said he would oppose opening up trade with the
communist nation as long as Fidel Castro remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for America to keep the pressure on Fidel
Castro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign day, Bush blended touches of humility
and cockiness, apologizing for his late arrival and threading his
remarks with humor. Mostly, however, it was confidence that shone
through.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, during a visit to the Bow fire station, where he
faced questions from voters, a voice in the back called out,
``You're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Bush, with a broad smile, ``I believe I am going to
win.''

KLA MOVE INTO KOSOVO TOWN HEIGHTENS TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Kosovo _ The Kosovo Liberation Army swept in early
Monday morning and took control of two major neighborhoods in this
city, setting up a potential political conflict with international
peacekeeping troops and a possible military clash with
yet-to-depart Serb militia.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, KLA soldiers in full uniform and armed for
battle had set up checkpoints in Albanian streets of this
multi-ethnic city, in apparent violation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not allowed,'' said Col. Rolf Bescht, an officer with the
German peacekeeping troops who have been arriving for the past
several days. Bescht said Kosovo Force (KFOR) representatives had
informed the KLA it was in the wrong, but conceded that ``we cannot
be at every point in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the KLA _ which leaders said was 1,000-strong _
complicates what already has been a very tense and violent
transition of power in this region.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were supposed to be out of the area by midnight and a
peacekeeping force of German and Dutch soldiers is supposed to then
have full control of the town.
</P>
<P>
   But while the international peacekeepers clearly had a more
established presence in town Monday, the issue of who controls
Prizren was still very much in question.
</P>
<P>
   Serb civilians scuttled to pack their cars and leave town,
fearful that they would be the target of vengeful Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   KLA commander Rexha Aekrem, who goes by the nom-de-guerre of
Commander Drini, said his soldiers would keep order in the area as
long as they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   The KFOR troops ``are not enough'' to protect civilians from
attacks by lingering Serb military or civilians, Drini said. ``We
will be the force who will control the situation,'' he said from a
local KLA post, just 200 yards from a KFOR tank.
</P>
<P>
   Drini warned of a possible showdown between the KLA and the Serb
paramilitary, which he said were occupying two apartment buildings
near the KLA local command. The 17 paramilitary were rumored to be
planning to loot and torch the buildings as they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told KFOR (this) and we will be very happy if they would be
there,'' Drini said. But ``we will not stay and wait for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parting shot, Serb military trashed and burned Albanian
houses early Monday morning, less than a day after peacekeepers
entered the city, witnesses said. The slogans ``Death to
Albanians'' and ``Serbia All the Way to Tokyo'' were spray-painted
on the outer walls of the Albanians' houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible. I'm afraid of booby-traps and mines,'' said a
shaking and weeping Zade Hoxha, standing at the threshold of her
virtually destroyed home. Hoxha had been hiding with her husband in
a neighbor's house when, she said, the Serbs smashed, shot up,
burned and then left the Hoxha home they had been occupying.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled Serb withdrawal from this western region of Kosovo
_ the site of the heaviest fighting and worst reported atrocities
of the war _ is not going smoothly. Peacekeepers turned back
drivers headed toward Djakovica Monday, saying it was not yet safe.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Serb soldiers awaiting departure hunkered down
at a corner and had already started drinking, worrying KFOR that a
confrontation could occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous,'' Bescht said.
</P>
<P>
   A Sunday night fight between Serbs and KLA in nearby Suva Reka
left one KLA soldier and seven or eight Serbs dead, and 12 Serbs
``arrested'' by the KLA, Drini reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incident. It is not the war,'' Drini said when asked
if shooting, deaths and the taking of prisoners meant the war was
not finished.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA never had a strong presence during the war in Prizren,
an old, picturesque city in Kosovo's southwest. With a mosque and
an Orthodox church Prizren was always among the most ethnically
harmonious of Kosovo cities, home to Serbs, Albanians and a sizable
Turkish population.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival Monday of KLA soldiers _ outfitted with assault
weapons, pistols, hand grenades and hunting knives _ was the
biggest visible presence the city has seen, locals said. Drini said
the KLA had virtual control of Prizren, but the presence of the
soldiers was only heavily visible in two neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement, the KLA is supposed to
``demilitarize,'' though the details and schedule of the task is
not clear.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue army came into Prizren about 5 a.m. Monday from the
mountains. Locals who had been too afraid to step out onto the
cobblestone streets were out in droves Monday, clamoring around the
KLA soldiers and thrusting flowers at them. KLA soldiers swaggered
triumphantly through the city square.
</P>
<P>
   Children invited peacekeepers and other Westerners to autograph
their forearms. The men of Prizren _ practically invisible during
Serb military occupation of the city _ reclaimed their usual posts
in cafes and on storefront steps, smoking scarce cigarettes,
sipping coffee and exchanging war stories.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, Drini said, would protect these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will control the places where the internatiuonal forces
will not be present,'' he said. ``The situation now is at the level
where we have to be here.''

   LOWICZ, Poland _ Racing to mend the centuries-old breach between
Orthodox and Roman Catholic believers, Pope John Paul II has turned
Vatican planning upside down and decided to go ahead with a
previously canceled meeting with the head of the Armenian Apostolic
Church in Yerevan after leaving Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who has often spoken of his dream of reconciling the
Eastern and Western Christian churches by the year 2000, had hoped
to build on his historic visit to Romania last month, the first
trip by a pope to a predominantly Orthodox country in almost 1,000
years, by visiting Armenia for three days in July.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans were postponed indefinitely last Friday, when
Karekin I, who leads more than 6 million Armenian Orthodox
believers around the world, sent an envoy to Warsaw to meet the
pope and express his regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Catholicos Karekin, 66, is suffering from throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Father said he was very sorry, and then he asked me,
`What can I do?''' Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, primate of the
Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, who relayed the message
in Warsaw, recalled. ``I told him that the catholicos would be
very, very touched by a personal visit, and the pope replied, `I
should do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, according to the Vatican spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the pope told his entourage, ``I am going to
Yerevan.'' Navarro called the decision, ``unexpected.'' It was the
same morning that the pope slipped and cut his head, requiring
three stitches, while getting ready to leave the Vatican embassy
for a Mass in Sandomierz.
</P>
<P>
   He still wore a bandage Monday at a Mass in Lowicz and a prayer
service in Sosnowiec, but as his change of plans suggests, he has
no desire to slow down. ``The Holy Father was thinking and thinking
and thinking, but we got the news Saturday morning,'' Navarro-Valls
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope decided that he wanted to pay his respects to the
Armenian patriarch, who shares his interest in ecumenical dialogue
and in 1996 went to the Vatican to sign a joint declaration that
formally buried a theological dispute that had divided the two
churches for 1500 years.
</P>
<P>
   Karekin, whose formal title is Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos
of All Armenians, did so over the objections of most of his
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   His eventual successor might not prove as eager to invite the
leader of the world's Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   It could well be the pope's best chance to personally bring his
message of reconciliation _ and powers of persuasion _ to a country
that won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and where
more than 90 percent of its 3 million inhabitants describe
themselves as Orthodox Christians. Armenia has a small Catholic
minority, and also a small number of Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this visit, which also has the character of an ecumenical
pilgrimage, John Paul II wishes to express to Catholicos Karekin
his spiritual closeness in this moment of suffering,''
Navarro-Valls said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans call for the pope to spend an additional night
in Krakow on Thursday, and fly to Yerevan on Friday morning,
returning to Rome the same night.
</P>
<P>
   As the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion,
in A.D. 301, Armenia has a special significance for the pope, as
does his close relationship with Karekin I. But a fruitful meeting
there will not necessarily bring the pope any closer to his
long-awaited goal of visiting Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian Apostolic Church belongs to the Eastern Orthodox
tradition, but it became independent from other Christian churches
in A.D. 451, several centuries before the schism between
Constantinople and Rome in 1054.
</P>
<P>
   It remains independent from the other Orthodox churches, and
while the Armenian patriarch is on good terms with Aleksy II, the
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, he is unlikely to soften
his Russian counterpart on the subject of Catholics. Aleksy II has
steadfastly refused to meet with the pope or invite him to Russia.

US SOLDIERS GUARD POSSIBLE MASS GRAVE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KACANIK, Yugoslavia _ As American soldiers stood guard Monday
over what NATO officials say may be a mass grave of civilians
killed by Serb forces, refugees streaming back to this town in
southern Kosovo told a chilling story of how men, women and
children were massacred more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, British soldiers saw local people bringing flowers to
a spot in the town graveyard in back of a gas station. By Monday,
that gas station had been commandeered by members of the US Army's
82nd Airborne, and the grave site had been cordoned off to allow
for a forensics examination by the international war crimes
tribunal at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   British Army Capt. Vicki Wentworth said there were 81 stakes to
mark the graves of local people allegedly killed by Serb forces
during a killing spree which villagers said took place April 9.
</P>
<P>
   In the town center, residents told of at least two separate mass
killings. In one, according to Dr. Lul Raka, who works at the town
hospital, 17 people were shot dead on New Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were mostly elderly people,'' said Raka. ``Some were
shot in their houses, some running on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Raka said that because of the confusion, with local residents
having fled before and after the massacre, the exact number of
people killed won't be known unless the bodies are exhumed for
examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? They buried them, we didn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest slaughter, according to witnesses, was up a hilly
gorge lined with houses, where a group of about 80 civilians fled
when Serb forces opened fire on the morning of April 9. Witnesses
said 46 people were killed at Rakoc, and that the Serbs took all
but a few of the bodies down the hill later in wagons pulled by
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Skender Sopa, 37, led a group of journalists up the hill, next
to a stream, where he and other civilians fled, the Serbs in hot
pursuit. The dirt road leading up the hill was strewn with hundreds
of bullet casings, some from conventional rifles, others five-inch
anti-aircraft shells.
</P>
<P>
   Sopa, who escaped by hiding in a nearby house with nine other
people, said he buried three of the victims at the massacre site
before the Serbs removed the bodies. He named the victims as
Mukadeze Lika, 38, Tefik Nalbani, 45, and Xhyli Rexha, in his
mid-60s. He pointed out three graves behind a house in which some
of the victims were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Kacanik was apparently singled out for brutality because it was,
and is fast becoming again, a hotbed of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army. Monday, KLA rebels walked the streets of the town, all but a
few of them without guns per an edict from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A three-man patrol of soldiers from the 82nd Airborne walked the
streets, too. Spc. Matt Smith, Sgt. Charles Chiri and Staff Sgt.
George Person said they had been greeted warmly throughout the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happy to see us,'' said Chiri, 35, from Santa
Clara, Calif. ``We're here to show our presence, let them know
we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiri said the KLA had been instructed not to carry weapons,
with the exception of the local commander and his deputy, who were
allowed to carry sidearms.
</P>
<P>
   That KLA commander, Xhabir Zharku, used to manage restaurants in
Greenwich, Conn. But he moved back to Kosovo two years ago, and
Monday he sat behind the desk and in the office of the former
leader of the Serb paramilitary police unit which allegedly carried
out the April 9 massacres. He said the Serb police abandoned the
building last Friday, the day before NATO entered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Zharku said his rebel soldiers would keep their arms ``until we
know there are no Serbs here.'' He claimed that NATO agreed with
that strategy. He said his forces were searching for Serbs they
believe were involved in the massacres. He said they had not found
any yet, but if they did they would hold them and turn them over to
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Zharku said he had asked NATO not to allow refugees to flood
back until his troops had been able to reconnect the water, get the
hospital up and running, and clear mines and booby traps from homes
in the area. He said he needed 5 to 10 days to get the town ready.
</P>
<P>
   But many people cannot wait. Those who were not in the refugee
camps but were instead staying with relatives in Macedonia have
been coming back to the village over the last few days. Monday,
Faik Lata broke down in tears when he returned to his home and
found that it had been looted but not destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Lata, 45, his wife, Nebahat, and their 15-year-old nephew left
his sister's home in Skopje, the Macedonian capital, and took a
taxi to the border. They walked into Kosovo, walked for some time
on the highway, then got a lift to Kacanik.
</P>
<P>
   Given the devastation in this town, where every shop has been
looted and some of them completely destroyed, Lata got off
relatively easy. The three-story apartment block where he lives was
still standing, and while his apartment was trashed, it was simply
a matter of cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb forces stole his TV, his black leather jacket, 6,000
Deutschemarks he had hidden in the closet, and 10 kilograms of
coffee. But Lata considered himself lucky that, unlike many other
returning refugees, he had something to build on.
</P>
<P>
   Lata's restaurant, Perparimi, was destroyed, like every other
business in town. But he vowed to rebuild it, and rename it in
honor of US President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be here without NATO,'' he said. But he also said
he won't stay unless the KLA is allowed to remain armed.
</P>
<P>
   Sabit Raka's daughter, Jehona, was a nurse who was killed when
she tried to help the wounded who had fled up the gorge where the
46 civilians were allegedly massacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was at home,'' said Raka, 52, who is a captain in the
local KLA and is not related to Dr. Raka. ``When they needed first
aid, they called her, and she would go.''
</P>
<P>
   He said she had done that, and had climbed the steep gorge to
attend to the injured when she was shot. Dr. Raka brought out the
stainless steel first aid kit she was carrying. The metal was torn
by a bullet hole.
</P>
<P>
   Melihate Shehu, a nurse, said her brother, Rashat, was among
those killed at the gorge. She said two other nurses who rushed to
the scene were killed along with Jehona Raka. Monday, Shehu and a
group of nurses and doctors from the local hospital brought flowers
to the mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Lulzim Zaku, 23, a KLA volunteer, said he watched from a nearby
hill as the Serbs collected the bodies the day after the April 9
slaughter. He said they used a tractor to ferry the bodies down the
steep gorge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bulldozer came and opened a big hole,'' he said, describing
two large graves. ``They just grabbed them and threw them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the nearby village of Stagovo said there was a
massacre there around the same time as the killings in Kacanik.
Ahmed Bajrami, 31, said at least a dozen people were killed, the
youngest a boy of seven, the oldest, the village elder, 95-year-old
Ramush Jaha.
</P>
<P>
   KFOR officials said they had not yet investigated those claims.

SUPREME COURT STRIKES BAN ON GAMBLING ADS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Broadcast stations that reach viewers and listeners
in Texas can now trumpet Louisiana gambling halls without violating
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous Supreme Court on Monday struck down as
unconstitutional a federal ban that had kept some casino
advertising off Houston televisions and radios.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters had failed to convince lower federal courts
that the U.S. government's ban on interstate radio and TV ads
illegally restricted their First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals _ with jurisdiction over
Texas, Louisiana and neighboring states _ had agreed with a federal
district court that the government's goal of curtailing compulsive
gambling justified the ban on interstate advertising. The Supreme
Court disagreed, saying the government failed to defend its
restriction as sufficiently narrow to justify the restriction on
the broadcasters' speech.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government belied its goal of combatting
compulsive gambling by exempting from its advertising ban many
forms of wagering that are just as addictive as private casinos,
the court said. Under the law, advertisements regarding casinos on
American Indian reservations, state lotteries and horse races are
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   These forms of gambling are legal and advertised in Texas and
many other states that outlaw private casinos. American Indian
casinos operated by the Tiguas tribe in El Paso, Texas, and the
Kickapoos tribe in Eagle Pass, Texas, are thriving, a point not
lost on the justices as they rejected the government's argument
that reservations are far removed from populated areas and do not
merit free-speech concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's suggestion that Indian casinos are too
isolated to warrant attention is belied by a quick review of tribal
geography and the government's own evidence regarding the financial
success of tribal gaming,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the
court. ``If distance were determinative, Las Vegas might have
remained a relatively small community, or simply disappeared like a
desert mirage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashton Hardy, a Metairie, La., lawyer who pressed the Louisiana
broadcasters' case before the justices, praised the decision as
giving broadcasters ``the same First Amendment freedoms that are
enjoyed by the other media'' that can legally advertise casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates
broadcasters and defended the federal law, had no comment on the
court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the high court said the government has given
``no convincing reason'' for subjecting private casinos to an
advertising ban not imposed on similar places and forms of
wagering. The justices said the federal government could still
legally fight compulsive gambling with regulations, and thereby
avoid the risk of running afoul of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power to prohibit or regulate particular conduct does not
necessarily include the power to prohibit or regulate speech about
that conduct,'' Stevens wrote. ``It is well settled that the First
Amendment mandates closer scrutiny of government restrictions on
speech than of its regulation of commerce alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate regulations, for example, could prohibit casinos from
extending credit to gamblers, limit the use of cash machines in
gambling houses and restrict the permissible amount of bets, the
justices said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, the only member of the nine-person
court who declined to join Stevens' opinion, wrote separately to
express his strong disdain for the government's advertising
restriction. ``I continue to adhere to my view that in cases such
as this, in which the government's asserted interest is to keep
legal users of a product or service ignorant in order to manipulate
their choices in the marketplace
</P>
<P>
   such an interest is per se illegitimate,'' Thomas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In other high court news:
</P>
<P>
   -- The justices agreed to decide whether taxpayer dollars can be
used to provide computers and other high-tech educational equipment
to parochial schools without running afoul of the Constitution's
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   In a case from Louisiana, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
struck down as unconstitutional a federal program that provides
funds that local school boards can use to provide computers to
public and parochial schools. The appeals court said the use of
public funds for religious schools violated the First Amendment
prohibition on government endorsement of religion.
</P>
<P>
   -- The high court also agreed to decide whether Texas courts
violated the constitutional rights of a man serving a life sentence
for aggravated-sexual assault and related offenses on a 14-year-old
girl. Scott Carmell claims Texas prosecutors should not have been
permitted to allow his alleged victim to testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell, in his successful request that the justices hear his
appeal, argued that Texas law at the time of his 1992 offense
prohibited sexual-assault victims from testifying if they waited
longer than six months after the offense before telling a person,
other than the defendant, of the purported attack. A 1993 amendment
to the law removed the six-month deadline, and the victim was
permitted to testify at Carmell's 1997 trial, even though she had
waited more than six months to tell of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Carmell said the Constitution's prohibition on ex post facto
convictions prohibited prosecutors from using at-trial testimony
that would not have been permitted at the time of the attack. That
argument, however, lost in Texas courts, prompting Carmell to
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to hear arguments in the Louisiana
case, Mitchell vs. Helms, and in Carmell vs. Texas this fall or
early next year and to render their decisions by July 2000.

 &HT;    Baptists convene in Atlanta for annual meeting
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Southern Baptists by the thousand convene in the
Georgia Dome today, President Clinton, the nation's top Baptist
layman, is being criticized for his stand on homosexual rights
again.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 official ``messengers'' to the convention and many
more visitors and denominational officials are expected for the
annual gathering of the flock and its dose of praise and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Headliners from outside the denominational hierarchy include
football star Reggie White, known for his anti-homosexual stance,
and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, best known as founder of the now
defunct Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   Some convention attendees interviewed Tuesday said they looked
forward to the worship and fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   After years of strife for control of the country's largest
Protestant group, the conservatives who now lead it are ``getting
our focus back on reaching the world for Christ,'' said the Rev.
Gary Dean, an evangelist from Fulton, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeff Spooneybarger, whose brother Timothy signed with
the Braves as a pitcher in Orlando last week, said he expected the
greatest achievement of the convention to be ``its spirit of
worship and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   And Trudy Sturgill, a first grade teacher and pastor's wife from
Pineville, Ky., said of her first convention, ``More than anything,
it's spiritually uplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   But SBC leaders in pre-convention events were not about to
ignore a White House proclamation issued June 11 proclaiming this
Gay and Lesbian Pride Month 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist president the Rev. Paige Patterson, speaking on
a denominational radio show Tuesday, called for President Clinton's
home congregation, Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, to
discipline him.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation, said Patterson, is ``entirely inconsistent
with his confession as an evangelical Christian and certainly as a
Southern Baptist.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the proclamation should be ``the subject of
church discipline. The fact that he is President of the United
States ought to make no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proclamation praised ``America's diversity,'' condemns
hate crimes and encourages all Americans to recognize Gay and
Lesbian Pride month and ``observe this month with appropriate
programs, ceremonies, and activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sermon Tuesday to the Southern Baptist pastor's conference,
the Rev. Richard Land, head of the denomination's Ethics and
Religious Liberty Commission and host of the radio show, once again
made reference to the proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what appropriate action is,'' Land said. ``It's praying
that God will stay his judgment on this country until this man is
no longer our president.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Southern Baptist Convention rejected an effort to
deny credentials to Clinton's church because of his stands on
abortion and homosexuality. And last year, the convention voted
down narrowly a move to call on Immanuel to discipline the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wiley Drake, a California pastor and self-described
rabble-rouser, said he will introduce a resolution Tuesday
discouraging Americans from observing Gay Pride month ``other than
to pray for the repentance and salvation of those caught up in this
sinful lifestyle.''

EPA CHIEF PROMISES `DOWNWIND' STATES ACTION AGAINST POLLUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thwarted by a federal court in her effort to clean up air
pollution that drifts from other regions to the Northeast, the head
of the US Environmental Protection Agency said Monday she would
give in to the demands from four states to take direct action
against polluters.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner said she had hoped to avoid
enforcing the unusual petitions from the states, which blame power
plants and industrial boilers in 12 states from Indiana to Maryland
for part of the summertime smog problem in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But she said a federal appeals court last month forced her hand
by at least temporarily stopping a 37-state pollution reduction
plan from taking effect. The ruling was the second this spring in
which the three-judge panel found that the EPA has overstepped its
authority in making new air pollution rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northeast has been waiting a long time for these pollution
reductions,'' said Browner in a briefing for reporters. ``We had a
sensible path to get us there. The courts robbed us of that
opportunity, but we are not giving up. We are going back and
finding another path to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern air pollution officials said Browner was making the
best of a bad situation after the court stopped tougher new smog
standards as well as the regional cleanup of nitrogen oxides, which
turn toxic in the summer sun. The state petitions will cut nitrogen
oxide emissions by 717,000 tons a year instead of 1.1 million tons,
but officials said that's better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real measure of success is whether EPA insures that all
major smokestacks in the eastern US have modern pollution controls
by the 2003 ozone (smog) season,'' said Jason Grumet of the
Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, which advises
states on air issues. ``Based on the choices available, this
strategy seems most likely to produce that result.''
</P>
<P>
   However, owners of the plants that would bear the brunt of the
EPA crackdown said Browner's new strategy is ``dramatically
weaker'' because the agency cannot hold them to the tougher smog
standards. A diminishing number of regions within states violate
existing standards _ Boston meets them, for example _ making it
hard for states to argue that distant smokestacks are causing a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Are the impacts'' that Massachusetts and
other states petitioned EPA about ``significant?'' asked Patrick
Dal Porto, staff engineer for American Electric Power, the
Ohio-based utility that owns many coal plants that would be
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Browner's initiative is the latest move in a highly technical
tug-of-war that, at its root, is both simple and important:
</P>
<P>
   Scores of older power plants across the Midwest and South,
mostly exempted from current pollution control standards, pump
countless tons of emissions out of tall smokestacks that are
carried on the prevailing wind to other states, mostly in the
Northeast. The question is: what should be done?
</P>
<P>
   EPA, under pressure from New England and other so-called
``downwind'' states, had pulled together a 37-state group of upwind
and downwind states to work out a regional plan, leaving it to the
22 individual states that ``export'' pollution to decide how to
control it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, EPA developed more restrictive limits for
ozone, an ingredient of smog that is formed when nitrogen oxide and
other pollutants are cooked in hot summer sun. In developing their
plans, the 22 pollution ``exporting'' states would have to meet the
new, lower standard.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA strategy crumbled on May 14 when the US Court of
Appeals in Washington declared the new ozone standard ``an
unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.'' Two of the
three judges agreed that EPA could not enforce an ozone standard
that was tougher than the one in the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on May 24, the court stayed the 37-state regional nitrogen
oxide clean up, on the grounds that it, too, exceeded EPA
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Browner has called the rulings ``bizarre,'' and the agency plans
to appeal. In the meantime, Browner turned to petitions from 11
``downwind'' states that ask her to force power plants and
industrial boilers to clean up. The Clean Air Act allows states to
appeal directly to EPA to solve pollution problems caused outside
their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these petitions also face a challenge by utilities
and others in the same appeals court, but Browner hopes to
short-cicruit legal challenges by tossing out any references to the
new ozone standard. As a result, she said petitions from Maine, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont had to be rejected, and 10 of
the 22 pollution ``exporting'' states would not have to undertake
new pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always regarded the petitions filed by the Northeast
states as an insurance policy, the backstop to the regional plan,''
said Browner. If EPA is able to reinstate the ozone standards and
37-state cleanup plan, she said the petitions would be voided.

NEWS ANALYSIS: KOSOVO CONFLICT REIGNITES DEBATE OVER EUROPEAN
DEFENSE NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-REBELS) 
(sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The Kosovo war has brought radical changes to the
European continent, thrusting Germany into a leading military role
not seen since 1945, galvanizing attempts to forge a common
European defense policy, and altering Europe's relationship with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with Russian stability still deeply uncertain, and
the abrupt movements of Russian troops in Kosovo suggesting
Moscow's military may be restive, Europeans remain wary of any
``decoupling'' from Washington. But the desire to maintain
trans-Atlantic ties is now accompanied by a push to balance them in
a new way.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, now often called the ``Kriegskanzler,'' or
war chancellor, has found himself steering a coalition made up
largely of former pacifists toward involvement in a war that has
ended with the planned deployment of 8,000 German troops in Kosovo,
the second-largest contingent, after Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany has become a normal country in military terms, and
that is a critical change for Europe,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a
British defense analyst. ``The change is timely because the war has
shown how much Europe needs to do to catch up with the United
States in defense terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Kosovo war began, the European Union remained obsessed
with the creation of a common currency, the euro. Efforts to
develop shared European defense and security policies were largely
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   But an 11-week NATO bombardment of Kosovo that was dominated by
the United States appears to have changed that. Europe's need for
new military technologies like laser-guided bombs, its dependence
on the United States for strategic reconnaissance, and its lack of
aircraft were clear.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a debate that had been confined to a few foreign
policy and military experts about Europe's growing dependence on
the United States and its failure to keep up with new technologies
has become a subject of wide public discussion. What decisions
Europeans will make are not yet clear, but they know they have to
make some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has been a watershed in so many ways,'' said Karl
Kaiser, a German foreign policy expert. ``For Germany, it has
represented a coming of age. For Europe, it has brought a crushing
realization of the asymmetry of military power between it and the
United States, and the need to do something about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Europeans have shown they intend to be in the fore of
the Kosovo deployment. Troops from the four major European Union
countries _ Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ will total about
33,000, outnumbering the planned American unit of 7,000 troops by
almost five to one.
</P>
<P>
   The British commitment of 13,000 troops reflects Prime Minister
Tony Blair's determination to give Britain a leading role in the
development of European defense _ a critical departure from former
leaders who saw such a policy as a betrayal of the Atlantic
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans have clearly moved from a peripheral role in Bosnia,
where far fewer troops were deployed only after a heated national
debate, to a central one in Kosovo that was quickly approved last
week by Parliament. The ghosts of Nazi horrors in the Balkans, so
present at the time of the Bosnian discussions, have faded.
</P>
<P>
   But there was evidence of tensions surrounding the German
deployment on Sunday. A German military spokesman said German NATO
troops in Prizren shot dead one Serb and seriously injured another
after being threatened with a hand grenade. In another episode
about 25 milies south of Pristina, at least two German journalists
from the weekly news magazine Stern were shot dead by unidentified
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The large European deployment reflects both the Pentagon's
enduring hesitations about ground troops and Europe's emerging
desire to prove itself after its failure in Bosnia and the American
domination of the air campaign over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision of a multipolar world is being reinforced,''
Jacques Chirac, the French president, said of the Kosovo
deployment, picking up an old French theme stressing the need to
counter American ``hegemony.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe can point to a real role in ending the Kosovo war: its
envoy, President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, brought home the
peace agreement from Belgrade. At the same time, Europe at last
merged its redundant defense body, the West European Union, with
the European Union itself and appointed the NATO secretary general,
Javier Solana, as its first high representative for foreign and
defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, Eyal, the British defense analyst, remarked, ``These
changes, for the moment, are largely symbolic ones and all the
difficult decisions lie ahead for a continent still massively
dependent on the United States for the military power that was
decisive in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Those difficult decisions include increasing defense spending.
The United States spends about 3.2 percent of its total output of
goods and services on defense, compared with an average of about
2.1 percent in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Such increases are sure to meet strong domestic resistance in
many European states, where important bodies of left-of-center
opinion suspect that NATO's reinvention of itself as an agent of
humanism is merely a way to reinforce defense industries and spread
American capitalism behind a mask of benevolent concern for human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Constraints on European budget deficits imposed when the euro
was created will also hamper increased defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has made it clear that a complete restructuring of
European armed forces is needed,'' said Kaiser. ``The notion that
everyone does and repeats the same thing has become absurd. There
has to be a new division of labor, new synergies, new European
thinking, but politically it will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for perhaps the first time since the end of World War II,
Europeans seem aware that they cannot eternally remain the security
orphans of 1945 or depend overwhelmingly on the United States,
which is deeply reluctant to deploy ground troops in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have also realized, more deeply even than over Bosnia,
that conflict on the continent did not end with the Cold War's
conclusion, but merely shifted to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no military exit strategy from the region,'' said
Carl Bildt, the U.N. Kosovo mediator. ``An international military
presence to guarantee peace in the Balkans must be seen in the
coming decades as something as natural as it was to have troops in
divided Germany during the Cold War years.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Emaciated young men slowly walk the
twisting, narrow alleys of an ethnic Albanian neighborhood here,
while others too injured to wander recuperate in homes where they
were lucky to find care and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   They are the missing men of Kosovo, and they are beginning to
turn up here in sad shape after weeks of what they describe as
extreme maltreatment in Serb-run prisons or other detention.
</P>
<P>
   In a single small neighborhood in northern Pristina seven of
these still dazed men were found Monday, all of them released from
prisons or the hospital last Thursday. It was the day after
Yugoslavia agreed to pull its troops out of Kosovo, when Serbs here
learned they were about to be confronted with responsibility in the
eyes of the world for their noxious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd get out of there,'' said Ramadan Sadriju,
a 20-year-old ethnic Albanian with hollowed cheeks and ribs jutting
from his skinny torso. He referred to the feared prison at Lipjan,
the place he spent six gruesome weeks packed into a single cell
with 38 others.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was out, but he still seemed unable to smile.
</P>
<P>
   His 16-year-old brother Berat was just as physically debilitated
-- as they sat without shirts their heartbeats were easily visible
-- but Berat was too withdrawn to answer a journalist's questions
or describe his stay in the same prison.
</P>
<P>
   The pair and four other men interviewed were grabbed by Serb
forces from refugee convoys trying to escape into Macedonia or
Albania, just like tens of thousands of other men reported
separated from families trying to leave the terrors of Kosovo. A
seventh man was shot and injured during an attack on his village,
then taken away by Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   All are patients of a remarkable young doctor, Murat Abdazi,
himself only aged 25. Abdazi, working sometimes with a nurse and
medical assistant, has spent these grim months racing from one
disastrous case to the next.
</P>
<P>
   For a while his team worked a nearby mountain village under
siege, but mostly he has snaked his way through sniper fire and
stronger assaults here in Pristina, delivering babies, treating
people beaten and shot, and generally trying to keep alive the
ethnic Albanians hiding his own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared for this. I had saved the medicine,'' said
Abdazi, who was greeted by almost every passing person as he led
two journalists through the hilly district of houses with a rural
village look.
</P>
<P>
   But he had nearly exhausted his supplies, and he was worried
about treating some of these ex-prisoners who were his latest round
of emergency patients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most seriously injured was Bahtir Zeciri, 26, who was
wounded in the same Serb military attack that killed his father in
their village of Kolatec north of here on May 26. He was shot in
the left shoulder and right arm, and another bullet grazed his
upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   Police picked up him and two other men, he said, and he ended up
in what sounded like a special interrogation room in a basement
here in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three days I had no food or water,'' Zeciri said. He was
blindfolded the entire time and had no medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Like others interrogated, Zeciri said the Serbs tried to make
him admit to being a member of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and
to give information about the KLA, which has been labeled a
terrorist group by the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   He was released after the three days, but en route home to his
village was cornered by Serb paramilitary forces who beat him
severely. That apparently is when he suffered the broken left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Zeciri finally ended up in the main surgical hospital of
Pristina, but it was no safe haven for an ethnic Albanian brought
in by Serb security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who came into my room beat me,'' he said, citing the
nurses, the doctors and two army officers who threatened to throw
him out the window. ``People from the prisons came to the hospital,
but they were treated like they were in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories have circulated already about the Pristina
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb-run hospital, too, discharged its prisoner patients on
June 10, and Zeciri staggered out into the city. A young woman from
Dr. Abdazi's neighborhood found him and brought him home.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said Zeciri's broken arm was set, but he had not
removed the cast to see it yet. He said wounds to the young man's
right arm and wrist were not well doctored, and the patient cannot
move his ring finger on that hand.
</P>
<P>
   Veton Berisha, 22, is another of the complicated cases the young
doctor has been trying to treat with few resources.
</P>
<P>
   He and his 48-year-old father Ilmi had been pulled from a convoy
on April 30. They also were dispatched to Lipjan prison, which Ilmi
Berisha described as a house of horrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several died in the cell with us from beatings,'' said Ilmi
Berisha, describing pitiless living conditions in which some 160
people from four cells shared one toilet. Food was marginal and
beatings came almost every day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners in his cell were aged 13 to 75.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 days in custody, authorities took three or four people
from each cell, and they never were seen again in the prison, said
the elder Berisha.
</P>
<P>
   His son was severely injured on the day prisoners were ejected
from Lipjan. In weakened conditions they were forced to walk the 12
miles to Pristina, then encountered brutally hostile Serbs in the
city. It was one day after Kosovo's ethnic Serb population learned
it had lost out to NATO, which would be sending international
peacekeeping troops to secure the city at the same time Yugoslav
troops would be required to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In the city both men were beaten to unconsciousness. Abdazi said
the younger Berisha was hit at least 20 times in the head, based on
the wounds he found, had his jaw broken and his left ear nearly
ripped off. The father and son were dropped into a building that
was then set afire.
</P>
<P>
   They were fortunate that neighbors saw what had happened and
busted through a window to retrieve them. Finally they were brought
to Abdazi's neighborhood, where he is trying to treat them.

   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Shala Selvinaze pulled back the tatty wool
carpet in her tiny living room to show precisely where Serbian
paramilitary men slit the throat of her son, Ymer.
</P>
<P>
   She had cleaned the top carpet, she said. She had to. If she
wanted to live, the Serbs said, she had to remain in the house, on
devastated Ramiz Batusha Street in this devastated city. She
couldn't live, she said, with the sight of her son's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, a second carpet was stained rusty red. Mrs.
Selvinaze, 65, pulled that back. A sheet of cardboard beneath bore
a larger, darker stain. She was flooded with tears.
</P>
<P>
   A scouting party of Italian NATO forces finally arrived in Pec
on Monday at around 6 a.m., but she hadn't dared leave the house.
She kissed the hand of the first foreigner she saw.
</P>
<P>
   Pec, like most of Kosovo, is a ruin, and nearly empty of people
now. The downtown has been looted and burned with a methodical
hatred. Very few Albanians remain in the city, most of them old or
ill, and the Serbs who lived here have been fleeing by the
thousands, fearful of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Pec was a city of some 70,000 before the war _ 120,000 including
the surrounding villages. About 30 percent of the people were
Serbs. Now, the Serbs are fleeing and the Albanians have not yet
returned from their exile.
</P>
<P>
   On a burned Albanian building, the graffiti reads: ``Serbia to
Tokyo!'' Now, the Serbs are following their withdrawing army and
police and fleeing back to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Selvinaze said the paramilitaries came on the night of May
10. With no electricity, she and her son, Ymer, 35, were sitting in
candlelight when the knocks came on the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had already come twice before and stolen her washing
machine and her old television. They took the wedding ring from her
finger and the earrings from her ears. They were her grandmother's,
she said; the only pair she owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Give us money or we'll kill you.' And I said, `I
have only my soul to give _ take that and kill me.'''
</P>
<P>
   They searched the house, saying that they were looking for
weapons. They took anything they wanted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When they came again, she said, she told her son to run. ``I
told him to rush to the neighbors,'' Mrs. Selvinaze said. ``He
said, `No, mother. You run there. What can they do to me? I've done
nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   She went next door. Then she heard him screaming, she said,
screaming, ```Oh mother, I'm dying. I'm dying.' They cut his throat
with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   When she came back to her house and saw Ymer, she fainted, she
said, beginning to whimper, making small noises like a toy bellows.
</P>
<P>
   She said she left Ymer's body overnight where it lay. She went
back to her neighbors. ``What could I do?'' she pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   She could not bury him, she said, because her little courtyard
is concrete. That night, she said, the Serbian police came back and
bundled him into a blanket and took him away in a green van. Where,
she has no idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even cry,'' she said, still dressed in black. ``So
I'm eating bread and salt. I went mad when they killed Ymer. If
they kill me now, I don't care. I heard him screaming, `Oh mother,
I'm dying,' and I told him to run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Serbian soldiers and police remain in Pec, and Mrs.
Selvinaze has spent the last three nights in a neighbor's cellar,
as Serbs fired weapons and burned more houses. She carefully took
her visitor outside, to house number 63, a large establishment with
a satellite dish that was burned by Serbs on Sunday night, she
said, and was still smoldering.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, she went into the garden of another ruined
house. Two fresh graves were mounded amid the bright red peonies
and the weeds. She helped her neighbor Sena dig them two days ago.
Sena's mother, Naja, 75, and her brother, Hasan, 55, were killed by
the Serbs. Sena buried them and then fled.
</P>
<P>
   In the street, houses smoked. A woman's shoe lay in the road,
next to part of an electric iron. Serbian names like Goran and
Milos are spray-painted on charred, broken walls.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Selvinaze said she could not hate the Serbs. Her Serbian
neighbor, Jela Lakovic, looked after an old Albanian man named
Rustam Muja. ``She brought him bread and yogurt,'' Mrs. Selvinaze
said. ``She said, `Don't be afraid.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw me crying and brought me peppers and yogurt,'' Mrs.
Selvinaze said. ``She said, `Our people did a lot of bad things and
honest people suffered.' She was good to us. She told me, `The
foreigners will come in a few days and don't be afraid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Where is Mrs. Lakovic now? ``I don't know,'' Mrs. Selvinaze
said. ``Maybe she left. I told her I would always remember what she
did for us. But her son-in-law was a terrible man, and he killed
many people, like a butcher.''
</P>
<P>
   In the central city, more Italian troops were moving in, black
feathers bobbing on their helmets, pointing out to each other yet
another burned shop or house.
</P>
<P>
   On the road to the Pec Patriarchy, Serbs continued to load up
cars and trailers with suitcases, televisions, food, blankets,
mattresses and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Serbs are leaving Pec, and we cannot stop them,'' said
a priest named Miljko Koricanin, who leads the congregation at St.
Jovan, the Serbian Orthodox church in Pec. ``We go out to speak
with them and beg them to stay. But people are terrified that the
KLA will appear again.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Italians reached Pec Monday, he said, ``we talked with
the general and asked him to protect the people who stay here.
Otherwise, he'll have nothing to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of Serbs are leaving and no one can stop them and
NATO doesn't stop them,'' Koricanin said. ``We asked the Italians
to put soldiers near the patriarchy and the churches and two
soldiers in every village. If we manage to keep the people here,
then the others will come back. People are just fleeing their
houses and they don't know where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Gorazdevac, he said, 600 houses belong to
Serbs, but only 30 Serbs remain. In Belo Polje, a mile away, only
20 old people are still there.
</P>
<P>
   Pec is to Serbian Orthodoxy what Rome is to the Catholics, he
said. ``This is a holy place, and if they take this, they will take
the soul from the Serbs, our dearest possession.'' By they, he
said, he meant the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   The priest's eyes reddened. ``It has been very difficult for us
when the Albanians left,'' he said. ``And it is very difficult for
us now. I can't lie to you, it's harder now, when our own people
leave. We go and ask them, beg them to stay. But they just want a
guarantee from someone, that someone guarantees them peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the separatist group here in Pec? He smiled. ``It's
everywhere,'' he said. ``If you stay overnight you will hear the
shooting. The proof they exist is very easy,'' he said slowly.
``Just sit with an Albanian civilian in his car and you will find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Koricanin is not a monk; he has a family. And even he took his
wife and two sons away from Pec, ``and I haven't done anything bad
to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked the names of sons, he began to cry. Stephan, he said, is
11, and Dusan is 8. Tears running down his beard to disappear into
his cassock, Koricanin cried, ``I don't know if I will ever see
them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned and walked away.

BAY STATE COURT ACTS TO HALT PROFILING IN TRAFFIC STOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a stunning break with the nation's highest court,
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled Monday that police
do not have an automatic right to order drivers and passengers out
of cars during routine traffic stops, saying the practice was ``a
clear invitation to discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-2 decision strikes at the heart of a police practice that
minorities say is used disproportionately against them, leading to
calls across the nation for an end to so-called ``racial
profiling'' in traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would behoove our law enforcement community . . .
to get on the stick here,'' said state Senator Dianne Wilkerson,
who played a key role in April's State House hearings at which
blacks testified about being stopped by police solely because of
their race.
</P>
<P>
   The five-judge majority said it will flatly ignore two US
Supreme Court decisions that empower police _ for their own safety
_ to issue so-called ``exit orders'' without fearing they are
violating the privacy rights of the people in the cars.
</P>
<P>
   The majority said the state's constitution, on which the US
Constitution was modeled, gives Massachusetts citizens greater
privacy rights. The court said it feared adopting the approach of
the US Supreme Court would lead to the kind of racial profiling
that has occurred most prominently in New Jersey, where state
troopers were found to have stopped blacks and Hispanics at much
higher rates than whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That a small percentage of routine traffic stops may result in
the detection of more serious crimes is no reason to subject the
vast majority of citizens to orders to get out of their vehicles,''
Justice John M. Greaney wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Greaney, along with the court's only black judge, Justice
Roderick Ireland, indicated they were reacting to complaints from
motorists who said they'd been stopped by police simply because
they're black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Routine traffic stops may also pose unique hardships on
minorities who, it has been argued, are often the subject of stops
on pretext,'' Greaney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The recent hearings at the State House have prompted legislators
to ask that police be required to record the race of those they
stop in order to assess the prevalence of racial profiling in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   As Ireland pointed out, ``Statistics show that such racial
profiling occurs throughout the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a stinging dissent, Justice Charles Fried, said the
majority had waded into a policy area best left to the Legislature
and had relied on ``the inflammatory issue of race'' to bolster a
poorly conceived conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely agree that the discriminatory enforcement of law
is a shame and disgrace,'' Fried wrote. ``(But) I think it is
fanciful to imagine that by weaving a gossamer garment of
complicated rules, we will do anything to root out this behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried said the US Supreme Court had drawn a ``bright-line''
standard that everyone can understand _ police have the power to
issue ``exit orders.'' It's designed to protect police officers and
any discomfort to law-abiding citizens is minimal, Fried said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the majority and Fried agreed on a key point, however. If a
police officer, acting out of legitimate concern for his or her
safety because of the acts of a specific individual, orders someone
out of a car, then the courts will back any prosecution that
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a mere hunch is not enough, it does not take much for a
police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit
order,'' Greaney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the case that led to Monday's decision does not have
any racial component. In 1997, a state trooper pulled over a taxi
that drifted over a marked lane on Interstate 195 in Marion.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger in the rear seat, John D. Gonsalves, became
nervous and was removed by the trooper when he admitted he had
outstanding arrest warrants. The trooper then searched the seat and
found 78 grams of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge threw out the cocaine evidence against Gonsalves
because the trooper had no specific reason _ other than Gonsalves'
nervousness _ to take him out of the car and search the seat. The
Appeals Court upheld the ruling but Plymouth County prosecutors
appealed to the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the SJC said the drugs cannot be used as evidence
against Gonsalves, effectively ending the case, according to his
attorney, J. Drew Segadelli.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC, he said, didn't want ``to give the police unfettered
rights. This could be you or I. This is a great victory for the
people of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Bennett, president of the State Police Officers
Association of Massachusetts, said the ruling simply reinforces
what he has long told colleagues from other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 49 states _ and then there is Massachusetts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said troopers routinely pull over cars for traffic
violations, not because of the driver's race or gender. Through
contact with state police in such places as Maryland and New
Jersey, where racial profiling has drawn heavy criticism,
Massachusetts troopers have learned what not to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the SJC majority ignored the reality of police
work, where a life-threatening event can grow suddenly out of
routine traffic stops. The trooper who arrested Gonsalves acted
wisely, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what their concern is,'' Bennett said. ``At
least the officer went home that night. And so did the bad guy.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola products pulled after illnesses in Belgium
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (f) Financial and (i) International categories.)
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Belgian government has ordered Coca-Cola Co. to
withdraw its beverages from the market after more consumers
reported becoming ill from the company's soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche took the action Monday after
anti-poison centers reported consumers with hemolysis, a condition
that destroys red blood cells. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting
and stomach aches.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said the company is
cooperating fully with Belgian authorities in removing its
products, including Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light, Sprite, Fanta and
Cherry Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said he believes this is the first time the company has
been asked to remove its entire inventory from a nation. Outside of
Belgium, no complaints have been reported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While its Belgian business represents less than 1 percent of the
company's global sales, Coca-Cola controls nearly two-thirds of the
nation's soft-drink market.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry said it will not permit sales to resume
until Coca-Cola traces the cause of the problem and makes sure that
its products are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said an independent scientific analysis shows the
products cited in the illnesses _ Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Light _
``do not constitute a health hazard.'' He said the company has been
working ``around the clock to identify the cause of the incidents.
We expect to have an answer soon.''
</P>
<P>
   One incident involved Coca-Cola cans that had a nontoxic odor on
the exterior, Baskin said. About 40 students were hospitalized last
week and then discharged, he said. An additional 17 students were
reportedly hospitalized Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A separate incident last week involved glass bottles that had a
``nontoxic off-taste,'' Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   The products are distributed in Belgium by Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which recalled about 100,000 cases last
week.
</P>
<P>
   CCE, which is 40 percent owned by Coca-Cola, is known for having
a high degree of quality control, said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Until the facts come out, no one
should draw any conclusions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's problems follow a major health crisis in Belgium
that started last month when chicken, eggs, beef, pork and dairy
products were found to be contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts said the Belgium government might be
acting aggressively on the Coca-Cola situation in light of the
dioxin scare.

 &HT;    Family hopes large reward will reap information in murder case
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The family of a wealthy Atlanta businessman found shot
to death in his burning mansion 2 1/2 years ago is offering
$200,000 _ believed to be the largest private reward in state
history _ for information leading to his killer.
</P>
<P>
   The reward is second only to the $1 million posted for the
capture of Eric Robert Rudolph in connection with the 1996 bombing
at Centennial Olympic Park. And that was by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of any reward go this high,'' said John
Bankhead, spokesman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The family of David L. Coffin Jr. announced the reward Monday.
The family also placed a display ad in today's Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, said Mike Perricone, vice president of
advertising for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin, whose family has been at the helm of a Fortune 500
corporation in Connecticut for more than 200 years, was found in
his kitchen under debris that fell during an arson fire at his home
shortly after 9:30 p.m. Dec. 10, 1996. Police said he had been shot
once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Atlanta police arrested Scott Davis, a local
businessman. Coffin was dating Davis' ex-wife at the time of his
death, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Davis, whose father is a forensic psychiatrist
who has profiled killers, was charged with murder, arson and three
break-ins at Coffin's Atlanta house.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was jailed for three months and released when a judge
signed a $500,000 property bond secured by his parents' home. The
bond was awarded because the Fulton County District Attorney's
office had not taken the case before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors eventually dropped charges against Davis though he
remains a suspect. He is now living in San Francisco. Monday, his
attorney, Bruce H. Morris, said neither he nor his client were
aware of the $200,000 reward. Morris declined comment on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel there was sufficient evidence against Scott
Davis,'' Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said Monday.
``We certainly have to consider him a suspect in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said investigators in his Major Case Division are
doubling their efforts on the case as they work with Atlanta
homicide investigators. Atlanta Maj. Mickey Lloyd said his
detectives continue to follow leads in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigators are intensifying their efforts over the next
two weeks to bring the person to justice,'' Howard said. ``We'll be
working on some things I can't divulge, but we hope to have a
conclusion to this very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffin, who was single, moved to Atlanta from Connecticut in
1991. He purchased his $375,000 home that August, court records
showed. According to friends, he was self-employed, ``buying
businesses and selling them for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, through their Atlanta representatives, declined
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that someone out there who is probably in this area
knows something about this and we hope this reward will help bring
them forward,'' Howard said. ``This reward is certainly
unprecedented.''

EMI PUTS FIVE GAS-FIRED POWER PLANTS ON AUCTION BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five gas-fired power plants that can supply about 4 percent of
New England's electric needs are being put on the auction block by
owners sensing a chance to earn top dollar for them.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Management Inc. of North Dartmouth, Mass. said Monday it
has retained Fieldstone Services Corp. to solicit bids for units in
Dartmouth and Dighton, Mass., and Pawtucket, R.I., and for plants
under construction in Tiverton, R.I., and Rumford, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said that based on recent sales and
construction trends, privately held EMI could get upward of $450
million for the plants, whose output totals nearly 840 megawatts,
plus a premium for plants at choice spots on the transmission grid.
General Electric Co. owns half of the Dartmouth and Pawtucket
plants and wants to sell its stakes as well, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One megawatt represents the power demand of 600 to 750
average-size homes.
</P>
<P>
   Electric industry restructuring in Massachusetts and other
states is driving a rapid consolidation of ownership of power
plants, as competitive companies take them over from utilities that
now only carry power to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's early heat wave demonstrated the potential riches to
be made generating electricity locally, as shutdowns at six large
plants drove spot-market prices to 30 times normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, EMI is offering its long-term contracts for
155 million British Thermal Units a day of natural gas, so a buyer
could also choose daily to resell gas instead of generating
electricity if the gas market were stronger. The Bay State gas
market is also being deregulated this fall.
</P>
<P>
   James Gordon, founder and president of 24-year-old EMI, said:
``We think the market environment is right to bring a class of
state-of-the-art assets into the market. We just think the sun, the
moon, and the stars are aligned, and there are a lot of people who
want to be in this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal B. Costello, general counsel of the Competitive Power
Coalition, a generators' group, said to the surprise of some
officials that prices for power plants ``have not bottomed out,''
despite recent deals in which old coal- and oil-powered plants
fetched three or four times book value.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the country slow to join the deregulation
bandwagon, ``This is where the action is'' for companies eager to
get into power generation, Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   The gas-fired, combined-cycle units being sold include
265-megawatt units in Tiverton and Rumford, 68-megawatt units in
Dartmouth and Pawtucket, and a 170-megawatt unit in Dighton. Sales
are not expected to affect jobs at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry sources said modern gas plants like these have
been selling recently for $500,000 to $600,000 per megawatt or
higher, but EMI may get more if buyers are looking for a footprint
for expansion or arbitrage between selling gas and electricity.

LACKING ORDERS, RUSSIANS CANCEL RESUPPLY OF TROOPS IN PRISTINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina _ Russian commanders informed
Western peacekeepers that they intended to resupply their troops at
the Pristina Airport with a convoy from Bosnia Monday. They
prepared to depart, then returned to their basecamp when the
expected orders to proceed to Kosovo did not come.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Nikolai Ignatov, the ranking Russian officer in Bosnia,
said the convoy would consist of 30 soldiers and 15 vehicles
carrying food, fuel and water. Western officers said the troops and
vehicles were assembled at Bijeljima, near where a bridge crosses
the Drima River into Serbia, waited throughout the day Monday, then
returned to their base at Ugljevik.
</P>
<P>
   If the convoy had gone through, it would have represented an
escalation of an already delicate standoff between Russia and NATO
over Russia's role in the peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo. The
crisis in NATO-Russian relations was set off last Friday when 180
Russian troops and 46 vehicles left Bosnia, and took up positions
at the strategically important Pristina Airport, arriving ahead of
the NATO troops. The move surprised NATO, coming just hours after
President Clinton gave assurances that the international
peacekeepers would act in a unified manner to ensure the withdrawal
of Yugoslav forces and help resettle hundreds of thousands of
Kosovar Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The resupply convoy now awaiting orders to enter Kosovo is from
that same Russian contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has ties to the Serbian government and opposed NATO's
11-week bombing war against the Serbs. It has pushed NATO to have
its own sector of control in northeastern Kosovo where most of the
ethnic Serbs live. NATO has refused to allow Russia to operate
independently.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has about 1,300 troops in a Serb-dominated area of
northeast Bosnia, where they perform peacekeeping duties similiar
to those of three dozen other nations who have about 30,000 troops
in other parts of the country. Only the Russians are not under NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Lee Hockman, spokesman for the United Nations-
santioned, NATO-led Stabilization Force for Bosnia (SFOR), said
Ignatov told SFOR officers he had received orders from Moscow to
prepare but no orders to move forward, and decided to return to
base to await instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Hockman said Monday that Ignatov also had informed Major General
Kevin Burns, the NATO commander for the north section of Bosnia, on
Friday, that he had orders from Moscow to deploy a contingent of
200 soldiers in Kosovo to function as an advanced party for a
larger group which was to come from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO was surprised when, two hours later, the troops
departed, Hockman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatov is stressing to Western commanders that his country has
no intentions of pulling out of SFOR, and that the 180 troops
already dispatched to Pristina either would return to Bosnia or be
replaced, Hockmans said, adding that there is no indication that
the remaining 1,100 Russian soldier in Bosnia are doing any out of
the ordinary.

CONCORD, N.H.: was unforgiving.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton may be a drag on the character issue, but, oddly, his
widely acknowledged political skills have also taken a toll on his
vice president. The concern goes beyond vice presidential-itis, an
infectious disease usually caught by standing in the draft of a
commander-in-chief. Most people appear clumsy next to Clinton, and
Gore is no exception. A recent joint engagement in Texas proved
such a disaster for Gore that the campaign is now on high alert to
keep him and his mentor from sharing a stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers say that his difficulty in establishing his own
persona has been aggravated by his running in a vacuum, against
himself rather than against an identifiable opponent with
vulnerabilities to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has Gore been running in a vacuum, but you have the
reflection of Bill Clinton,'' one Gore adviser lamented. ``We're
being compared to the absolute best.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnick, a senior adviser to Clinton, put it a little
differently. ``Gore has been running so far against two perfect
people _ Clinton, whose skills as a candidate are taking on mythic
proportions, and Greta Garbo,'' he said, referring to Bush's
ability to appeal to voters without saying much.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been reluctant so far to acknowledge Bradley,
Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination. But this is
proving harder as Gore finds he still needs to court certain
audiences, including union workers and Iowa Democrats, who are
pleased to have an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're struggling with whether to engage Bradley,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic consultant based in Los Angeles. ``Do you
raise his stature or ignore him and hope he doesn't get traction?
That causes some indecisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides take solace in his strong showing in early polls
testing him against Bradley. But the picture turns darker when Gore
is matched against Bush. Voters know little about Bush, but he
leads Gore in public opinion polls; most recently, a Newsweek
survey had Bush ahead, 54 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By large margins, voters say Bush is more of a leader than Gore,
more inspiring, has a better moral character and is more able to
get things done. The governor polls ahead of the vice president
across every category of voter, most alarmingly among the elderly
and women, two bedrock Democratic constituencies without whom the
Democrats cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats worry that Bush's talk of ``compassionate
conservatism'' will blur the ideological lines and magnify Gore's
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem facing Al Gore is the fact that people see
him as a politician, through and through,'' one Democratic
consultant said. ``It's not that he's not smart or doesn't
understand where America is at.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he had told Gore he was
putting too much emphasis on things like endorsements from elected
officials. ``People see him as more of a politician than he really
is,'' Schumer said. ``But he's a substantive, policy-oriented guy,
and I think that's going to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho also dismisses the personality factor, saying the public
is not looking for ``a drinking buddy'' but someone with
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Al Gore to be Al Gore,'' Coelho said. ``If you start to
let the computer in your head dictate what you should do, then you
lose your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Al Gore's heart, his campaign says, that will be on
display this week.

   &UR; AYN RANDISTS AGAINST COMPASSION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Ayn Rand Institute is in full cry over  &UR; George W. Bush &LR; 's
launch of his official presidential campaign based on the
principles of ``compassionate conservatism.'' The Randists, who
believe in individual enterprise, charge that Bush is following in
the ``timid footsteps'' of his father, whose notion of fighting the
Democrats was to talk about ``a kinder and gentler'' nation.
</P>
<P>
   What that ``compassion'' really means is ``liberalism,'' says
 &UR; Andrew Bernstein  &LR; of the institute, ``a hand-wringing capitulation
to the proponents of the welfare state.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bernstein, ``Bush and the Republican exponents of
this `compassionate conservatism' are frightened appeasers,
scurrying to avoid being labeled heartless for supporting
capitalism and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. They're not only soft, they're also poets. Senator  &UR; Phil &LR; 
 &UR; Gramm &LR; , R-Texas, wrote a poem to invite supporters to a
fund-raising barbecue on July 4. A segment, as quoted in The Hill:
``My heart is full./ I long for you./ I've missed your smile/ and
money, too. ... Just say yes/ and with panache,/ I'll buy the beer/
with your cash.''

longer welcome, says the Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Actress  &UR; Lorraine Bracco  &LR; has filed for bankruptcy, explaining
that she is out of money after a six- or seven-year custody battle
with &UR; Harvey Keitel &LR; , says the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   - Miramax Chairman &UR; Harvey Weinstein  &LR; has been fined $300 for
lighting a cigarette in the bathroom of a Concorde on the way from
New York to London in December. Weinstein told the magistrate that
he was an ``extremely nervous traveler'' and a ``man of good
character, anxious to avoid the stigma of a criminal conviction.''
He also said that Miramax had helped the British film industry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BUILDING TRADES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Watching ``high iron guys'' scampering over the
10-story-or-so-high scaffolding they're building at Pier 30 for the
ESPN X Games,  &UR; Robert Menzimer  &LR; suggests that their agility beats
any that will be demonstrated by the Extreme sportsmen. Scrambling
over the metal framework ``seems a lot scarier to me than bungee
jumping and skateboarding,'' writes Menzimer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Daryl Glen  &LR; says he saw a ``Maximum Occupancy 10'' sign on a
construction-site portable rest room on Pacific Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAUGHING AND ASHAMED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Bathroom humor is in, says the latest Entertainment Weekly,
listing the excess of ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and noting that
even ``The Phantom Menace'' has two scatological jokes (Jar Jar
stepping in excrement, for example).
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of intelligent versus unintelligent comedy is
irrelevant to me,'' says  &UR; Mike &LR;   &UR; Myers &LR; , creator of spy Austin
Powers. ``It's not too stupid as long as it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ted Baehr &LR; , publisher of Movie Guide (which gives ratings for
moral content), has a different view: ``Relying on bathroom humor
over and over is an easy creative crutch that ultimately leads to
an uncivil society. A few flatulence jokes in `Austin Powers' are
innocuous, but the sum total of all that raunchy humor all summer
takes a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people lose sight of is that the net worth of these
ultrawealthy young people is tied up in company stock. You also
can't expect that much from people who are building their first
house and don't even have kids in college yet. By and large, the
fruits of that accumulation will be felt 15, 20 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; William H.  &LR; Gates II, father of billionaire  &UR; Bill Gates &LR;  and
director of his son's foundation, telling Wired magazine why young
millionaires can't be expected to be very charitable.

BUSH VOWS NOT TO PUT FEDERAL-COURT APPOINTEES UP TO A `LITMUS TEST'
ON ABORTION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CASTLE, N.H. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in his first
campaign visit to this important primary state, said Monday that as
president he would not require his federal-court appointees to meet
a ``litmus test'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extended news conference with national media since
leaving home over the weekend, Bush addressed the character issue
by refusing to directly criticize President Clinton's personal
integrity. He also refused to elaborate on his own admittedly
``irresponsible'' youth.
</P>
<P>
   However, he vowed, with his right hand raised, to ``uphold the
dignity of the office'' if he wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has frequently said he opposes abortions, a particularly
sensitive issue in the Republican Party. He recently signed a new
Texas law requiring parents to be notified before the procedure can
be performed on their underage daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has cautioned that ``America is not ready to
overturn Roe vs. Wade because America's heart is not right'' and
that government should pursue policies that discourage abortions.
</P>
<P>
   His answer to the judicial-appointments question may give
ammunition to Republican opponents who insist on a harder
anti-abortion stance, despite a new poll showing that in New
Hampshire, at least, the majority of voters favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush 34 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor
in that new poll, his rivals quickly pounced on his comments about
an abortion test for court appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm hearing right now from the governor is waffling on
the one issue that can clearly explain compassionate
conservatism,'' said candidate Gary Bauer, who last week demanded
that Bush promise to impose an abortion litmus test on Supreme
Court nominees. ``If compassionate conservative means anything, it
has to mean do anything we can to stop the loss of 1.5 million
unborn children every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle said that because his anti-abortion position was
``rooted in conscience rather than politics, those I select for the
most critical positions in government, including my running mate or
nominees to the Supreme Court, will share it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan called Bush's abortion stance ``grossly
inadequate,'' and Steve Forbes said, ``I believe you should appoint
justices on a matter of principle. One of those principles is
belief in the sanctity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said people he considers appointing to courts will share
``my overall philosophy and ... strictly interpret the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That criterion will be applied for all issues across the
board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no litmus test except for whether or not the
judges will strictly interpret the Constitution. I am not a lawyer.
My job is to pick the judges who are qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny New Castle, a coastal town of about 900 residents, was the
Texas governor's first stop in New Hampshire, which in February
holds the nation's first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended an outdoor rally with about 300 supporters under a
tent. He joined his wife, Laura, to read to 25 children in the town
library and shook a lot of hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've waited so long for him to come to New Hampshire,
everybody wants to hold on to his hand and welcome him,'' one
supporter remarked as the governor spent 20 minutes making his way
through the crowd to the tent, greeting dozens of people along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that he was late starting his New Hampshire
campaign, but said his top supporter in the state, U.S. Sen. Judd
Gregg, already had a Bush organization in place. And he promised:
``I'll be back. I'll be back a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll of New Hampshire voters in the Boston Herald on Monday
indicated that Bush already had won strong support. Among
registered New Hampshire voters, Bush had 45 percent compared to 11
percent each for Elizabeth Dole and U.S. Sen. John McCain. The rest
of the GOP field were in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   With those numbers probably in his mind, Forbes challenged Bush
to meet his Republican opponents in five debates between July and
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, the electorate will not only clearly discern where
the candidates stand on issues of the day, but who truly means what
they say, and who will have the Reaganesque strength to carry
through with their promises,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized for his vague stance on many national
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The poll for the Herald and WCVB-TV also showed that two-thirds
of New Hampshire voters favor abortion rights, including half of
New Hampshire Republicans. More than half of New Hampshire's
anti-abortion voters said in the poll conducted last week that they
would vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The children Bush greeted at the New Castle library were in
kindergarten and first and second grade. Bush read from ``The Very
Hungry Caterpillar,'' a picture book designed to help children
learn their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you read more than you watch TV?'' he asked. When
about three-fourths of the children raised their hands, he added,
``Your teachers are doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also spoke to more than 1,000 people at a New Hampshire
Federation of Republican Women luncheon in Manchester, where he
credited New Hampshire with being the ``maker of presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   He also met with firefighters in Bow, attended a fund-raiser for
a Republican congressman in Bedford and visited supporters at a
reception in Goffstown.
</P>
<P>
   In his wide-ranging news conference in New Castle, Bush also:
</P>
<P>
   -- Promised to lay out a plan for cutting federal taxes on ``my
timetable'' later in the campaign. He already has vowed to veto any
increases in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reaffirmed his opposition to racial quotas and preferences,
but said he wanted to expand opportunities for immigrants to
America.
</P>
<P>
   -- Said he was ``concerned'' that the Clinton administration had
negotiated a peace settlement for Kosovo without having a plan for
carrying it out. ``It's important that Kosovo not become
partitioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Said he wanted to develop and deploy an anti-ballistic
missile system because ``it's important to bring certainty to an
uncertain world.``
</P>
<P>
   -- Called for the removal of all barriers to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his promise to usher in the ``responsibility era'' in
America was an attack on Clinton's personal behavior, Bush replied,
``No. I'm talking about an overall cultural phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that people elected to high office should realize
they have taken an oath to ``uphold the dignity of the office to
which we've been elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not take the bait when he was challenged by a New
Hampshire reporter to clarify what he has often called his own
``irresponsible'' behavior when he was younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a game in Washington. It's called `gotcha.' It's a
game where you start a rumor and make a candidate prove a negative,
and I'm not playing the game,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to try to elevate the discourse to ideas and
philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who kicked off his national campaign in Iowa on Saturday,
planned to campaign more in New Hampshire Tuesday and attend
fund-raisers in Boston and Greenwich, Conn., before returning to
Austin, Texas.

   LOWICZ, Poland _ Racing to mend the centuries-old breach between
Orthodox and Roman Catholic believers, Pope John Paul II has turned
Vatican planning upside down and decided to go ahead with a
previously canceled meeting with the head of the Armenian Apostolic
Church in Yerevan after leaving Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who has often spoken of his dream of reconciling the
Eastern and Western Christian churches by the year 2000, had hoped
to build on his historic visit to Romania last month, the first
trip by a pope to a predominantly Orthodox country in almost 1,000
years, by visiting Armenia for three days in July.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans were postponed indefinitely last Friday, when
Karekin I, who leads more than 6 million Armenian Orthodox
believers around the world, sent an envoy to Warsaw to meet the
pope and express his regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Catholicos Karekin, 66, is suffering from throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Father said he was very sorry, and then he asked me,
`What can I do?''' Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, primate of the
Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, who relayed the message
in Warsaw, recalled. ``I told him that the catholicos would be
very, very touched by a personal visit, and the pope replied, `I
should do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, according to the Vatican spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the pope told his entourage, ``I am going to
Yerevan.'' Navarro called the decision, ``unexpected.'' It was the
same morning that the pope slipped and cut his head, requiring
three stitches, while getting ready to leave the Vatican embassy
for a Mass in Sandomierz.
</P>
<P>
   He still wore a bandage Monday at a Mass in Lowicz and a prayer
service in Sosnowiec, but as his change of plans suggests, he has
no desire to slow down. ``The Holy Father was thinking and thinking
and thinking, but we got the news Saturday morning,'' Navarro-Valls
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope decided that he wanted to pay his respects to the
Armenian patriarch, who shares his interest in ecumenical dialogue
and in 1996 went to the Vatican to sign a joint declaration that
formally buried a theological dispute that had divided the two
churches for 1500 years.
</P>
<P>
   Karekin, whose formal title is Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos
of All Armenians, did so over the objections of most of his
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   His eventual successor might not prove as eager to invite the
leader of the world's Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   It could well be the pope's best chance to personally bring his
message of reconciliation _ and powers of persuasion _ to a country
that won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and where
more than 90 percent of its 3 million inhabitants describe
themselves as Orthodox Christians. Armenia has a small Catholic
minority, and also a small number of Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this visit, which also has the character of an ecumenical
pilgrimage, John Paul II wishes to express to Catholicos Karekin
his spiritual closeness in this moment of suffering,''
Navarro-Valls said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans call for the pope to spend an additional night
in Krakow on Thursday, and fly to Yerevan on Friday morning,
returning to Rome the same night.
</P>
<P>
   As the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion,
in A.D. 301, Armenia has a special significance for the pope, as
does his close relationship with Karekin I. But a fruitful meeting
there will not necessarily bring the pope any closer to his
long-awaited goal of visiting Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian Apostolic Church belongs to the Eastern Orthodox
tradition, but it became independent from other Christian churches
in A.D. 451, several centuries before the schism between
Constantinople and Rome in 1054.
</P>
<P>
   It remains independent from the other Orthodox churches, and
while the Armenian patriarch is on good terms with Aleksy II, the
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, he is unlikely to soften
his Russian counterpart on the subject of Catholics. Aleksy II has
steadfastly refused to meet with the pope or invite him to Russia.

 &HT;    Baptists convene in Atlanta for annual meeting
 &HT;    (EDS: 1ST LEDE: Adds Internet information)
 &HT;    By Gayle White and Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Southern Baptists by the thousand convene in the
Georgia Dome today, President Clinton, the nation's top Baptist
layman, is being criticized for his stand on homosexual rights
again.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 official ``messengers'' to the convention and many
more visitors and denominational officials are expected for the
annual gathering of the flock and its dose of praise and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention is going high-tech, making it
possible for Baptists worldwide to watch the two-day annual meeting
live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Headliners from outside the denominational hierarchy include
football star Reggie White, known for his anti-homosexual stance,
and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, best known as founder of the now
defunct Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   Some convention attendees interviewed Tuesday said they looked
forward to the worship and fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   After years of strife for control of the country's largest
Protestant group, the conservatives who now lead it are ``getting
our focus back on reaching the world for Christ,'' said the Rev.
Gary Dean, an evangelist from Fulton, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeff Spooneybarger, whose brother Timothy signed with
the Braves as a pitcher in Orlando last week, said he expected the
greatest achievement of the convention to be ``its spirit of
worship and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   And Trudy Sturgill, a first grade teacher and pastor's wife from
Pineville, Ky., said of her first convention, ``More than anything,
it's spiritually uplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   But SBC leaders in pre-convention events were not about to
ignore a White House proclamation issued June 11 proclaiming this
Gay and Lesbian Pride Month 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist president the Rev. Paige Patterson, speaking on
a denominational radio show Tuesday, called for President Clinton's
home congregation, Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, to
discipline him.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation, said Patterson, is ``entirely inconsistent
with his confession as an evangelical Christian and certainly as a
Southern Baptist.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the proclamation should be ``the subject of
church discipline. The fact that he is President of the United
States ought to make no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proclamation praised ``America's diversity,'' condemns
hate crimes and encourages all Americans to recognize Gay and
Lesbian Pride month and ``observe this month with appropriate
programs, ceremonies, and activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sermon Tuesday to the Southern Baptist pastor's conference,
the Rev. Richard Land, head of the denomination's Ethics and
Religious Liberty Commission and host of the radio show, once again
made reference to the proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what appropriate action is,'' Land said. ``It's praying
that God will stay his judgment on this country until this man is
no longer our president.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Southern Baptist Convention rejected an effort to
deny credentials to Clinton's church because of his stands on
abortion and homosexuality. And last year, the convention voted
down narrowly a move to call on Immanuel to discipline the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wiley Drake, a California pastor and self-described
rabble-rouser, said he will introduce a resolution Tuesday
discouraging Americans from observing Gay Pride month ``other than
to pray for the repentance and salvation of those caught up in this
sinful lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   To see the action live, go to www.namb.net and click on ``Live
Webcast.'' For it to work, you'll need the latest version of
RealPlayer, which can be downloaded off the convention Internet
site.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Patterson, the convention's president, plans to focus the
Southern Baptists on inner-city evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   Senior pastor, the Rev. J. Kie Bowman, of Hyde Park Baptist
Church in Austin, Texas, said for all the media hype that seems to
surround convention activities, Baptists should bear two things in
mind: Resolutions adopted on the floor are not binding on any
Southern Baptist, and the voting messengers cast personal votes of
conscience, not ones that represent their home congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tell our people what to vote,'' Bowman said.

 &HT;    Anderson, Williams no-shows at Falcons camp
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The warm and fuzzy memories of the Falcons' first trip
to the Super Bowl seemed far away Monday when running back Jamal
Anderson and right guard Gene Williams were absent from the first
day of passing camp.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have made it clear that contract concerns are
keeping them at home from the optional-attendance camp _ Anderson
in Salt Lake City and Williams in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, even suggested that he might ask the
team to trade the All-Pro back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent them a letter (Monday) that said unless we have some
sort of show of good faith they were moving forward, Jamal was not
going to attend passing camp,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't hear something that indicates we'll be moving
forward, we may ask that they rekindle (trade) talks. Hopefully, we
can be part of those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, was second in the NFL last season with a
franchise-record 1,846 rushing yards on a league-record 410 carries
and led the Falcons to the Super Bowl and a 16-3 record. He has
4,063 yards in his five-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is scheduled to make $1.6 million in salary this season
plus $1 million in incentives that were earned during the 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials have had little or no discussion about
contract extensions with nine players in the final year of their
contracts, in part because of salary-cap concerns. The Falcons will
have only $400,000 to spend after signing draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Harold Richardon contacted Sims in November
to start talking about Anderson's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, an eight-year veteran, came to Atlanta in 1996 and
started 34 of 35 games the past two seasons. He earned $750,000
last season and is scheduled to make $1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent called them in the middle of last season and asked
about my future,'' Williams said. ``The timetable for an answer
kept getting pushed back and pushed back. I think I'm one of the
best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal didn't get 1,800 yards alone. I know a lot of us are in
the same boat (in terms of contracts about to expire), but a lot of
those guys are getting paid what they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves didn't seem too concerned about the absences of Anderson,
Williams and middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, who is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get bent out of shape,'' Reeves said. ``I'd
like to have everybody here ... but it's not mandatory. I haven't
talked to Jamal, but I thought he was going to be here. He
indicated to (running backs coach) George (Sefcik) he was going to
be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to help (extension talks) one iota if he's
here, nor will it hurt if he's not,'' Reeves said. ``I talked to
Gene (Williams), and he said he thinks (being here) won't help him
get an extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of Atlanta's projected starters are in line to become
unrestricted free agents after next season. The others are Tuggle,
center Robbie Tobeck, wide receiver Terance Mathis, fullback Bob
Christian, defensive ends Lester Archambeau and Chuck Smith,
defensive tackle Shane Dronett and free safety Eugene Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The team's best offer to Anderson calls for a long-term contract
averaging $5.2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wants $10 million or more, in keeping with what several
of the NFL's top backs got with recent extensions. Team officials
don't want to go that much higher than the franchise-record $6
million quarterback Chris Chandler got last fall with his four-year
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt Jamal is one of the top five backs, and
we're willing to pay that,'' Reeves said. ``But he says he wants to
reach up and be top three. Jamal and his agent are looking out for
himself; we've got to look out for the whole organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teammates aren't sure what to think. ``I hope we keep
everything together,'' cornerback Ray Buchanan said, ``because
we've got a good thing going and a chance to start a dynasty. The
salary cap can change all that.

   TO CATALINA ISLAND BY HIGH-SPEED CAT
</P>
<P>
   The voyage between Long Beach, Calif., and Santa Catalina
Island, off the southern California coast, will be reduced by 30
minutes to under an hour with the introduction of a high-speed
ferry scheduled for the end of this month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trip on the new catamaran, operated by Catalina Express,
will take 45 to 50 minutes between Long Beach and the island
village of Avalon, versus 1 hour 15 minutes on a regular ferry.
Only a helicopter ride is faster, taking 15 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new ship, named the Starship Express, can accommodate 300
passengers at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour. The vessel is
designed with computer controls that are supposed to smooth what
can sometimes be a choppy ride. Passengers will be able to choose
between riding in the main cabin or in a deluxe cabin that features
priority boarding and more comfortable furnishings. Round-trip fare
is $38 for the main cabin, $58 deluxe. Reservations are strongly
recommended. Information: (800) 429-4601.

   SUMMER FLOWER SHOWS MULTIPLY IN ENGLAND
</P>
<P>
   Two new flower shows have been added to the British
horticultural calendar, one in London, the other in Cheshire in
northern England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Regent's Park Show, from June 25 to June 28 in the southeast
corner of the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, is a revival of a show
founded by the Royal Botanic Society that flourished throughout the
19th century. The organizers _ the Royal Parks Agency, the Royal
Parks Enterprises and Park Events Limited _ hope to recreate much
of the atmosphere of the original shows with Victorian bandstands
and traditional tents. The centerpiece will be the Grand Floral
Marquee, an enormous tent in which more than 90 of Britain's top
nurseries will exhibit plants ranging from brand-new orchids to
traditional roses. The 10 or 12 show gardens will include a Bronze
Garden, in which all the planting will be in shades of bronze, and
a Ripple Garden, with landscaping that looks like ripples. The show
will also include tours that focus on Regent's Park's trees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $16 if bought in advance, $19 at the door; $8 after
5 p.m.; children 5 to 16, $8. Strawberries and cream and champagne
will be served in a tea garden. Tickets (44-870) 904-0500. Open 10
a.m. to 7.30 p.m., until 6 p.m. June 28.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cheshire show, July 22 to 25, will be held on a 25-acre site
in the heart of Tatton Park, a National Trust property 200 miles
northwest of London. The organizer, the Royal Horticultural
Society, also runs the Chelsea Flower Show and the Hampton Court
Flower Show.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tents housing displays by nurseries and plant
societies, there will be a Heritage tent devoted to horticultural
art, design and conservation, and 29 show gardens. Various
artisans, including a dry-stone waller, a stone carver, a saddler
and a rush weaver, will demonstrate their trades.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $19 in advance, $22 at the gate, children $8.
Advance booking (44-870) 607-7444. Tatton Park is in Knutsford, 10
miles from Manchester. A shuttle bus to the show will operate from
Altrincham station on the Manchester-Cheshire line. Information:
(44-1625) 534400.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY RAISES PRICES; OTHER PARKS FOLLOW
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, Walt Disney World has raised the
price of admission to its Florida theme parks. And once again,
Universal Studios and Sea World are keeping up with the neighbors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On May 23 a one-day, one-park ticket increased by $2, bringing
the price for ages 10 and older to $44, or $46.64 with tax. Tickets
for ages 3 to 9 went up by $1 to $35, or $37.10 with tax. The
attractions affected are Disney's Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom,
Epcot, the Disney-MGM Studios, Sea World Orlando, Universal Studios
and Universal's Islands of Adventure park, which opened on May 28. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Various combination packages are available that offer some
savings. More information about the Universal parks: (800) 711-0080

<P>
   NERO'S STATELY PLEASURE DOME REOPENS
</P>
<P>
   The Domus Aurea, the palace built by the Emperor Nero between
A.D. 64 and 68, is scheduled to reopen to the public on Thursday.
It has been closed since the early 1980's for extensive
renovations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The palace was famous in its time for its size and magnificence,
but members of the Flavian dynasty, who came to power soon after
Nero's suicide in A.D. 68, began to dismantle it as part of a
scheme to wipe out all traces of Nero's tyrannical rule. The
Emperor Vespasian started with the area where one of his own
building projects, the Colosseum, now stands, stripping away marble
and gilded decorations, while the Emperor Trajan filled the
remaining rooms and halls with earth to serve as a foundation for
his baths. This actually helped preserve the palace, which remained
buried for hundreds of years until it was rediscovered in the late
15th century.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance artists were among the first to enter some of the
rooms, through holes bored into the vaults of the halls, and their
autographs can be seen alongside the stuccoed and painted
decorations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Domus Aurea (the name means Golden House) was renowned in
antiquity for the wealth of its decorations, though today many
scholars dispute the claim that the most important rooms were
actually lined with gold and precious jewels. What is certain is
that many of the rooms, 150 of which have been dug up (out of
perhaps 300 or so), were richly embellished with frescoes and
stuccoes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around 30 rooms will be open to the public, but more will be
visible on the sides because now they are well lighted. The visitor
will pass from the gardens of the Colle Oppio, facing the
Colosseum, through 40-foot-high corridors and vast rooms that give
at least some sense of the palace's former glory. The room
dedicated to the Homeric cycle, with its frescoes by Fabullus, for
example, is a rare chance to see the work of this celebrated
artist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of the visit is the octagonal hall, a large room
with a semicircular dome similar to that of the Pantheon, including
the large oculus, or eye, in the center. The Roman historian
Suetonius wrote that the vault was covered by removable and
perforated tiles that rained flower petals upon Nero's dinner
guests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Domus Aurea, on the Colle Oppio next to the Colosseum, will
be open daily from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Visitors will enter in groups
of 25 at 15-minute intervals. Tickets are expected to cost about $7
and can be reserved at (39-06) 481-5576.

OFFICIALS DOUBT SUSPECTED CHINESE SPY WILL EVER FACE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Calif., Tenn., N.J.) (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three months ago, a research mathematician was
dismissed from his job at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory
for security violations. Today federal authorities say it is most
unlikely that the mathematician, who is at the center of the uproar
over the suspected theft of nuclear secrets by China, will ever
face criminal charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the officials are unsure whether the scientist, Wen Ho
Lee, will be accused of any wrongdoing, even though investigators
found in March that he had downloaded thousands of secret codes
used in the design of the most sophisticated American nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain status of the case has infuriated some government
officials and lawmakers, primarily Republicans, who say Lee may be
responsible for the most damaging espionage of the post-Cold-War
era. That conclusion was reinforced last month, when a
congressional panel found that China had used nuclear secrets
stolen from American labs to develop advanced miniature warheads
and a mobile ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher, said his client was an innocent
scientist who had been publicly branded as a spy even though he had
not even been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lee has been unfairly injected into a politically charged
debate over America-China relations and has been subject to
improper leaks in violation of federal law,'' Holscher said.
</P>
<P>
   The extent and nature of evidence against Lee remains obscure.
But a review of the still classified evidence _ including details
about Lee's work, his meetings with Chinese scientists and his
overseas travel _ helps explain why after three years of
investigation, law-enforcement officials acknowledge that they will
probably never learn the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, officials said, the evidence is a mosaic of fact and
conclusions that suggests why counterintelligence cases are
frustrating and often fail to result in prosecutions. These are
some of the points:
</P>
<P>
   _ There are no witnesses who saw Lee engage in espionage.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no evidence of a motive in the form of unexplained
income or a change in his style of life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nor are there indications that Lee, a naturalized American who
was born on Taiwan, was ideologically allied with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even the evidence that a theft occurred is circumstantial.
</P>
<P>
   Still, counterintelligence officials said, they strongly suspect
that China stole the important information data in the mid-'80s.
The loss was apparently not found at the time, when an
investigation might have had the greatest chance of success.
Authorities did not realize that the information had been stolen
until 1995, when suspicions were aroused at the lab in northern New
Mexico by an analysis of Chinese nuclear tests and when the Central
Intelligence Agency obtained a document with esoteric computations
that indicated that Beijing had acquired nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee emerged as a suspect because he was one of the few
researchers in the area that is thought to have been compromised,
computational fluid dynamics. Many people at the Energy Department
were aware of the information. But officials said Lee was the sole
scientist with full access who had also visited Chinese
counterparts in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   From there the evidentiary trail followed a meandering course.
Investigators pieced together an account of Lee's contacts with
Chinese over the years, producing an outline of circumstantial
information. Some of it seemed to raise questions about Lee. Some
of it seemed too speculative to shed significant light on his
activities. And none of it was solid enough to form the basis for
an indictment, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial component is missing. There is no direct evidence
that Lee ever passed or tried to pass on to China any classified
national security information.
</P>
<P>
   Although the evidence is apparently insufficient to prosecute
Lee, the FBI thought that the case against him was compelling
enough to ask the Justice Department in 1997 for permission to
eavesdrop on Lee under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
The law lets the government monitor subjects electronically, not to
assemble evidence of a crime, but to gather intelligence in
national security cases.
</P>
<P>
   The still classified FBI application cited questions about Lee
dating from the early '80s, when he contacted a scientist who had
been ousted from a weapons lab in California after an inquiry into
the theft of secrets about the neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The application, made up of drafts of documents exchanged
between the FBI and the Justice Department, described how Chinese
intelligence differed from espionage by the United States'
traditional adversaries. The Chinese, the document said, usually
seek information from overseas Chinese who are traveling in China
through scientist-to-scientist contacts, a more elusive form of
espionage, because it does not rely on identifiable intelligence
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI request said Lee had failed to disclose the identities
of all the scientists whom he contacted in China on visits in 1986
and 1988. The Energy Department had approved the trips and
authorized his meetings and discussions of nonclassified matters
with Chinese officials. After the trips, Lee and his wife met
American security officials and identified a number of Chinese
scientists whom they had met.
</P>
<P>
   But counterintelligence officials apparently suspected that Lee
might have held back some pertinent information about his
activities during vacations taken after each trip. On the
vacations, the officials said, Lee had undisclosed contacts with
scientists, including one identified as Side Hu, a top official at
an institute of engineering physics involved in nuclear weapons
research. Other officials said the omissions might have been
inadvertent, in light of the numerous contacts that Lee did report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Hu led a delegation of Chinese officials on an official
tour of Los Alamos that the Energy Department had authorized,
documents show. On the visit, Hu spoke privately with Lee and
embraced him in a congratulatory manner.
</P>
<P>
   Later, counterintelligence agents surreptitiously analyzed Lee's
spending and found what they thought might be another puzzle piece.
They found two charges on a credit card at a travel agency while
Lee was in Hong Kong in 1994. One charge was for $100, the other
for $700, enough to pay for what officials said might have been an
airline ticket to China.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senators like Fred Thompson of Tennessee and at least
one Democrat, Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, have expressed
outrage that the Justice Department blocked the FBI request for a
warrant to eavesdrop on Lee, a step that they suggest would have
accelerated the investigation at a critical time, before Lee
realized that he was under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, the Office of Intelligence Policy Review at the
Justice Department found that the evidence was so nebulous and
dated that it refused the FBI request for electronic monitoring.
After a bureau official had questioned the decision, Attorney
General Janet Reno ordered a second review by the Justice
Department, which also found that the bureau had failed to produce
enough evidence to justify the request.
</P>
<P>
   A counterintelligence official who was skeptical of the
application said, ``It was very indirect and inferential, and the
law requires more than mere suspicion, particularly for U.S.
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said bureau officials dropped the issue. For her part,
she said recently, ``I assumed that since I did not hear from the
FBI that the matter had been resolved to their satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, bureau officials said investigators decided to pursue
other avenues. An agent who was posing as a Chinese intelligence
officer approached Lee. The scientist rebuffed an invitation to spy
for Beijing, government officials said, but he did not tell
authorities about the contact until they had approached him to
explain it.

 &HT;    Can the Spurs' Duncan fill Jordan's Nikes?
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ In the frenzy and eagerness to project
``the next Michael Jordan,'' everyone omitted from the list Tim
Duncan, the San Antonio Spurs' center with the demeanor of a
Caribbean hotel valet: pleasant, accommodating and, most
definitely, relaxed. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet now, Duncan is there at the top of the list, very much
Jordan's heir in a couple of compelling ways. One, Duncan is
universally regarded as the best player in the NBA. And, two,
Duncan has led his team, the San Antonio Spurs, to within smelling
distance of the league championship, a Jordan staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he the best player in the NBA,'' New Yorks Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy said, ``but fundamentally, he is so sound in
the way he plays the game. It's not flashy, highlight reel. It's a
coaching clinic. He has a fundamentally sound approach to the game.
It's not an athletic game. To me, from a coach's standpoint, that's
the beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Which also describes Duncan's style. It is not anywhere near the
brilliance of Jordan, tongue-wagging and elevating dunks over
helpless foes early in his career and burying the unfathomable
fadeaways in the later years. Duncan would just as soon stick a
bamboo stick under his finger nail than exhibit flash. ``There's
only one Michael Jordan,'' Duncan said. ``And we won't see
another.''
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right, but the start of his career has been
nothing short of stunning. The Spurs _ winners of 42 of their last
48 games _ take on the Knicks in Game 1 of the NBA Finals beginning
Wednesday night at the Alamodome mostly because of Duncan's
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 21.7 points in the regular season and had a
league-leading 37 double-doubles. In the playoffs, he has led San
Antonio to consecutive sweeps over the Los Angeles Lakers and
Portland Trailblazers with averages of 21.5 points and 10.4
rebounds. In Jordanesque fashion, he's reliable when the Spurs need
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the league,'' exciting and athletic
Knicks forward Marcus Camby said. ``I'm just trying to get where he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Camby and Duncan met in December 1995, when they
were superstar college juniors. Camby of UMass had 17 points 9
rebounds and 3 blocks to Duncan's 9 points (4 for 18 shooting), 12
boards, 4 blocks. And Camby's team won.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since then. ``We were both young, young pups,''
Camby said. ``I remember the hype. We were both high profile. I was
more of a scorer then, getting plays run for me. Right now, it's
definitely different roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's anticipated role of complementary player to perennial
all-star David Robinson changed in Duncan's rookie season, when he
was named to first team All-NBA _and he's only tightened his hold
on Robinson's neighborhood since then. He was first team All-NBA
this season, plus first-team all-defense and an MVP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is surprising to everyone, including the coach who
helped hone his skills in college. Dave Odom of Wake Forest
conceded Monday from his office that even he did not envision
Duncan's rapid ascent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought by his fifth or sixth season, he'd be approaching
this good,'' Odom said. ``In no way did I feel he'd reach this
level in two years. But the thing I'm most proud of is that he
answers the bell every single night to the best of his ability. And
you can't say that too often about the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom said Duncan's development at Wake was far less rapid. ``It
was gradual,'' he said. ``His first college game, we played Alaska
in the Alaska Shootout. We started him at the last minute, and he
had no points and three rebounds. It was a gradual incline in his
growth since then.''
</P>
<P>
   In his sophomore year, Duncan showed Odom all he needed to know
that the player would have a sparkling professional future. In a
game at Wake Forest against North Carolina, Duncan failed to
inbound the ball at the end of a tight game, and the Tar Heels went
on to win in overtime. ``It wasn't his fault,'' Odom recalled,
``but Tim never forgave himself. So a month and a half later, we
play at Chapel Hill. Timmy gets 29 points on 11-for-13 shooting, 21
rebounds and 5 blocked shots. Rasheed Wallace gets no field goals
and three rebounds. We win. And I think that shows you how much he
grew. He never forgot that other game. His determination is
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   And so is his discipline. While other players exercise their
enthusiasm through high-fives, chest bumps, head-shaking and the
like, Duncan simply does his damage and runs down court. The blank
facial expression seldom changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a real sense of pride watching him play, because I see
the presence he's carried to the NBA,'' Odom said. ``He just plays
on. He knows that in the end, his style will win out. And his
willingness to do the right things, make the right plays,
possession by possession is remarkable. He's not flashy. He's not
impressed with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   All he's done is impress others with his uncanny footwork in the
low post, which allows him to maneuver around stronger defenders
and over smaller ones. And when the inside is jammed, no problem.
Duncan, who grew up a swimmer in the Virgin Islands, simply moves
his game to the perimeter, where he's an accurate face-up jump
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on him to do a lot, and he does it,'' guard Avery
Johnsons said. ``And it's all so quite, so effortlessly. It's his
league now.''

 &HT;    NBA Notes: Johnson still questionable for Game 1
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The New York Knicks are not counting on
Larry Johnson for Wednesday night's Game 1 of the NBA Finals
against San Antonio, but they are hopeful. Johnson's showing some
progress in the sprained right knee and he seems determined to be
healthy enough to play with a brace.
</P>
<P>
   His status will not be determined until just prior to the 9 p.m.
gametime. Johnson has spent virtually every minute of every day
since he got hurt Friday in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals
getting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain is pain,'' he said. ``I don't want to rule out Wednesday
or Friday. I'm just going to see what happens, how it feels and go
from there. But it's worse for me to play and not be able to do the
things I'd like to do than sitting out.''
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson either out or limited, the call in New York is for
Marcus Camby to start in his place. Camby has been a major
post-season conributor off the bench. Coach Jeff Van Gundy said he
had not made up his mind about his lineup, but it's likely Camby
will continue in his role as bench spark.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was not concerned about it. ``I'm no star,'' he said.
``I'm just a guy out ther among stars. I don't care who gets the
glory. I just want to get my ring and be a part of a championship
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, because Patrick Ewing is already out with a partially
torn Achilles, the Knicks plan to petition the league to add
another player to their roster. That likely would be forward Ben
Davis, who spent time with the team this season but was not on the
playoff roster. The NBA, however, likely will not grant them
another player.
</P>
<P>
   Super-loud Mario
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio leader Mario Elie, whose verbal lashing of David
Robins, Tim Duncan and Sean Elliott sparked the Spurs' turnaround,
refused to let up. Having won consecutive championships with the
Houston Rockets, Elie knows the virtues of being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the Spurs are overwhelming favorites to become
the first former ABA team to win an NBA championship, and Elie will
not let his team fall prey to overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting here is great, but I'm telling my guys every day, over
and over, we haven't done anything yet,'' Elie said. ``People call
us favorites. I told my guys to do all their shopping now so they
won't be out so much in public listening to all that crap. We've
got a long way to go. You think the Knicks care about being
underdogs? They didn't against Miami or Atlanta or Indiana. Why
would they against us? We're going to have to beat that team, and
we can't do it going into the series feeling comfortable. We have
to maintain an urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The prodigal son
</P>
<P>
   Knicks forward and former Texas Christian star Kurt Thomas, who
missed nearly two years with an ankle injury, said he's glad he
disregarded friends' advice to sign as a free agent with anyone but
the Knicks. ``They said that I wouldn't play, that I wouldn't do
what I wanted,'' Thomas said. ``Now, I'm coming back for the first
time. I'm coming home the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Doctor is in
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's Doc Rivers made his first roster move as coach, and it
was not a pleasant one. He cut former Hawk Dominque Wilkins, with
whom he teammed with in Atlanta during the 1980s. Wilkins played
one season with the Magic but was seldom used by former coach Chuck
Daly.

 &HT;    Stars aging nicely so far
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ When people, including maligned sports fans in
western New York, went searching for evidence that possibly could
tilt the Stanley Cup Finals in favor of the Buffalo Sabres, two
factors stood out: the wizardry of Dominik Hasek and the receding
hairlines on the Dallas Stars' roster.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie hasn't disappointed. But those expecting the Stars to
require walkers by the middle of the series might want to
re-evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which holds a 2-1 lead going into Game 4 of the finals
tonight at Marine Midland Arena, appeared far less weary than the
more youthful Sabres on Saturday, when the teams were playing their
third game in five nights. Further, the Stars have outscored their
four younger playoff opponents _ Edmonton, St. Louis, Colorado,
Buffalo _ 32-16 in the third period and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the advantage lies in younger legs right now,''
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``Before the series, I thought that
was a good theory. But I'm not thinking it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' playoff roster includes 39-year-old Guy Carbonneau,
38-year-old Craig Ludwig and 35-year-olds David Reid, Brian
Skrudland and Pat Verbeek, all of whom have played key roles in the
postseason. Carbonneau played 19 minutes in Game 3, second-most
among Dallas forwards, won a game-high 17 face-offs and helped kill
off eight Stars penalties, blocking three shots.
</P>
<P>
   The secret: ``Vitamins,'' he said. ``Lots and lots of
vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau has played in 205 career playoff games and was on two
Stanley Cup winners in Montreal. He said he was amused when some
projected doom for the aging Stars. ``They've said the same thing
for the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane, a relative pup at 32, said, ``When we lose a game,
our age always seems to come up. When we win, nothing is said about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny when people talk about the age of our hockey
team,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Age is nothing. The age of your
heart is more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common denominator with these veterans is, when they go on
the ice they have an arrogance about them,'' he said. ``It's a
great quality to have. They feel that regardless of their style of
play, their role, they're the best player on the ice. They really
feel they can impact the game in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said his players ``burned out'' in Game 3 after throwing
countless bodychecks early in the game, then extending their shifts
too long. The Stars players often have short shifts of 30 to 40
seconds, and they play four forward lines whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   But having a team of long-time veterans on the roster does have
its problems, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get your wings in coaching in the NHL, you need
to go through the experience of having a veteran team,'' he said.
``There can be a lot of conflicts. Because of their experiences,
they have some strong ideas on which direction we should point the
ship, and guys can get going a hundred different ways.''Jeff

 &HT;    Stanley Cup Notebook: Hull considered 'doubtful' for Game 3
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Not withstanding the standard quota of injury
misinformation that flows from coaches in the playoffs, Dallas
coach Ken Hitchcock continued to express doubt Monday that Brett
Hull would play in tonight's fourth game of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who scored two goals in the first two games of the series,
aggravated a groin pull in Game 3 and did not practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think he's doubtful,'' Hitchcock said.
``Realistically, we might be doing more damage than anticipated if
we put him in there, and I don't think we can take that chance
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull would not speculate on his status, but he did say, ``That
was the funnest practice I had all year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the ice conditions at Marine Midland Arena.
``It's just as bad, if not worse, than Dallas,'' he said, adding
that poor ice and stronger, faster players are the biggest reason
for the increase in injuries in the league.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was dazed by the same check that led to his
exit last game, Hull said, ``No, you couldn't hurt this head.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff labeled Dallas's Joe Nieuwendyk ``the
most dangerous player in the series right now,'' and said he will
make appropriate matchup changes. The Sabres' forward line centered
by Michael Peca, who had been shadowing the Stars' Mike Modano,
probably will open against Nieuwendyk. Ruff also might shuffle some
line combinations to spark some offense, particularly from the
scoreless Miroslav Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, expect the Sabres to skate shorter, stronger shifts,
mimicking the Stars, and not overexert themselves throwing body
checks. ``One thing we did in Game 3 was we went out of our way to
keep hitting, and we wasted a lot of energy,'' Ruff said. ``We want
to finish our checks, but we don't want to be running from one end
of the rink to the other. Then, after 30 seconds, we have three
forwards worn out. We've got to be more under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote/unquote
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, when asked if he was thinking about having to win three
out of four games against Dallas to win the series: ``No. If this
had been a best out of three, then I'd be scared to death.

WILD WILD WANGO TANGO 2 GOES OFF SMOOTHLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The only thing missing from KIIS-FM's Wild Wild
Wango Tango 2 hit parade Saturday at Dodger Stadium was a visit
from Jar Jar Binks.
</P>
<P>
   Binks was beaten to the promotional punch at the 55,000-seat
daylong event by an Austin Powers look-alike who worked the crowd
and posed for photos.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was a lot of time for lollygagging around the
sun-baked stadium seeking out clones of Mike Myers.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank Top 40 station produced a superbly well-run event,
headlined by Ricky Martin in his first Los Angeles appearance since
becoming a mainstream sensation, that got most of the 11 acts on
and off stage with a minimum of fuss or delay.
</P>
<P>
   The largely female audience was clearly pleased with the range
of performers, including sex symbols Martin, Enrique Iglesias and
98 Degrees, along with Britney Spears, Will Smith, M.C. Hammer,
Blondie, Shaggy, Nancy Sinatra, UB40 and Fabrice Morvan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was sort of touching to witness so much female fan
power in one place, reacting with shrieks, tears and blown kisses
to the cute features and sculpted torsos on display.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, pop ruled the roost. Martin lived up to the hype,
delivering a slam-bang set that showed him to be a whirlwind of
eye-catching dance moves and engaging Latin-tinged pop.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with the smash hit ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' Martin kept
the crowd on the far edge of hysteria, offering dynamic versions of
``Shake Your Bon-Bon'' and ``The Cup of Life,'' which he performed
on the Grammy telecast in February, sparking a fascination with the
pop audience that propelled his recent self-titled English-language
debut album to the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   The family-filled crowd also swayed to the sweet teeny-pop
balladry of cute-boy foursome 98 Degrees, decked out in camouflage
pants and bizarre ammo vests revealing crowd-pleasing bare chests.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of us were looking forward to Spears, although the
17-year-old pop queen's uninvolving set turned out to be the day's
biggest disappointment. File this kid under ``one-hit wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly reunited Blondie fared better and eventually got the
crowd dancing at their seats with '80s cuts like ``Call Me'' and
``Rapture,'' plus the recent Euro-hit, ``Maria.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Iglesias performed just one number before returning
backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, booked to promote the forthcoming ``Wild Wild West''
film, mimicked the moves from his videos for ``Men in Black,''
``Goin' to Miami'' and the title track of the new flick, and was
joined by rapper Kool Moe Dee and former partner DJ Jazzy Jeff for
an energetic segment at dusk as anticipation built for Martin's 10
p.m. appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Our only complaint: More variety of food and drink was needed in
the stands. But in the end, a couple of Dodger Dogs, popcorn and
soda went down well with a particularly sweet bill. &QL;

WAITS MAKES UP FOR LOST TIME AT WILTERN SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAMES HAMES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His band already in position, Tom Waits entered
the Wiltern Theatre from the back, coming through the roaring crowd
under spotlights and singing through a bright red megaphone,
mustering the audience like both Billy Sunday and the demon he came
to fight. He climbed on stage, stepped upon a short, dirt-filled
platform, kicking up dust and kicking into ``Black Rider.'' ``So
come on in/ It ain't no sin/take off your skin/and dance around in
your bones.''
</P>
<P>
   And the faithful, waiting 10 years since his last show like
this, were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Making a run through crowd favorites (``I Don't Wanna Grow Up,''
``Jockey Full of Bourbon,'' ``Time'') and a big handful (``Picture
in a Frame,'' ``Eyeball Kid,'' ``Filipino Box Spring Hog,'' ``Come
on Up to the House'') from the recent ``Mule Variations,'' Waits
and band blazed a path through his (and co-writer/wife Kathleen
Brennan's) eight records, an observance of both the bright lights
and shadows of life's carnival. Waits makes a personable guide.
</P>
<P>
   He filled spaces between songs with schtick: anecdotes, bits of
trivia, L.A. stories. Waits' tidbits start out as mostly true but
end elsewhere _ a spider needing a foot rub, Western Avenue leading
to Mecca, L.A.'s one honest mechanic moving to Boston, or did he
say Austin? Waits' voice always sounds as if it's coming through a
megaphone, or to mix some metaphors from his songs, the broken
china voice of rusty brandy stirred with a nail.
</P>
<P>
   His arrangements are also mixed metaphors of sorts. There's that
German dance hall organ with the Pirates of the Caribbean banjo
done as a kind of samba. Add to that snippets of bluesy a capella
inside the orchestrated accidents and the ``what's that buzzing
noise?'' production that make up his sound. It's all very strange
yet vaguely familiar, like a deja vu that belongs to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   And the faithful at Sunday's performance ate it up, screaming
approval for ``16 Shells From a Thirty-Ought Six'' from the pivotal
``Swordfishtrombones'' from '83, to singing along with ``Innocent
When You Dream'' from ``Big Time'' from '87, to laughing at the ad
libs in ``What's He Building?'' from ``Mule Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the crowd just wanted him to kick up some dust.
He did, after a two-encore and two dozen-song show, the stage
around his microphone and his pants were covered in dirt.

WITNESS SAYS HE SAW LEWIS SNIFF `SUBSTANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A former longtime Celtics season-ticketholder said
Monday that he saw Reggie Lewis sniffing ``a shiny white powdered
substance'' in a public restroom at a Saugus pizza parlor a year
before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in the medical malpractice trial stemming from the
Boston Celtics star's death, Ronald J. Marks said he witnessed the
incident by chance, as he entered the men's restroom during a
Celtics charity auction he had attended with his two children in
July 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, 49, said he entered the restroom alone and immediately
observed ``two tall African-American gentlemen,'' one of whom was
holding a ``two-inch plastic vial and miniature spoon with a white
powdered substance'' to the nose of the other man, whom Marks
identified as Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   He could not identify the other man, and he said no one else was
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up against his nostril,'' said Marks, who acknowledged
a 20-year history of drug use dating to 1970, but who said he is
now sober. ``He was sniffing it.''
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, attorneys for Lewis's widow, Donna
Harris-Lewis, who has vehemently denied her husband used drugs,
attacked Marks's credibility, questioning him about his long
history of drug abuse and his long criminal record, which includes
several felony convictions for heroin possession and several
assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, asked by Harris-Lewis's lawyer, Robert G. Harley,
if he considered himself a ``family man,'' Marks replied that he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that accord with you trying to run your wife over with a
car?'' Harley asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was her point of view,'' answered Marks, who has since
divorced, but whose former wife appeared in the courtroom for most
of his testimony, a fact pointed out by a defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, who appeared uncomfortable on the stand, also
acknowledged that his former wife had once accused him of spraying
Lysol in her face, and that she had taken out three restraining
orders against him.
</P>
<P>
   Harley also produced a document suggesting that Marks falsely
told a psychologist in 1995 that he had no prior criminal record.
Marks denied doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Harley also accused Marks of repeatedly dodging efforts by his
law firm to locate and question him prior to the trial. Asked if he
had appeared in a window naked and shouted obscenities when a
private investigator hired by Harley arrived at his house, Marks
acknowleged that he had, but he noted that ``it was 10 p.m. and I
just got out of the bathtub.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks, who said he worked in ``packaging sales,'' said he held
Celtics season tickets from 1981 to 1994, and that he auctioned
them off after declaring bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, jurors were read a deposition from former Celtics
employee Wayne LeBeaux, who said he had smoked marijuana in his
condominium with Lewis and two women at a summer basketball camp in
Maine in the late 1980s or 1990.
</P>
<P>
   LeBeaux, who attorneys said was unable to testify in person,
began working for the team as ballboy in 1979 and rose to become
equipment manager and ``director of travel.'' His job was
terminated in 1997 with the arrival of new management.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also heard from Dr. H. Thomas Aretz, a cardiac
pathologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate
professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School, who said the
cause of Lewis's death could not be determined by scarring found on
his heart during an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Called as an expert witness for the defense, Aretz said scarring
in Lewis's heart was ``not specific enough to say anything about
its specific cause,'' but that it was ``consistent'' with damage
caused by cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Aretz's testimony was intended to weaken the testimony of
Stanley Evans, the state's chief medical examiner, who said Lewis
died because his heart was damaged by a common virus and weakened
by structural defects, and that cocaine use played no role in his
death.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Lewis's scarring had been caused by a virus or by
cocaine, ``I don't think you can say it either way,'' said Aretz.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ordered jurors to
disregard the testimony of former Northeastern University health
director Job Fuchs, who had contradicted himself on the stand
Friday, saying both that Lewis had and had not tested positive for
drugs.

NEW STADIUM COMING TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-SAFECO-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Water drips down the stairways at Safeco Field and dust and
debris still cover other sections of the new stadium, particularly
down the left field line.
</P>
<P>
   With one month to go before the $517 million ballpark opens its
gates on outdoor baseball, those are good signs to Ken Johnsen,
director of the project for the Public Facilities District.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of work to do, but it will come together
overnight,'' he said, whistling comfortably during an energetic
tour of the structure he's managed the past three years. ``There
are just a lot of little things. And they are doing something to
just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The water isn't from a leaking roof or even a rainstorm. It's
from power washers hosing down the sections that are now complete.
And that disheveled look at the west end of the park exists only
because the plans called for the work to begin in right field, home
plate and outside before finishing around the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always worked the project this way, so this is the least
finished part,'' Johnsen said, stepping through the club seat
section in left field and climbing to the suites above, which are
linked to a shared food and beverage area by a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nuts and bolts are already fastened, but some double
shifts are being scheduled to make the final July 15 deadline.
Currently, there are about 750 workers on site, down from a peak of
about 1,000 when major work was being performed on the retractable
roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good, aggressive pace in front of us,'' Johnsen
said, noting that Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix had about 1,000
people working around the clock to finish the stadium in time for
the 1998 inaugural season. ``Everybody who shows up to work
everyday is pumped. You really get high production right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some details and fan amenities that may not be
complete until just before the gates open for the first game.
</P>
<P>
   The counters and kitchen fixtures in concession stands are now
going in, and they all sprout baseball-themed monikers, including
``Hit it Here Cafe,'' and ``Ribbies Barbecue.'' After they are
hooked up, the concession stands have to be inspected and cleared
by the Health Department and the Fire Department before the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concessions and concession hookup are probably the biggest
challenge that we will be absolutely be working on right up to July
15,'' Johnsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the last details to be completed before the
park can be opened:
</P>
<P>
   The screen behind home plate now glares in the sun. It will be
painted black.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 Zenith televisions must be installed in suites,
concession areas, restaurants and media facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Panels one and two of the three-paneled roof have been tested,
but panel three has just been completed and awaits testing.
</P>
<P>
   The lights must be trained on a grid laid out on the field and
approved by Major League Baseball. Each of the 500 lights that ring
the top of the ballpark is being aimed at a specific spot.
</P>
<P>
   Most advertising and sponsorship signs are on site but are not
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Stairwells, seating areas and concourses are being power washed,
and each individual seat has to be checked and cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the unfinished final detail work resulted from
afterthoughts once construction began.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last changes, for example, was to add windows around
the southwest main gate, protecting the rotunda area from the
elements and blocking out gusts coming through the concourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind, when it's cold and rainy, comes from the
southwest,'' Johnsen said. ``The feeling here was that you reach
the inside of the building when you go inside those gates, (so)
let's put some glass up.''
</P>
<P>
   Also yet to be completed is a cable around the upper seating
levels, strung three to four inches above the railings already in
place. Johnsen said that although the railing height met building
codes, concerns were raised that a higher barrier was needed. A
cable was chosen because it didn't disrupt views as much as a full
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept going back to what was the code, but there is a point
where people just don't feel comfortable,'' he said. ``There had
been a enough people who commented that these looked low.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine tuning the stadium is a process that might take several
years, according to Johnsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be places in the building where after you've
operated it for a while, you will have to make some changes,''
Johnsen said. ``I don't know what that is. It depends on the fans'
reaction and how they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is still a month away from opening, Safeco Field
already has hosted a number of tour groups from other stadiums
being constructed, such as groups from Milwaukee, Houston and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming to see us. Right now, this will be the best
ballpark in the world when we're finished,'' Johnsen predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would suffer a postpartum depression once all the
work is finished and the building is turned over to the Mariners,
Johnsen said he would like to return to the stadium with a press
pass just so he could cover every game and continue to spend most
of his time inside Safeco's walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good that it's turning out so well, but it's
not like it's going away once it's finished,'' he said. ``You can
come and visit it for years or bring your kids and your grandkids
here. Not only me, but there are three or four thousand other
people who can say, `I worked on that.'''

MANDELA DIRECTS HIS SUCCESSOR TO THE PRESIDENT'S SEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ Looking solemn in a gray suit and silk
tie, President Nelson Mandela watched South Africa's second
post-apartheid parliament get on with the business of democracy
Monday and choose the man who will replace him as the country's
leader, Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said not a word. But when the voting was finished and
Mbeki had delivered his acceptance speech, Mandela, 80, signaled
the end of his era with the kind of grace that has been his
trademark. He rose from the president's seat and gestured to Mbeki
to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard, Mbeki, 56, who is to be inaugurated on
Wednesday, tried at first to refuse. But Mandela, a much taller
man, straightened to his full height and pointed sternly at the
chair. Finally, Mbeki gave in and slid onto the leather bench with
the official seal as applause filled the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time that a parliament elected by South
Africans of all races had been sworn in here, and there was sense
of celebration throughout the chamber. Parliament members took
their oaths 10 at a time, some carrying shields and dressed in
bright tribal regalia.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a sense, too, that South Africans were old hands
at this. Not all the seats in the spectator gallery were full and
the country scarcely seemed to pay attention, going about business
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's nomination for president was unopposed. The governing
African National Congress won in a landslide this month and
controls 266 of the 400 seats in Parliament. So great is the ANC
margin that laughter erupted when the Chief of the Constitutional
Court, Arthur Chaskalson, asked whether there were other
presidential nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mbeki, hoarse from the flu, paid tribute to the
``masses'' who had propelled the ANC to its second overwhelming
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of us stand tall today, as all of us surely do, it is
only because we are borne aloft by the firm hands of the ordinary
people of our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also referred to the deep poverty and racial divide that
continue to trouble South Africa and promised to focus on improving
delivery and uniting citizens of all races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the problems we face require the greatest possible
unity among ourselves as South Africans so that we use our
collective strength for the benefit of the country,'' Mbeki said.
``And yet all of us are aware that our country continues to be
divided along racial and other lines and is, therefore, that much
more difficult to unite around common objectives. The new
presidency will have to focus on all these matters, in the
interests of the country as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The British-educated Mbeki, who has in effect been running the
country for the last few years as deputy president, is to be
inaugurated in Pretoria, and is expected to name his cabinet on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the election on June 2, the African National Congress won 66
percent of the vote, even more seats in parliament than it did five
years ago, when it first swept to power in South Africa's historic
apartheid-ending election. In that election, the ANC won just under
63 percent of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ANC will again dominate the legislature and
continue to have the power to enact almost any legislation it
wishes, the opposition is likely to be livelier than before.
</P>
<P>
   The New National Party, which as the National Party brought
South Africa apartheid and ruled for more than 40 years, lost most
of its seats in the assembly to the liberal Democratic Party, which
has been a far more vocal and effective critic of government.
</P>
<P>
   Making his maiden speech as the leader of the opposition, Tony
Leon of the Democratic Party congratulated Mbeki and struck a
conciliatory note. He promised that his party would ``stand up to
you whenever necessary, and sit down with you whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He also issued a gentle warning, borrowing lines from one of
Mbeki's favorite poets, W.B. Yeats: ```I have spread my dreams
under your feet. Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches, Mbeki and Mandela walked out of the chamber,
shoulder to shoulder. And, for once looking much like Mandela, the
usually reserved Mbeki stretched to shake hands with everyone in
reach.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Seven years ago, a group of engineering students at
Johns Hopkins University here was given $2,000 and an assignment:
Build a ``smart'' gun, a gun that could be fired only by its owner.
Using off-the-shelf equipment, the students developed a prototype
that, with wires hanging out of it, was neither attractive nor
practical. But it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty,'' recalled Stephen Teret, director of the
Gun Policy and Research Center at the Johns Hopkins School of
Public Health. ``But if three undergrads with $2,000 and no gun
experience could make it, it means others could do the same, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, has not proved to be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the idea of a smart gun _ a gun that could
not be fired accidentally by a child or violently by a criminal who
stole it _ came up, it has come to be seen as a quick fix, cited in
lawsuits and in legislatures by gun-control advocates. So far,
legislation requiring that within five years all new handguns be
smart guns is pending before at least eight statehouses, including
those in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. And lawsuits to
hold gun makers financially responsible for not incorporating
smart-gun technology have been filed by New Orleans and 17 other
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pressure for smart guns grows, it is becoming
increasingly clear that they may not be the simple fix many
proponents think they are. For one thing, no workable smart gun is
in sight, and as with so much in the national gun debate, its
development is mired in disputes, technological problems and even
questions about whether smart guns are, in fact, really a smart
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to smart guns, there's no great fix out there
right now,'' said Joshua Horowitz, a lawyer with the Coalition to
Stop Handgun Violence, a gun-control group in Washington.
``Everyone who has looked at it said there is no quick, feasible
way of doing this. For people like us, there's a question of a
balancing point: Would smart guns increase gun sales or would they
save lives? And, from the industry's perspective, no one wants to
do it until they all have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gun makers welcome smart guns as a marketing opportunity to
improve sagging handgun sales; other gun makers oppose them as a
first step on a slippery slope toward gun control. Some gun-control
advocates say smart guns could cut down on the thousands of deaths
and injuries caused each year by suicide, homicide and
unintentional shootings. Other gun-control advocates oppose them,
saying smart guns could encourage people who might not have guns to
buy them, increasing the risk of handgun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Rifle Association has officially remained
neutral on smart-gun technology, many of its members have lobbied
against it in various legislative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest in smart guns is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy to invent an affordable and reliable smart gun
will be a trillionaire,'' said Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel of
Glock, a gun manufacturer in Smyrna, Ga. ``It's absurd to say we're
hiding this technology. Why would someone be hiding it? They'd be a
wealthy person.''
</P>
<P>
   While the debates continue, efforts are under way in Washington
to get more government money for smart-gun research and
development. The National Institute of Justice, a federal agency,
is working with Colt's Manufacturing Co. to develop a prototype
smart gun for law-enforcement officers. A first test model,
developed with $500,000 in government money, is expected to be
delivered this summer. The goal is to cut the number of police
officers killed with their own weapons by assailants, an average of
six to 10 a year, or 10 percent to 16 percent of all police deaths
in the last decade, government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Police groups are putting their efforts behind a Clinton
administration budget proposal to spend $4 million on smart-gun
technology. Colt's, along with many members of Congress, is also
seeking up to $40 million in federal grants to develop the
technology, and behind-the-scenes lobbying has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has demonstrated a model that is viable in the
marketplace,'' said Steven Sliwa, chief executive of Colt's.
``We've developed some interesting prototypes with the government,
but they haven't shown the durability and reliability needed to be
commercially viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt's lineup of semiautomatic handguns range in price at retail
from about $250 for a .22-caliber target pistol to $813 for its
.45-caliber Combat Commander. The smart-gun technology could add
$300 to $400 to the price of each gun, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the money for research is needed is simple: It is not
easy to make a smart gun. Essentially, a smart gun is a meshing of
a complicated 19th-century mechanical device, the gun, with
delicate and sophisticated computer engineering. Within the
footprint of an existing gun _ with controlled explosions, heavy
percussions and vibrations, dirty residues and high temperatures _
electronics would be embedded that would have to withstand this
high stress. It is like putting a laptop computer into a gun and
then having that computer decide when the gun will work _ and when
it will not. This is more complicated than what electronics in an
automated teller machine, in car dashboards, or even in missiles,
are asked to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, yes, smart guns are a great concept,'' said
Richard Roberts, director of special operations at the
International Union of Police Associations, which favors smart-gun
development. ``But from the street officers' level, they'll want
some real assurance that this baby will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many types of smart guns have been proposed, each with problems.
Some prototypes operate on radio waves that allow a gun to operate
when it receives a signal from an owner's ring, wristband or pin.
But other radio waves can interfere with these signals.
</P>
<P>
   There are also biometric devices like fingerprint or voice
recognition, but those pose problems with accuracy. A report
prepared by Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., on
smart guns concluded, ``It may take a generation of smart-gun
systems to come and go before a smart gun is not only common but is
favored over a nonsmart gun.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, lawsuits calling for smart guns press on. Many suits
against gun makers have been filed by the same lawyers who sued the
auto industry seeking seat belts and airbags. Unlike the carmakers,
with their deep financial resources and large
research-and-development staffs, the gun industry is a collection
of small, marginally profitable companies _ the combined revenues
of all gun makers is only about $2 billion a year. By contrast,
Ford and General Motors each has revenues of over $140 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the industry is simply waiting for the government to
foot the bill. Steven Morton, chief executive of Oxford Micro
Devices, a semiconductor maker in Newtown, Conn., is working on a
fingerprint-activated gun. But he has yet to find a gun maker to
join him in a venture he estimates will take up to two years and
cost at least $5 million in research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun makers tell me they want to wait,'' Morton said. ``They
feel that sooner or later, Congress will put up the money for
research. So they are simply waiting for Congress to pay for
something so they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Mossberg, a vice president at O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, a
gun maker in New Haven, Conn., that is working on a smart gun,
said, ``We'd love to get government funds, but not with strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   As a debate rages in Congress over gun-control legislation _ a
measure focusing on who buys guns and how they are sold _ the
efforts to get more money directed to smart-gun technology are
taking place quietly, out of the spotlight. The important word here
is quiet _ no gunmaker or member of

AFI GUARDS LIST AHEAD OF `100 STARS' SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: ``Tonight'' refers to Tuesday, June 15)  
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What becomes a legend most? If you believe the
American Film Institute, it's being elected to their list of the
top movie stars in cinema history. The results of their
invitation-only poll will be revealed at 8 tonight on the CBS
special ``AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there will be only 50 ``legends'' named on the show,
with appearances by 50 contemporary stars including Dustin Hoffman,
Goldie Hawn, Lynn Redgrave and Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape about the program sent to the press shows James
Woods praising Bette Davis, and Jessica Lange gushing about Marlon
Brando, for example. ``Bette Davis had an extraordinary way of
showing her vulnerability, yet she was incredibly strong as a
person,'' says Woods. Of Brando, Lange says: ``When you watch
Brando in `Streetcar' ... even in his stillness, it's so
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lemmon makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the
show to explain the criteria of who was eligible to be named a
``legend.'' Only those stars whose first on-screen appearance
occurred in or before 1950 _ or who have died, if their debut
occurred after 1950 _ are eligible. This renders Lemmon ineligible,
along with such actors as Clint Eastwood, Paul Newman and, as
Lemmon cracks, ``some guy named Matthau.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is hosted by Ms. Good-Ship-Lollipop (and a nominee)
herself, Shirley Temple Black. ``I think it's very important for
all of us to remember our past with the movie legends of our
time,'' said Black, who rarely makes entertainment-related
appearances these days. ``After all, movies are a mirror of the
time, very often. Sometimes the image is not very attractive in the
mirror. Other times, it's a beautiful or funny picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But what viewers will most want to find out is: Will Jimmy
Stewart beat out Humphrey Bogart? Will James Dean make the cut,
despite his career being cut short? Will famous rivals Bette Davis
and Joan Crawford both rate with voters? You'll have to tune in
tonight to find out, since results of the list are being kept
secret until airtime. The show will be in ``countdown'' format,
with the 25th-ranking male and female star announced, followed by
the 24th and so on.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong clues, however, as to who some of the top
vote-getters are. An ad this week for music and video retailer the
Wherehouse co-promoted the AFI show with special prices on videos.
Among the advertised films: ``All About Eve'' (Bette Davis),
``Rebel Without a Cause'' (James Dean), ``The Maltese Falcon''
(Humphrey Bogart) and ``Spartacus'' (Kirk Douglas). Even John Wayne
and Marilyn Monroe, two hugely popular stars who often haven't
gotten their due from critics, are likely to appear on the AFI
countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Coming one year after AFI's much-hyped and much-critiqued ``100
Years ... 100 Movies'' list, this list is again sure to arouse
controversy. AFI officials claim to be happy and satisfied about
the heated discussion of their list, which, for example, did not
include any of the films of Buster Keaton. They won't reveal how
many people voted among the critics, film executives and artists
that received ballots, other than to say the number was
``comparable'' to the number who voted on last year's poll.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is quantifiable is the exposure AFI has gotten
from the process. The Los Angeles-based organization, like
publications including Entertainment Weekly, has found that lists
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been phenomenal,'' said Jean Picker
Firstenberg, director and CEO of the AFI. ``I think we've
established ourselves as a national educational and cultural
entity. ... We get calls nearly every day now from organizations
around the country wanting to do joint projects with us.''
</P>
<P>
   This is important not only for AFI's stated mission of
``advancing and preserving'' the art of the moving image. It's also
important to the non-profit's bottom line, since it, like a number
of arts organizations, lost funding in the recent National
Endowment for the Arts budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``100 Movies'' special on CBS was a ratings success,
and the network is obviously counting on this special to repeat
that. They're devoting three hours of prime time to the ``100
Stars'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious commercial prospects, Firstenberg emphasizes
that extreme care was taken to keep the list from being ``a
popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a comprehensive appreciation ... you really have to
have time to understand a person's body of work,'' said
Firstenberg, explaining the criteria for the list. ``We decided to
use the half-century mark for our cutoff to make sure we were
considering the context and not just popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Firstenberg hints strongly that this may not be the last list
you'll see from AFI. ``This is a very exciting time, because we're
not only celebrating a century, we're celebrating a millennium,''
says Firstenberg. ``I think there are many different ways to look
at this, because our connection to cinema is so profound ... I
think we'll be seeing more of this type of thing.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL;

The show: ``AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars.'' &QL; 
When: 8 to 11 tonight. &QL; 
Where: KCBS (Channel 2). &QL;

   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ As Yugoslav troops withdraw under NATO
tanks and guns, the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas are
coming down from the mountains and forests to stake their claim to
power.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren, armed KLA soldiers manned checkpoints around the
city on Monday, tolerated, at least for the moment, by NATO
peacekeepers. The rebels have set up a headquarters in Pristina,
Kosovo's capital. KLA checkpoints have sprung up in other Kosovo
towns, including Suva Reka and Kacanic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the rebels seized one of Serbia's largest coal
mines and took control of a Serbian customs office at the border
crossing with Albania, in Morini.
</P>
<P>
   The swift emergence of the KLA as a new power on the ground
poses a delicate problem for the NATO peacekeepers, particularly
because of the growing political support the relatively small and
fractious band of guerrillas commands from Albanians here.
</P>
<P>
   A major purpose of the NATO effort is to end the Serb atrocities
that drove more than one million Albanians from their homes, and
Albanians view NATO as allies of the KLA. But the peacekeepers have
been at pains to stress that they are a neutral force, trying to
protect Serbs as well as Albanians. Under the terms of the peace
accord, the NAT0 forces are charged with demilitarizing the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   While rebel commanders say they are eager to cooperate with NATO
and have promised not to carry out reprisals against Serbs, they
have not given up their weapons in Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours after the bulk of Yugoslav forces and tens of
thousand of Serb civilians packed in buses and private cars left
Prizren to the jeers of the city's Albanians, the KLA appeared on
the streets brandishing its weapons and new-found authority.
</P>
<P>
   `'We are controlling the main part of the city,'' a senior KLA
officer known as Commander Drini told foreign reporters late on
Monday afternoon. `'We contacted KFOR and we agreed we would not
make any incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about the KLA's claim to control most of the city, a
spokesman for the German NATO force here, Maj. Dietmar Jeserich,
said:
</P>
<P>
   `'If they did control Prizren that would worry us. But if it's
just talk about it, it doesn't worry us.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the KLA was savoring its new freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sokol Haziri, a 46-year-old former French teacher, reached the
edge of the city in the darkness on Monday morning, marching in
with 800 other guerrillas from the Kosovo Liberation Army's 124th
Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening he was manning a half-roadblock, half-giddy
celebration in the city's Shkolla-e-Re district, a flower stuck in
his ammunition vest, a Serb incendiary grenade in his hand and his
red-and-black KLA patch with the double-headed eagle safety-pinned
to the sleeve of his camouflage shirt.
</P>
<P>
   A radio was blasting `'The March of the KLA'' and the crowd was
singing along, hugging the soldiers. All over this graceful old
city, ethnic Albanians were streaming into the streets, celebrating
the departure of the Yugoslav forces _ and most of the serb
civilians _ cheering, waving Albanian flags and blaring car horns.
</P>
<P>
   KLA soldiers streamed into the southeastern town of Kacanic on
Monday, embracing and slapping each other on the back on streets
lined with looted homes and shops. Taking control of the local
police station, they hung an Albanian flag where the Yugoslav flag
flew only days ago.
</P>
<P>
   American soldiers reported little tension with the KLA in
Kacaninc. In contrast to Prizen, none of the KLA soldiers in
Kacanic were armed. Hajrush Luma, the 28-year-old deputy commander
of KLA soldiers in the town, said he had received orders to abide
by NATO's request that KLA soldiers not carry weapons. Individual
KLA soldiers said they supported demilitarization, whatever the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need guns anymore,'' said Avni Lika, a 28-year-old
soldier. ``This is an ethnically clean town.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. George Person, a U.S. paratrooper patrolling the town
on foot Sunday night, praised the KLA. ``They've been no trouble at
all,'' he said. ``They seem very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA moved swiftly this weekend to seize control of some
strategic points. On Saturday morning, when NATO forces first
crossed the border from Macedonia, the KLA took over a mine at
Dobre Selo. The mine is a critical link in Kosovo's electrical grid
and was briefly held by the rebels last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the KLA took over what had been the Serbian customs
post at the Morini border crossing to Albania, through which the
bulk of the bedraggled refugees had poured at the end of March and
early April. About 10 to 15 KLA guerrillas were guarding the Morini
station late Sunday, according to Andrea Angeli, spokesman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the wrecked city of Suva Reka, the KLA had set up its own
checkpoints on Monday, manned by bearded guerrillas in black
berets, although there were no people in evidence and little
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Prizren on Monday echoed with chants of the rebels' initials,
UCK in Albanian, pronounced `'Oo-Che-Kah.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Shkolla-e-Re district the guerrillas strutted about in
uniforms and pieces of uniforms, some in camouflage, many in
varying shades of black. One had a lilac in the muzzle of his AK-47
rifle and an unlit cigarette tucked behind his ear under a baseball
cap. People came out to take pictures and videotapes of themselves
with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   `'I am feeling great as an Albanian'' said Hysen Huseni, who
said he had been fighting for a year and a half in the Drenica
region. `'This is the most happiest day of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting under a leafy tree in a walled garden, plates of
strawberries and cherries on a table in front of him and flanked by
an aid in a sleeveless Lakers basketball shirt, Commander Drini
said his men controlled `'the whole part'' of the city except for
the three main roads out, which he said they would leave clear for
the Serbs to depart.
</P>
<P>
   He said his troops would act as a kind of police force in the
initial unsettled period until NATO forces took full control.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's enough in this moment before the full deployment of the
international peacekeepers,'' he said. `'For the present situation,
it is very important to protect against criminals, people who want
to make profit from the situation. As for Serb civilians, the KLA
will not touch them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Commander Drini, who speaks seven languages and wore purple
socks and Adidas mountain running shoes with his camouflage
uniform, readily acknowledged that there had been bursts of gunfire
in the air from his men as the tail of a Serb convoy passed.
</P>
<P>
   `'Yes, there was shooting, it was about 100 people right in
front of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `'I said `OK guys, you have used up half the ammunition,''' he
went on. `'But to see the Albanian flag in the streets of Prizren
after ten years (of Serb rule), it's an emotional experience. What
can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   The commander, whose nom de guerre means `'river'' in tribute to
his love of fishing, said the KLA would disarm if its political
leadership told it to, but implied this might have little real
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   `'What does it mean? We all live here. Sure, I have taken my
fishing stick and gone fishing. But what does it mean to disarm. It
is an Albanian tradition to have one arm with you,'' he said,
slapping his hip like a holster.
</P>
<P>
   `'We couldn't have a worse situation than 1998 to `99,'' he
said. `'Anyway the domination of the Serb forces is over.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what mattered to Haziri, the triumphant rebel.
</P>
<P>
   `'We are very happy,'' he said. `'When we came here the people
were very happy. They think they are safe now from the Serbs.''

MARKET PLACE: THE GOLD RUSH IS NOW TO THE EXITS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean-Marie Eveillard, the portfolio manager of the
Sogen Gold fund, takes heart by recalling a recent comment by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that gold is still the
``ultimate form of payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eveillard said, ``You can't say that about copper and pork
bellies.''
</P>
<P>
   No you can't. But you can't bank on gold anymore, either.
Indeed, in the nearly six years since Eveillard started the gold
fund, it has lost, on average, about 8 percent a year for its
investors. Only the threat of a worsening global financial crisis
last fall stopped Eveillard from liquidating the fund at the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, gold _ once the dependable haven for millions of
worried investors _looks a lot like just another sinking commodity
these days in a world financial system dominated by
inflation-fighting central bankers. Even Swiss bankers, the doyens
of gold, do not push it anymore as part of a properly diversified
portfolio because there are now many more efficient ways to hedge
risk. And a whole generation of investors can only imagine the
glory days when the price of gold cleared $800 an ounce for two
days in January 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point I have to say I think I have been wrong so long
that maybe I am missing something,'' Eveillard admitted
reluctantly. ``Maybe I was just being stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two decades since the price of gold peaked, there
have not been many good seasons for the precious metal. It last
touched $500 an ounce in December 1987, and it has not fetched $400
since April 1996. Its average price for 1998, $294 an ounce, was
the lowest in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 is turning out to be especially harsh and is clearly
trying the patience of even the most devoted gold bugs.
Unfortunately for them, the strongest argument for gold and its
special qualities is that its price is doing exactly what it should
be doing in an environment of low inflation: falling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet gold's real nemeses these days are the world's central
banks, which are likely to control the outlook for some time to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Many central banks are selling or planning to sell portions of
their huge hoards of gold, a looming presence that has driven down
the price by almost 30 percent since the selling announcements by
the banks accelerated in 1997. Central banks controlled about 23
percent of the above-ground stocks of gold at the end of 1998,
according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, a leading precious
metals research firm based in London. They have sold more than
3,100 tons of gold since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they are succeeding in reducing inflation, a
force that has traditionally pushed the price of gold higher.
</P>
<P>
   All this allows speculators to make a pretty safe bet _ that
gold will fall. And they have added to the downward pressure by
selling gold months ahead in the futures market and pocketing easy
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most things are conspiring against gold,'' said Philip
Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors eroding gold's age-old role as a haven against
political or financial disaster has been the opening of financial
markets throughout the world. That means investors in many nations
can put their money in another currency and in foreign stocks and
bonds. In addition, there are many more sophisticated ways to hedge
against risk these days. And often, as happened last year at the
low point of the global financial crisis, buying United States
Treasury securities is as safe as buying gold, and much easier to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The shift has been reflected in gold's recent reactions to world
political and financial crises. Gold managed to top $400 an ounce
when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and again when the United
States and its allies started a land war in January 1991 to force
Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait. But the price plunged again
quickly, even with the threat of a surge in oil prices. Gold did
not budge with the threat this spring of a land war in Kosovo that
could have sucked in most of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And gold could not sustain a rally in any of the big selloffs in
the stock market, either in 1987 or in 1998. In fact, the price of
gold was higher before August 1998 than it was after the Russian
currency devaluation that month and the near-collapse of Long-Term
Capital Management, the giant hedge fund, both of which prompted
the Federal Reserve to engineer three one-quarter-point cuts in
interest rates to calm the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is the Year 2000 computer bug to worry about. But the
fear of a computer crisis as the new millennium begins has
contributed more to the record sale this year of 1.54 million
tenth-of-an-ounce American Eagle gold coins _ favored by millennium
bug alarmists _ than to the price of gold itself. Some analysts
still say gold will spike higher as the year 2000 draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on gold's relationship to inflation, however, is
unlikely to be settled until there is another serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at American Skandia Life
Assurance in Shelton, Conn., says that gold is still the best
barometer of future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that the gold signal is pointing toward zero
inflation and, hence, its price should be easing down,'' he said.
``The gradual elimination of inflation renders gold a poor
investment. That is how it should be. People should be buying
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold has so far failed to react to the latest ado over
inflation. That is surprising, since interest rates have shot
higher this year in part, traders say, because of fear that the
jump in oil prices, a seesaw run-up in other commodity prices and a
rebound in growth in Asia and Latin America will push consumer
inflation to the 2.5 percent range, up from the 1.6 percent
increase in 1998. The Consumer Price Index was up 2.3 percent for
the 12 months through April. But perhaps that is simply too small a
jump to stimulate action in gold.
</P>
<P>
   The worst news this year for gold was the Bank of England's
announcement in early May that it planned to sell 415 metric tons,
or 13.3 million ounces, of its gold bullion over the next several
years. Even the World Gold Council, a trade group that represents
big mining companies, acknowledged that Britain's decision would be
seen as ``further evidence of official disenchantment with gold as
a reserve asset.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 25 metric tons (803,775 ounces) will be sold in July;
other auctions will follow, with the aim of selling 125 tons (4
million ounces) a year. Since the announcement, the price of gold
has plunged 7.8 percent, to $260.35 an ounce, just above the
20-year low of $258.60, reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Britain's big move, which amounts to shedding 58 percent of its
stockpile, came on top of sales already announced over the last
several years by the central banks of Belgium, Argentina, the
Netherlands and the Czech Republic. If it sets off a competition
among central banks to sell before the price falls too much lower,
it will reverberate in the gold market for years.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other major official sellers waiting in the wings.
The Swiss are working on a plan that could result in the eventual
sale of 1,300 tons (41.8 million ounces) of its gold reserves. Part
of the money would go to survivors of the Holocaust and relatives
of the victims. And the International Monetary Fund is considering
selling about 161 tons (5.2 million ounces) of its reserves and
using the proceeds to help the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks are also undermining the price of gold by lending
their reserves to be used in trades that make it easier for gold
producers to sell their product in futures markets.
</P>
<P>
   Given this year's price decline, Eveillard said his Sogen fund,
which makes its bets on gold by buying stocks of gold companies,
may become one of the casualties of the rout. Many gold mines have
already fallen victim, including Bannockburn, Bullabulling and
Mount Morgans in Australia, which have closed, and Canada's Royal
Oak Mines, which has gone into receivership.
</P>
<P>
   Even the apparent good news for the industry _ that it is now
cheaper to produce gold _ is bad for the price. In 1998, according
to Gold Fields, the total cash cost of production fell almost 18
percent, to $206 an ounce. This means there is an incentive to
produce more, only adding to the supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a market with no upside,'' said Bruce L. Cleland, the
chief executive officer of Campbell &AMP; Co. in Baltimore, a money
manager that deals in foreign exchange and financial and commodity
futures, including a tiny bit of gold. As an unapologetic gold
bear, he believes that gold ``has been essentially demonetized by
the modern financial economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph F. Ippolito, a registered investment adviser in
Malvern, Pa., feels differently.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying gold stocks in 1969 and until recently had 10
percent to 15 percent of his portfolio in two gold mining
companies, TVX Gold Inc. and the Bema Gold Corp., and one gold
mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in the price of gold has cut that share quite a bit.
TVX is now worth just under a $1 while Bema Gold is trading at 63
cents a share _ both less than a quarter of the value of their 1998
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for him, he said, ``hope springs eternal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying in good health,'' Ippolito, 61, added. ``I intend
to be around. Sooner or later there will be a traditional world
crisis and gold will respond.''

 &HT;    Bush promises no litmus test for judges on abortion issueBy
Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CASTLE, N.H. _ On the third day of his newly-minted
presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush said Monday he would not
use abortion as a ``litmus test'' for appointing federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no litmus test, except for whether a judge will
strictly interpret the Constitution,'' said Bush, who believes
abortion should be banned except in cases of rape, incest or
pregnancies that threaten the woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   At the first news conference since he announced his candidacy
Saturday, Bush said he would appoint judges who share his overall
philosophy and would not use the bench to make law.
</P>
<P>
   The comments put Bush in line for further heat from GOP
presidential contenders who targeted him several months ago when he
said he favors a constitutional amendment banning abortion but does
not think it's worth pursuing because it could not win voter
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If compassionate conservative means anything, it has to mean
do anything we can to stop the loss of 1.5 million unborn children
every year,'' said GOP hopeful Gary Bauer, a former Reagan
administration education official who is striving to make himself
the most strident anti-abortion candidate in the GOP race.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as Bush was announcing his candidacy in Iowa,
Bauer, also in Iowa, challenged Bush to join him in vowing to
appoint only judges who oppose abortion rights. Bauer said the
country's next president could have two or three appointments to
the Supreme Court that could ``shift the balance of power toward
the pro-life side.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, never the darling of social conservatives though he aligns
with them on most issues, addressed the challenge during a foggy
oceanside news conference, attended by about 200 reporters, during
his first swing through the state with the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would nominate Supreme Court judges based on three
criteria: Judicial temperament and ``do the judges share my overall
philosophy and will the judges strictly interpret the Constitution
as opposed to using the bench to legislate?''
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP presidential contenders pronounced Bush's position not
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is ``a yes on an anti-abortion litmus test,''
according to spokesman Bob Adams. New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith has
pledged ``only to nominate pro-life justices for the Supreme
Court,'' spokeswoman Karen Hickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said, ``I believe you should appoint justices on
matter of principle. One of those principles is belief in the
sanctity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle said that because his
anti-abortion position was ``rooted in conscience rather than
politics, those I select for the most critical positions in
government, including my running mate or nominees to the Supreme
Court, will share it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Elizabeth Dole, who shares Bush's opposition to
abortion but believes that the nation is not ready for a
constitutional amendment banning it, declined to clearly state
whether she would make abortion a litmus test for judicial
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be one of the many issues she considers when she
appoints the most qualified judges,'' said Ari Fleischer, adding
that Bush's comments will cost him support among ``the
right-to-life vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning of the challenges (Bush) is going
to face as he defines himself,'' Fleischer said. ``Nobody knows
what he stands for right now. He is very popular, and his
popularity is thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared relaxed and confident as he answered questions on
a variety of topics for about 20 minutes. He said he'd boost
defense spending and build an anti-ballistic missile defense
system, and he promised to oppose increases in personal or
corporate income taxes. He said a detailed plan for simplifying the
tax code and lowering marginal tax rates is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The tax issue caused him some trouble last week in anti-tax New
Hampshire, when he appeared to waffle on a pledge not raise taxes.
After a Bush spokeswoman said he wouldn't sign an anti-tax pledge
signed by his GOP rivals, he reversed course and sent a letter to
the head of Americans for Tax Reform that was identical to the
formal pledge. He said Monday that the letter was, ``in essence,
taking the famous New Hampshire pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also discussed racial preferences, reiterating his
opposition to racial quotas and his support for what he calls
``affirmative access.'' As an example, he cited the Texas law that
guarantees state university admission to the top 10 percent of
students in every Texas high school. The law was adopted in the
wake of the Hopwood decision banning consideration of race in
university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dodged a question on whether he believes President Clinton
epitomizes the ``if it feels good, do it'' philosophy he often
criticizes, saying only that ``when I put my hand on the Bible, I
will swear to uphold the dignity of the office.'' As he has in the
past, Bush declined to be specific about what he has described as
an ``irresponsible'' youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a game in Washington called 'gotcha.' You float a
rumor and make candidates prove a negative. I will not play that
game,'' Bush said. ``I made mistakes 20, 30 years ago, but I
learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor will be offering
up his life story in an autobiography written by Houston Chronicle
sports columnist Mickey Herskowitz, who has chronicled the lives
late baseball great Mickey Mantle, University of Alabama football
coach Bear Bryant and former Texas Gov. John Connally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor knew that other writers had decided to do
biographies even though he discouraged it,'' Tucker said. ``He
wanted to make sure there was one that was done right, so he
decided to cooperate with one person for one biography.''

WAL-MART ENTERS BRITISH MARKET WITH $10.8 BILLION PURCHASE OF ASDA
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In its first foray into Britain, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
agreed Monday to pay $10.8 billion in cash for Asda Group PLC,
Britain's third-largest supermarket chain, thwarting a rival suitor
at the last moment and threatening other British retailers with a
potentially devastating price war.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover agreement, equivalent to 220 pence, or about $1.36,
a share, is part of Wal-Mart's aggressive buying spree in Europe,
where tight zoning regulations make it almost impossible to build
big, new stores, leaving entrants into the businesses of
supermarkets and large mass convenience stores known as
hypermarkets no option but to acquire existing chains.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's move came days before Asda, the dominant low-cost
discount market in Britain, had been set to conclude a $9.6 billion
all-stock deal announced April 16 with Kingfisher PLC, Britain's
sixth-largest retailer, which valued the company at 198 pence a
share. Kingfisher said Monday that it would not sweeten its offer,
but left it formally on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The bid by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, follows its
acquisitions in Germany, where it bought the Wertkauf chain in 1997
and the Spar Handels hypermarket chain last year, seeking to unlock
new growth in Europe as the United States market becomes saturated.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Britain's supermarket chains, Asda offers the most
obvious fit to Wal-Mart. Its 229 British stores are generally 50
percent bigger than those of its competitors, it works on low
margins and sells a wide range of discounted, general goods. Last
year, Asda earned 317 million pounds, or about $512 million, on
sales of 9.8 billion pounds. ``We are dealing with Asda as a
company that is very similar to ours in culture,'' said Donald
Soderquist, senior vice chairman of Wal-Mart, which is based in
Bentonville, Ark. He acknowledged that the Kingfisher-Asda deal had
spurred Wal-Mart's bid: ``From time to time in the past, we've held
talks, but not about an offer. The Kingfisher merger created the
opportunity to look at it and become serious about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Leighton, Asda's chief executive, said: ``The way we
operate is based mainly on ideas we pinched from Wal-Mart. So from
a colleague point of view, this is pretty much the perfect deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bid sent Asda stock up 19 percent to match and even exceed
the bid price, reaching as high as 222.5 pence before falling back
to 218 pence. Wal-Mart shares rose 18.75 cents, to $42.875, in the
United States. But Kingfisher shares slumped 45 pence, to 791
pence. And other British retail stocks fell back sharply amid
worries that in Britain's already troubled supermarket business
Wal-Mart would cut prices at Asda to strengthen the chain's share
of the market. That would threaten other household-name stores like
Tesco, Sainsbury and Safeway, which would have to cut their prices
to stay competitive. ``They'll be nervous and wait to see what
happens,'' said Richard Perks, a retail analyst with Corporate
Intelligence, a consulting firm. ``The one thing they can't do is
try to knock Wal-Mart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in J. Sainsbury PLC fell 18.5 pence, to 372 pence, and
Tesco PLC stock dropped 12.75 pence, to 178 pence. But Safeway PLC
stock rose 7.5 pence, to 252.25 pence, after a newspaper report
that it was being courted by the Kroger Co., the United States
supermarket chain, and the investment bank Blackstone Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart acquisition did not come as a total surprise. Even
at the time of the Kingfisher-Asda deal, analysts depicted the
proposed merger as a defensive ploy to thwart Wal-Mart's European
ambitions. A combination of the two British entities would create
the country's biggest retailer and a platform for expansion into
Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, though, has unraveled with remarkable speed. Asda
executives said Wal-Mart approached Asda just two weeks ago and the
agreement announced today came only days before the Asda-Kingfisher
deal was due for completion.
</P>
<P>
   The British acquisition, however, would still leave Wal-Mart
considerably short of a commanding position in the European market
that would enable it to squeeze concessions out of suppliers.
``They have a huge way to go,'' said Perks at Corporate
Intelligence, echoing the views of other analysts. ``In the U.K.
they bought a business. In Germany we are going to see them create
a business.'' And, because of strict European zoning laws, he said,
``if Wal-Mart wants to expand elsewhere in Europe, it's going to
have to do so through acquisitions.''

BURNS FROM TEAPOT HANDLE MIGHT HAMPER DUVAL IN OPEN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ David Duval confirmed Monday that he would
play in the U.S. Open despite burning his hand on a pot handle last
Friday. But Duval said he might be hampered by lingering blisters
on his right thumb and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   Duval worked on his putting Monday on the practice green at
Pinehurst Resort and Country Club's No. 2 course, but he will not
play a practice round until Tuesday. He wants to give his injury
more time to heal, but as world's No. 1-ranked player, he is also
running out of days left before Thursday's opening round. He still
has a nasty-looking blister about the size of a dime on his right
thumb and a smaller blister near the top of his right forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it has been disruptive,'' Duval said of his
freakish accident in picking up a teapot at his home in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fla. ``I was supposed to be here three days ago, and I
haven't even had a chance to hit balls. There's no pain now, but
there probably will be tomorrow when the blisters break and it gets
down to raw skin. But even that's speculation. I don't know what's
going to happen. I'm just trying to let them be as good as they can
for as long as they can, let it heal, then go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, almost everyone who approached Duval Monday inquired
about his injury. After shaking hands with Duval, Jim Furyk looked
at Duval's hand and made a face. ``Yikes,'' said Furyk, shaking his
head when he looked at the swollen blisters.
</P>
<P>
   Before his injury, Duval was on almost everyone's list of
favorites for the year's second major, along with Tiger Woods, who
has won his last two tournaments. Now, Duval is unsure if he will
be 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is considering wearing a glove on his right hand to
protect his fingers, but he is worried that it may feel too
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would make an awfully big change in feel,'' Duval
said. ``A lot depends on how it feels when the blisters pop. That's
when I'm really going to have to pay attention to making sure
they're clean, putting antibiotics on them and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt cheated after sustaining an injury at such an
inopportune time, Duval said: ``I'm just generally not happy about
it. But I don't think, `Why now?' It's just one more thing I've got
to overcome. Sort of like a double bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duval guaranteed that he would make his 7:30 a.m. tee time
Thursday, regardless of the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might shoot 90,'' he said, ``but I'll be playing.''
</P>

PRACTICAL TRAVELER: HOTEL PHONE BILL CAN BE A SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 20)  
(ms) 
 By BETSY WADE c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hotel telephone fees are starting to climb again. Although phone
fees vary widely from hotel to hotel, they have become one of the
three areas where hotels are seeking bigger profits, along with
in-room safes and valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   It is often a saving to use a cell phone instead of the hotel
phone for access to a much cheaper regular carrier. It is not
unusual for a hotel or resort to put a surcharge of 50 cents or $1
on an 800-number call, which is the way many guests reach their own
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for using hotel-room phones have traced peaks and valleys
in the last 10 years. A peak came in the 80s when hotels sold their
phone services to the highest bidders among ``alternate operator
services'' and guests were surprised by outlandish bills, as much
as twice the actual cost.
</P>
<P>
   A valley came with regulations that guests be warned of such
surcharges. People began using phone credit cards, circumventing
the hotel's supplier. Many hotels and phone companies, especially
those that put pay phones in remote areas, countered by blocking
calls to the access codes of rival carriers.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in hotel phone surcharges followed Federal rulings
forbidding blocked access. This rule phased in slowly, with a final
deadline of 1997 for hotels reporting it would cost more than $15 a
phone to remove the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   When calls to discount access numbers beginning 10-XXX (these
typically now start 10-10) were first blocked, all carriers began
to offer 800 and 888 numbers as alternatives. As a result of the
anti-blocking rules and the new access routes, the Federal
Communications Commission says that complaints about blocked access
have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But hotel companies are permitted to put surcharges on calls to
800 numbers, providing they are applied equally to all 800 numbers.
And that is happening now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New technology is begetting the current situation. Hotels say
they charge for 800 numbers because guests frequently use these to
get on the Web, and once on, stay on. Kevin Maher, the legislative
representative for the American Hotel and Motel Association in
Washington, said members report that guests register, plug in their
modem lines and leave them in until they check out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ties up phone lines for hours,'' he said, ``and a hotel
has a limited number of lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken McEldowney of Consumer Action in San Francisco, which for
some years has campaigned against unreasonable phone charges, said
he had received few complaints about surcharges for 800 calls or
for long calls. He said a reason might be that business travelers
were the ones using the Web and e-mail most frequently and that the
charges were absorbed as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   No one is likely to select a hotel on the basis of its phone
fees. But a brief look at some hotels' charges indicates the range.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the FCC required that phone customers be able to
learn in advance what a call is likely to cost, either through a
sign on the phone or by dialing a code. The smartest approach is to
ask the hotel, or the hotel operator, what its charges are before
making a potentially expensive call.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Hotels are among those with new charges. Jeanne K. Datz,
director of communications, said that they were put in place a year
ago. The price of a local call from a room is linked to prices in
the area, she said, with 75 cents or $1 for the initial connection.
After 30 minutes, she said, a charge of 10 cents a minute is added.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to 800 numbers under 30 minutes are free, and beyond that
they cost 10 cents a minute, too. Operator-dialed long-distance
calls are charged at the AT&AMP;T day rate, plus 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Datz said that Hilton was putting in high-speed access lines
for computer use as it renovated hotels. These should be in 130 of
the 300 domestic Hiltons by the end of the year, the company said.
Their use will cost $9.95 for each 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Maher of the hotel association said various other companies are
following Hilton's steps _ charges for long calls and supplemental
high-speed lines.
</P>
<P>
   At Westin Hotels and Resorts, phone charges can vary, but Sandra
Merkin, director of public relations, said there are no surcharges
for lengthy calls. Local calls cost 50 cents to $1, and 800 and
credit-card calls carry no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   But direct-dial long-distance is charged an operator-assistance
fee of $2.12, plus $1 to $1.50 a minute, plus the AT&AMP;T daytime
rate. So a two-minute long-distance call that would be, say, 50
cents from home would cost at least $4.62 at a Westin.
</P>
<P>
   Westin has ``guest office'' rooms, with free local calls and no
surcharges on an in-room fax-printer-copy machine. These cost $20
above regular rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wingate Inns, part of the Cendant franchising company, has 60
hotels, all less than three years old. Jim Ferri, a spokesman for
Cendant, said that these were built with T-1 high-speed access
lines to the Web, and that there was no charge for their use. At
Wingate, all local calls and 800 calls are free.
</P>
<P>
   Knights Inns, another Cendant division, provides free local
calls to members of its frequent-guest plan. There is no charge for
800-number calls, Ferri said; regional calls are billed at the
phone company rate, but Knights Inns are free to put surcharges on
credit-card calls.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Hotels and Resorts also says it does not dictate phone
policies for its franchises: Inter-Continental, Crowne Plaza,
Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express and Staybridge.
</P>
<P>
   At the 10 Inter-Continentals in the United States and Canada,
according to Melanie Brandman of Bass, the local market affects
charges, but the maximum is $1 for 800-number, local and
operator-assisted calls.
</P>
<P>
   At Holiday Inns, 800 numbers are free, and Bass recommends that
local calls also be free. Operator-assisted access calls are free.
Bass recommends that direct-dial long-distance calls carry only a
``marginal'' markup over AT&AMP;T rates.
</P>
<P>
   At all types of Marriotts, according to Gordon Lamborne, a
spokesman, there are no access charges for calls to 800 numbers, or
for credit-card or calling-card calls. For local calls, he said,
there may be a fee _ 75 cents on average. When a modem or laptop is
used to make a direct-dial call, he said, the charge is 40 to 50
percent above the regular tolls.
</P>
<P>
   What travelers are facing can be seen in a reader's phone bill
from the Cliff Lodge at the Snowbird Resort in Utah. It listed 28
phone calls to an 800 number _ a call that costs the hotel nothing
_ as ``long distance'' at 50 cents each, $14 total.
</P>
<P>
   Another business traveler said that she was billed $1 each for
800-number calls at a hotel in California that she would not
identify. When she protested, she said, the charges were expunged.
</P>
<P>
   This case should serve as a reminder to hotel guests who like to
check out from their rooms using a television-computer system that
they may miss some charges that they might want to protest.

EPA UNVEILS SMALLER PLAN TO CUT SMOG IN NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Pa., N.J., Del., Ind., Ky., Md., Mich., N.C.,
Ohio, W.Va., Va.) (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stymied by two court rulings setting aside clean
air standards, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that
it had a new way to force power plants in 12 states to cut
pollutants that contribute to smog in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The approach relies on petitions by four states _ New York,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Connecticut _ saying that no matter
what they did within their borders they could not meet older smog
standards, because too much pollution blew in from other states.
</P>
<P>
   Using that argument, the agency said it could force plants in 12
states to reduce their output of nitrogen oxides by about 60
percent of what the agency had sought. Ten other states targeted by
the standards that are now in limbo would not be affected by the
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northeast has been waiting a long time for these pollution
reductions,'' EPA Administrator Carol Browner said Monday in a
meeting with reporters. ``We had a path to get us there, a sensible
path. The courts robbed us of that opportunity, but we're not
giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for utility and coal industries, which won the last
round in court, said they would also file legal challenges to the
new approach.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia ordered the agency to reconsider its new clean air
standards, which set potentially stricter ozone limits. The agency
had planned to use those standards to control pollution that is
blown into the Northeast where it contributes to smog, but in a
second ruling the court said it could not do so.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions that the agency said Monday it would use to do
that job were filed under an older standard that is still intact.
It sets a one-hour peak limit for smog, while the rejected standard
would have set limits over eight-hour periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a procedural chess move,'' said Frank O'Donnell,
executive director of the Clean Air Trust, a nonprofit lobbying
group that supports the stricter standards that the court blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania and Massachusetts also brought petitions that the
agency will use. The petitions were filed in 1997 but the agency
set them aside, preferring to use a 22-state plan that said that
reductions were required under its new eight-hour rule. Using that
tool, the EPA had asked the states to specify how they would reduce
nitrogen oxides, giving them a choice of targets, including cement
kilns, large internal combustion engines in stationary
applications, large industrial boilers and large utility boilers.
Enforcing petitions instead will give the states less flexibility,
Browner said, because New York's petition, for example, identifies
individual power plants by name.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and trucks are another major source of nitrogen oxides but
the strategy to control cars is now set uniformly for most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions target 717,000 tons of nitrogen oxides a year in
the 12 states; the EPA had originally sought to get 1.1 million
tons from 22 states. The 717,000 tons comes to about 5 percent of
all nitrogen oxide emissions from the states, according to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Pennsylvania portray themselves as victims in their
petitions, but they are among the states that other petitioners
list as being part of the problem. The other states where the EPA
will demand reductions are are New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Several other states also filed petitions, but those were based
on the eight-hour standard, which is now in limbo. Other states
could also file under the one-hour standard, Browner said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said that although she expected the court decisions to
be overturned in a year or two, that would still delay compliance
by that amount of time. She said the new strategy will keep some
reductions within the previous schedule seeking compliance by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court raised several objections to the EPA's
standard, including that Congress had given the agency too much
leeway in setting standards and that the agency had failed to
justify its decisions. The court also blocked a new standard on
fine soot, but soot was not part of Monday's action by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Mining Association, Quinlan Shea, a lawyer, said
that his group had already challenged whether the petition process
was legal under the Clean Air Act, but that the question had been
set aside when it looked like the EPA would issue an order to 22
states on its own. Now the challenge will be revived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry will perceive this as an effort by EPA to continue to
game the process,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner, asked if she expected a court challenge, said: ``This
is the EPA. We will definitely be sued.''

 &HT;    No cover on gun control votes
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House will vote separately on a series of gun
control proposals, scuttling an earlier plan to vote on the
measures as part of a juvenile crime bill, Republican leaders said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest procedural move reflects the continued uncertainty
and confusion within Republican ranks over how they should handle
the most controversial elements of proposed gun restrictions, the
first the House has considered since banning assault weapons in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders claimed that separating out the gun control
provisions would provide a more honest and straightforward debate
when the House takes up the juvenile crime measure either Wednesday
or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats immediately denounced the move as a ploy to make
it more difficult for some members to vote for gun control. Rep.
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House minority leader, said it was
easier for some members to vote for the 1994 assault weapons ban
because it was included in a larger crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring members to vote exclusively on gun control this time
around will make those votes politically more difficult, Gephardt
said. ``They don't want anybody to have any excuse to vote for this
bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a board member of the National Rifle
Association and a fierce opponent of any gun control, said he was
pleased with the move. He said he hoped it would make it easier to
defeat the measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more intellectually honest and appropriate thing to
do,'' Barr said. On Monday, Barr sought permission from the House
Rules Committee to offer amendments deleting any gun control
language from the juvenile crime bill sent to the House floor for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under the framework outlined by GOP leaders, the House will
consider dozens of amendments relating to gun control, both for and
against, as part of the debate on a proposal to require criminal
background checks for guns bought at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more popular gun provisions, such as preventing
violent juveniles from ever owning a gun and requiring trigger
locks to be sold with guns, were deleted from the original juvenile
crime bill and given to politically vulnerable GOP members to offer
as amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif.), for example, considered by many
analysts to be among the most vulnerable GOP incumbents, will offer
the amendment to prohibit violent juveniles from owning guns.
</P>
<P>
   The gun show language in the latest GOP bill would require
anyone purchasing a gun at a gun show to submit to a criminal
background check. Currently 20 percent to 40 percent of such sales
are exempted because there is no requirement that unlicensed
dealers at gun shows conduct the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charge that the House version would be much weaker
than a similar bill passed by the Senate, and they plan to offer a
substitute that mirrors the Senate language.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of six Democrats, four of whom represent rural
Southern districts, also will offer an amendment to weaken the
House gun show language even further. The amendment, drafted by
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), would require the background checks to
be completed in 24 hours instead of 72, and it would allow
out-of-state gun dealers to transfer guns to in-state dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The House also will consider a second bill that deals
exclusively with developing new punishments and incarceration
guidelines for juveniles. Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, plans to offer an amendment to this bill that
would prohibit the distribution of violent and obscene material to
juveniles. Hyde's bill also would require music CD and video
sellers to make copies of song lyrics available. Separately, Rep.
Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) will offer a sweeping amendment to establish
mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles and make it easier for
prosecutors to try juveniles as adults.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Republicans leaders were moving on a track to
consider one massive bill. House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)
and Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-Calif.) informed
Democrats of the change in tactics from on mid-day Monday.

FED CHIEF SAYS NEW-AGE ECONOMY CAN HAVE OLD PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
warned Monday that increases in business efficiency could not
counterbalance the strains on the economy forever.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a congressional committee, Greenspan revisited
his favorite theme of the last few years, that huge investments in
technology are yielding substantial gains in productivity, or
output for every hour worked, a fundamental and far-reaching
improvement in the way the economy functions.
</P>
<P>
   But without directly addressing the growing consensus that the
central bank will raise interest rates as soon as the end of this
month, Greenspan cautioned against counting on technology as a
miracle cure for inflation or a rationale for ever-higher stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of growth of productivity cannot increase
indefinitely,'' he told the first of three days of hearings held by
the Joint Economic Committee on the role of technology in the
economy. ``While there appears to be considerable expectation in
the business community, and possibly Wall Street, that the
productivity acceleration has not yet peaked, experience advises
caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been an advocate of the view that technology has
helped improve the economy's ability to grow without inflation, but
he has been distancing himself in recent months from the notion of
a ``new economy'' in which inflation is no longer a threat. As he
did in a speech last month, he noted Monday that ``history is
strewn'' with miscalculations about technology developments and
that policy makers had to be modest about their ability to predict
technology's effects.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of his remarks was in line with that of other Fed
officials over the last month in making clear that the central bank
increasingly sees early signs of problems brewing in an economy
that has enjoyed a remarkable run of growth.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave no clear indication of whether the central bank had
enough evidence of resurgent inflation to nudge interest rates
higher at its next policy meeting, on June 29 and 30. As a result,
his comments had little effect in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and investors expect Greenspan to provide a
relatively unambiguous signal about his intentions when he
testifies about monetary policy before the committee on Thursday, a
day after the government releases figures on consumer price
inflation in May.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was the first witness at the hearings, which the Joint
Economic Committee is conducting in part to discuss such issues as
tax breaks for research and development and the liability of
technology companies for problems involving the Year 2000 software
problem. The witnesses include William H. Gates, the chairman of
the Microsoft Corp., who will appear on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearings also seem intended to give the Republican
majority in Congress an opportunity to give a sympathetic ear to
the technology industry, one of the most important battlegrounds in
the fight between the parties for campaign donations, and one that
Vice President Al Gore has worked hard to sew up for his
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In highlighting the Year 2000 liability issue, the Republicans
are putting on display the uncomfortable situation the Democrats
find themselves in, trapped between their desire to court
technology companies that want protection from lawsuits and the
Democrats' traditional alliance with lawyers, who want to protect
the right of computer users to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan steered clear of both politics and specific references
to monetary policy. He reiterated his belief that technology has
been perhaps the dominant force in the economy in recent years,
fostering widespread changes in the way businesses operate and
contributing tremendously to the vibrancy and durability of the
expansion, which is now in its ninth year. But with investors and
economists looking for any clues about future rate increases, it
was his warning about the limits of technology that was most
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists and investors expect the central bank to push
its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5
percent, at the end of the month. Evidence that the economy
continues to roar along, including a surge last month in retail
sales, has already pushed up the long-term interest rates set by
the market in recent weeks, in effect doing some of the Fed's job
for it by squeezing sectors of the economy sensitive to interest
rates, like housing.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Fed tightening is not certain _ there are still scant
signs that inflation has taken root _ the markets are increasingly
asking not whether the Fed will move this month but whether the
move will be a one-time action or the start of a series of rate
increases that would take back all of last fall's easings.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut rates three times last fall, in quarter-point
increments, to keep the markets stable and the economy humming
despite the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial crisis, which originated in Asia, now seems to
be receding. A surprising rebound in economic growth in Japan
during the first quarter _ provided it does not turn out to be a
statistical fluke _ could prove to be an important turning point.
And the fear that gripped the credit markets last fall is all but
gone, replaced by more concrete concern that inflation could stage
a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Jack Guynn, the president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta, put it Monday, the ``lucky streak'' that the
United States has enjoyed on inflation ``has finally run out,'' at
least to the degree that price increases have been held down by
economic weakness in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy prices are up substantially from their year-ago levels,
and other commodity prices have risen, too,'' Guynn said in a
speech to a business group in Atlanta. ``What's happened, of
course, is that as the economies of Asia and elsewhere have turned
the corner to recovery, global demand has picked up, and so have
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Guynn, who is a nonvoting member of the policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee, said higher inflation was not inevitable.
But he offered a list of issues that worry him, including ``the
residual stimulus'' from last fall's rate cuts; signals that the
bond market is increasingly concerned about inflation; rapid growth
in the money supply, and the very low unemployment rate, which is
4.2 percent.

NEWS ANALYSIS: QWEST IS BIDDING TO BE AMONG THE GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also QWEST-USWEST) 
(ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bit less than two years ago, just before Qwest
Communications International Inc. first offered stock to the
public, Joseph P. Nacchio, who had just left a top job at AT&AMP;T
Corp., was asked what he meant to create in Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to create a full-service communications provider,''
said Nacchio, Qwest's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The answer did not ring true. After all, it seemed so much
easier for Qwest to build an advanced nationwide communications
network and then sell it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday Nacchio proved his strategy was real by firing off
a pair of hostile bids, worth as much as $55 billion in cash and
stock, to acquire both U S West Inc., the smallest of the Baby
Bells, and the Frontier Corp., one of the nation's biggest
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those companies had already agreed to be acquired by
Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda, another strapping young
communications provider.
</P>
<P>
   Even as early as March 1998, Qwest's agreement to acquire LCI
International Inc. for $4.4 billion signaled that the company was
serious about serving callers in addition to serving other
carriers. And maybe because Philip Anschutz, the oil and railroad
tycoon behind Qwest, had already made his billions, he felt no
pressure to sell while the getting was good. Instead, he rolled the
dice on creating a giant.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the rise of Qwest represents an ideal confluence
of ability, personality and opportunity. Anschutz and Nacchio
supplied the first two. The Internet and Congress supplied the
third, with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 introducing
competition that has nurtured demand for communications generally
and for Internet service specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity also played a role. One of the more interesting
aspects of the communications revolution is the way it has built on
older, more traditional industries. For example, the real estate
easements and rights of way won by railroads and pipeline companies
100 years ago _ networks that crisscross the United States and
reach into downtowns everywhere _ have taken on a second life as
pathways for high-capacity fiber optic communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The first two letters in Sprint's name initially stood for
Southern Pacific, the railroad that started the long-distance
giant. Through a series of corporate mutations involving GTE and
the old United Telephone, Sprint became independent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, MFS (originally Metropolitan Fiber Systems)
Communications, one of the first companies to broadly challenge the
Bells' local phone monopoly with business customers, emerged from
Peter Kiewit &AMP; Sons, a construction empire based in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   And the Williams Cos., which supplied Worldcom with its first
fiber optic network, the Wiltel communications unit, recently
started yet another national fiber optic network.
</P>
<P>
   Through Anschutz, Qwest has become the Southern Pacific
Railroad's second great communications progeny. For all of the
brilliance of Global Crossing's founder, Gary Winnick, a Los
Angeles financier, Global Crossing does not enjoy Qwest's sort of
heritage. It is not that an old industrial pedigree has made its
holders any more prescient, but it has given them a head start.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Global Crossing is by no means out of the game for U S
West and Frontier, given the sharp thumbs-down the market gave
Qwest Monday, a winning deal by Qwest would catapult it into the
ranks of the world's biggest communications companies. That would
be an impressive feat for Nacchio, a personable, engaging,
fast-talking salesman who is widely admired for his smarts.
</P>
<P>
   In Qwest's machismo culture, executives have a good time and
clearly enjoy devising ways to crush competitors. It is a fairly
productive approach. Nacchio has assembled a crack executive team
including Lewis O. Wilks, Qwest's aggressive Internet chief, who
came from GTE, and Robert S. Woodruff, the chief financial officer
from Coopers &AMP; Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, though, Qwest's quest is something of a personal
rivalry between two former AT&AMP;T executives _ Nacchio and Robert
Annunziata, Global Crossing's chief executive, who have known each
other for years.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left to head Teleport Communications Group, one of the
early competitors to the Bells in local markets, in 1984,
Annunziata had spent most of his career at AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio stuck it out at AT&AMP;T until October 1996, when it became
clear that the chairman, Robert E. Allen, would not anoint him as a
successor. In leaving to lead Qwest, he joined an exodus of senior
AT&AMP;T executives that included Alex J. Mandl, who became chairman of
Teligent Inc., the wireless communications company.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong took over as AT&AMP;T's chief executive after
Allen's hand-picked successor, John Walter, failed to impress the
board, and the first big deal Armstrong made was to acquire
Annunziata's Teleport in January 1998 to get its fiber optic links
to big business customers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Annunziata rejoined AT&AMP;T, but it did not
last long. Winnick hired him to lead Global Crossing at least
partly for reasons Nacchio was chosen to head Qwest: name
recognition in _ and a thorough working knowledge of _ the
communications business.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Nacchio and Annunziata have come to be rivals
in almost every sense, competing for the same investors, and many
of the same customers. Now they are competing for a place at the
table with the moguls of communications.

RUSSIA'S ROLE IN KOSOVO MAY OVERSHADOW CLINTON'S SUCCESS AS SUMMIT
CONVENES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton heads to Europe Tuesday to
celebrate NATO's success with international leaders, his trip may
be overshadowed by Russia's unexpected role as a difficult partner
in Kosovo peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose of Clinton's visit is the meeting of the
seven western industrialized nations and Russia in Cologne,
Germany, a summit that usually focuses on economic concerns but
this year will likely be dominated by the Kosovo situation and
rebuilding the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, seeking a role in the peacekeeping, have refused
to cede control of the airport in Kosovo's capital city, Pristina,
after sending in several hundred troops in advance of NATO
peacekeeping forces. The move infuriated NATO commanders, who
continued to pour troops into the region Monday, and sparked
serious talks between Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton telephoned Russian President Boris
Yeltsin while vice president Al Gore spoke with Russian prime
minister Sergei Stepashin to resolve the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the talks, Defense Secretary William Cohen will
meet later this week with Russian Defense officials in Helsinki,
Finland, to hash out what the Russian role should be in policing
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials tried to play down the latest impasse
with Russia, arguing that it had not interfered with NATO's plans
to send 50,000 troops to keep the peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to exaggerate this problem. This is
something that can be worked out,'' said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. ``We have said we want the Russians to be part
of it, they want to be part of it. I think it does not defy the
imagination here to figure out a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, negotiations with the Russians have not been easy.
It has been less than clear who is in charge in Moscow these days,
with conflicting reports as to who authorized sending the troops
into Kosovo. The ailing Yeltsin is viewed with suspicion by many in
his military who believe he capitulated to the United States and
NATO by agreeing to the accord that forced Serb troops to retreat
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wants to control a sector in Kosovo but does not want its
troops under NATO command. NATO officials believe a sector
controlled by Russia, a longtime Serb ally, would divide Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for NATO officials and Clinton to meet
face-to-face with Yeltsin may be limited. Yeltsin is not expected
to show up at the economic summit until Sunday, the third day of
the meeting, according to administration officials. Until then,
Russia will be represented by Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   Before he arrives in Germany for the summit at the end of the
week, Clinton will speak to the International Labor Organization
Conference in Geneva and then fly to Paris to meet with French
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   After Germany, the president flies to Slovenia, where he will
meet with its top leaders and address the citizens of that former
part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The world leaders will have several matters to hash out when
they convene in Cologne, including how to coordinate the
reconstruction efforts in Kosovo. European countries have pledged
to pay the lion's share of the peacekeeping force and the
reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also will discuss their standard fare of economics,
including improving financial safeguards in developing nations. The
industrialized nations will consider a U.S. proposal to help reduce
the debt of poorer countries, a burden that administration
officials say has hampered their economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will address another problem in developing nations,
the use of child labor.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Labor Organization conference in Geneva,
Clinton will emphasize the need for many of the poor countries to
stop exploiting children.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the head of Clinton's National Economic Council,
said Clinton will tell members of the United Nations agency that
these countries need to be helped into steering young people into
education or other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child labor is not an issue in which you can simply shut down
the factories or go for an easy solution,'' Sperling said. ``The
chances are too great that you will drive a 10-year-old boy from
the factories to running drugs, or an 11-year-old girl from the
factories to prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Cologne summit, the president will go to Bonn,
Germany, to participate in the U.S. European Union meeting, a
summit that will focus on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   After Bonn, Clinton will fly to Ljubljana, Slovenia, where he
will meet with President Milan Kucan.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia was the first region to break from Yugoslavia after the
fall of communism and has been lobbying to become a member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is a way of encouraging positive developments in a
small nation that sits in an unstable region of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slovenia is one of the countries that really has made
considerable progress, both economically and politically, in terms
of democracy and openness,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the other items on his agenda during the seven-day trip,
the president is sure to make time to emphasize the success of the
NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo. Some observers say that such
bragging might be appropriate, considering the considerable
skepticism voiced by many during the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves a victory lap,'' said Ivo Daalder, a
foreign-policy expert at the Brookings Institution who had been
critical of the bombing. ``He has pulled the rabbit out of the hat,
again.''

STOCKS MIXED AS INVESTORS WAIT FOR KEY REPORT WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed and activity remained subdued
Monday as traders and investors delayed putting money to work
before an important inflation report that is scheduled for release
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates, which have risen sharply in recent
weeks and put pressure on stocks, eased a bit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drop in rates did little to alter the consensus that
the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates to dampen
growth when its policy makers meet later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that are sensitive to the business cycle, which do well
in an expanding economy, helped to push the Dow Jones industrial
average higher. But Internet stocks were crushed, pushed lower by
negative developments affecting three of the group's most important
companies _ America Online, Charles Schwab and Ebay _ as well as
concerns about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, high-cap stocks are the allure, and money is coming
out of technology and Internet stocks and even some small stocks''
to move into those companies, said Bill Allyn, head of listed
trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, money was not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth time in the last eight sessions, fewer than 700
million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. At
832.2 million shares, volume on the Nasdaq market was a bit better
but still well short of the 1-billion-share trading sessions seen
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Led by DuPont, General Electric and Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing, the Dow rose 72.82 points, or seven-tenths of a
percent, to 10,563.33. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was
flat, rising 0.36 point, to 1,294.00.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq composite index, dragged down by the Internet
sector, fell sharply. At the close, the Nasdaq was off 49.57
points, or 2.03 percent, to 2,398.31.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders and analysts said the market's tone might change
after Wednesday's release of May consumer price data.
</P>
<P>
   The April numbers showed the biggest monthly increase in more
than nine years. That report rattled financial markets and led to
an ever-rising chorus that the Fed would move soon to raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A report showing the April figures to be an aberration would be
helpful but hardly conclusive, said Jeffrey Applegate, chief
investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market has priced itself for at least one Fed
tightening, and if the Fed does go, it will have to position itself
for another,'' Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the consumer price numbers look pretty benign, then the
market might take comfort from that,'' he added. ``But I suspect
this is not something that will be sorted out with the next one or
two data points. I don't think we are out of the woods yet. There
are just too many crosscurrents.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow Internet stocks have been saying for some
time that the sector was particularly vulnerable. Still, Monday's
downdraft was particularly drastic.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about slowing subscription rates led to big declines in
America Online. At the close, the stock was down 9, to 90{. Ebay
continued to suffer from a computer system failure last week,
falling 29~, or 18 percent, to 136. And Schwab was punished after
it reported that its daily online trading volume fell 28 percent in
May, compared with April activity. The stock closed at 83 15/16 a
share, down 10 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the price-earnings ratios for companies like America
Online and Schwab, there is not much room for error,'' said Michael
Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``These were material, fundamental events.''
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in these issues also helped to drag down other Internet
shares. Cisco Systems, a component of the S&AMP;P 500, fell 2~ a share,
to 107 13/16. Amazon.com shed 13 13/16, to 92. And Yahoo lost 16,
to 119\.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dow, DuPont gained 2~, to 70 3/16. General Electric
closed at 103}, up 2 13/32. And Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
gained 3 5/16, to 89\.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, drug and medical service company shares slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Becton Dickinson, the nation's largest manufacturer of medical
syringes, declined 8}, to 30 5/16, after notifying Wall Street that
earnings for the third quarter and the full year would fall short
of expectations because of slower sales in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer continued to drop, falling 2], to 95[. And Warner-Lambert
slipped {, to 62\.

SPORTS COLUMN: A BIZARRE SPRINGTIME KEEPS GOING
</HEADLINE>
  (First names are deliberately omitted in third graf.) 
(ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After staring at my screen saver for the past hour, I still
cannot come up with an argument why the Knicks absolutely cannot
beat the San Antonio Spurs in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   I want to clear my throat authoritatively and pretend I'm a hoop
maven and declare that the Knicks cannot possibly match the Twin
Towers.
</P>
<P>
   But all I know is what I have seen for the last month: Sprewell
and Houston bonding on the court, Camby coming on in the stretch as
Lemon Drop Kid did in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this is hardly a triumphal bleat from some giddy
Knicks fan. I have no emotional attachment to them or their
organization, plus they are bad for my health _ late hours, indoor
games, stale air at their dismal practice gym.
</P>
<P>
   But they made the Garden rock last Friday, and I am not so sure
they cannot do it again when they come home next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This team is a work in progress. The sum is greater than the
parts. This is not a normal season. An eighth-seeded team is in the
finals. Ignore their chaos at your own peril.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, I've had two cups of black coffee, a
snack of sushi and one hard candy. The basic food groups: caffeine
and soy and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   I have gazed at my screen saver some more. (It scrolls the teams
in Italy's national soccer league, Serie A; I programmed it myself
one slow afternoon.) Still, prudence does not raise her wise old
head.
</P>
<P>
   As I sit here, I put nothing past this bunch of lugs, whoever is
left of them. The Knicks say they'll make the decision about Larry
Johnson at game time Wednesday, which sounds like making busy work
for the San Antonio coaches. I saw the rolling block on Johnson on
Friday night, and I say he is out until the third game. I still
think the Knicks could catch the Spurs rusty Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about going after the proverbial split,'' Jeff Van
Gundy Monday, but you bet the coach would like to steal one and
hope L.J. is limber again next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, what do I know about San Antonio? I live in
the East. I have just spent this winter dealing with rampant
skulduggery in the Olympic movement, plus tracking down oddities
and calamities in my own time zone: John Calipari self-destructing
in New Jersey; Ernie Grunfeld getting whacked as an offering to the
new owners of the Garden. Who had time for Twin Towers out West?
</P>
<P>
   This is a big country. You can absorb just so much. It took
years for Easterners to appreciate Magic Johnson out in Los Angeles
the way we appreciated Larry Bird in Boston. Bird played at 7:30
p.m.; Johnson played at 10:30 p.m. That simple.
</P>
<P>
   In this weird little season following the owners' desperate
lockout, there were very few East-West games, which meant that Tim
Duncan and David Robinson were playing past my bedtime. I take
everybody's word for it that they are great, but I have seen
bizarre things from the Knicks lately, and I am loath to say they
cannot continue.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston is like some cold-blooded assassin out there.
(``The great scorers, if they can bury you, they bury you,'' Van
Gundy said Monday, regarding Houston's current binge.) A few weeks
ago I was scoffing at any comparison of Houston and Latrell
Sprewell's potential chemistry with the very real karma of Walt
Frazier and Earl Monroe back in 1973. I no longer scoff. Is it
possible the absent Grunfeld was on to something?
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have the right attitude. Herb Williams _ probably
destined to be the star of one of these games _ seemed downright
insulted Monday when asked to give one reason the Knicks could win
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really should be asking if there is any reason we can't
win,'' Williams said, almost huffily. ``Guys are going to go out
there and play their game. If they defense us, hats off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston seemed totally unfazed by news that the Knicks were
9-point underdogs. ``It sounds a little low to me,'' he said.
``We're never going to say we're underdogs, but the way the media
and the experts talk, it sounds like it should be double digits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks remember the lucky bounce against Miami, the lethargy
of Atlanta, the fortuitous 4-point call against Indiana. They are
on a roll. I say they win one in Texas, then they come home to the
Garden, where the Beast lives.
</P>
<P>
   This is, essentially, a team that did not exist two months ago.
After witnessing the Knicks' fast and furious evolution, I cannot
work up the conventional wisdom to pick against them.

   BALTIMORE _ Seven years ago, a group of engineering students at
Johns Hopkins University here was given $2,000 and an assignment:
Build a ``smart'' gun, a gun that could be fired only by its owner.
Using off-the-shelf equipment, the students developed a prototype
that, with wires hanging out of it, was neither attractive nor
practical. But it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty,'' recalled Stephen Teret, director of the
Gun Policy and Research Center at the Johns Hopkins School of
Public Health. ``But if three undergrads with $2,000 and no gun
experience could make it, it means others could do the same, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, has not proved to be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the idea of a smart gun _ a gun that could
not be fired accidentally by a child or violently by a criminal who
stole it _ came up, it has come to be seen as a quick fix, cited in
lawsuits and in legislatures by gun-control advocates. So far,
legislation requiring that within five years all new handguns be
smart guns is pending before at least eight statehouses, including
those in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. And lawsuits to
hold gun makers financially responsible for not incorporating
smart-gun technology have been filed by New Orleans and 17 other
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pressure for smart guns grows, it is becoming
increasingly clear that they may not be the simple fix many
proponents think they are. For one thing, no workable smart gun is
in sight, and as with so much in the national gun debate, its
development is mired in disputes, technological problems and even
questions about whether smart guns are, in fact, really a smart
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to smart guns, there's no great fix out there
right now,'' said Joshua Horowitz, a lawyer with the Coalition to
Stop Handgun Violence, a gun-control group in Washington.
``Everyone who has looked at it said there is no quick, feasible
way of doing this. For people like us, there's a question of a
balancing point: Would smart guns increase gun sales or would they
save lives? And, from the industry's perspective, no one wants to
do it until they all have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gun makers welcome smart guns as a marketing opportunity to
improve sagging handgun sales; other gun makers oppose them as a
first step on a slippery slope toward gun control. Some gun-control
advocates say smart guns could cut down on the thousands of deaths
and injuries caused each year by suicide, homicide and
unintentional shootings. Other gun-control advocates oppose them,
saying smart guns could encourage people who might not have guns to
buy them, increasing the risk of handgun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Rifle Association has officially remained
neutral on smart-gun technology, many of its members have lobbied
against it in various legislative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest in smart guns is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy to invent an affordable and reliable smart gun
will be a trillionaire,'' said Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel of
Glock, a gun manufacturer in Smyrna, Ga. ``It's absurd to say we're
hiding this technology. Why would someone be hiding it? They'd be a
wealthy person.''
</P>
<P>
   While the debates continue, efforts are under way in Washington
to get more government money for smart-gun research and
development. The National Institute of Justice, a federal agency,
is working with Colt's Manufacturing Co. to develop a prototype
smart gun for law-enforcement officers. A first test model,
developed with $500,000 in government money, is expected to be
delivered this summer. The goal is to cut the number of police
officers killed with their own weapons by assailants, an average of
six to 10 a year, or 10 percent to 16 percent of all police deaths
in the last decade, government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Police groups are putting their efforts behind a Clinton
administration budget proposal to spend $4 million on smart-gun
technology. Colt's, along with many members of Congress, is also
seeking up to $40 million in federal grants to develop the
technology, and behind-the-scenes lobbying has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has demonstrated a model that is viable in the
marketplace,'' said Steven Sliwa, chief executive of Colt's.
``We've developed some interesting prototypes with the government,
but they haven't shown the durability and reliability needed to be
commercially viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt's lineup of semiautomatic handguns range in price at retail
from about $250 for a .22-caliber target pistol to $813 for its
.45-caliber Combat Commander. The smart-gun technology could add
$300 to $400 to the price of each gun, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the money for research is needed is simple: It is not
easy to make a smart gun. Essentially, a smart gun is a meshing of
a complicated 19th-century mechanical device, the gun, with
delicate and sophisticated computer engineering. Within the
footprint of an existing gun _ with controlled explosions, heavy
percussions and vibrations, dirty residues and high temperatures _
electronics would be embedded that would have to withstand this
high stress. It is like putting a laptop computer into a gun and
then having that computer decide when the gun will work _ and when
it will not. This is more complicated than what electronics in an
automated teller machine, in car dashboards, or even in missiles,
are asked to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, yes, smart guns are a great concept,'' said
Richard Roberts, director of special operations at the
International Union of Police Associations, which favors smart-gun
development. ``But from the street officers' level, they'll want
some real assurance that this baby will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many types of smart guns have been proposed, each with problems.
Some prototypes operate on radio waves that allow a gun to operate
when it receives a signal from an owner's ring, wristband or pin.
But other radio waves can interfere with these signals.
</P>
<P>
   There are also biometric devices like fingerprint or voice
recognition, but those pose problems with accuracy. A report
prepared by Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., on
smart guns concluded, ``It may take a generation of smart-gun
systems to come and go before a smart gun is not only common but is
favored over a nonsmart gun.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, lawsuits calling for smart guns press on. Many suits
against gun makers have been filed by the same lawyers who sued the
auto industry seeking seat belts and airbags. Unlike the carmakers,
with their deep financial resources and large
research-and-development staffs, the gun industry is a collection
of small, marginally profitable companies _ the combined revenues
of all gun makers is only about $2 billion a year. By contrast,
Ford and General Motors each has revenues of over $140 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the industry is simply waiting for the government to
foot the bill. Steven Morton, chief executive of Oxford Micro
Devices, a semiconductor maker in Newtown, Conn., is working on a
fingerprint-activated gun. But he has yet to find a gun maker to
join him in a venture he estimates will take up to two years and
cost at least $5 million in research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun makers tell me they want to wait,'' Morton said. ``They
feel that sooner or later, Congress will put up the money for
research. So they are simply waiting for Congress to pay for
something so they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Mossberg, a vice president at O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, a
gun maker in New Haven, Conn., that is working on a smart gun,
said, ``We'd love to get government funds, but not with strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   As a debate rages in Congress over gun-control legislation _ a
measure focusing on who buys guns and how they are sold _ the
efforts to get more money directed to smart-gun technology are
taking place quietly, out of the spotlight. The important word here
is quiet _ no gunmaker or member of Congress wants to alienate the
National Rifle Association. A Washington lobbyist said the first
question asked by many members of Congress when approached about
financing for smart-gun research was, ``Where is the NRA on this
issue?''
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers understand that technology used to develop a smart
gun for law-enforcement officers, whose needs are more specialized
than the average citizen, could later be spun off for a civilian
model. The common notion is that an officer's gun would have to be
more durable, reliable and would be used under more circumstances,
outdoors and inside, in heat and in cold, than handguns used by
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Because police officers are so skeptical of new equipment _ it
took over 30 years for many police forces to accept
bullet-resistant vests _ a smart gun that passes muster would have
to be an engineering marvel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking cops to take a reliable product and give them a
gun that will be, by definition, less reliable,'' said Daniel
Rosenblatt, executive director of the International Chiefs of
Police. ``But, if you could get a smart gun to work, it would be
one of the most significant developments in the history of
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   From a business perspective, the law-enforcement market is small
_ there are only about 600,000 police officers in the country _
making it difficult, on a cost basis alone, to justify high
research costs. For gun makers, the real prize is the larger
civilian market, where gun sales have been falling and where a new
product might stop the slide. In 1997, the most recent year for
which statistics are available, 3.7 million firearms were
manufactured in the United States, a sizable drop from 5.2 million
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the dropoff is the big decline in handgun
sales, falling to 1.4 million in 1997 from 2.8 million units in
1993, in the wake of anti-handgun campaigns and the market's
saturation.
</P>
<P>
   A study from the Johns Hopkins University gun policy center that
appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine last year showed
that 71 percent of adults surveyed favored legislation mandating
personalized guns. Among gun owners, 59 percent favored such bills.
To gun makers, that is a sign of enormous market opportunities. To
some gun-control advocates, that is a sign of enormous problems
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun industry thinks that smart guns would allow them to
develop additional markets of 60 million new handgun owners,'' said
Kristen Rand, senior counsel at the Violence Policy Center in
Washington. ``If anything close to that would happen, we would see
a significant increase in firearms-related deaths as people get
lulled into a false sense of safety. Smart guns send a message that
handguns can be made safe and there can be magic guns where no good
people will ever be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, more cities are expected to follow New Orleans
and file lawsuits, and more bills are expected to be introduced in
more statehouses. These efforts are being led by the Johns Hopkins
center, whose director, Teret, is a former plaintiffs lawyer who
battled for airbags a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he thinks he can re-create that success.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with cars and airbags, I believe litigation will be most
effective for an industry as intransigent as the gun industry,''
Teret said. ``It's not a question of whether Beretta can afford to
design a smart gun, but whether they can afford to make a gun
without these safety devices.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO slowly expanded its control over a
central swath of Kosovo on Monday, pouring thousands more soldiers
into major towns and villages but effectively ceding the airport
here in the capital to about 200 Russian soldiers who defiantly
occupied it three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening, NATO officials reported no new clashes on
Monday like ones on Sunday. The force's commander, Lt. Gen. Michael
Jackson of Britain, said on Monday that German and British troops
who had opened fired in separate confrontations on Sunday in
Prizren and Pristina, killing two Serbs, had acted justifiably.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NATO's ever growing presence, parts of Kosovo remained
tense and, occasionally, chaotic. There were reports that a body
found near Suva Reka may have been that of a third German
journalist, a day after two others were shot to death. In Djakovica
and Pec, cities at the center of the civil war over the last year,
retreating Yugoslav forces set houses on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Long columns of Yugoslav army and police units continued to
withdraw on schedule, NATO commanders said, but as they went, they
intermingled on narrow roads with desperate convoys of Serbian
civilians and advancing NATO troops. ``We are in a difficult,
volatile and, at times, dangerous environment,'' Jackson said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from the Yugoslav army still controlled the roads into
Pristina's airport, southwest of here, where the Russian force has
settled in. The Yugoslav troops refused to let anyone pass, let
alone NATO troops. In a news conference in Pristina's main hotel,
the Grand, where Yugoslav soldiers are still quartered in the
basement, Jackson said Russia's role was a political issue, to be
decided at the political level.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pristina, Jackson chided those who saw the impasse over
the airport as an embarrassment to NATO or a hitch in the
operation. He said he had not intended to establish NATO's
headquarters there, as NATO officials previously indicated, because
of the distance from the capital and the hazards of mines and
unexploded NATO bombs. ``I'm very happy to leave the airfield in
Russian hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the occupation's third day, more than 14,000
allied troops controlled an anchor-shaped area, stretching from Pec
in the west to Gnjilane in the east, with the capital, Pristina, at
the head.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's presence has begun to spread from the main corridors to
smaller roads and villages. Overhead, there is a constant thudding
of helicopters. The United Nations and relief organizations
delivered rations of food inside Kosovo on Monday for the first
time since NATO's bombing stopped. Aid workers handed out the food
to 18,000 refugees in Glogovac, many of whom had waited out the war
in the hills near some of the heaviest fighting between Serbian
forces and Kosovo Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, a special envoy from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said NATO must move quickly to establish
control so that food, medicine and other supplies can reach as many
as 500,000 Albanian refugees believed to have fled their homes and
to have remained inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO said its deployments were on schedule, there have
been snags. After a half-start on Sunday blamed on congestion,
1,000 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit finally
crossed into Kosovo early on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With units from the 82d Airborne and 1st Armored Division having
arrived the day before, more than 2,000 Americans are now
patrolling their sector in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will not control the entire province until the last
Yugoslav forces leave, which is required to happen by next Sunday.
The first phase of that withdrawal, from roughly a third of Kosovo,
must take place by Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said a quarter of the 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers
and police officers in Kosovo at the height of the conflict had
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   As the soldiers left, so did Serbian civilians, many of them
from the southwest, around Prizren. Long, ragged convoys fled on
the road from Prizren to Gjnilane, toward an area with a larger
Serbian population.
</P>
<P>
   Sveta Jovicic, left with her three daughters and only two
blankets. She was sick, she said, in need of dialysis, but no
longer felt safe in Prizren. ``We have been living with terrorists
for two years,'' she said, her voice breaking. ``But where can go?
I don't know. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Serbs were determined to stay. Blagoje Arsic said Serbs in
his village, Zitinje, voted on Monday and decided to stay in their
homes. ``I want to live in peace with my neighbors: no problems, no
hate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Kosovo's border with Macedonia, deserted only days ago,
hundreds of Kosovar Albanian refugees began to flow back toward
their homes. In Albania, the tide of those wanting to return was so
great that German forces closed the border.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of thousands remain in camps in Macedonia,
where aid workers are trying to convince them to stay until it is
safer to go home, the return of some on Monday showed a growing
faith in Kosovo's security in the wake of Serbian withdrawals.
Those better off went by car _ one so full that two men sat in the
trunk _ but a steady trickle of people walked north on the main
road into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Adila Zeneli, 40, returned with two sons and a daughter. Her
husband, a soldier in the Kosovo Liberation Army, called her in
Macedonia where she has stayed since the war began and told her it
was safe to return to their village, Kacanik. ``We are not
afraid,'' she said, ``because NATO is there.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the Kosovo Liberation Army. In town after town vacated by
retreating Yugoslav army and police units, the group's fighters
openly patrolled roads and fields, often only yards from NATO
troops.
</P>
<P>
   On a road north of Vitina now controlled by American troops,
Slavisha Maksimovic, a Serb, complained that he had to flee his
home in the village of Trpeza because armed members of the group
had appeared. He pleaded, unsuccessfully, with an American Marine,
Cpl. Derian F. Pritchett, who guarded a checkpoint outside of
Klokot. ``We can't do anything about that right now,'' Pritchett
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NATO commanders fear that the rebels will not disband. At the
border crossing from Macedonia, American soldiers from the 82d
Airborne have begun searching every car for weapons they fear
refugees may try to bring in to the group's fighters.
</P>
<P>
   At an Army checkpoint south of Kacanik, Pvt. Wylie Shaffer,
armed with a grenade launcher, said he had stopped several Kosovo
Liberation Army soldiers and confiscated their weapons, mostly
AK-47s. ``We just ask them,'' he said, ``and they give them up.''

GERMAN PRESS ALARMED BY KILLINGS OF JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The killing of at least two German journalists in
Kosovo spread alarm at major German newspapers and magazines on
Monday, prompting editors to order correspondents to stick close to
NATO forces at all times and to avoid any risk.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Kraemer, a 56-year-old photographer with 30 years'
experience at the weekly news magazine Stern, and his colleague
Gabriel Gruener, 35, a reporter, were shot dead in uncertain
circumstances on Sunday as they drove through Dulje, a town about
midway between Prizren, in southern Kosovo, and Pristina, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Because the killings came against the backdrop of Serbia's
visceral hostility toward Germany, a sentiment rooted in savage
Nazi reprisals against Serbs during World War II and in the
repeated use of anti-German propaganda by the regime of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, they caused particular
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Otto, a spokesman for Stern, said the two journalists and a
translator were killed by sniper fire. Kraemer died instantly, and
Gruener, whose companion is seven months pregnant, died after being
rushed to a hospital in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathiaas Doepfner, the editor of Die Welt, said he had heard
from his correspondent, Edith Kohn, who passed along the same road
five minutes before the journalists who were killed, that from
accounts of people who said they had been at the scene, the
journalists were executed.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists were lured out of their car with a promise that
they would be taken to the site of a mass grave and were then
executed by Serb gunmen, Doepfner said he had been told. He added
that he had ordered Ms. Kohn to stay in her hotel in Pristina for
the next two days and to avoid the volatile city of Prizren, the
base for about 8,000 German NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior editor at a weekly publication also said he had
reports that the two journalists and the translator were executed
after being removed from their car. ``They were targeted as
Germans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty surrounded the possible death of a third German
journalist. The defense ministry retracted an earlier report that a
third journalist's body had been found, but Werner Adam, the
foreign editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine, said he had heard
that a freelance journalist working for a South Tyrolian paper had
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked and at a loss,'' said Michael Meier, the chief
editor of Stern. ``These colleagues were among our most experienced
and sensible reporters. The deaths are an unimaginable loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruener had served in Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia in recent
years. Kraemer was a photographer well known for his work in
Eritrea, Sarajevo, South Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just spoken to our correspondent, Bernhard Kueppers,
and our instructions are, `Don't risk anything,' '' said Gernot
Sittner, one of two executive editors of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
``Absolutely no risk.'' But, like other editors, he said that
Kueppers, who is now in Prizren, would not be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung lost its Balkan correspondent, Egon
Scotland, 43, when he came under Serb fire in Croatia on July 26,
1991. ``Obviously,'' said Sittner, ``we are particularly sensitive
because we have already lost one man in the Balkan wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto, the Stern spokesman, said the magazine still had
correspondents in the region and had decided not to order them out.
Rather, they have been asked to work full time on investigating
their colleagues' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Klingst, the political editor of the weekly Die Zeit,
said the paper has two correspondents in Kosovo. ``They have been
told not to go off on their own, not to look for mass graves, and
to stick to the NATO soldiers _ Germans in Prizren and British in
Pristina. We are extremely shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb resentment of Germany has scarcely eased in the 54 years
since the end of World War II. Bosnian Serb barracks during the
1992-95 war in Bosnia were regularly adorned with posters showing
the blue-and-gold European flag covered with swastikas. The slogan
read: ``Are you ready for Deutschmocracy?''
</P>
<P>
   Early German support for Croatian independence during the
Croatian war of 1991 cemented old Serb convictions that Germany has
had one consistent strategic aim in this century: penetration of
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   As the Croats sang ``Danke Deutschland'' when the German move
helped them gain independence, the Serbs fumed at what they often
portrayed in Belgrade, their capital, as the policies of a Fourth
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it is common sense that we are not cherished by the
Serbs,'' said Roman Leick, the foreign editor of the weekly
magazine Der Spiegel. ``But until these incidents, we had not
thought that Germans could be singled out and targeted. Indeed, we
are still not sure that was the case.''

 &HT;    Church van kills 3 in Georgia; seat belts likely not worn
 &HT;    By Joey Ledford and Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGRANGE, Ga. _ It's likely that none of the passengers in a
fatal church van crash on the interstate was wearing a seat belt,
Georgia State Patrol officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers continue to investigate the Sunday afternoon accident
on southbound I-185 about 55 miles south of Atlanta, which took the
lives of three teenage members of St. James CME Church in Columbus,
Ga. Eight people were injured, some of them critically.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't finished looking at it, but they don't think
anybody had a seat belt on,'' said Gordy Wright, spokesman for the
Georgia State Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger vans that carry 15 or fewer passengers, like the
rented 1999 Dodge that carried the church group, are virtually
unregulated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires operators of vehicles carrying 16 or more
passengers to hold commercial driver's licenses, Wright said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 15-passenger van, rather than 16, means you can operate it
with a regular license,'' said Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The van is also exempt from Georgia's primary seat belt law,
which covers only vehicles designed to carry 10 or fewer
passengers, said Wright.
</P>
<P>
   All but the driver, Lula M. Pearson, 58, were ejected onto the
highway and the grassy shoulders around 3:52 p.m. just north of
exit 14, about 40 minutes north of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The van was carrying nine young members of the church youth
group, ages 13-16, who were returning from religious training at
Paine College in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was the only person aboard not thrown from the van,
``apparently because she was wedged in by the steering wheel and
console,'' said Georgia State Patrol Cpl. S.F. Hicks, assistant
commander of the LaGrange GSP post.
</P>

   The driver's husband, Ester Pearson, keeping vigil at West
Georgia Medical Center, said his wife was in ``sore, but good
spirits'' Monday following surgery for head injuries and severe
injuries to her hand. She was reported in fair condition Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   His wife does not yet know of the deaths, Pearson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going that far yet,'' he said. ''She's been through
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State Patrol's Specialized Collision Reconstruction
Team is analyzing the accident, but Hicks said details concerning
speed and how the driver lost control are still under examination.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports indicated that Lula Pearson fell asleep at the
wheel, Wright said. But investigators said passengers also told
them that she may have been looking in the rear-view mirror and
then returned her gaze to the road to discover the van had slipped
off the interstate's right-hand shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The three victims were identified as Jonathan Lyle, 13, who was
flown to Atlanta Medical Center from the scene, where he died;
Cecil Jernigan,13, who died after transfer to Egleston Children's
Hospital in Atlanta; and Janice Jordan, l5, who died at the
LaGrange Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Jan Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   The injured admitted to West Georgia Medical Center are Ebony
Brown, 13, listed in fair condition; and Maurice Kendrick, 15,
upgraded Monday afternoon from critical to guarded condition. His
brother William, 16, was treated for minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
   Tracie Fields, 13, and Natasha Kimbrough, 14, were transferred
to Columbus Regional Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Chester, 49, and Candice McKissie, 15, were admitted to a
hospital in Newnan, Ga., where they were listed in stable condition
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   William Kendrick Sr., 63, a retired Army sergeant major, said
his younger son Maurice underwent surgery for a ruptured spleen and
a collapsed lung Sunday night but ``he's doing fine today, though
he's sedated.'' Doctors had to removed the spleen, the elder
Kendrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick said he learned of the crash when the church pastor,
the Rev. James Hawkins Sr., called him around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, his
voice strained and nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'We got a problem, there's been an accident and
they're in the hospital.' I didn't question him,'' Kendrick said.
''I jumped in my shoes and drove here pretty fast. It sounded
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick said he walked into the room and found Maurice strapped
to a stretcher, trying to get up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize he was hurt as bad as he was,'' he said. ''My
heart goes out to the children who were killed.''

 The following article was reported by Lawrence K. Altman, William
J. Broad and Judith Miller; it was written by Broad.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one has come down with smallpox for decades. But in some
respects it is potentially more dangerous than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox killed more people over the ages than any other
infectious disease. In the 20th century alone, experts estimate, it
took up to a half billion lives, more than all the wars and
epidemics put together.
</P>
<P>
   Its scars run deep. As long as three thousand years ago, Chinese
records tell of slow deaths and disfigurations. Signs of pockmarks
appear on the mummified head of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses V. The
disease decimated Europe and traveled with colonists to the New
World, laying waste to tribes and aiding British soldiers who
spread the virus as a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the high fevers, deep rashes and oozing pustules that
characterize smallpox are gone _ a feat of disease eradication so
far unequaled in the history of public health. This banishment is
so complete that recent medical textbooks often skip the disease or
give few details of its wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this triumph of modern medicine, Washington and key
allies now fear the scourge could strike anew sometime in the
future, unleashed by war or terrorism. And that worry is raising
new alarms and questions.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the virus so deadly? How well do old vaccinations
work? What about new drugs and vaccines? How likely is a smallpox
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Some answers are grim. For instance, troubles with quality
control are such that no stored smallpox vaccine in the United
States can now be used except in emergencies, Federal officials
say. Stoppers on vials are deteriorating and a vital ancillary
medicine is unusable.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point came on April 22 when the United States _ one of
two official smallpox repositories around the globe, along with
Russia _ announced that it would delay its intended destruction of
the virus, reversing years of planning and Washington's previous
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was to have been destroyed this month, the first
species driven to extinction by design rather than accident. But
the Clinton administration, after careful study, concluded that
clandestine supplies probably exist and could cause the disease to
emerge suddenly in war. And it reasoned that living samples might
aid the development of new treatments and antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that decision, a host of other actions are now
taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Most visibly, top scientists and health experts are now calling
for a federal program to produce new vaccine to protect up to 100
million people in the United States _ enough, in theory, to stop
any epidemic in its tracks. More quietly, American and Russian
scientists hope to embark on studies to better understand the
killer's ways in an effort to perfect a cure. And most stealthily
of all, intelligence agencies are stepping up their efforts to
better judge the threat of smallpox attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing, extremely disturbing,'' said Dr. Donald A.
Henderson, the scientist who led the global campaign that
eradicated smallpox and now is dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health. ``I thought the door had closed on
smallpox. I had happily put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises
Washington on germ warfare, called the eradication ``one of the
great humanitarian accomplishments of our century.'' But he added:
``We have no idea what may have been retained, maliciously or
inadvertently, in the laboratories of a hundred countries from the
time that smallpox was a common disease. These would be the most
likely sources of supply for possible bioterrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that past is prologue, the experts say, the
history of smallpox offers clues to the dangers and opportunities
that may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that if smallpox returns it could be more deadly
than ever. The effects of the disease on an unprotected population
were underscored by the experience of settlers who set sail from
Plymouth, England, landed on the Massachusetts coast in 1620 and
found the area remarkably free of Indians because a deadly epidemic
had just swept through. Early explorers had already spread the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, immunities built up slowly as people survived the
infection, with children usually faring better than adults. Later
on, vaccinations helped keep the scourge at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts say, such protections are all but gone and people
are generally more vulnerable to the disease, underscoring the need
for intelligent debate and possibly protective action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all Indians,'' said Elizabeth A. Fenn, a smallpox
historian at George Washington University. ``We're approaching 100
percent susceptibility.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Murderer
</P>
<P>
   As Viruses Go, Huge and Vicious
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where smallpox came from. Viral historians say it
probably began as an epidemic disease 10,000 years ago when human
populations first grew dense. The virus is unusual in that it
inhabits only humans, unlike many whose main home is in animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to have evolved from its natural forebears,'' said
Lederberg, a president emeritus of Rockefeller University. ``Close
relatives like monkeypox are still fairly prevalent in the rain
forests, occasionally reaching humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the disease has existed for at least three
millennia is found in the scars on the head and shoulders of the
Pharaoh Ramses V, who died as a young man in 1157 B.C., perhaps of
the disease. Deities in India and West Africa are devoted to
smallpox, attesting to ages of devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, probably spread by traders, is said by historians
to have reached Europe sometime in the first millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1520, Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conqueror of Mexico, is
believed to have unintentionally brought a smallpox-infected slave
with him to the New World. In the next two years, an estimated 3.5
million Aztecs died.
</P>
<P>
   In 18th-century Europe, smallpox killed 400,000 people a year,
peasants and monarchs alike, a toll proportionately equivalent to
more than a million deaths today. The disease in one 80-year period
is said to have taken the lives of a queen of England, an emperor
of Austria, a king of Spain, a czar of Russia, a king of France and
a queen of Sweden. And President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 was
probably feverish with the disease when he gave the Gettysburg
Address. Two days later, he broke out in the gruesome rash.
</P>
<P>
   Modern science has found that the smallpox virus, known as
variola, is a monster in size, possessing one of the largest
genetic blueprints of any virus. Whether that helps explain its
extraordinary lethality is unknown. What is clear is that, unlike
most viruses, it is highly stable outside its host and can retain
its powers of infection over long periods of time, aiding its
spread among victims.
</P>
<P>
   After a person is exposed, the virus multiplies rapidly and
spreads unobtrusively through the body's lymph system for about two
weeks. Suddenly the symptoms come on. The head, back and muscles
ache. The temperature spikes as high as 104 degrees, leaving the
victim drained. In these hours, little distinguishes smallpox from
garden-variety flu.
</P>
<P>
   In about two days, fever and aches give way to pockmarks. At
first they dot the tongue and roof of the mouth and then, over a
few days, break out over the face and spread to the arms and legs.
Flat and red at first, the pox over two weeks or so turn into small
blisters and fill with pus, after which scabs form. Sometimes the
entire rash becomes bloody.
</P>
<P>
   In its early stages, the disease is often confused with chicken
pox, and one way to distinguish them is that the smallpox rash
often spreads farther, covering the palms and soles.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the victims die, mainly from blood loss, low
blood pressure, cardiovascular collapse and secondary infections.
Many survivors are scarred and blinded. Others have shortened bones
and other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox spreads easily once the rash appears in the throat or
skin, and studies have shown that each infected person typically
passes the virus to three or four others in close contact, often by
coughing. In hospitals, the virus has been shown to travel
surprisingly far in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Eradication
</P>
<P>
   Hunting Down An Assassin
</P>
<P>
   In 18th-century Europe, one segment of the population _
milkmaids _ attracted medical attention because they escaped
smallpox. Surmising that these workers may have developed an
immunity from their association with cows, who were prone to a
related disease, cowpox, Edward Jenner, a British physician, in
1796 vaccinated a boy with material from an infected cow, Blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Jenner inoculated the boy with smallpox virus,
but the boy did not get sick. He was immune. Jenner had
successfully developed the smallpox vaccine. Jenner sent his report
on this breakthrough to the Royal Society, which promptly rejected
it. So Jenner published the historic paper on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like any vaccine, Jenner's worked by alerting the body's immune
system to the threat of microscopic invaders, prompting the
formation of antibodies to fight them off. The novelty was that
Jenner used one virus to protect against another, the first being
similar enough to trigger the body's defenses. Cowpox protected
against smallpox even though the two viruses, though clearly
related, are distinct species.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jenner dreamed of eliminating smallpox. But no serious efforts
were made until the 20th century. As late as the 1930s, smallpox
struck up to 50,000 people each year in the United States. The last
case occurred in 1949 in Hidalgo County, Texas. Although Jenner had
used cowpox virus, a third virus, vaccinia, became the standard
vaccine against smallpox. Experts say vaccinia is related to the
smallpox and cowpox viruses, but its origin is a major scientific
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Global vaccinations and quarantines began to be envisioned when,
after World War II, the World Health Organization was founded as an
arm of the newly established United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, WHO resolved to eradicate smallpox, largely at Moscow's
urging. But little happened until 1966, when the United States and
the Soviet Union proposed $2.5 million for an expanded effort. That
year 2 million people died of the disease, mainly in Bangladesh,
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and African countries
south of the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Mass vaccinations were not enough to stop all viral
transmission. So planners added strong measures to hunt down hidden
cases and quarantine victims in an effort to create transmission
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, tribal healers were hired to perform
vaccinations, eventually doing much good. ``They were soon out of a
job,'' recalled Henderson, who led the global campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Europe wiped out smallpox early on. But infected foreign
visitors still caused outbreaks so severe that hospitals
specifically for smallpox were built. As late as the 1960s, West
Germany constructed two such hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   India was one of the last major hurdles. In 1975 during a
two-week period, 130,000 workers visited 100 million homes there,
finding many smallpox cases. Cash rewards produced others. With
each sweep, the smallpox count dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Once India was free of the disease, attention turned to
Ethiopia. Counts fell and the global effort seemed over. But then
cases popped up in Somalia, on the horn of Africa. After another
push, WHO recorded the last case on Oct. 26, 1977, putting the
Somali victim in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the person-to-person chain was broken, defeating the
scourge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, WHO proclaimed the world free of smallpox and soon
asked for all laboratory samples of the virus to be destroyed or
sent to central repositories. But it had no inspection powers. The
heroes of the eradication effort had to take nations of the world
on their word when, one by one, they said the dreaded virus was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Threat
</P>
<P>
   Dark Evidence Of Hidden Arsenal
</P>
<P>
   The deadliness of smallpox has long beckoned to military minds
and was exploited in the New World with relative ease. Settlers and
soldiers from Europe often had immunity because of childhood
exposure. And Indians did not. So the virus tended to kill
selectively, overcoming a general drawback of germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   During an Indian uprising in 1763, Sir Jeffrey Amherst,
commander of British forces in North America (and namesake of the
Massachusetts city), suggested that the disease be sown
deliberately. ``Could it not be contrived to send the Small Pox
among those disaffected tribes of Indians?'' he wrote a
subordinate, encouraging the use of ``every stratagem in our power
to reduce them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his men at Fort Pitt, today Pittsburgh, had already
forged ahead without his encouragement, giving Indians infected
blankets and a germ-laden handkerchief. Epidemics ensued, but
historians are unsure to what extent the spread was due to natural
or deliberate exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fenn, the George Washington historian, who is finishing a
book on smallpox epidemics in America, said Amherst and his men's
independent pursuit of smallpox weapons showed the idea's
prevalence and wide appeal, which continued into the Revolutionary
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were willing to use it in nasty ways,'' she said of
British forces. ``But it's almost impossible to determine how
effective it was.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, George Washington was suspicious enough of the
British using smallpox as a weapon, and had lost so many troops to
the disease, that in 1777 he ordered his men to undergo crude
inoculations. The Americans, in contrast to English soldiers, had
typically grown up without exposure to the disease. Thus, like the
Indians, they had no acquired immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its apparent disuse in the last two centuries, the idea
of smallpox as a weapon has never disappeared. Indeed, evidence has
recently surfaced that many such armaments were made, if not used.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Soviet official named Kanatjan Kalibekov, now known
as Ken Alibek, defected to the United States. In secret
debriefings, Alibek, formerly a top player in Soviet germ warfare,
told Washington that Moscow had made tons of smallpox for war, and
he suggested that the virus might have been sold or secreted away
as the Soviet state collapsed and Russian scientists sought new
ways to support themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he went public, and he followed this year with a
book, ``Biohazard'' (Random House), which details a nightmare of
smallpox weapons that he says the Soviet Union made, including
warheads for long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   WHO's announcement of the disease's eradication in 1980, Alibek
wrote, had prompted the Soviets to redouble their smallpox efforts.
``Where other governments saw a medical victory,'' he said, ``the
Kremlin perceived a military opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they have confirmed many of Alibek's
smallpox claims and have also found signs that the virus is now
hidden in Iraq and North Korea, although they report seeing no
evidence of smallpox arms or planned strikes. The intelligence,
they say, helped drive Clinton's April 22 decision to forgo
destruction of American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, destruction of the virus has been put off three
years, until at least June 2002, as world health authorities debate
the stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaccine
</P>
<P>
   Nagging Doubts About a Life Saver
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the United States stopped routine vaccinations of
civilians against smallpox, nearly a decade ahead of much of the
world. Thus, about 114 million Americans born since then, 42
percent of the population, are completely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For people age 27 and older who were vaccinated, the degree of
protection is unclear because scientists have never systematically
measured the duration of immunity. Protection probably drops with
time, but how much is unknown. Lifelong immunity is unlikely, some
experts say. But old vaccinations may lead to milder attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the eradication program, WHO and a number of
countries independently stored enough smallpox vaccine for 60
million people and kept a safeguarded supply of the vaccinia virus
to make vaccine in case more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   With its cache, the United States in theory could protect up to
14 million people if each vial of stored vaccine was used to its
maximum potential of 100 doses. The manufacturer, Wyeth
Laboratories, holds the supply of vaccine in Marietta, Pa., under
the control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox vaccine is still needed at CDC for scientists who work
with the virus. But serious problems with quality control have
stopped vaccinations, creating an acute problem for a very select
group of scientists in the United States and, in the event of an
emergency, a much wider group of people.
</P>
<P>
   Crumbling rubber stoppers on vials are letting in moisture, and
a brilliant green dye is inexplicably losing its color, but the
vaccine remains near normal potency, Federal experts say. The
bigger problem is that the American supply of a colorless liquid
medicine, known as vaccinia immune globulin, which is needed to
counteract adverse reactions to the vaccine, has turned pink for
reasons no one understands. Federal rules say the medicine must be
on hand before vaccinations are given, and the Food and Drug
Administration has barred its use until the mystery is solved.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication is that new batches of vaccine cannot be
made with the old process, since today that process would fail to
pass the FDA's more rigorous standards.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, prompted in part by Alibek's revelations, the
Pentagon embarked on a $322 million program to make new vaccines
for the military, including smallpox. The earliest it will be
ready, officials say, is 2005 _ if it can pass FDA muster. That
will be difficult. Because the disease no longer exists and the
virus is too lethal to unleash on people, clinical trials cannot be
conducted to test whether or not the new vaccine actually helps
humans resist smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, they're going to have to make a fairly substantial
judgment call,'' Steve Pryor, president of Dynport, the Pentagon's
vaccine contractor, said of FDA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Civil authorities in Washington want at least 40 million doses
of new smallpox vaccine, and health experts like Henderson, who now
heads a center for the study of bioterrorism at Johns Hopkins, are
calling for 100 million. Talks are under way for Dynport to produce
vaccine for civilian use as well, but nothing to date has been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some experts question the whole vaccine approach as a
germ warfare safeguard. Foes, they say, knowing well in advance
about vaccinations, might counter them by switching to a different
germ or a different variant, perhaps genetically engineered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensive measures are much more difficult than offensive
ones,'' said William C. Patrick III, who made germ weapons for the
United States before President Nixon outlawed them three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such threats are helping fuel a search for new ways to combat
smallpox and related viruses, including the development of new
kinds of anti-viral drugs. Unlike vaccines, such drugs, if found
workable, might be administered long after exposure to save
infected victims, attacking the virus directly rather than relying
on the body's immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the National Academy of Sciences released a 108-page
report listing new research frontiers, many of which American and
Russian scientists are already pursuing, such as trying to
understand the genetic secrets that make the virus so deadly.
Combined with the intelligence assessment that other countries were
harboring smallpox for military use, the academy report influenced
the Clinton administration's decision to forgo destruction of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The great unknown, experts say, is whether the benefits of such
planning will ever be needed in a crisis and, if so, whether the
protections will work as envisioned. But the consensus is that
action is nonetheless needed.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, federal experts meeting in Atlanta reviewed
the germ threats facing the nation. Smallpox came out on top.
Second was anthrax, which causes high fevers and death but is not
contagious. In comparison, smallpox spreads like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unanimous that smallpox is the primary threat,'' said
Henderson, who attended the federal meeting. ``The likelihood of an
attack is small, but were it to occur it would be a real
catastrophe.''

 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARQUETTE, Mich. _ Stand on the southern shore of Lake Superior,
looking out at its gently tossing, deep blue immensity, and it is
hard to imagine anyone here ever feeling short of water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the aftermath of a Canadian company's plan to send a
tanker full of lake water to Asia for bottling and sale as drinking
water, the very notion of shipping any of it abroad stirs anger
along both sides of the border in the Great Lakes region. Although
the company's plan was halted last year, a visitor need only walk
along the docks here to find universal hostility to water exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give one eye-dropperful away to anybody _ this is
our water,'' Ronald Pederson, a local boater, said as he sat
sipping coffee on a bench at a marina here Sunday morning, wearing
a white T-shirt that said, ``Michigan Lighthouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The water exports issue seems to be attracting more attention
these days because of a decline in Great Lakes water levels. The
problem is not water exports (there aren't any), but, with boaters
snagging propellers and running aground in unexpected places,
anything that has even the potential to affect the amount of water
in the lakes is suddenly of more than passing interest.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists attribute the drop in levels, which have always
varied somewhat, to unusually warm weather and below-average
precipitation. The level in Lake Superior, which has the cleanest
water in the Great Lakes and hence the most attractive for any
would-be water exporters, has dropped only three inches in the last
12 months, making it now seven inches below average for this time
of year. But levels in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron have plunged
two feet in the last year, one of the largest drops ever recorded.
Both lakes are now a foot below average.
</P>
<P>
   Some water from Lake Michigan is diverted each year to the
Mississippi River _ enough, in fact, to fill a tanker every two
hours. But this diversion, which was first undertaken in 1848 and
provides extra water to help river barges float over sandbanks, is
strictly limited by a Supreme Court decision. American and Canadian
officials say they are not aware of any additional proposals to
divert or export water from the Great Lakes, at least since the
death of the plan by the Canadian company, which would have filled
its tanker on the Canadian side of the border but, after
controversy, lost its permit from the Ontario government.
</P>
<P>
   Various exporting plans are being developed, however, to pump
water out of other lakes, in Canada and Alaska. The issue has
prompted so much concern that Canada barred water exports in
February and, with an eye on the possibility that further proposals
might involve the Great Lakes themselves, joined the United States
in asking for a study by the International Joint Commission, a
90-year-old bilateral agency that regulates water issues along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Great Lakes water is seen as such a potentially exportable asset
to begin with because the lakes hold a fifth of all the world's
available fresh water, excluding the polar ice caps, at a time when
freshwater supplies in East Asia and the Middle East are becoming
polluted or depleted by rising populations.
</P>
<P>
   The water in Lake Superior accounts for more than half of all
Great Lakes water, and is also the cleanest. Superior has never had
many people or much heavy industry on its shores, and regulations
have so reduced the flow of sewage and other water pollution into
it that almost all the pollution still entering the lake is that
which simply drifts into it out of the air.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute here is such that even the North American Free Trade
Agreement has been dragged into it. Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat
whose district has 1,500 miles of shoreline on Lakes Superior,
Michigan and Huron, has been warning that if water exports begin,
lake water might become subject to the pact. In that case, future
efforts to restrict exports might be deemed an unfair trade
barrier, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Stupak first raised the issue during the debate that led to
congressional approval of Nafta in 1993, but it attracted little
attention from his constituents, who, he said, saw little harm then
in shipping lake water to nations abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water levels were high,'' he recalled, ``and people said,
`Why don't we give them a little?'''
</P>
<P>
   To allay any concerns, the Canadian, Mexican and United States
governments issued a joint statement on Dec. 2, 1993, the day
before the House of Representatives voted, that said none of the
three nations could be required by Nafta to export water. But the
statement also mentioned that water that had ``entered into
commerce'' was subject to Nafta. An American trade official who was
asked about the matter said that this mainly meant bottled water
and that even if some water from a lake was sold, the lake would
not be considered commercial. The International Joint Commission
nonetheless retained trade lawyers recently to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even as falling lake levels displease many in the
region, there are some exceptions. David L. Lange, the owner of a
propeller repair business on the northern outskirts of Green Bay,
Wis., said he had fixed 600 propellers so far this year, compared
with 350 by this time in a typical year, as a result of boaters'
hitting rocks and sandbars.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said he would be delighted if someone drained a little
additional water out of the Great Lakes for export and water levels
dropped further. ``That would be wonderful,'' he said
enthusiastically. ``The lower the better.''

SOUTHERN BAPTIST LEADER CALLS FOR CLINTON TO BE DISCIPLINED OVER
GAY PROCLAMATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The president of the Southern Baptist Convention on
Monday called for local church discipline against fellow
denomination member President Clinton for proclaiming June as Gay
and Lesbian Pride Month.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Patterson, president of the 15.7 million-member
denomination, issued the call for church discipline, as more than
14,000 convention delegates, known as messengers, converged on
Atlanta's Georgia Dome for Tuesday's opening of the national
convention's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, also president of Southeastern Baptist Theological
Seminary in North Carolina, castigated Clinton for issuing the
gay-pride proclamation last week. Every June, the U.S. gay
community observes the anniversary of the 1969 resistance to police
harassment and mistreatment at the Stonewall Inn in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (proclamation) is entirely inconsistent with his
confession as an evangelical Christian and certainly as a Southern
Baptist,'' Patterson said. ``I would call once again upon the
church in which the president holds membership to take before them
this proclamation he has made at the White House and make it the
subject of church discipline,'' Patterson said during a live
broadcast of a denominational radio program from the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's call was greeted with applause from a small audience
attending pre-meeting activities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, president of the convention's ethics and religious
liberty commission, also harshly criticized the president. ``I am
appalled that the president would abuse the office of the
presidency to call for an affirmation of a lifestyle that tens of
millions of Americans, based on their religious convictions,
believe to be a deviant lifestyle,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Later during a pastor's conference, Land said, ``I will ask that
God stay his judgment on this nation until this man is no longer
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Rex Horne of Immanuel Baptist Church of Little Rock,
Ark., Clinton's pastor, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, defended the
proclamation. ``This proclamation is about preventing
discrimination,'' Toiv said. ``It is about preventing hate crimes;
it is about every American having an equal opportunity to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation encourages ``all Americans to observe this
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities that
celebrate our diversity, and to remember throughout the year the
gay and lesbian Americans whose many and varied contributions have
enriched our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time convention leaders have called for the
church to take action on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Kentucky, called Immanuel to discipline
Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. But Clinton
issued a letter to the church apologizing for the incident and
publicly repented his role in the affair, defusing the calls for
church discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the church's seating at the annual meeting in Houston
was challenged because of Clinton's controversial order permitting
gays in the military and his appointment of gays in his
administration. The convention's credential committee ruled,
however, that a church's seating at the meeting could not be
challenged on the views of a congregant.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates voted in the Houston meeting to distance themselves
from Clinton's policies. Horne at that time said he had talked with
Clinton on the gay and abortion issues. ``We try to show grace and
love, show the straight path and encourage people to take it,''
Horne said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wiley Drake of Buena Park, Calif., said he would
introduce a resolution Tuesday ``discouraging all Americans from
observing this month in any way, other than to pray for the
repentance and salvation of those caught in this sinful
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is the minister who called for the denomination to boycott
the Walt Disney Co. because of what he perceived as anti-family,
pro-gay rights policies of the entertainment conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist denomination is nonhierarchical, and the local
church is autonomous. But the national convention, firmly
controlled by conservatives since 1979, has grabbed national
headlines with its countercultural views.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the national convention amended its doctrinal
statement calling for wives to ``graciously submit'' to their
husbands' authority.

 &HT;    Experts expect the worst of the damage from the zip virus's to
dwindle
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thursday night, Meg Wilson lost four years of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   While checking her e-mail, Wilson, a University of Texas
instructor, thought she had found a resume from a former student
she was nominating to a leadership program. What she found instead
was the Worm.Explore.Zip bug, a software virus that has struck
hundreds of thousands of computers since last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost all my (Microsoft) Word files, my PowerPoint files . .
. personal files are gone,'' Wilson said. ``That's about four years
of my life, gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Wilson was still trying to recover four gigabytes
worth of files. She said she believes she was able to get rid of
the virus _ which she thinks she got from a former student _ before
infecting 2,000 users whose names crowded her e-mail program's
inbox and who could have potentially been exposed to the worm.
</P>
<P>
   While most Austin-area companies said they had minimal damage
from the bug _ Dell Computer Corp. officials said the company only
had minor damage and a few frozen machines _ researchers said the
virus is going global.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news: Researchers also said they believe the
worst of the Worm.Explore.Zip bug attacks are over, at least for
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   The first alerts went out last week about Worm.Explore.Zip,
which is transmitted through files sent by e-mail and activated
when a user runs the attachment, said Eric Chien, senior researcher
at Symantec Corp.'s AntiVirus Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Chien said that despite the virus' hits on companies including
AT&AMP;T, Boeing, Compaq Computer Corp. and Motorola Inc., early alerts
and distribution of anti-virus software kept most companies safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most major corporate enterprises are well aware the
virus is out there,'' Chien said. ``The worst definitely for the
U.S. is over. Most have eradicated it from their systems or
protected themselves against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Symantec's center in Santa Monica, Calif., was first alerted to
the virus June 6 when five Israeli companies spotted
Worm.Explore.Zip. The first instances of the bug in the U.S. came
three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Chien said the biggest threat now is to home users receiving
e-mail from work and in countries including Korea and China, where
many companies use outdated virus protection programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Worm bug is the third major virus to hit computers over the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Worm apparently strikes Microsoft programs, including Microsoft
Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Users are being advised to avoid
opening e-mail attachments unless they are confirmed with the
sender.
</P>
<P>
   If someone receives the virus, the e-mail should be deleted and
the trash folder should be emptied. Users are also being advised to
install and use anti-virus software or download updates for their
existing anti-virus programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the FBI was still investigating the origins of the
Worm bug as computer experts found new ways that it can spread.
</P>
<P>
   According the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie
Mellon University, the bug may be able to spread outside of e-mail
attachments. ``Further analysis has shown that, once installed, the
program may also behave as a worm, and it may be able to propagate
itself, without any human interaction, to other networked
machines,'' CERT said in a statement on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Worm bug can also spread to Macintosh computers that are
using software to run Microsoft Windows operating systems or
Macintoshes networked to Windows computers over a file-sharing
network, Symantec said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mullen, owner of Austin's PC Guru, said that while he's had
inquiries about the virus from companies in the United Kingdom and
in other parts of the U.S., he's had few calls from companies in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that most companies (here) have had sufficient
knowledge to put up protection against it,'' he said. ``This one
doesn't spread as rapidly as Melissa and is easier to detect _ if
you've got a virus that's deleting all your files, you know you've
got it.''

BOEING'S LITTLE 717 IS PUT ON CENTER RUNWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE BOURGET, France _ Boeing's centerpiece at the Paris Air Show
here is not one of its famous wide-body jumbo jets but the newest
and smallest member of its fleet, a stub-nosed little passenger jet
called the 717.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. flew in one of the first production models of the
twin-engine, 100-seat aircraft to put on display, and it is
planning to take it on a 10-city European tour after the air show
ends this weekend. Its executives are telling anyone who will
listen how inexpensive the 717 is to operate, how its new engines
surpasses even the most rigorous noise standards, and how it
provides travelers with as much overhead stowage space as a 747
jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people in the commercial aerospace industry think that
the 717 already has one foot in the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The reason illustrates the challenges Boeing faces as it tries
to right itself and compete against Airbus Industrie, the European
consortium, after two disastrous years in which its commercial
airplane division wrote off $4 billion and missed out on the
biggest aviation-industry boom in history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision to build the 717 was made four years ago,
Boeing has sold only 117 of them. Last year, Airbus also decided to
enter the market for 100-seat jets. It announced its offering, the
A318, in April and has already booked more than 100 orders.
</P>
<P>
   Making money selling 100-seat jets is difficult because they are
expensive to build and airlines do not want to pay very much for
them. But Airbus and Boeing forecast that 2,000 to 2,600 planes
capable of carrying 70 to 100 passengers each would be bought by
airlines over the next 20 years. They do not want to cede that
market to each other, or to the three manufacturers of 50- and
70-seat regional jets _ Embraer of Brazil, Bombardier of Canada and
Fairchild Dornier, a German unit of Fairchild Aerospace _ who are
talking about building larger 100-seat models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not launched the A318, we would have created a
vacuum,'' said John Leahy, Airbus' commercial director. ``We need
to have a full product line.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus' solution was to shrink its 124-seat, twin-engine A319 to
create the 318. Like all Airbus jets, the A318, which will start
flying in 2002, will have common cockpit displays and controls. One
of Airbus' strongest selling points is that pilots can move from
one of its models to another with minimum training, which can add
up to millions of dollars in savings for carriers.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes the cost of the A318 easier to justify because
airlines that buy it will then have an incentive to order the
larger, more lucrative Airbus jets.
</P>
<P>
   The 717, on the other hand, has little in common with Boeing's
other models. Indeed, it started life at the McDonnell Douglas
Corp. as the MD-95, a successor to the successful DC-9. Boeing
inherited the plane after it bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts thought that Boeing would cancel the MD-95, just
as it decided to stop making the other McDonnell Douglas models.
But after several months, Boeing announced that it would add the
jet to its product line and christened it the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many doubted Boeing's commitment to the new plane and
speculated that the company had no choice but to keep the project
going because it would have had to pay heavy penalties to a
suppliers if it canceled development.
</P>
<P>
   When the company announced a review of all its operations
earlier this year, promising to eliminate planes that were ``value
destroyers,'' many analysts speculated that the 717 was at the top
of the list. Some industry executives even now believe that Boeing
is taking the 717 on tour as a prelude to canceling it by
fulfilling its contractual obligations to suppliers to make its
best sales effort.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing denies that. The idea that the company would cancel the
717 after most of the investment in the jet had already been made
was ludicrous, Alan Mulally, chief of the commercial airplane
division, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chief executive, sent a
letter to Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's, assuring the rating
agencies that Boeing was firmly behind the jet. The same month,
Boeing executives flew a 717, which is made at the old McDonnell
Douglas plant in Long Beach, Calif., to their Seattle headquarters
in an effort to promote the aicraft within company ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who gets a look at the plane really likes it,'' said
Joseph Leonard, chairman and chief executive of Airtran, which is
scheduled to begin flying the first 717 in October. He estimated
that the plane would cost Airtran 10 to 12 percent less to operate
than its current fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the slightest bit concerned about the number of
sales,'' he said. ``The 737 wasn't a very big seller in the early
days, and it became the best selling airplane of all time.''

HOW TO STOP THE SPURS: KNICKS PONDER THE WAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Chris Childs remembers the game with such
clarity that he grimaces and shakes his head when recalling the
details. The images of that debacle against the San Antonio Spurs _
almost 15 months ago _ are as fresh and focused as the film the
Knicks watched Monday in preparations for Game 1 of the National
Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were in similarly dire injury straits for that game
in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing and Chris Dudley were sidelined and the Knicks
started a super-small lineup, with Charles Oakley at center, Larry
Johnson at power forward and three guards. To exploit that, the
Spurs started three 7-footers with Will Perdue joining the regulars
David Robinson and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Spurs 95, Knicks 78.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was matched up with Charlie Ward, who went 0 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them everything,'' Childs said before the Knicks
arrived in San Antonio via chartered jet Monday evening. ``We gave
them inside. Outside. We became a stationary ball club. We tried to
play them in the halfcourt set where their legs and strength took
advantage of us. You can't play them the same way. We're a
different team now. We're a lot smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the Knicks will suffer the same fate now, even if
Johnson is unable to play in this series. His availability for Game
1 will be determined at game time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas on the team, and Dudley
healthy, the Knicks _ even without Ewing _ are in better shape
inside. When everyone is healthy, the Knicks' depth is so deep they
rarely worry about foul trouble. Now, because fouls follow Thomas
and Dudley around like lost puppies, managing their time will be
one of Coach Jeff Van Gundy's greatest burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said he learned more from the teams' first meeting
last season, a 90-84 Knicks loss in which there were more
conventional matchups. In that game, Duncan, just a few weeks into
his rookie season, and Robinson each scored 23 points, and Ewing,
who had not yet sustained his wrist injury, had 25 points and 15
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has been circumspect about how the Knicks will defend
Duncan and Robinson. Dudley figures that neither can be stopped
entirely and that the Knicks will have to mix their defenses just
to limit their offensive production. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks double-team them, they must hope the guards Avery
Johnson, Mario Elie and the small forward Sean Elliott can't beat
the Knicks by themselves. While Duncan (21.5 points a game) and
Robinson (15.2) are the Spurs' leading scorers in the playoffs, the
much-traveled Johnson has quietly emerged with 14.1 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feasible, but I'm not sure you'd want to go with the
double-team on both of them the entire game because it opens up too
much for everyone else,'' Van Gundy said. ``With Avery Johnson, no
matter where he has played, the strategy was `Make Avery Johnson
beat you.' And that's what he always does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Camby, who will be in the middle of this maelstrom, trying
to use his long arms and legs against either Robinson or Duncan, is
convinced that the Knicks will not be able to play them straight up
for an entire game without getting a lesson in why each is regarded
as a most valuable player candidate. ``Definitely, they are our
main concern,'' Camby said. ``Not just one player can guard them.
We're definitely going to have to rely on some help at some point.
I'm not going to tell you if we're going to double or triple, but
they're definitely going to command some double-teams at some time.
They're that great of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy would not say Monday whether Camby or Thomas would
start if Johnson is out, but at least the Knicks will have a bigger
lineup than they did when the Spurs pounded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give them everything,'' Van Gundy said. ``You can't
give them perimeter and post, transition and second shots. You have
to do something to limit some parts of their game. That's one of
the reasons we were effective against Indiana; we took away their
3-point game. Any team that's really dominant, as they have been,
is balanced. Teams that are inconsistent you can exploit because
they have weaknesses. This team has no weaknesses; that's why
they've won 10 playoff games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Knicks can hope to limit is still unclear. Because
Duncan and Robinson are both shot-blocking threats, the Knicks
would like to draw one of them away from the basket to play
perimeter defense. But if Johnson is out, the Knicks lose a scorer
with size who can shoot from long range.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will run even more than they did against Indiana with
Latrell Sprewell (who will match up with Sean Elliott, a player he
says is so similar to him that it is like playing against a mirror)
and Allan Houston (against Elie) trying to drive into the lane,
headlong into the twin oaks planted there, hoping to draw a foul
from Robinson or Duncan, who have each fouled out only once in
their 12 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about penetrating and driving, but it's
easier said than done,'' Sprewell said. ``We still have to attack
those guys. We can't worry about them blocking shots. We can't be
timid. We have to be aggressive and try to get them in foul
trouble. We can do it. But I don't know how effective it's going to
be.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders decided Monday to separate
gun-control proposals from a piece of broader juvenile-crime
legislation and put the measures in their own distinct bill, a
surprising change in strategy that underscored the sensitivity of
the issue and instantly gave rise to conflicting interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were trying to make sure that new
restrictions on firearms had a fair shot at passing the House. That
outcome would be less likely, these Republicans said, if the
measures remained in a bill laden with so many other contentious
issues that it practically begged lawmakers on both the right and
the left to vote against it, leaving too narrow a center for
success.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the Republicans' decision was really a tactic to
try to ensure the failure of gun control. By this thinking,
Republicans who wanted to vote against gun control had found a way
nonetheless to pass some legislation and deflect accusations that
they were doing nothing in response to the school shooting in
Littleton, Colo., two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is really about is an attempt to give the interest
groups who want to kill this legislation the best chance,'' said
Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority leader. ``I think it's
pretty clear what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who helped write the juvenile
crime bill, said that the new approach merely aimed to make sure
that the debate and votes on other aspects of the legislation, like
tougher penalties for children who commit crimes and new
restrictions on violence in entertainment, did not get lost in all
the attention being paid to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that, as a practical matter, there's going to be
any substantive difference in the outcome,'' McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, McCollum's crime bill, which allocates new
federal money for the prosecution and prevention of juvenile crime,
would be the vehicle for amendments that dealt with cultural and
religious matters, like one that proposes criminal penalties for
adults who let children have access to material with extreme
violence in it. This whole package would be debated and decided one
day this week.
</P>
<P>
   But gun-control measures would be considered either the day
before or after, and those provisions that succeeded would become
their own bill. If the House passed that bill, it would be combined
with the juvenile crime legislation without any additional vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were political calculations at work as the House Rules
Committee began Monday to consider about 175 proposed amendments to
the juvenile crime bill and Republican leaders gave hints of which
amendments would reach the floor, and how.
</P>
<P>
   By putting gun control in its own box, leaders had given its
fiercest Republican opponents a way to vote for conservative
cultural measures and tougher enforcement of crime without
approving any new restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But they had also given Democrats opposed to aspects of the
legislation a way to vote for gun control. Senior Republican aides
said that Republican leaders felt they had to get some gun-control
measures through the House, or Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who had
virtually promised that outcome, would suffer a potentially
debilitating embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said that the Rules Committee would probably
permit about eight modest gun-control measures, mostly addressing
the same issues as the provisions that the Senate passed, to reach
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   For mandatory background checks on buyers at gun shows,
Republican leaders would likely allow three alternatives of varying
strictness, with sponsorships that reflected interesting political
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The most lenient gun-show measure, in line with the wishes of
the National Rifle Association, is likely to bear the names of six
Democrats. The harshest measure has at least one Republican joining
two Democrats as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   But for other new restrictions on firearms, like child safety
devices on handguns, the Rules Committee would probably refer just
one measure, without any alternative, to the floor, Republican
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   A list of possible measures and their sponsors suggested some
cunning planning. For example, Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who
represents a district that has been getting increasingly
Democratic, has his name attached to a measure that bans firearm
ownership for any adult who has committed a violent crime as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that Republican leaders were playing every
angle: giving gun control a way to fail while also setting
themselves up, by putting Republican names on many measures, to
claim some credit if it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a peculiar procedure from the beginning,'' said
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, the chairman of the House Democratic
Conference, ``and it's only getting more peculiar every day.''

CLINTON AND YELTSIN CONFER BUT FAIL TO RESOLVE IMPASSE OVER RUSSIAN
TROOOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and other senior American leaders
spoke with their counterparts in Russia on Monday but were unable
to resolve the impasse over Russian troops that has marred the
beginning of the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American officials tried to put the best face on the military
and diplomatic mess, but it was clear that Russia and the United
States remain far apart on critical questions arising from Russia's
demand to take part in the Kosovo military operation on its own
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Four high-level telephone conversations took place on Monday
between Washington and Moscow, but officials appear to have made
little progress in settling such issues as the size of the Russian
military contingent in Kosovo, its command structure and its
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia for 23
minutes on Monday morning, their second conversation in two days.
Aides described the talk as ``good,'' but offered few details. The
two leaders agreed to dispatch their foreign and defense ministers
to Helsinki, Finland, this week for further talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to meet Yeltsin this weekend in Cologne,
Germany, at the annual meeting of leaders of the major industrial
democracies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke with Igor Ivanov,
the Russian foreign minister, twice on Monday, officials in
Washington said. Vice President Al Gore telephoned Sergei
Stepashin, the Russian prime minister, and the two spoke for about
45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the conversation, Stepashin said that Russia intended to
play ``a substantial role'' in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation
under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In their conversations with the Russians, the American officials
were trying to determine, among other things, who ordered the
armored Russian column of about 200 soldiers to enter Kosovo last
Friday night in advance of NATO troops. The NATO soldiers were
supposed to form the vanguard of the forces being deployed to
police the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, speaking at a briefing for reporters in the White
House, said there was apparent confusion in Russia and in
Yugoslavia over the Russian military move. She said she assumed
that Yeltsin had given the order but that the Russian military
``got out one step ahead'' of the political leadership in Moscow by
moving prematurely into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior aide said, though, that it was clear to American
officials that Yeltsin had given the order to move Russian troops
into Kosovo. He contended that Yeltsin is enjoying the confusion he
has sown in Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that administration officials sought assurances
that no additional Russian troops would move into Kosovo until
their zone of influence and questions of command and control are
settled at the Helsinki talks. There have been indications in
Moscow of preparations to dispatch troops to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stress that we welcome Russian participation'' in
the peacekeeping operation, Albright said on Monday. But she said
that the administration was sticking to its insistence on ``unity
of command'' in Kosovo, meaning that all troops operating there
would report to a single NATO commander.

   WAL-MART AGREES TO BUY BRITISH SUPERMARKET CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   In its first foray into Britain, Wal-Mart Stores agreed to pay
$10.8 billion in cash for Asda Group, Britain's third-largest
supermarket chain, thwarting a rival suitor at the last moment and
threatening other British retailers with a potentially devastating
price war. The takeover agreement is part of Wal-Mart's aggressive
buying spree in Europe, where tight zoning regulations make it
almost impossible to build big, new stores, leaving entrants into
the businesses of supermarkets and large convenience stores no
option but to acquire existing chains.

   GREENSPAN SOUNDS NOTE OF CAUTION
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, warned that increases in business efficiency could not
counterbalance the strains on the economy forever. But he did not
directly address the prospect of an increase in short-term interest
rates later this month.

   STOCKS MIXED AS NASDAQ TUMBLES
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices were mixed and activity remained subdued as traders
and investors delayed putting money to work before an important
inflation report scheduled for release tomorrow. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 72.82 points, or seven-tenths of a percent,
to 10,563.33. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was flat,
rising 0.36 point, to 1,294.00. But the Nasdaq composite index,
fell 49.57 points, or 2.03 percent, to 2,398.31. The yield on the
30-year Treasury fell to 6.09 percent.

   Seeking to prove that America Online had deceived the judge in
the government's antitrust trial against Microsoft about its plans
to compete with the software giant, Microsoft put its most
important rebuttal witness on the stand, David Colburn, a senior
executive from the on-line service. But several people dozed
through the questioning, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told
Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, to hurry up and finish.

NATO TROOPS FIND SCORES OF FRESHLY DUG GRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KACANIK, Yugoslavia _ American soldiers on Monday sealed off
areas around this small town in southeastern Kosovo where other
NATO troops found what they said could be graves containing the
remains of scores of civilians killed by Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   At one site, a local cemetery, British troops found what
appeared to be 80 freshly dug graves with simple markers.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers and members of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrilla
force showed reporters a narrow ravine just outside Kacanik that
contained a half dozen jackets and shirts that appeared to have
bullet holes in the shoulder and chest areas.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were among the belongings of more than 50 people
they said were killed by Serbs on April 9 in retaliation for a
Kosovo Liberation Army ambush the day before that killed a half
dozen Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That night, they said heavy equipment was seen digging what
appeared to be a large mass grave in the local cemetery. But the
British soldiers taking control of the area discovered as many as
80 freshly dug individual graves in the cemetery, which they
believe could hold the bodies of the victims. The site was sealed
off, awaiting International War Crimes Tribunal investigators who
may arrive this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the individual graves were what the
villagers said they saw being dug by the equipment in April. NATO
spokesmen also have accused the Serbs of exhuming the bodies of
execution victims from mass graves in recent days and then
reburying them in individual graves.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said this pattern occurred in Hallac, a village in
central Kosovo, where they said 20 people were killed in mid-April,
dug up more recently and then reburied in individual graves.
</P>
<P>
   If, as NATO officials suspect, this was part of an attempt to
cover up mass killings, the aim theoretically would be to try to
create the impression that the buried bodies were of people who
died individually in combat, not in a mass execution.

Hyman is something of a maverick and does not come from the ranks

QwEST SHARES PLUNGE 24 PERCENT IN BID'S WAKE  
(With QWEST-USWEST-ASSESS) 
(ms) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Qwest Communications International Inc.,
the upstart telecommunications company, plummeted 24 percent Monday
after investors panned its $55 billion bid for both U S West, the
Denver-based local telecommunications concern, and Frontier Corp.,
one of the nation's long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest is hoping to woo U S West, one of the regional Bell
companies, and Frontier, the former Rochester Telephone, away from
the embrace of rival Global Crossing Ltd., which had agreed to buy
both concerns. Qwest, like the Bermuda-based Global Crossing, has a
lofty stock price fueled by the promise of high-flying growth
stemming from the Internet. Qwest is building an Internet fiber
optic network to link 150 metropolitan areas in the United States,
and hopes to expand into Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, said investors were
confused about how to value the combination that would marry the
more traditional telephone assets of U S West with the fast-growing
Qwest stock. Technology stocks, too, particularly Internet shares,
took a beating Monday, which also accounted for some of Qwest's
decline, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only winners here are Frontier and U S West,'' Burnett
said. But, he warned that neither Global Crossing nor Qwest would
easily emerge as the victor in what is likely to be a lengthy and
bitter battle for U S West and Frontier. ``This is not a short
race, but a marathon,'' he said. Plus, it is possible that Qwest
might try to acquire just one of the companies, most likely
Frontier, instead of both, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is the deal Qwest announced Sunday was not nearly
as attractive to U S West and Frontier shareholders after Qwest's
stock declined Monday. Qwest said two days ago that it would offer
U S West shareholders stock valued between $78 and $80 a share. For
Frontier's part, Qwest would give shareholders $20 in cash plus
stock valued between $53 and $55. But in one of Qwest's most active
days on record, the stock fell $10.75 a share, to $34.125. With the
lower price, analysts said Qwest would pay U S West shareholders
about $60 in stock. Frontier shareholders would receive about $61
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vote of disenchantment, but it is only one day,''
said Peter Schoenfeld, who heads P. Schoenfeld Asset Management in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Those values are close to the deals struck with Global Crossing,
giving investors little reason to prefer one company over the
other. Based on Monday's closing prices, Frontier shareholders
would get Global stock valued at about $63. Shareholders of U S
West could pick between two stocks _ one made up of the
combination's fast-growing Internet assets, the other, more
traditional telephone assets _ valued between $63 and $65 a share.
Shares of Global Crossing fell 37.5 cents Monday, to $50.375, while
U S West rose $3.125, to $58. Frontier rose $1.9375, to $57.375.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Nacchio, the flamboyant chief executive of Qwest,
still contended his company's offer was ``superior'' despite the
fact that the stock's decline had made the deals comparable in
price. ``This is a major inflection point in terms of our future,''
Nacchio said on a conference call. ``I'm not surprised to see some
investors move out, and I would expect others to buy in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the next few days are sure to be complicated as both U S
West and Frontier sort through the issues. U S West's board is
expected to meet this week to discuss the Qwest offer. Frontier
management is considering the Qwest offer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, for its part, reaffirmed its commitment to both
the U S West and Frontier mergers, despite recent rumors that it
was looking to get out of the deals. Robert Annunziata, Global
Crossing's chief executive, said in a statement Monday that his
company's offers for U S West and Frontier were superior, too, and
he expected both deals would close as planned. But even if Global
Crossing loses U S West, the company would earn an attractive door
prize _ U S West could have to pay Global Crossing as much as $850
million in breakup fees.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CASTLE, N.H. _ Peggy McDonald, a retired dental assistant
who lives in this speck of a town on the New Hampshire seacoast,
pronounced Texas Gov. George W. Bush ``adorable'' when he showed up
to give a speech Monday, then proceeded to raise a red flag about
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is well packaged,'' Mrs. McDonald said, ``but I don't know
what's in the package. I don't know what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Fairgrounds in Des Moines on Saturday night, Bonnie
Gobel, chairwoman of the Iowa Christian Coalition, marveled at
Bush's energetic presence, saying she had ``never seen a
presidential candidate draw so much excitement.'' But Mrs. Gobel
was stumped when the subject turned to Bush's position on abortion
rights, a prime issue for her organization as it considers whom to
endorse for the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the governor delivered his benchmark campaign
speech _ a broad-stroke address that offered the major themes of
his candidacy _ he has emerged as a personable and charismatic
campaigner, displaying a level of skill and taste for politicking
not seen on presidential battlegrounds since Bill Clinton first
came here eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his obvious talent at presenting himself, he has
been notably vague on this closely watched national outing about
particulars, offering only scant details amid generalities _ on
everything from taxes to military spending to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that details would come in time, and declared that he
would not be hurried into laying out any specific ideas this far
before the first caucuses and primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been pretty darn specific,'' he said in an
interview on WMUR-TV, the ABC affiliate in Manchester. ``I'll have
a tax plan. I'll have the proverbial 10-point tax plan here. But
I'm going to put it out on my own timetable. This is a long
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush pointed out, it is extremely early. And it would be
highly unusual, in most years, for a candidate to be offering any
10-point tax plans at this stage. But as has been clear from the
reaction of Republicans eager to hear Bush these past few days,
this is anything but a usual year. And that is in no small part
because of Bush's strategy of trying to present himself as his
party's de facto nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is on the cover of Time and Newsweek this week, and NBC's
evening news program televised two segments on his campaign Monday.
That is the kind of coverage that would not typically be expected
before next February at the earliest. While it is in Bush's
political interest to remain vague for as long as possible _ the
more positions he takes, the more he risks losing the support of
voters who do not agree with him _ that might prove difficult in
this environment.
</P>
<P>
   As he traveled Monday through New Hampshire, which has a
justifiable reputation of being a state with informed voters who
ask informed questions, Bush painted in a few parts of his
political portrait. He is, he responded to a heckler in Bow, in
favor of the constitutional amendment prohibiting flag burning.
</P>
<P>
   When the heckler followed up with a sarcastic query about
whether he is also in favor of the First Amendment, which
guarantees the right of speech, Bush neatly retorted: ``You're
exercising it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush said he supported the Second Amendment, which
protects the right to keep and bear arms. Bush said he backed some
restrictions on the gun purchases, but added: ``I believe that
people ought to be able to bear weapons. I believe that's part of
the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor was fuzzy in responses on abortion rights. He
said he would not automatically reject judicial candidates because
they did not share his views on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no litmus test except for whether or not the
judges will strictly interpret the Constitution,'' he said. ``I am
not a lawyer. My job is to pick judges who are qualified to serve
on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice, however, he avoided saying whether he would question
prospective judges about their views on abortion, or whether their
replies would help guide his selection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if elected, his first two priorities would be
pushing through a tax cut and increasing military spending. He said
he would support cuts in the marginal tax rates as well as programs
to provide tax relief specifically to poorer families. He also said
he might be open to a fundamental restructuring of the tax code,
although he declined to provide details.

   He said he opposed affirmative action but declined to say
whether he supported Proposition 209, the California measure passed
in 1996 that prohibited race- and sex-based preferences in state
hiring and contracting and college admissions.

   For all his vagaries, Bush clearly signaled Monday that he
intends, to some extent, to run in the Republican primaries against
someone who is not even on the ballot: President Clinton. He
invoked Clinton's difficulties when he was asked about passages in
his new stump speeches decrying a ``if it feels good, do it,''
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for any of us, who assume high office,
to understand that when we put our hand on the Bible, that we're
swearing not only to uphold the laws of the land, but that we are
swearing to uphold the dignity of the office to which we've been
elected,'' Bush said, raising his right hand as he recalled his own
oath of office, as cameras clicked furiously.

 &HT;    `Seriously ill' Bullock released from hospital
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, suffering from
congestive heart failure, left an Austin hospital for home care
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very seriously ill,'' said Bullock's longtime friend,
Ralph Wayne, head of the Texas Civil Justice League and a former
state representative from Plainview. ``His friends are praying for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, considered the last of the great legends of Texas
politics, had been diagnosed with lung cancer four and a half
months ago, the latest in a series of maladies he has battled for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But recent struggles with pneumonia pointed to the coronary
condition, an often slow deterioration of the heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Ed Small said Bullock, whom Small saw a month ago,
told him he was feeling well despite his appearance to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want anyone to feel sorry for him, that's for
sure,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who underwent heart bypass surgery in 1994, had a
pacemaker implanted last fall to correct an irregular heart beat.
He entered the Austin Heart Hospital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock retired as lieutenant governor in January after serving
eight years in what is considered Texas' most powerful elective
office. A recovering alcoholic and chain smoker, he had one-third
of his right lung removed in 1972 because of nonmalignant tumors,
suffered a heart attack in 1979 and had the bypass operation
shortly before he won his second term in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His dominion of the Texas Senate as its presiding officer _ and
of Texas politics in the 1980s and '90s _ was shaped by an iron
will and statewide relationships built from 40 years in politics,
either in office as state representative, secretary of state, state
comptroller or in practicing law or in the Austin lobby corps.
</P>
<P>
   Osler McCarthy writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

   NEW YORK _ Gail Collins, an editorial writer for The New York
Times, has been appointed an Op-Ed Page columnist for the duration
of the 2000 political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made Monday by Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the
paper's publisher, and Howell Raines, the editorial page editor.
They said the assignment would draw on Ms. Collins' experience with
the political scene, both locally and nationally. Her column will
appear twice a week, and she will return to editorial writing after
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the editorial board in 1995, Ms. Collins, 53, was
a columnist at The Daily News from 1985 to 1991 and at New York
Newsday, from 1991 to 1995. She also worked as a financial
journalist for United Press International in New York from 1982 to
1985, and was a Bagehot Fellow in Economic Journalism at Columbia
University from 1981 to 1982.

   BALTIMORE _ Seven years ago, a group of engineering students at
Johns Hopkins University here was given $2,000 and an assignment:
Build a ``smart'' gun, a gun that could be fired only by its owner.
Using off-the-shelf equipment, the students developed a prototype
that, with wires hanging out of it, was neither attractive nor
practical. But it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty,'' recalled Stephen Teret, director of the
Gun Policy and Research Center at the Johns Hopkins School of
Public Health. ``But if three undergrads with $2,000 and no gun
experience could make it, it means others could do the same, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, has not proved to be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the idea of a smart gun _ a gun that could
not be fired accidentally by a child or violently by a criminal who
stole it _ came up, it has come to be seen as a quick fix, cited in
lawsuits and in legislatures by gun-control advocates. So far,
legislation requiring that within five years all new handguns be
smart guns is pending before statehouses in at least eight states:
New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode
Island, Massachusetts and California. And lawsuits to hold gun
makers financially responsible for not incorporating smart-gun
technology have been filed by New Orleans and 17 other
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pressure for smart guns grows, it is becoming
increasingly clear that they may not be the simple fix many
proponents think they are. For one thing, no workable smart gun is
in sight, and as with so much in the national gun debate, its
development is mired in disputes, technological problems and even
questions about whether smart guns are, in fact, really a smart
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to smart guns, there's no great fix out there
right now,'' said Joshua Horowitz, a lawyer with the Coalition to
Stop Handgun Violence, a gun-control group in Washington.
``Everyone who has looked at it said there is no quick, feasible
way of doing this. For people like us, there's a question of a
balancing point: Would smart guns increase gun sales or would they
save lives? And, from the industry's perspective, no one wants to
do it until they all have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gun makers welcome smart guns as a marketing opportunity to
improve sagging handgun sales; other gun makers oppose them as a
first step on a slippery slope toward gun control. Some gun-control
advocates say smart guns could cut down on the thousands of deaths
and injuries caused each year by suicide, homicide and
unintentional shootings. Other gun-control advocates oppose them,
saying smart guns could encourage people who might not have guns to
buy them, increasing the risk of handgun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Rifle Association has officially remained
neutral on smart-gun technology, many of its members have lobbied
against it in various legislative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest in smart guns is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy to invent an affordable and reliable smart gun
will be a trillionaire,'' said Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel of
Glock, a gun manufacturer in Smyrna, Ga. ``It's absurd to say we're
hiding this technology. Why would someone be hiding it? They'd be a
wealthy person.''
</P>
<P>
   While the debates continue, efforts are under way in Washington
to get more government money for smart-gun research and
development. The National Institute of Justice, a federal agency,
is working with Colt's Manufacturing Co. to develop a prototype
smart gun for law-enforcement officers. A first test model,
developed with $500,000 in government money, is expected to be
delivered this summer. The goal is to cut the number of police
officers killed with their own weapons by assailants, an average of
six to 10 a year, or 10 percent to 16 percent of all police deaths
in the last decade, government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Police groups are putting their efforts behind a Clinton
administration budget proposal to spend $4 million on smart-gun
technology. Colt's, along with many members of Congress, is also
seeking up to $40 million in federal grants to develop the
technology, and behind-the-scenes lobbying has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has demonstrated a model that is viable in the
marketplace,'' said Steven Sliwa, chief executive of Colt's.
``We've developed some interesting prototypes with the government,
but they haven't shown the durability and reliability needed to be
commercially viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt's lineup of semiautomatic handguns range in price at retail
from about $250 for a .22-caliber target pistol to $813 for its
.45-caliber Combat Commander. The smart-gun technology could add
$300 to $400 to the price of each gun, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the money for research is needed is simple: It is not
easy to make a smart gun. Essentially, a smart gun is a meshing of
a complicated 19th-century mechanical device, the gun, with
delicate and sophisticated computer engineering. Within the
footprint of an existing gun _ with controlled explosions, heavy
percussions and vibrations, dirty residues and high temperatures _
electronics would be embedded that would have to withstand this
high stress. It is like putting a laptop computer into a gun and
then having that computer decide when the gun will work _ and when
it will not. This is more complicated than what electronics in an
automated teller machine, in car dashboards, or even in missiles,
are asked to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, yes, smart guns are a great concept,'' said
Richard Roberts, director of special operations at the
International Union of Police Associations, which favors smart-gun
development. ``But from the street officers' level, they'll want
some real assurance that this baby will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many types of smart guns have been proposed, each with problems.
Some prototypes operate on radio waves that allow a gun to operate
when it receives a signal from an owner's ring, wristband or pin.
But other radio waves can interfere with these signals.
</P>
<P>
   There are also biometric devices like fingerprint or voice
recognition, but those pose problems with accuracy. A report
prepared by Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., on
smart guns concluded, ``It may take a generation of smart-gun
systems to come and go before a smart gun is not only common but is
favored over a nonsmart gun.''

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BUFFALO, N.Y. _ He faced 29 shots in Game 3 and ended up on the
losing end of a 2-1 score. So what would Dominik Hasek like to see
when his Buffalo Sabres face the Dallas Stars in today's 7 p.m.
Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals at Marine Midland Arena?
<TEXT>
<P>
   More action assuming, of course, that means his teammates are
picking up the pace at the other end, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to stop the puck, whether it's 20 shots or 40
shots,'' Hasek said Monday. ``We have to create more chances. We
have to score more goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the Sabres to avoid falling behind three games to one in
the best-of-seven series, The Dominator may have to dominate on an
even grander scale.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has been bad so far, by any means. The Czech has
kept Dallas very much in check for most of the first three games,
stopping 90 of 96 shots. (The Stars' other goal was an empty-netter
at the end of Game 2.)
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, however, has scored just six goals against the league's
best defensive team, and so far that hasn't been enough to get the
job done. Before a raucous sellout crowd Saturday night, the Sabres
managed just 12 shots on goal, three each in the first and third
periods.
</P>
<P>
   With its defensemen laying back, Buffalo's front line fizzled on
all eight power-play opportunities, further adding to local
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason our defense didn't want to get involved the
other night,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said Monday. ``It wasn't our
game plan to have them pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success in the first few rounds was because we pinched,
because we got five guys involved. Typically, we didn't give up a
lot, even though we played like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's brilliance makes that sort of risk-taking not only
possible but profitable. Buffalo, the No. 7 seed in the East, got
to the Stanley Cup Finals by pressing the issue and relying on the
fellow generally considered the greatest goaltender in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 games leading up to the Finals, Buffalo scored 50
goals. Often as not, the Sabres forced the attack with the
knowledge that the man with the Slinky for a spine could make up
for most of the defensive gaps that sort of strategy might create.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get back to that,'' Ruff said. ``We're going to
harp on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Dallas, that aggression has been muted, in part by the
Stars' smothering defense. Buffalo managed to split the first two
games in Texas despite scoring only five goals, but that offense
ground to a halt in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is no way to win a Stanley Cup, and the Sabres
realize they will have to get more heat on Stars goalie Ed Belfour
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to win the game,'' Hasek said, ``when you
only have 12 shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the presence in the other net, that total is
particularly galling. Hasek was Belfour's backup when the two
played together in Chicago, and it has become clear that no love
was lost between them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his former teammate's relative inactivity in Game 3,
Hasek grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's true,'' he said. ``But that's the way the Dallas
Stars play. They play well defensively and block many shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek has stopped most of what he has seen at the other end. He
has done so despite a groin injury that some have reported as a
hernia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I can feel it every day in practice and in games,''
he said. ``Once the puck drops, I don't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Hasek and the rest of the Sabres can't avoid pondering
once the puck drops tonight, however, is the make-or-break nature
of this Game 4. Should Dallas win, the Stars would have three
chances to close things out, and they have not lost three
consecutive games all season.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the toughest game of the series,'' Dallas
center Mike Modano said. ``There's no doubt about that in anybody's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when you get outplayed on your home ice, there's a
response, a major regrouping.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, in fact, faced an almost identical situation in the
Western Conference finals against Colorado. After losing Game 1 at
home, Dallas won Game 2, shut the Avalanche out in Game 3 in Denver
and had a chance to take a stranglehold in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars fell behind early in that one, battled back, then lost
in overtime. Coach Ken Hitchcock has made sure to mention the
similarities in the hope that recent history doesn't repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful game, a great game,'' he said, ``but our
players felt at the end that we didn't sacrifice enough, we didn't
pay a big enough price.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's already been discussed. We owe ourselves a tremendous
performance in Game 4 because we let ourselves down a little bit in
Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Sabres gamble to pick up the offensive pace tonight, the
Stars should have their share of chances to redeem themselves.
Hasek knows what likely is coming, but he can still do the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win three out of four games,'' he said. ``We can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If The Dominator dominates, anything is possible, as a No. 7
seed still playing for hockey's greatest prize can attest.

 BALTIMORE: nonsmart gun.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, lawsuits calling for smart guns press on. Many suits
against gun makers have been filed by the same lawyers who sued the
auto industry seeking seat belts and airbags. Unlike the carmakers,
with their deep financial resources and large
research-and-development staffs, the gun industry is a collection
of small, marginally profitable companies _ the combined revenues
of all gun makers is only about $2 billion a year. By contrast,
Ford and General Motors each has revenues of over $140 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the industry is simply waiting for the government to
foot the bill. Steven Morton, chief executive of Oxford Micro
Devices, a semiconductor maker in Newtown, Conn., is working on a
fingerprint-activated gun. But he has yet to find a gun maker to
join him in a venture he estimates will take up to two years and
cost at least $5 million in research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun makers tell me they want to wait,'' Morton said. ``They
feel that sooner or later, Congress will put up the money for
research. So they are simply waiting for Congress to pay for
something so they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Mossberg, a vice president at O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, a
gun maker in New Haven, Conn., that is working on a smart gun,
said, ``We'd love to get government funds, but not with strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   As a debate rages in Congress over gun-control legislation _ a
measure focusing on who buys guns and how they are sold _ the
efforts to get more money directed to smart-gun technology are
taking place quietly, out of the spotlight. The important word here
is quiet _ no gunmaker or member of Congress wants to alienate the
National Rifle Association. A Washington lobbyist said the first
question asked by many members of Congress when approached about
financing for smart-gun research was, ``Where is the NRA on this
issue?''
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers understand that technology used to develop a smart
gun for law-enforcement officers, whose needs are more specialized
than the average citizen, could later be spun off for a civilian
model. The common notion is that an officer's gun would have to be
more durable, reliable and would be used under more circumstances,
outdoors and inside, in heat and in cold, than handguns used by
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Because police officers are so skeptical of new equipment _ it
took over 30 years for many police forces to accept
bullet-resistant vests _ a smart gun that passes muster would have
to be an engineering marvel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking cops to take a reliable product and give them a
gun that will be, by definition, less reliable,'' said Daniel
Rosenblatt, executive director of the International Chiefs of
Police. ``But, if you could get a smart gun to work, it would be
one of the most significant developments in the history of
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   From a business perspective, the law-enforcement market is small
_ there are only about 600,000 police officers in the country _
making it difficult, on a cost basis alone, to justify high
research costs. For gun makers, the real prize is the larger
civilian market, where gun sales have been falling and where a new
product might stop the slide. In 1997, the most recent year for
which statistics are available, 3.7 million firearms were
manufactured in the United States, a sizable drop from 5.2 million
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the dropoff is the big decline in handgun
sales, falling to 1.4 million in 1997 from 2.8 million units in
1993, in the wake of anti-handgun campaigns and the market's
saturation.
</P>
<P>
   A study from the Johns Hopkins University gun policy center that
appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine last year showed
that 71 percent of adults surveyed favored legislation mandating
personalized guns. Among gun owners, 59 percent favored such bills.
To gun makers, that is a sign of enormous market opportunities. To
some gun-control advocates, that is a sign of enormous problems
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun industry thinks that smart guns would allow them to
develop additional markets of 60 million new handgun owners,'' said
Kristen Rand, senior counsel at the Violence Policy Center in
Washington. ``If anything close to that would happen, we would see
a significant increase in firearms-related deaths as people get
lulled into a false sense of safety. Smart guns send a message that
handguns can be made safe and there can be magic guns where no good
people will ever be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, more cities are expected to follow New Orleans
and file lawsuits, and more bills are expected to be introduced in
more statehouses. These efforts are being led by the Johns Hopkins
center, whose director, Teret, is a former plaintiffs lawyer who
battled for airbags a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he thinks he can re-create that success.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with cars and airbags, I believe litigation will be most
effective for an industry as intransigent as the gun industry,''
Teret said. ``It's not a question of whether Beretta can afford to
design a smart gun, but whether they can afford to make a gun
without these safety devices.''

 &HT;    Sabres aren't in a panic
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ One dominating performance has put the Dallas
Stars in command of the Stanley Cup finals. Another one tonight and
the engraver can start going over the Dallas roster to make sure he
has the correct spelling on names like ``Skrudland'' and
``Nieuwendyk.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff has been telling his players to treat
Game 4 like a Game 7. Center Curtis Brown clearly picked up on the
theme Monday when he called it ``the biggest game of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   While most reporters seem to agree that Dallas could wrap it up
in two more games, the Sabres were insisting their 2-1 disadvantage
was only a temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our goaltending, speed and aggressiveness,'' Ruff said,
``we feel we can climb back in. Being down one game is not the end
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two-day layoff between games, Stu Barnes added, ``It may
be good for us. We've had time to step back and take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres also had time to get in a full practice Monday in
which Ruff reviewed a number of changes in the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed with how we played,'' Ruff said. ``But in
the same sense we were leading with five minutes left in the second
period, and played poorly. If we can get back to the way we skated
and handled the puck (earlier in the series), we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some areas where the Sabres need _ and expect _ to improve:
</P>
<P>
   Length of shifts: Ruff hopes to keep his players fresher by
limiting shifts to 30-35 seconds, down from 45-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a stretch in the first and second periods where the
changes were 2-to-1,'' Ruff said. ``Two of their lines would play
against one of ours. That type of energy took its toll on us, and
cost us (the first) goal when we didn't get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade slappers for wristers: Ten Stars blocked 19 shots, far
more than the 12 that wound up on net. Buffalo's game plan is to
create scrambles and finish rebounds, but neither can occur unless
the puck gets through in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent some time working on the wrist shots at the end of
practice,'' Ruff said. ``We've got to find a way to get it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake up Miroslav Satan: Buffalo's 40-goal scorer during the
regular season has eight points in the playoffs _ and none in this
series. His two shots on goal in Game 3 were his first of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not looking at him to find a way to score three goals;
that's not going to happen,'' linemate Joe Juneau said. ``He knows
what he can do. He can be real good for us. I think he's going to
be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Satan steps on the ice he's facing three or four of
their biggest defensemen,'' Ruff said. ``There's no way around
that; you've got to battle through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Get the defense involved: Jason Woolley and Alexei Zhitnik rank
1-2 in Buffalo playoff scoring, but neither played the aggressive,
gambling style in Game 3 they had earlier in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason our defense didn't want to get involved,''
Ruff said. ``It wasn't in the game plan to have them pull out. Our
success in the first three rounds was because we had five guys
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they collapse in the defensive zone our forwards don't
have a lot of space,'' Zhitnik said. ``If we get a chance to go in,
we've got to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Get to more loose pucks: Buffalo has a significant speed
advantage, but careless dump-ins have allowed either goaltender Ed
Belfour or the Dallas defense to gain control before the Sabres'
attack can get organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can dump it smarter, and at the right times, to give you a
better chance to get control,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Relax and enjoy: The combination of youth and playing the first
home game in the finals in 24 years resulted in the Sabres, as
Zhitnik put it, ``squeezing our sticks too tight'' in Game 3. Being
back in their familiar underdog role should make the Sabres a
looser bunch tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first round on, people were saying we shouldn't be
here,'' winger Geoff Sanderson said. ``That's partly why we've been
so successful and outplayed the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in shots and thoroughness of Dallas' win in Game 3
seems to have subdued fans in Western New York. But Ruff and his
gang insist they're as confident as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were disappointed, there was a letdown,'' Ruff said.
``But if we can go out and win Game 4 we'll get it right back to
that level.''

 &HT;    Dallas defense taking control
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The emerging dominating force in this year's
Stanley Cup finals isn't a scorer or a goaltender. It's a Dallas
defense that confounded and frustrated the Buffalo attack with 19
blocked shots in Game 3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said his philosophy doesn't call for
blocked shots as much as it demands defenders to patrol critical
areas around the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking our players that nothing gets through, whether
it's blocking with your body, your stick, or just (skating) out
from certain angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view that as an offensive tool. (Because) if we can
frustrate the opposition, make them gamble and push harder than
they want to push, we can counterattack quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the vantage point of an offensive player,'' defenseman
Daryl Sydor added, ``getting shots blocked is frustrating. Our guys
don't really like to do it; it's more a reaction thing. When you've
got guys who do it really well, you feed off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Dallas' blocked shots came against the Buffalo power
play, which totaled just one shot on goal in eight chances in Game
3. Sabres defenseman Alexei Zhitnik pointed out the Sabres broke
two sticks on a 5-on-3 advantage and were impatient on other
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not frustration, it's just part of the game,'' he said.
``If you're going to be afraid to shoot the puck, nothing's going
to happen. You have to try to make a shot _ a wrist shot, any shot
_ and maybe it'll go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabres considering changes: The two-day break between Games 3
and 4 gave Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff time to consider some lineup
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff had been playing Michael Peca, one of the league's top
defensive forwards, against the Mike Modano line, but said he was
likely to send Peca out against Joe Nieuwendyk, who had both Dallas
goals in a 2-1 win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Nieuwendyk is their best player, so we'll have to
address that situation,'' Ruff said. ``In all likelihood we'll
address Michael to him, but we still have to worry about Modano.
That's kind of a Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff also was juggling his lines, swapping wingers Joe Juneau
and Geoff Sanderson. If the changes stick, Juneau will play
alongside Curtis Brown and Miroslav Satan while Sanderson will be
paired with Stu Barnes and Brian Holzinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking was Sanderson's speed was opening things up in
the other series,'' Ruff said, ``but Joey's a better puckhandler
and a better passer, so we thought we'd take a look at it. I don't
know if we're going to stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: With their AHL team in Rochester having lost 5-1 in
the Calder Cup finals to Providence, the Sabres recalled veteran
left winger Randy Cunneyworth and two rookies, right winger Dean
Sylvester and goaltender Michel Baron.

REPORT SCOLDS BUREAUCRACY FOR U.S. NUCLEAR LAB LAPSES
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-NUKE-LEE) 
 (nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration initiatives to tighten
security at nuclear weapons laboratories are not being carried out
fully because of bureaucratic arrogance and foot-dragging, said a
scathing report issued Monday by a presidential review panel.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose
department owns the laboratories, had spoken too soon when he said
he had fixed the problem of lax security after allegations arose
that China had spied at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson ``overstated the case when he asserts, as he did
several weeks ago, `that Americans can be reassured; our nation's
nuclear secrets are today, safe and secure,' '' the White House
panel's report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Issued by the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
which studies sensitive intelligence and national security issues,
the report argues that the Energy Department has mishandled the
nation's nuclear secrets for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, it says, ``has embodied science at its
best and security of secrets at its worst.'' The report also said
the department was a ``dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it
is incapable of reforming itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel proposes a radical reorganization, calling for the
creation of a new agency, either with some autonomy within the
Energy Department or completely divorced from it, that would be put
in charge of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal appears similar to legislation proposed by several
Republican leaders in the Senate and strongly opposed by
Richardson. In an interview Monday, Richardson repeated his
opposition to the creation of an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
   More cautious measures proposed by Richardson are likely to
succumb to bureaucratic pressure, the review board argued. ``The
next secretary of energy will not have spent months at the tip of
the sword created by the recent public outcry over DOE
mismanagement of national secrets,'' the report said. ``Indeed, the
core of the department's bureaucracy is quite capable of undoing
Secretary Richardson's reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucracy has fought against President Clinton's order in
February 1998 intended to improve counterintelligence at the
national labs, the report said. ``Never before has the panel found
an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to dispute, delay and
resist implementation of a presidential directive,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The review board, chaired by Warren Rudman, a former Republican
senator from New Hampshire, was asked by Clinton to review
counterintelligence and security measures at the Energy Department
in March, in the wake of the controversy over allegations of
espionage at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman briefed Clinton on the report Monday morning, and Clinton
was ``taken aback'' by the findings that the president's directive
mandating tougher counterintelligence at the Energy Department was
meeting resistance, a senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Monday that he stood by his statement that
America's nuclear secrets were now secure, and he disagreed with
the panel's warnings that the bureaucracy was still blocking the
carrying out of tough new security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we are actively and aggressively implementing our
reforms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The review board had access to classified information about the
Los Alamos spy case and the government's investigation of Wen Ho
Lee, the scientist who was the FBI's prime suspect in the case. Lee
was fired in March after being investigated by the FBI, but he has
not been arrested or charged.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not attempt a full investigation of the handling
of that case by the FBI, Justice Department, Energy Department and
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But it did state that a review of the classified intelligence
persuaded the board to reject both extremes in the public debate
over the controversy: the view that the Chinese have acquired very
little classified information and can do little with it, and the
opposite view that the Chinese have nearly duplicated the most
advanced nuclear warhead in the American arsenal, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board agreed with the findings of an intelligence
assessment issued in April, which concluded that the Chinese had
stolen some secrets but probably not the full design plans of the
W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The board did conclude that while the Clinton administration had
moved too slowly to address the security problems at the labs, it
eventually acted more aggressively than its predecessors in seeking
to reform the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has acted forcefully, but it took
pressure from below and outside the administration to get the
attention of the leadership,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found plenty of evidence of counterintelligence
failures at the labs that had not been previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing concerned an incident that occurred
sometime after 1995, when an illegal telephone wiretap was
discovered at one of weapons labs. The employee who installed the
wiretap confessed but was not prosecuted, the report said.

COMPUTER WORM EATING CORPORATE AND INDIVIDUAL FILES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer researchers reported Monday that a virulent computer
program was spreading in a previously undisclosed way, generating
new reports of significant loss of data by major corporations and
individual computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, a government-financed
computer security organization based at Carnegie Mellon University
in Pittsburgh, said the program could spread not only by
attachments to e-mail but also over local corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, officials said, companies will need to take more
strenuous and potentially costly measures to guard against an
attack, since computers can be infected even if their users refrain
from opening suspicious e-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if even one infected machine is sharing files with other
computers on a network, the program will continually attempt to
infect those computers and to erase files on otherwise protected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a risk of continued infection,'' said Shawn Hernan, a
researcher for the response team. ``If you install anti-virus
software,'' but do not cut off the ability to share files while
each individual computer is disinfected, the program ``continually
attempts to reinfect'' computers in the network, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a type of computer infection known as a worm, was
initially detected early last week in Israel, where it is believed
to have originated, and spread to Europe and the United States
within two days. As it propagates from computer to computer, it can
destroy data along the way, preying particularly on widely used
Microsoft programs like Word and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   Although corporations and some individuals typically keep backup
copies of their data, it became evident Monday that the worm could
overcome even that precaution. Because the program expunges the
data within a file without deleting the file itself, the backup
copy may also turn out to be blank if the infection is not detected
quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of ways to make backup copies of data,''
said Dan Schrader, the vice president of new technology at Trend
Micro Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. ``Computer users should be careful
not to back up in such a way that good data is directly
overwritten.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of the program was underscored on Friday when it
destroyed data on the computer of the chief operating officer of
Trend Micro, the nation's third-largest anti-virus company.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-virus executives said new reports of infection by the
program continued to filter in, though not at the rate of late last
week. On Friday, Network Associates, based in Santa Clara, Calif.,
one of the nation's leading anti-virus software vendors, said 60
percent of its 300 large corporate customers had reported some
computers infected by the program.
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-virus researchers said that the 60 percent figure was
probably high for the national rate of infection from the worm,
known as Explore.exe for the file that launches it. Still, they
said it was likely to be as widespread as the Melissa program,
which infected about 19 percent of the nation's large corporations
in March but did not destroy files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense as of Friday is that this program is so far less
pervasive than Melissa but more destructive,'' said Peter Tippet,
chief technologist of ICSA.net, a computer security research firm
in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by ICSA indicated that Melissa had caused more
than $393 million in damage in less than a week in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   All the major anti-virus companies said their products protected
against the new infection but not against the danger of file
erasure if an infected machine was connected to the network.
</P>
<P>
   One of those companies, Symantec, said Monday that its customers
were starting to understand the scope of the damage. ``People are
looking for their data,'' said Carey Nachenberg, the company's
chief anti-virus researcher, ``and finding that stuff they didn't
even think about got destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies to have reported damage was the Storage
Technology Corp., a computer storage company, which had 100,000
files destroyed after the infection hit its Colorado headquarters
on Thursday afternoon. The files represented 600 gigabytes of data
_ roughly equal to the storage capacity of 600 late-model personal
computers. A spokesman for the company said the infection had been
contained by Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boeing Co., officials said Monday that the company's
e-mail network was shut down from 3 p.m. Thursday until 3 a.m.
Saturday to guard against spreading the infection. The company
reported some loss of data, but said much of it had been backed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that some people lost more or less important stuff,
but I'm not hearing that anything really critical got lost,'' said
David Suffia, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Imagio Technology Marketing and Communications, a Seattle public
relations firm, was also affected last week.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates, the anti-virus software company, said its
call volume had declined Monday but was still double the normal
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that on Friday and Saturday 10 million copies
of its anti-virus software were obtained over the Internet, six
times the normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our enterprise customers have got it nailed,'' said
Wes Wasson, the company's director of security product marketing.
But he added that there were new infections at smaller companies
and reports of widespread damage in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melissa showed us how fast viruses can propagate but didn't
have a warhead,'' he said. ``This one detonates.''

<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ Serbs left this city in the thousands on
Monday, jeered by ethnic Albanians who then danced on bridges and
cobblestone streets and set about the business of wiping their city
clean of the symbols of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Men smashed the windows of the Cafe Sfinga, the headquarters for
a prominent Serbian paramilitary leader; a hamburger stand; a
lawyer's office, and a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a mosque, working with a wire brush and dishwashing
detergent, two men scrubbed away the yellow spraypaint of a Serb
symbol _ meaning ``only unity can save the Serbs'' _ from a stone
fountain used by Muslims to wash before prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Serbian symbol,'' one of the men, Bahtiar Belloda, 23,
said. ``But this is our house.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were no reports of major violence, Albanians threw
rocks at carloads of departing Serbs. In the early evening _ as
Albanians banged on traditional drums and fired off guns in
celebration _ more than 100 Serbs cowered in a monastery near
downtown, waiting to find a way out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be the face of a new Kosovo: NATO peacekeepers
patrolled Prizren, as did soldiers from the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has set up checkpoints and now claims to control most of this
city in southern Kosovo. By early afternoon, there were virtually
no Serbian troops here.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian civilians, fearing revenge from ethnic Albanians, had
gone in large numbers _ no one was sure how many _ and Serbs said
the numbers would only grow.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Bogoljub Spasic, 71, showed a cut on his forehead and a
blackened right eye, saying the Kosovo Albanian rebels had beaten
him on Monday morning as they searched for a gun in his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't have a gun,' and they started to beat me,''
he said. Finally, he said, his wife, Jelica, 69, who was sitting on
her luggage at the monastery, got a gun from a Serbian police
officer and handed it over to stop the beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO gave us a guarantee of security, that the KLA would be
demilitarized,'' said a man at the monastery who would only give
his first name, Darko. ``Within two days they are inside the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   All through the night, hundreds of trucks of Serbian soldiers,
and some civilians, rumbled through town _ passing a gruesome
reminder of their defeat, the bullet-riddled car and mangled body
of one of two Serbs shot dead by German peacekeepers on Sunday
night after the Serbs opened fire. The body was finally removed in
the late morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, NATO officials said that another 300
vehicles left town, ferrying some 5,000 people north toward Serbia.
The civilians left much as the Albanians had left Kosovo over the
last two months: with anything of value that they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians lined the streets downtown, hurling stones and
screaming: ``Murderers! Thieves!''
</P>
<P>
   Masar Kuksi, a 47-year-old Albanian, recognized his own car
being driven out of town with a Serbian family inside. ``You stole
my car!'' he yelled. But it did not cloud his happiness, a feeling
that spread around the streets here for hours, as Albanians whizzed
around the streets, honking their horns and flashing victory signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing _ one car,'' he said. ``They have done worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, Kujtim Hashani, a 39-year-old electrician, cheered
the cars out of town. ``We are liberated,'' he said. ``They will
never come back. Kosovo is Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if all soldiers and civilians alike should leave, he said
there would be a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those whose hands aren't bloody can stay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But how many have bloody hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of them,'' he said.

STAGECOACH TO BUY COACH USA IN $1.24 BILLION DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Stagecoach Holdings of Scotland has agreed to buy
Houston-based Coach USA, the nation's largest operator of tour,
charter and sightseeing buses, for $1.24 billion in cash, or $42 a
share, company officials said Monday. Stagecoach, an international
bus and train company, also plans to assume $638 million of Coach
USA's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Coach USA's stock, which has closed under 30 since mid-February,
ended the day Monday at 41 3/8, up 2 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two companies have a shared background of successful
growth by acquisition, and we have found a high degree of
compatibility between the two management teams,'' Brian Souter,
Stagecoach's chairman, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   For Stagecoach, the deal means its first entry into North
America, while analysts said that for Coach USA it means more money
for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Smith, an analyst at Sanders Morris Mundy in Houston who
follows consolidators, said the $42 a share price was fair, but
might be a bit on the low end of a fair range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stagecoach is an accomplished, acquisition-oriented
transportation company just like Coach but on a larger scale,''
Smith said. ``Strategically, it makes sense that the management
teams would get along. Seems like the cultures fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Coleman, a transportation analyst with Banc of America
Securities praised the deal, calling the share offering a very good
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives (Coach USA) increased access to capital to keep
growing,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call for investors and analysts, Larry King,
Coach USA's chairman and chief executive, said no layoffs or
changes in Coach USA's operations are planned. King will keep his
current title and will join Stagecoach's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much the platform for Stagecoach's growth in
North America,'' said Keith Cochrane, Stagecoach's finance
director. ``The focus is going to be growth, not cutback.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach USA plans to continue running its business from Houston,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I feel it's sad that a foreign company sees the
opportunity more than U.S. investors,'' said Steven Harter,
president of Notre Capital Ventures II, which was the principal
founder of Coach USA.
</P>
<P>
   Harter, on the board of Coach USA since its creation, said there
is a small-cap company malaise among investors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, he said, was the right thing for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stagecoach is a great company and they see the opportunity,
and I think it's going to be a great merger,'' Harter said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there is growth potential in the bus business as
governments privatize services, corporations outsource
transportation needs, and the population ages, creating a bigger
market for tour and charter services.
</P>
<P>
   Coach USA was formed in September 1995 but had no operations or
revenues before May 1996 when it went public. Coach USA, which
began with six companies, has since acquired more than 70.
</P>
<P>
   It operates in Canada and throughout the United States, and
provides commuter transportation, airport shuttle, contract
services for local governments and corporations, and taxi services.
</P>
<P>
   King also said Coach USA was looking to the school bus market as
a growth opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Coach USA, which had 1998 revenues of $803 million, employees
about 12,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Among its activities, Stagecoach _ which employees 37,000 people
and has annual revenues of roughly $2.5 billion _ operates bus,
train and airport businesses in the United Kingdom; buses and
ferries in New Zealand; and buses in Sweden, Finland, Portugal,
Australia, Hong Kong and China.

ROOKIE COLANGELO OUT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels rookie outfielder Mike
Colangelo will miss six to eight weeks because of a torn ligament
in his left thumb, a result of the scary outfield collision he had
with teammate Reggie Williams on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo was examined by hand and wrist specialist Dr. Norman
Zemel on Monday when the tear was discovered. He was placed in a
cast that he'll wear for three weeks before being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo, making his major-league debut Sunday after being
called up Saturday night, was in good spirits after Sunday's game
when it seemed he would be OK. He had been taken off the field on a
backboard because he had upper-back pain, but X-rays of his
cervical spine were normal. He also had X-rays of the thumb, which
were normal.
</P>
<P>
   But while there was no break, there was a tear of the ulna
collateral ligament in the thumb. He did not make the trip with the
team to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo had three plate appearances Sunday before the
seventh-inning injury. He singled to center, walked and grounded
out. He also had an outfield assist.
</P>
<P>
   Why me?: Manager Terry Collins has been asked numerous times,
and he still doesn't have an answer. The question was asked again
after Colangelo's injury: When you're alone and thinking about
everything that's happened, do you ever ask, `Why me? Why us?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked myself, what can we change? What can we adjust? Is
there something we're missing?'' Collins said. ``But you look at
the injuries we've had, and they're not from a lack of training,
they're from aggressiveness. Every one except (Gary) DiSarcina,
which was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the fences in front of the dugouts, but Mo (Vaughn)
would have went for that ball anyway. And the next time Tim Salmon
has to dive for a ball, he will. Jim Edmonds got his bad shoulder
from crashing into fences. It so happens that our injuries have
cost us a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   While DiSarcina is nearing a return, Salmon is a month away and
Edmonds two months. Vaughn is limited to DH duty because of his
tender left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody else says, they play the game the
right way,'' Collins said. ``They're not going to not dive for
balls, or not slide or not run hard to first base because they're
afraid they're going to a pull a muscle. With situations like this
you say, can we do anything different? Do we train less? Do we
train more? The answer's no. (Injuries) just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon update: Right fielder Tim Salmon (sprained left wrist)
also was examined by Dr. Zemel and continues to improve. There is
no timetable set for his return.
</P>
<P>
   Percival on a roll: Closer Troy Percival continues to dominate.
With his perfect inning Sunday, Percival has allowed no runs and
only one hit in his past 17 outings (161/3 innings). He's second in
the American League with 18 saves.

COURT AGREES TO CONSIDER CASE ON AID TO RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Md., N.Y.)  (See also SCOTUS-GAMBLING) 
(mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding an important religion case to the docket for
its next term, the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether
the Constitution permits public schools to provide computers and
other ``instructional equipment'' for use in religious school
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The case challenges a firm line the court drew in a series of
parochial school aid cases in the 1970s _ a line between textbooks,
which public schools were permitted to lend to religious schools,
and all other instructional material, which the court viewed as too
easily placed in service of the parochial schools' religious
mission and therefore impermissible.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on that distinction in a decision last year, the federal
appeals court in New Orleans ruled that the public school system of
Jefferson Parish, La., could not make available to religious
schools within its district computers that it had acquired under a
widely used federal program.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking to expand that program,
part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, to help
provide computers and Internet connections to every classroom in
the country, public and private alike. Unless the lower court
decision in this case is overturned, that goal will be impossible
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Under the education act, public schools that receive federal aid
for special services and equipment, including computers, must share
the material on a ``secular, neutral and nonideological'' basis
with students in private schools within the district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the parochial school parents in Louisiana who brought
the Supreme Court appeal, Mitchell vs. Helms, No. 98-1648, the
administration told the justices that if the court's precedents
still require the ``categorical rule'' that the appeals court
applied, then it is time to re-examine those precedents.
</P>
<P>
   The case therefore has clear implications for broader questions
concerning the use of tax dollars for the benefit of religious
institutions in general and schools in particular. Although the
constitutionality of publicly financed vouchers for religious
school tuition is not directly before the court, this case will be
closely watched for indications of what the justices will do when
they eventually accept one of the voucher cases now beginning to
fill the legal pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The court's approach to the clause of the First Amendment that
prohibits an ``establishment'' of religion has been in flux. Two
years ago, in a case from New York, the court overturned a
precedent and ruled that the establishment clause was not violated
if public school systems sent teachers onto the premises of
parochial schools to teach federally financed remedial classes.
Other recent decisions, including one from 1995 that required the
University of Virginia to underwrite a student religious
publication on the same basis as other publications, have suggested
that the court's longstanding emphasis on church-state separation
is being replaced by a new emphasis on protecting religious
activities and institutions against unequal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The ferment on the court _ many of the recent cases have been
decided by 5-4 votes _ coincides with a political ferment over the
relationship between religion and government, a combination that is
likely to keep this case in a bright spotlight until the justices
decide it, perhaps as long as a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   The court stepped back from a second church-state dispute
Monday, declining to hear a challenge by a Maryland college
affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church to its exclusion
from a program of state aid to private colleges. The Maryland
Higher Education Commission's conclusion that the program of
Columbia Union College was ``pervasively sectarian,'' and therefore
ineligible for the aid, was upheld by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   While the court on Monday made no comment in turning down the
appeal, Columbia Union College vs. Clark, No. 98-1509, Justice
Clarence Thomas filed a four-page dissenting opinion. He said the
court should ``scrap the `pervasively sectarian' test and reaffirm
that the Constitution requires, at a minimum, neutrality, not
hostility, toward religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's other actions on Monday included these:
</P>
<P>
   Federal employees: The court ruled, 5-4, that in deciding
discrimination cases by federal employees against government
agencies, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the
authority to award not only back pay but compensatory damages for
illegal discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, West vs. Gibson, No. 98-238, interpreted the Civil
Rights Act of 1991, which for the first time made compensatory
damages available to discrimination plaintiffs who are successful
in court, whether against a private employer or the government. The
question was whether the new remedy also applied when the
commission, rather than a court, resolved the case.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, which was
joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David
Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented,
joined by Thomas, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice
Antonin Scalia. The dissenters said the federal government had not
waived its sovereign immunity with sufficient clarity to permit the
commission to award damages.
</P>
<P>
   New York death penalty: Without comment, the court turned down
an appeal by the district attorneys in Brooklyn and Rochester,
N.Y., of a ruling last year by New York's highest court that struck
down the plea-bargaining provisions of New York's death penalty
law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the New York law, defendants who plead guilty to capital
murder are safe from execution; they can receive a maximum sentence
of life in prison. But defendants who take their chances by going
to trial can receive a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Court of Appeals ruled last December that this
system, unusual among death-penalty states, placed an
unconstitutional burden on a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a
jury trial and Fifth Amendment right against compelled
self-incrimination. The appeals court's decision was based on a
1968 Supreme Court precedent, United States vs. Jackson, which held
that it was unconstitutional to offer a benefit to capital
defendants for pleading guilty and waiving their right to a jury
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, Hynes vs. Tomei, No. 98-1533, District
Attorneys Charles Hynes of Brooklyn and Howard Relin of Monroe
County urged the court to overturn that precedent in light of the
much greater role that plea bargaining plays today in the criminal
justice system.

MARKET REACTION NOT POSITIVE TO MINIMED DISTRIBUTION DEALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Investors are a fickle lot, as insulin pump maker
MiniMed Inc. learned following the announcement of two potentially
lucrative deals and a public offering of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced on Monday it had entered into distribution
and manufacturing agreements with pharmaceuticals companies Eli
Lilly &AMP; Co. and Elan Corp., and also filed a registration for a
public offering of 2.25 million shares of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did the stock market react? Not too happily. MiniMed
stock fell $3.375 to close Monday at $70.125.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might have reacted to fears that the extra shares
would dilute earnings, said Kurt Kruger, health care analyst for
Bank of America Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, however, is that the downtick is a correction on a
stock whose price has been ``on an absolute tear'' the past couple
of months, when it has jumped about $20, said Kruger, who has a
``buy'' recommendation on the shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price movement (Monday) looks to be a much-needed breather
or correction after the stock has exploded,'' he said. ``We think
it's unrelated to the news (Monday). We take all three events as a
positive, with special attention to the Lilly arrangement, which we
take as a very strong positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal with Eli Lilly, the Indianapolis-based
pharmaceuticals giant is licensing its new formulation of insulin
lyspro to MiniMed for use with MiniMed's insulin pump. The
agreement also calls for Eli Lilly to supply MiniMed with the
insulin formulation in bulk crystal form.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ``extraordinary event'' in that one rarely, if ever,
hears of a drug company doing that, Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really quite wonderful for MiniMed,'' he said of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Dublin, Ireland-based Elan Corp. grants
MiniMed exclusive worldwide distribution rights to Elan's Medipad
disposable continuous drug delivery system, which will be marketed
under MiniMed's name. It will be aimed at insulin-using Type 2
diabetes patients.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed also will be the exclusive maker of the continuous
system for all applications, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed chief financial officer Kevin Sayer would not comment on
the company's stock price. It will be a year or more before the
company's bottom line reflects the deals' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect revenues from either project until late, late
2000, and the impact in 2001,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Just four months ago, the black and silver
juggernaut known as the San Antonio Spurs seemed to be on the verge
of collapse. Greatly talented and expected to contend for a
National Basketball Association championship, the Spurs had a 6-8
record and were in danger of losing more than a playoff spot; their
coach and general manager, Gregg Popovich, was in the kind of
trouble that only Jeff Van Gundy can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich's Spurs were too loaded to be foundering, so everyone
was pointing a finger at the coach. Spectators at the Alamodome
were drowning him in boos. Ticket-holders were penning letters of
condemnation to the team's owners. Fans were flooding the phone
lines of sports talk radio with venomous comments. Local columnists
and broadcasters were on the attack. And the Spurs' chairman, Peter
Holt, was reportedly speaking with Doc Rivers about taking
Popovich's place on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   With the club saying its future in San Antonio was riding on the
public's willingness to finance the building of a new arena, the
probability that Holt would make a coaching change was increasing
with each inexplicable loss. Then, the Spurs drilled the Houston
Rockets by 17 points on the road, and two nights later, the Dallas
Mavericks by 16. Then they defeated the Los Angeles Clippers and
the Denver Nuggets and five other opponents en route to winning
nine straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the calls for Popovich's head disappeared and
eventually turned into praise. All of that has been forgotten in
the euphoria that accompanies a trip to the NBA finals, and
Popovich, 50, has no interest in drumming it up again in a
how-do-you-like-me-now sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't feel vindicated,'' said Popovich, whose team has
gone 42-6 since its 6-8 start and will play host to the Knicks in
Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game finals Wednesday night. ``I don't
think in terms of vindication. I don't think you have a right to do
that. If I think in terms of vindication, I will become a negative
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who correlate negativity with hard-nosed, old-school
coaching tactics already think Popovich has reached that point. At
times, some of his younger players have grown weary of his
authoritarian approach to coaching. But the Spurs' leaders _ David
Robinson, Mario Elie and Avery Johnson _ view Popovich as a leader
and appreciate his assertiveness. In fact, when Popovich's job was
on the line, Johnson addressed some of his teammates, imploring
them to put forth more effort to save their season and their coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel connected to him because he's the guy that brought me
in,'' said Johnson, who was cut by five teams, including the Spurs,
before Popovich brought him back to San Antonio in 1994. ``So I
took it personally when they were talking about him being fired. He
didn't talk much about it, but we listen to the radio and we read
the newspapers, so we knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, in his first year with the Spurs after signing as a free
agent, has an obvious fondness for Popovich, despite his coach's
dogged personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop stays on us, man,'' Elie said. ``We watch a lot of film.
Lord knows we don't want to lose a game because if we do, we know
we're going to have to sit through a one-hour film session with
Pop. And he'll bring up everything that we did wrong. So the guys
say, `Let's not lose' because we don't want to have to sit through
film with Pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie added: ``He's in charge, and we know that. Nobody talks
back to Pop. He doesn't really ride guys. He just makes his point
one time, and the guys accept it and do it because they don't want
to have to hear him say it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich learned his no-nonsense techniques as a student at the
Air Force Academy. After walking on the basketball team as a
freshman, he worked tirelessly on his game to become the club's
captain and leading scorer as a senior. Upon graduation, he toured
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union with the United States armed
forces team, where he played so well that he earned a tryout for
the 1972 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich failed to make the squad and spent the next six years
as an assistant coach at his alma mater before taking a
head-coaching job at tiny Pomona-Pitzer in Claremont, Calif.
Finally, in 1988, he landed a job in the NBA as Larry Brown's
assistant in San Antonio. After four years there, he moved to
Golden State as an assistant under Don Nelson before rejoining the
Spurs as the general manager in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Popovich has revamped the Spurs' roster almost
entirely, with Robinson being the only San Antonio player remaining
from when he took over. When Popovich fired Bob Hill as coach in
1996 _ and named himself as the replacement _ on the day that
Robinson returned from the injured list, he irritated people
throughout the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Spurs are in the finals _ in part because of
Popovich's off-season acquisitions of the key role players, Elie
and Jerome Kersey _ that too has been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   And the relieved Popovich, who recently received a vote of
confidence from Holt, is even joking a bit, such as about the
Knicks' short-handedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Johnson and Patrick Ewing will both be here on
Wednesday,'' he said with a smile. ``You can't trust those guys
from the big city. If we said guys were hurt, you could trust us.
But both of those guys will probably start and play 37 minutes.''

NASD IS EXPECTED TO START TRADING SYSTEM FOR JAPAN STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is expected to
announce Tuesday that it will form an electronic trading system
similar to its Nasdaq Stock Market to list and trade Japanese
stocks, securities industry officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The market's structure will be similar to that of the Nasdaq
market, the electronic, dealer-based system that is the world's
second largest behind the New York Stock Exchange. The new venture
will also offer trading of United States companies, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Softbank Corp., which specializes in Internet-related
investments, is expected to be a partner in the NASD venture,
industry officials said. Trading is to begin sometime late next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD, the parent of the Nasdaq market, has been moving to
reorganize itself as a ``market of markets,'' expanding its
presence both in the United States, through its purchase last year
of the American Stock Exchange, and overseas, through joint
ventures with foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the association is trying to stem the loss of
business to electronic communications networks, which are
electronic systems that match customer orders and account for more
than one-quarter of all the trading in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange has also faced competitive pressures
as some of its largest stock listings, including Viacom, the
entertainment giant, have defected to the New York exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Japanese joint venture were expected to be
announced at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday in New York. Frank G. Zarb, chairman
of the NASD, is expected to join in the announcement via video
transmission from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment Monday on reports of the
joint venture, which initially appeared in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a
Japanese newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq has already listed shares of 16 Japanese companies on its
market. Those shares trade in the form of American depository
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasdaq has had a difficult time recruiting Japanese
companies. Since 1984, only one company has joined the market. And
last month, the largest foreign listing on the Nasdaq market, the
Toyota Motor Corp., announced it was moving to the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq and its parent organization have previously aided in the
organization of several overseas markets similar to Nasdaq, with
varying success. Easdaq, a European version of Nasdaq, was
organized in Belgium in 1996, but has listed only 43 companies.
Among them are a few American technology companies, like Xoom.com
and Pixtech.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq also helped in the formation of Ausdaq, an Australian
exchange, and Rasdaq, a Romanian stock exchange. The NASD was
approached in the early 1990's by its counterpart in Japan about
the possibility of creating a Nasdaq-like market, but the venture
was not completed, a Nasdaq official said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Japan Securities Dealers Association set up, by
itself, a market for trading small-cap Japanese stocks. Trading in
those stocks is tracked by what is known as the Jasdaq stock index,
but it has no affiliation with Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Nasdaq will be able to use the Jasdaq
name for its contemplated Japanese joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq and its parent have recently pursued several other joint
ventures with foreign markets. In December, the NASD and the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange announced the establishment of a working team
to develop broader cooperation on the sharing of technology and
dual listings of stocks. In addition, the exchanges set up an
Internet site to provide information on stocks traded in each
market.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Nasdaq announced that it would open an office in
Shanghai to help recruit companies to a Nasdaq listing and to
provide support for Asian companies whose shares are traded on the
Nasdaq exchange. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Are you tired of hearing about the millennium yet?
</P>
<P>
   It seems the world can be divided into three groups of people
this year: those who don't want to hear the word millennium one
more time, those who are feverishly planning how to celebrate it
and those who anticipate making lots of money from those doing the
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who see dollar signs dancing in their dreams
are retailers who expect to sell scads of party clothes because,
the thinking goes, anyone going to a ``Happy New Year 2000'' party
will want to wear something special. There may be shortages of
champagne, caviar or hotel rooms, but there is no danger that there
will be a dearth of party clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Stores are asking designers for evening dresses, and designers
are whipping them up. The resort-holiday collections being shown
this month for delivery in October, November and December are
geared as much to holiday finery as to beach wear. The problem is
that most of the styles, rather than pointing the way to a new
century, could have been shown almost any year. For many designers,
inspiration came not from the future, but from the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of holiday north, holiday south,'' said Donna Karan,
who is calling her new collection Celebration 2000. It ranges from
a gauzy silver-shot full silk skirt in pale yellow, coral or white
(updated with a tube top) to a short black strapless dress
glittering with beads that would suit a modern-day flapper.
</P>
<P>
   As a nod to today, she based many styles on jersey tubes or
T-shirts, then layered tulle sprinkled with beads over them for
resort outings or added beaded fringe for dancing the centuries
away at a gala in town. And how about a crystal-beaded apron to tie
on over just about anything instead of wearing jewelry? It might be
just the thing for someone fearful of traveling with the real
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors has given a lot of thought to this holiday season,
which he expects to start as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are talking about it already,'' he said. ``I
think even people who never, never want to go out New Year's Eve
will want to go out. I'm doing a lot of take-away clothes, but
dressy for evening. Even in the most casual resorts, this year
they'll dress. And people will be going to cities as well as to
resorts. You're going to have people coming to New York and people
going to Sydney, Australia, to London, to Paris, to Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   His signature collection has youthful styles like packable
strapless dresses of paper taffeta with smocked tops. He's done
them short, in celadon, and long in black. ``You don't want to wear
something uptight and old-fashioned,'' Kors said, ``and this year
you don't want something that doesn't pack.''
</P>
<P>
   So he has also provided an off-the-shoulder silk sweater that
can be worn with shorts for day and with a long skirt for evening.
And white satin jeans with a beaded stretch tank in platinum gray.
``Platinum for the millennium,'' he explained. But the
quintessential Michael Kors look is a simple white taffeta shirt
worn with black pants discreetly scattered with jet beads.
</P>
<P>
   The line Kors designs for Celine is more glamorous, with a bare
black halter dress he calls ``the ultimate bathing suit dress''
because the top is cut like a swimsuit. There's also a pareo dress
that looks like a long scarf tied halter-style around the neck,
with long silk fringe dripping from the hem. (A lot of designers
are gung-ho for fringe.) For resorts, the scarf-dress comes in
coral; for cities, in black with jet beads. Also in the scarf mode
is a one-shoulder poncho in jet-encrusted black georgette, shown
with black stretch pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wear a lot of color at resorts,'' he said, ``but if
you're packing four or five evening things, you'll pack some black
along with the color.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein used fabrics like washed satin, ribbed silk or
paperlike cotton and double-layered stretch organza for long,
flowing skirts worn with tops that bare the arms and shoulders.
Thin fabrics are layered or embroidered tone-on-tone or given a
sprinkling of sequins. Colors range from white to peaches and pinks
he describes as ``face-powder colors, just pale washes of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most styles are geared to evenings at resorts, someone
might adapt a sequined white camisole for city wear by teaming it
with a dark skirt instead of a white one and wrapping up in a big
stole.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren's collection focuses on resort wear but includes
dressy clothes for parties in the city. Sexy jerseys come in black
and white or shades of blue taken from the colors of the Caribbean
sea and sky.
</P>
<P>
   A halter dress with skinny straps that crisscross in back comes
in black or white. A cropped halter top that wraps and ties in
front and that is paired with a low-riding bias-cut skirt comes in
azure. A black and white beaded georgette tube, shown with black
jersey pants, defies geography, but a multicolored fringed skirt of
Indian beadwork would probably look at home only in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to color, Carolina Herrera is all for it. ``I
think the millennium is about color,'' she said, gesturing toward a
rack glowing with orange, turquoise and red evening wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pieces to mix, like this turquoise beaded top with
an orange skirt,'' she said, ``or this striped top in turquoise,
white and tan to mix with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also long dresses with beading, either etching a
discreet border around the neckline or forming an all-over floral
design. And Ms. Herrera has provided two-toned bravura stoles that
reverse from pashmina to taffeta to add a touch of drama to any
event.
</P>
<P>
   The dresses are very slim or have full taffeta skirts that
billow gracefully but can be folded almost flat for packing. A navy
blue taffeta is dark enough for a city ball yet has a sliplike top
that is bare enough for southern climes. It looks rather like a
1950's prom dress without the boning and crinolines.
</P>
<P>
   The versatility of being suitable for wearing in the north or
south is the ideal many designers strove for. Another common thread
is full skirts, either gently flared or ballgown-wide, perhaps
signifying a yearning for a more romantic era. Oscar de la Renta's
collection includes a strapless paper taffeta dress in a muted
plaid of rose, blue, pink and wine with fullness in back, ending in
a train, and a ballgown skirt of yellow and blue plaid taffeta that
is poufed up in front and, for a modern touch, shown with a yellow
silk sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership of Mark Badgley and James Mischka is known for
beaded columns but has expanded the repertory to include
full-skirted ballgowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of trunk shows,'' Mischka said, ``and
women are all looking for that great dress. Last week in Seattle we
sold nine elaborate $10,000 gowns. People are taking the millennium
parties very seriously. So for this collection we focused on things
that are right for resort and right for New York, going into
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   He described an iridescent pink taffeta dress with an A-shaped
skirt and a train as ``in between slinky and ballgown.'' But a
Wedgwood blue and cream striped taffeta embroidered with white
beads and crystals on the strapless bodice has a bouffant skirt
worthy of a ball at Tara.
</P>
<P>
   A nostalgic spirit has struck much of the fashion world at the
end of a century that has seen tremendous progress in science and
society. Does anyone really expect the Y2K bug to send the world
back to 1900?  &QL;

A LONDON FINANCIER SEEMS TO HAVE HELPED MILOSEVIC ACCEPT ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A British financier, acting with the knowledge of the
German and Finnish governments, held secret negotiations with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that appear to have helped
Milosevic reconcile himself to the peace agreement announced on
June 3, German and Swedish officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Castenfelt, a London investment banker with close ties to
the Russian government, secretly entered Serbia on May 29 and
remained in Belgrade until June 4, they said. He met with Milosevic
before Martti Ahtisaari, the president of Finland and the European
Union envoy, arrived on June 2 for conclusive talks with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting with Milosevic in a garden in central
Belgrade, Castenfelt was taken to a bunker in the city where he
drafted a memorandum that laid out the positions on which the West
would not shift and those on which some negotiation was possible,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memorandum was taken to Mr. Milosevic by his chief of
security,'' a person with intimate knowledge of the visit said.
``It proved decisive, and opened the way to the quick accord with
Mr. Ahtisaari.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Castenfelt, who has helped steer Russia
toward accords with the International Monetary Fund, was first
reported on Monday in The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   His role _ which the officials said was also known to the United
States _ reflected a concern among some top Russian officials that
Russia's Balkan envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was not making headway,
and a feeling in the German and Finnish governments that a ``back
channel'' could be useful.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Western governments vowed throughout the 11-week
NATO bombardment that there would be no negotiation with Milosevic.
Castenfelt's involvement was therefore potentially embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, said he met with Castenfelt twice _
on May 26, three days before the secret mission, and on June 7,
after his return. But Steiner said the only purpose of the meetings
was to gather information and to exchange views, insisting that
Castenfelt's visit made little difference to the diplomatic
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What led Mr. Milosevic to accept our terms was two things,''
Steiner said. ``First, the growing toll of an increasingly powerful
NATO bombardment. Second, the fact that he realized that Russia
would not give up its ties to the West to save him.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin dismissed the notion that
Castenfelt played a critical role in bringing Milosevic to heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic didn't need a secret meeting to know what the NATO
conditions were,'' Rubin said. ``He could have watched TV. So there
was no channel that provided critical information on what he needed
to do. The idea that he changed his position through these
discussions is sheer and utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Kaiser, who was the foreign affairs adviser to
Schroeder during his election campaign, said, ``Mr. Castenfelt
played a central role in showing Milosevic how the accord could be
made to look better than what was offered at the Rambouillet peace
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's refusal to sign the accords reached at Rambouillet,
France, led directly to the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, who arranged the meetings with Steiner, and Castenfelt
first met and discussed the Kosovo war at a meeting of the
East-West Institute, a research organization, in Berlin on April 9
and 10, just over two weeks after the bombing began. John Kornblum,
the American ambassador to Germany, was also present.
</P>
<P>
   Castenfelt, who once worked for the Dillon Reed investment
banking firm, and now owns a London financial company, Archipelago
Enterprises, is close to Chernomyrdin and is trusted by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, the officials said. He declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said that while it was clear that Serbian forces would
have to withdraw from Kosovo and that NATO forces would have to be
allowed to deploy there under any settlement, the timing of these
moves and their link to a halt in NATO bombing were more flexible.
Examining the statement by the Group of Seven industrialized
nations in early May, in which Russia and the West first outlined
terms for a settlement, Kaiser and Castenfelt saw other points that
could be used in discussion with the Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The first was that Yugoslavia's sovereignty over Kosovo was
reaffirmed. The second was that a call for a review of Kosovo's
status after three years, which was in the Rambouillet plan, was
not explicitly in the Group of Seven statement.
</P>
<P>
   The third was that the composition of the ``international
force'' in Kosovo was partly open to discussion. And the fourth was
that the force would arrive under a United Nations mandate, unlike
the NATO presence called for at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Castenfelt's visit was arranged by
senior Russian military officials, who made contact with
Milosevic's military and security entourage in Belgrade. He flew to
Sofia, crossed the Bulgarian border at Gradina, was picked up by
Serbian security officials and driven to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed at the Inter-Continental Hotel. Milosevic, officials
said, met the financier in a garden. The meeting lasted about two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extraordinary how little Milosevic seemed to know
before the memorandum and the talks clarified things,'' an official
said. ``He really seemed in the dark about NATO's thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that for whatever reason, the Yugoslav leader
decided to accept the terms presented by Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin
with remarkable speed when they met him on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said it was absurd to suggest that Milosevic had in any
way secured a better deal than he would have had at Rambouillet.
``To begin with,'' he said, ``Rambouillet allowed for a substantial
Serbian security presence in Kosovo, whereas now all Serbian
soldiers and police have been obliged to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But a person involved with the mission said, ``What we basically
did was to pre-sell the agreement, and that is exactly the way it
worked out.''

FASHION LOSES A TRUE ESTHETIC EYE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death of David Seidner last week in Miami Beach brought an
end to a talent that was far too individual, far too stubborn and
classically obsessed to be conventionally successful, though he
was. Rarely has a modern-minded photographer, whose work appeared
regularly in the pages of fashion magazines and who poured out a
steady stream of books and advertising images for clients like
Revlon and Yves Saint Laurent, soared so freely while having one
foot planted in the clay of the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Seidner, born in Los Angeles in 1957, combined a free-thinking
California character with the Old World esthetic life he discovered
in Paris at age 19, and developed into an original photographer.
``His infatuation with French intellectual society, which always
blended with the fashion world, did color his eye,'' said the
writer Bob Colacello, who met Seidner in the late 1970s. Initially,
</P>
<P>
   Colacello, who was then an editor of Interview, was put off by
what he said were Seidner's attempts to control every aspect of how
his work was used.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, who are organizing a memorial service for Seidner, who
had AIDS for 15 years and was 42 when he died, invariably describe
him as a kind of head-to-toe esthete, someone who quoted
philosophers, collected Jean-Michel Frank furniture and wore
vintage Gucci loafers, typically with skinny moleskin trousers.
Certainly, in the lush, freewheeling era of Paris in the late
1970s, Seidner had no trouble making connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, David was a very precocious kid,'' said Tom Fallon, a
former executive at Bill Blass, who hired Seidner to shoot the
designer's advertisements, which he did for 10 years up until his
death. ``You couldn't help but respond to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Colacello added, ``If you were young and attractive and out at
night, eventually you met someone who said, `You must meet Yves.'''
Seidner not only met Yves, but also went on to produce some of the
most enduring advertising images for the house of Saint Laurent _
indeed, for any fashion house.
</P>
<P>
   Seidner's contemporary subjects were often portrayed in
historical mode _ the Miller sisters, most famously, when they
appeared in Vanity Fair in 1995 as if full-blown from the brush of
Boldini. Yet somehow the images looked modern. ``His style had
nothing to do with what was trendy or of the moment,'' said Robert
McElroy, Seidner's agent for many years. ``It was very contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, there was an essential contradiction in Seidner. ``To
many magazine editors,'' said George Cortina, the stylist who
worked on the Miller sitting, ``David was too much of an artist,
and yet the artist himself didn't think he was enough of one. He
didn't fit perfectly in one world or the other. He was sort of an
abyss unto himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfectionist, Seidner was famous for having his subjects pose
for hours under intense lights (``like a hot day at the beach,
times 2,'' Cortina said), while orchestrating every millimeter of
movement _ from the tilt of a head to the tiniest fold of fabric.
He also tried to exert extraordinary control over his images, even
how they were presented on the page.
</P>
<P>
   For a series of Sargent-inspired portraits that appeared last
year in Vanity Fair, he photographed 17 subjects, exhausting
himself and nearly everyone else. ``Believe me,'' said David
Harris, Vanity Fair's art director, ``the Sargent shoot brought
everyone to their knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Graydon Carter, the magazine's editor in chief, added with a
laugh: ``He shot my wife and daughter. It took so long, they were
older at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Brandolini, a decorator who was a close friend of
Seidner, said it was particularly difficult for a man of Seidner's
esthetic sensitivity to witness his own physical decline. ``He'd
say, `I look so bad,''' Mrs. Brandolini recalled. ``It was a
contradiction. Here he was creating beauty and, at the same time,
seeing his own face change in the mirror.'' She suggested that this
frustration, combined with his exigent nature, had the effect of
turning his personality into a wedge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved David,'' Mrs. Brandolini said, ``but he harmed himself
with his hardness toward himself and others.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last months of his life, Seidner had sold most of his
possessions, including his beloved Frank furniture, and had gone to
live in Miami Beach. In a corner of his ocean-front apartment, in a
space not larger than four feet square, he began photographing
orchids. It was all he could manage, but he made dozens of images
of those flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before he died, Cortina said, Seidner told him, ``I
cannot take the sort of pictures I want to take any more, because
they have killed me.''

   DILI, East Timor _ This disputed province is growing calmer but
still has a ``long way to go'' before those who support breaking
away from Indonesia feel secure enough to vote in a referendum on
independence, less than two months away, the chief United Nations
official here says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a priority for us both to assess and also to try and have
a positive effect upon a security situation, which is still a great
concern around the country,'' said the official, Ian Martin, who
heads a United Nations mission that arrived here in May.
</P>
<P>
   He said his first task had been to assess whether people felt
secure enough even to register to vote in the referendum. It is set
for Aug. 8, and will take place as part of a U.N.-brokered
agreement signed on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal, the former
colonial power.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, political violence, carried out mainly by
militias and gangs that want to remain part of Indonesia, has
claimed more than 100 lives, mostly those of independence
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long way to go'' Martin said, ``if pro-independence
supporters, many of whom have left their homes in recent months,
are going to feel that they can return in security, which is what
they have to do for registration let alone ballot campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who support independence have gone into hiding and
are only now beginning to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only beginning to happen very slowly,'' Martin added. ``I
don't think yet anything like a sufficient sense of confidence has
been created. Inevitably it will be slow to return after what has
happened in the recent past.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of the first U.N. personnel last month, the
security situation in the provincial capital, Dili, has noticeably
improved, Martin said, despite ``a good deal of apprehension'' and
continuing threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said Dili was clearly a lot calmer than the outlying
districts of Liquica, Maliana and Suai, where the United Nations
continued to receive ``disturbing reports.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials here have faced challenges enforcing certain
provisions of the May 5 accord and making sure that all parts of it
are clearly understood.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin put it, ``I'm not sure that the agreement has really
begun to be understood or explained certainly down to local level
among government officials, who may have been given a very
different expectation of what they were to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the agreement strictly prohibits use of Government
money for spreading propaganda about the autonomy proposal or
supporting political and militia groups allied to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly begun to raise that as an issue with the
Indonesian authorities,'' Martin added, ``and we will have to
absolutely insist that any evidence that it is continuing must lead
to prompt and firm action on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed concern that military and police chiefs in the
province had allowed several pro-Jakarta militias to join
village-level civil defense groups that have policing powers.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's regional police commander, Col. Timbul Silaen, said
recently that he did no object if a hard-line militia commandant,
Eurico Guterres, joined the civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by that statement,'' Martin said, adding that
although he was not entirely clear on the legal basis, ``certainly
it is something that exists in many parts of Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his group had ``made clear'' that ``it is the police and
only the police who shall play the security role, so we expect to
progressively see that is the case.''

MICROSOFT CALLS HOSTILE WITNESS BUT STRATEGY SAGS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft Corp. put its most important rebuttal
witness in the government's antitrust trial on the stand Monday, a
senior executive from America Online, and set out to prove that the
online service had deceived the judge about its plans to compete
with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort proved to be a bust in terms of how it played in
court.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the halting, tedious examination of David M.
Colburn, a senior vice president of America Online, had put several
people in the courtroom to sleep. Finally Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson called Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, up to the bench and
told him he was not getting much if anything out of the questions
or the documents Warden was offering as evidence. Jackson urged
Warden to hurry up and finish.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Microsoft's lawyers have been saying they would base
a good part of their rebuttal case around their allegation that
Colburn did not tell the complete truth when he testified as a
government witness in October.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they said, America Online's plan to purchase the
Netscape Communications Corp. was well under way at the time of
Colburn's earlier testimony, and planning documents showed that
America Online intended to mount a strong challenge to Microsoft,
though Colburn made no mention of that in his original testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appeared to be two-fold. Microsoft would challenge
``the completeness and candor of prior testimony,'' the company
said in a court filing _ raising credibility issues, just as the
government's lead trial lawyer, David Boies, had done with many of
Microsoft's witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the strategy would be to show that America
Online, through its purchase of Netscape, intended to mount a
strong competitive challenge to Microsoft, undercutting the
government's assertion that Microsoft holds an unassailable
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But Colburn did not cooperate. Monday Warden offered as evidence
presumably the best selections from the trove of documents
Microsoft subpoenaed from America Online, Netscape and Sun
Microsystems, a partner in the deal. Colburn recognized few of
them, however, and quarreled with Warden's interpretation of almost
every one.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson showed little interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit it,'' he said with a shake of the hand about one
America Online document offered as evidence. ``I don't know what's
probative in it; I really don't. Without some testimony to give it
substance, I don't know what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Warden had displayed documents showing that America
Online planned to work with Sun to build a personal computer that
used no Microsoft software, thus ``breaking the deadly embrace with
Microsoft'' in the words of a Sun executive.
</P>
<P>
   But Colburn said the plan went nowhere. It was, he said,
intended to create lower-price personal computers, so more people
could afford to join the service. But while the planning was under
way, computer prices fell sharply, ``so the talks are largely
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents Warden presented did show that America Online
executives, including the chief executive, Stephen M. Case, were
concerned about Microsoft. In one, Case wrote, ``Our relationship
with Microsoft is strained and will get much worse no matter how we
play it.'' He then wondered what would happen if his company
stopped distributing Microsoft's Web browser to its 16 million
subscribers and replaced it with Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the discussion, Colburn and many of the documents
said, America Online finally decided to keep the relationship with
Microsoft just as it had been _ and to continue using Internet
Explorer. The company renewed its contract with Microsoft in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, a Microsoft lawyer gamely asserted that
Colburn's statements would be useful in later written pleadings,
Judge Jackson's lack of interest Monday notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   By shortly after noon Monday Judge Jackson's attention was
clearly flagging as Warden began another series of questions
without looking up at the judge. A lawyer at Microsoft's table
quickly sent Warden a note, and as soon as Warden read it, he
called for a lunch break. The judge readily agreed.

SOME REFUGEES SLIP BACK INTO KOSOVO DESPITE DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Ignoring warnings about land mines and armed
Yugoslav troops, several hundred returning refugees slipped back
through the closed border into Kosovo on Monday by taking a
dangerous path on a wooded mountainside as periodic gunfire rang
out in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear who was firing the shots, although aid
organizations speculated that they came from members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the rebel group that fought Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo, to warn the refugees to go back for their own safety.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of the rebel group _ which intervened on Sunday at
the main border crossing to help enforce the closing, and which
still occupies the border itself with the apparent assent of NATO
and the Albanians _ said the firing came from local people in
Albania shooting their guns into the air for recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough Kosovo Albanians were returning to create the
``nightmare scenario'' of a rush back home by hundreds of thousands
of refugees who were expelled from Kosovo this spring by the
Yugoslavs. But Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees, called it a ``mini-nightmare'' because
of the danger of land mines and, at least until midday, hundreds of
armed Yugoslav troops who swarmed over the road just a few miles
inside the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   The border opened chaotically Sunday to the news media and aid
agencies for the first time since the crisis began. Refugees were
largely kept from re-entering by the German NATO forces controlling
the Kosovo side of the border. A number of refugees got in during
the confusion, but more than 200 refugees, mostly men wanting to
check on their houses and families, were held back.
</P>
<P>
   In their frustration, the refugees climbed over a railing to get
on a bridge that led them right up to the barbed-wire roadblock
into Kosovo, where they clamored to the German troops to let them
go back home. Aid workers say the mood got increasingly ugly until
late in the day, when rebel fighters effectively pushed the
refugees back. Since then, the rebels have controlled the middle of
the bridge, the actual border line, in between the Albanian police
on the Albanian side and the German soldiers on the Kosovo side.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at 6 a.m., the Germans closed the border into Kosovo to
the news media, citing the nearby Yugoslav troops and the shooting
deaths of at least two German journalists on Sunday in Kosovo. Then
they re-opened it at noon after they said the Yugoslavs had moved
on.
</P>
<P>
   But in a repeat of what happened on Sunday, more than 200
refugees _ some of whom could see their houses from the border _
turned up and were denied entry. Impatient, many headed up a
hillside path that crosses over into Kosovo, in partial sight of
the Germans, the rebels and the Albanians. The U.N. refugee agency
estimated their number at ``several hundred'' over the course of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go on the mountains here, and we can't do anything,''
said Sgt. Christian Schuh, a German soldier at the border post. But
twice Monday, he said, he had seen rebel fighters go after refugees
once they reached the Kosovo side of the road and bring them back.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers spent fruitless hours Sunday and Monday trying to
persuade the refugees at the border that it was still dangerous to
go home, particularly to villages where there could be land mines
in the fields and booby traps left in houses. Colville, the refugee
agency spokesman, said a land mine was discovered on Sunday only
six feet from the road at the border post.
</P>
<P>
   Ferit Saramati, 37, of the village of Dobrush, was one of those
waiting Monday morning to cross the border, even though he admitted
he was afraid of land mines. But he said he was not afraid of
Yugoslav troops. ``I know they are not there anymore,'' he said.
``We know that our village is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., a German soldier told the refugees through a
bullhorn to have patience. ``Wait a little bit,'' he said in
German, which was then translated into Albanian. ``The way you are
going through the mountains is very dangerous, and we can't give
you protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no evidence of a coming mass exodus of Kosovo
Albanians at the refugee camps here Monday night. At the camp run
by Doctors Without Borders, for example, refugees played
volleyball, did laundry and kept up with NATO's advance into Kosovo
on their radios.
</P>
<P>
   Shaip Pllana, 40, a laboratory technician from northern Kosovo,
said he knew that German journalists had been killed on Sunday.
``When it's possible to go back, we'll go back,'' he said.

LITTLE THINGS HURT DODGERS IN BIG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers tried to shake things up
when they fired pitching coach Charlie Hough. However, a 7-10
record is not what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   They've held team meetings, they've made changes in the lineup
... and still the team is struggling to win.
</P>
<P>
   It may be June and there are still 101 games remaining, but the
Dodgers are learning talent and coaching changes don't make an $80
million team better.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have the ability _ any team with Kevin Brown, Raul
Mondesi, Gary Sheffield, Eric Karros and Jeff Shaw is talented _
they just aren't doing the little things or the right things.
</P>
<P>
   It's why the Dodgers are 29-32 and why they were seven games out
of first place Monday. Los Angeles was 3{ games out of first when
Hough was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating isn't the word for it,'' Dodgers catcher Todd
Hundley said. ``It's a combination of things going wrong all at one
time. We have to, as a group, find a way to turn it around. We play
with a certain sense of urgency, and maybe it's too urgent. Maybe
(we put) too much pressure on ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' best chance at winning has been when Brown pitches.
In fact, it's been their only chance at winning lately. Brown, who
starts tonight when the Dodgers open a season-long, nine-game
homestand with the first of three against the Pittsburgh Pirates,
is the only starter to win in June. He's done it twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have three wins this month, losing three straight,
six of seven and nine of 12. Lately, their inability to get the
clutch hit, or make the key pitch, is overshadowed by their lack of
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what was said before the season, and the statements made,
teams are going to come after you much harder,'' Sheffield said.
``Management, they expect (us to win), and we have to perform. You
have to ask, is this the best team it could be?''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the next month might be worse than the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers may have former Gold Glove winners and all-stars at
nearly every position, but they've been shown time and again, by
Pittsburgh and Oakland and Florida and just about everyone else,
that attention to detail counts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have failed to move runners over, let alone
hit-and-run. They don't take pitches _ they're ninth in the
National League in walks (295) and 10th in on-base percentage
(.339). Their batting average is 13th (.265) out of 16 teams,
forcing them to rely on the stolen base. They've been caught
stealing 27 times, third most.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a team 12th in the league in runs scored, and
everyone knows you have to score to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stretches where we've been good, we've been hitting home
runs ... to tie the game,'' Hundley said. ``Fundamentally, it's
been tough. It hasn't been consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' problems aren't entirely offensive. They've
committed 47 errors, which have led to 32 unearned runs, third most
in the NL behind budget ballclubs Pittsburgh and Montreal. They
consistently miss cutoffs, and on some odd occasions, cut the ball
off when it should go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play the game better, do the little things, play
better defense,'' said Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre, who
leads the team with 13 errors. ``We're not playing good defense
right now, especially myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's also the pitchers, particularly starters not named
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park and Ismael Valdes have been erratic, Darren
Dreifort wild and Carlos Perez has been terrible. As a staff, the
Dodgers are tied for 11th worst with 237 walks, or 3.86 per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the pitchers don't hold runners on well and the catchers
don't throw runners out.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson called a team meeting before Sunday's 9-3
loss to Oakland, which featured the A's scoring five times with one
ball hit out of the infield _ and that was a pop up second baseman
Eric Young lost in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth inning, a shining example of what Dodgers baseball is
at this time, featured three walks, a hit batter to force in a run
and a strikeout-wild pitch that allowed two runs to score on
Hundley's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll survive,'' the usually unflappable Johnson said. ``We'll
be all right.''

SERBIAN RETURNEES REVEL IN JUST BEING ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslav soldiers leaned out of a civilian
bus, waving and whooping noisily, as it swept down the main street
bringing them back to this Serbian town Monday. People out
strolling in the warm evening on the main square looked up and
waved back.
</P>
<P>
   This town, home to the 3rd Army, which has done the bulk of the
fighting in Kosovo over the last year, has been welcoming its
troops home for several days now. Soldiers in camouflage fatigues
are everywhere, downing beers in the outdoor cafes and strolling
around town, overwhelmingly relieved to be back.
</P>
<P>
   After dark Monday the streets resounded with car horns blaring
and people whistling and shouting. ``I am very happy it's over,''
said one bearded reservist walking along the street. ``I got back
yesterday and now I've been told I can go home. It was difficult,
but we survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief is still the main feeling. Both soldiers and civilians
are just grateful the bombing has stopped, said Zoran Zivkovic,
mayor of Nis and an opposition party leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will be a matter of minutes and hours for most people
to remember all the problems they had before the war and which have
been multiplied by the war,'' he said in an interview in his
office. ``Problems of basic living needs, economic survival and how
to support their families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic, apparently in an effort to scotch
brewing public dissatisfaction, made a rare appearance Monday, his
first since the start of the NATO bombing. He went to the northern
city of Novi Sad to inaugurate the reconstruction of one of its
destroyed bridges.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech by the ruined bridge, he urged people to rally to
the task of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest 11 weeks since World War II are behind us,'' he
said. ``Now that we have peace again, new tasks await us. These are
to rebuild our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish our country and our people a fast recovery,'' he added,
vowing to rebuild the bridge in 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   In Nis, Zivkovic was dismissive of Milosevic's speech. The
bridge is only one of 39 that will have to be rebuilt, he added,
and the country has no money. He estimated that in Nis alone, it
would cost $100 million to $200 million to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The president has until the end of the summer, while the weather
is good, to sort out the country's most pressing problems, Zivkovic
said. And he will not be able to do that without foreign aid and
investment, Zivkovic asserted, adding that he hoped other nations
would not isolate Serbia further and create ``another Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The country experienced great tension and trauma during the
bombing, he said, and like the survivor of a car accident, is now
living in the euphoria of just being alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a high chance of being killed and you survive,''
Zivkovic said. ``After that, for a time, you feel lucky. But that
feeling dissipates and you start to realize that you have worse
problems than before.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Nis, who had been among the most fervent
supporters of democratic change and Western policies, have buried
34 civilians, he said _ casualties of NATO. Among them were 11
killed when cluster bombs hit a market on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly for the moment, the soldiers in Nis are still feeling
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy we survived, that we are alive,'' said a
20-year-old conscript who would give his name only as Nikola,
sitting in a cafe with two fellow soldiers. They arrived back from
Kosovo three days ago from their antiaircraft unit and have spent
much of the last two months hunkered down in trenches in the woods
in western Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to see civilization after three months,'' said
another soldier, Dragos, also 20, taking a long pull on his beer.
The two said they were counting the days until their year of
military service was up. ``We are in double digits now,'' said
Dragos, meaning fewer than 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing they did was to call their families and
girlfriends, they said. ``They were happy,'' Dragos said. ``They
had not heard from us for three months, they didn't know if we were
alive or not.'' Afterward the soldiers hit the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want this,'' said Nikola, gesturing to encompass
the war, the NATO bombing and the whole issue of Kosovo. ``We enjoy
sitting in cafes and chatting. But it was the bad policy of our
side _ they failed to solve it in a peaceful way. So NATO bombed
us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dragos said that as a child, he had wanted to be a soldier,
``but now, no way.'' Nikola, who said he had trained to be a
mechanic, insisted that he would never choose a military career,
despite the army's attempts to persuade conscripts to become
professional soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The two were initially reticent when asked if friends had been
killed in Kosovo. Fighting their emotions, they revealed that they
had lost several, both in the NATO strikes and in Kosovo Liberation
Army attacks.
</P>
<P>
   They changed their tone then, saying they were proud to have
defended their country against the most powerful alliance in the
world. And thinking about their friends who had died, they said it
had been worth fighting to keep Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As conscripts, they saw the streams of Albanians being expelled,
but said they had played no part in the purging. As to fighting the
rebels, they said that although they had not taken part in any
offensive, their positions had often been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they seemed to doubt whether the peace deal struck last week
was better than that offered in March, before the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy it has ended,'' Dragos said, ``but it could have
ended this way three months ago.''

DYNEGY, ILLINOVA TO MERGE IN $2 BILLION DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER WALSH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dynegy agreed on Monday to a $2 billion merger with
Illinova, an Illinois electric and gas company, giving the
energy-marketing firm electric plants and lines in major Midwest
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which will be called Dynegy and will be based
in Houston, will have total revenues of about $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will broaden the combined firms' energy-trading
strategies and will allow two large shareholders to follow through
on plans to reduce their stake in Dynegy, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates tremendous opportunities for the new company more
quickly than either company could have achieved on its own,'' said
Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Dynegy.
Watson will run the combined company as chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The combined assets from both companies is expected to lower
costs and allow Illinova to be more competitive in its marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the opportunity to access lower-priced electricity
in other markets that Dynegy is already involved in,'' said David
Butts, senior vice president of Illinois Power, a subsidiary of
Illinova, based in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction follows a trend of combining different types of
energy in the electric industry.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Enron Corp. bought Portland General Corp. in
Portland Ore., while Houston-based Reliant Energy, which owns
electric and natural gas companies, has expanded into trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this merger, the combined company becomes one of the few
players in the energy industry that possesses resources in energy
marketing and trading and power generation,'' Watson said. ``We're
confident this thing is going to be a company that will be a real
force in energy convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs are expected in overlapping administrative positions for
about 5 percent of the combined work force of about 6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dynegy fell by 7/16 to close at 18 1/4 on Monday.
Illinova rose by 5/16 to close at 25 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Dynegy enters the transaction as the larger company with sales
of $14.3 billion in 1998. Illinova had sales of $2.43 billion in
1998. When the deal is completed, Dynegy's shareholders will own
slightly more than 50 percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company can now produce 15,000 megawatts of energy,
which can light about 1.5 million residential homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too big, but more than what they were,'' said John
Olson, energy analyst for Sanders Morris Mundy, adding that the
amount makes up about 2 percent of the country's market.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also provides an option for Britain's BG PLC and
Canadian chemical company Nova Corp. to sell their combined 50
percent stake in Dynegy for about $645 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a solid transaction on both counts,`` Olson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Dynegy will get either $16.50 in cash or 0.69 of
the new share, while Illinova shareholders will swap their shares
with the merged company's shares. The deal acquires Illinova's
$2.25 billion debt and will include an $85 million termination fee.
</P>
<P>
   While this allows two long-term shareholders to exit, Chevron
Corp. will be upping its stake in Dynegy.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based company, which owns 29 percent of
Dynegy, announced it will take all stock in the deal and invest
$200 million to $240 million in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company (Dynegy) is in a growing area with
deregulation,'' said Mike Libbey, spokesman for Chevron, the
nation's fourth-largest oil company. ``It's got a centralized
energy in marketing and sales. We think Dynegy is positioned to
take advantage of that growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The transaction will be complete once Illinova sells a
nuclear-fueled power station in Clinton, Ill. Illinova currently is
in talks with Philadelphia-based Peco Energy Corp. to buy the plant
by the end of the year. Peco is currently managing the plant and
assuming maintenance and operating costs in an interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to be completed in March 2000, after
approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal
Energy Regulation Committee, and the Illinois Commerce Commission.

A LINE OF HEMINGWAY FURNITURE, WITH A VENEER OF TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jtr) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week, Jack Hemingway _ yes, son of _ was here
promoting the new Ernest Hemingway collection of furniture by
Thomasville. As far as he's concerned, the guardians of
civilization can just go wring their hands. Everybody else?
Consider the hunky ``Kilimanjaro'' bedside chest with
silver-finished hardware and paw feet, or a ``Catherine'' slipcover
love seat.
</P>
<P>
   Some years back, he and his two half-brothers signed with a
licensing agent to assert control over the family name,
particularly in this centennial celebration of Papa's birth. There
was a Hemingway Mont Blanc pen, an attempt at sports clothes, ``but
nothing as potentially profitable as this,'' Hemingway said the
other day at his Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just furniture,'' added Hemingway, 75, who has
pink skin, crisp blue eyes and an uncanny resemblance to his
father, and does 100 situps every morning. ``It's also accessories,
like picture frames, desk sets, clocks, and throws. ''
</P>
<P>
   He amplified, ``In the public eye, he's much better known for
his life style than his writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway _ Bumby in ``A Moveable Feast'' _ has a big,
unapologetic laugh, which he rolls out frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would this be fine with him? Probably not!'' The laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in light of Hemingway's family history _ pervasive
alcoholism; grandfather, father, uncle, aunt were suicides; a
half-brother who struggled with depression and a fondness for
women's clothes; one daughter with a history of mental problems;
the overdose of another (the actress-model Margaux) ruled a suicide
_ he presents himself as a remarkably jolly fellow. It's as if he
decided that when faced with the alternatives, to paraphrase
Dorothy Parker, he might as well live.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's firstborn probably had the best of his Papa, in the
early years before the ego ballooned and darkness fell. The son of
the first of the writer's four wives, Hadley Richardson, John
Hadley Nicanor (a matador) Hemingway spent his toddlerhood in the
cafes of the Lost Generation's Paris; his godmothers were Gertrude
Stein and Alice B. Toklas. His parents' divorce was not rancorous.
Jack vacationed with Papa: in Paris, Pamplona, Key West, Havana and
Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Time with Papa meant a gruff bonding as they hunted, fished and
boxed. ``He was my hero,'' Hemingway said. ``When he was with you,
you were the total center of his attention. But when I left to go
back to school, I was out of his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack was lucky. Never a serious student, he didn't aspire to
dance with his father's muse. Instead, he became a devout fly
fisherman. ``I was proud of Papa for his sports,'' his son said.
``When I was in prep school, an English teacher said to me,
``Hemingway, I expect more from you!'' And I said, `Why, sir?'''
</P>
<P>
   In ome arenas, son could go mano a mano with father. ``He
knocked me down, but I cut his eye and did a lot of damage,'' Jack
said. When Papa smugly arranged for him to be initiated by a Havana
prostitute, Papa didn't know that handsome Jack had already made
her acquaintance, gratis. During World War II, while arguing with
French Communists, Jack pulled a pin on a grenade. Before
parachuting behind enemy lines, he packed his fishing rod.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans shot him in his casting arm and held him captive for
six months. (``Papa loved to have me show off my scars.'')
</P>
<P>
   Professionally speaking, Hemingway was neither here nor there.
His 1986 memoir describes revolving-door jobs and is largely a
paean to Papa and fishing. After a stint as a stockbroker, he moved
his wife and three daughters to Ketchum, Idaho, living on trusts
from his father's estate, and became a conservationist of note. He
was an Idaho fish and game commissioner for six years, and sits on
several boards to protect North Atlantic salmon from nets.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemingway legacy has its blessings and burdens, said
Hemingway, who calls himself an imperfect father. With his gifted
but troubled eldest, Muffet, he was overbearing. Next, ``Margaux
was a ray of light,'' he said, ``but she lived in the fast lane and
it caught up with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his door was open, he didn't reach out. ``When the
problem was there, it was there, and when it wasn't, it wasn't,''
he said. ``I was like my father.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mariel, the actress, ``She was her mother's darling, and
had her head screwed on from the get-go.'' Hemingway's first wife
died 12 years ago and he has been remarried for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's candor is startling, and then rather winning. ``Papa
set a high premium on telling the truth, and I believed everything
he said,'' said Hemingway, who later learned that Papa, a notorious
self-mythologizer, had lied to his son about his war record.
</P>
<P>
   Papa also broke the most important vow he ever made. ``Neither
one of us will ever shoot himself, like Grandfather,'' Ernest told
Bumby. ``Promise me and then I'll promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa also told Jack never to sign anything he hadn't written.
But last week, there was Jack, at the Huffman-Koos furniture store
in Hackensack, N.J., jauntily autographing the latest Hemingway
biography, by one David Sandison. Anything to sell furniture. And
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   At least the licensed collection is tasteful, Bumby said. ``It's
protecting my father's name, and it's taking advantage at the same
time.'' Big laugh.

SENATE AIDES ARE DISCIPLINED FOR SEX IMAGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few Senate aides downloaded some pornography to
their computers recently, probably with the expectation that their
actions would remain private. And so they might have, if their
data-gathering from the Internet had been less exhaustive.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, they collected enough material to foul up the
computer system in their boss' office. Their boss is Sen. James
Inhofe, a conservative Oklahoma Republican, who, it is safe to
assume, was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe's chief spokesman, Gary Hoitsma said the aides, who
apparently violated a Senate regulation against downloading
pornographic or obscene materials, had been disciplined. But the
Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, which reported the episode
Monday, noted that Hoitsma declined to provide details ``in
deference to legitimate privacy concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll Call commented that the concern for privacy was ``odd''
given Inhofe's opposition to the appointment of James Hormel as
ambassador to Luxembourg. Inhofe has expressed concern that Hormel,
who is openly gay, might embarrass the United States by trying to
promote his lifestyle overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Hoitsma said that Roll Call's linking of the pornography
incident and the Hormel issue was ``totally ridiculous, and pretty
shoddy journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton installed Hormel last week, using the
prerogative of a president to fill a vacancy while Congress is not
in session. In retaliation, Inhofe said he would use the
prerogative of a senator to block future presidential nominees.

LENDER TO BUY INSURER BALBOA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., the nation's
largest independent residential mortgage lender and servicer, has
said it is buying a life and casualty insurance company for $425
million.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide's board already has approved the purchase of Balboa
Life and Casualty Insurance from Associates First Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, based in Irvine, has about 600 employees and is one of
the nation's leading writers of credit-related insurance in the
nation. It specializes in auto and homeowners insurance for
creditors such as mortgage holders.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa does business in all 50 states and had net premiums of
$234 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal further broadens Countrywide's presence in the
insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the company began an aggressive campaign to offer a
full range of insurance coverage. It operates Countrywide Insurance
Services Inc., a full-service insurance agency.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide agents will now be able to offer Balboa's products,
said Stan Kurland, president and chief executive officer of
Countrywide Home Loans and chief operating officer of parent
Countrywide Credit Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countrywide has a significant presence in the retail
distribution of insurance. The synergy is not placing (Balboa's)
people but actually using the entity as a preferred provider of
coverage for our agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Balboa will be funded in part by $200 million of
new common stock, equivalent equity-related securities, along with
unsecured debt.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jonathan Gray at Sanford Bernstein in New York said
Countrywide's core business will remain making home loans. Balboa's
operations are small compared with the home loan segment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have an array of products they are cross-selling. They
have a base of customers who have done business with the company
... and will offer this customer list other products and many other
financial services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Countrywide fells 87.5 cents to $39.3125 on light
trading Monday.

`JOHN DOE'S MASK THINS AS JUDGE LIFTS HURDLE FOR XIRCOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DON HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ The identity of a World Wide Web user who is
being sued as ``John Doe'' may soon be revealed under a court
ruling in a case over derogatory remarks about Thousand Oaks,
Calif., technology giant Xircom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom filed a defamation suit last month against the anonymous
detractor who posted comments on a Yahoo! message board claiming to
be a Xircom engineer, criticizing the quality of a key product,
poking fun at executives and claiming the work environment is bad
at Xircom.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom, a manufacturer of mobile computers, subpoenaed Yahoo!
and demanded Doe's true name. Ventura County Superior Court Judge
John Hunter threw out that subpoena Monday on procedural grounds,
but left the door open for the company to subpoena Yahoo! again.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter rejected a claim by Doe's attorney that his rights to
free speech and privacy would be violated by the release of his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom attorney David Jacobs said the company would issue a new
subpoena immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either somebody within the company or somebody who
recently departed the company,'' Jacobs surmised outside court.
``But since they are anonymous and have chosen to remain anonymous,
we don't know who they are. We're trying to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! is expected to turn over the critic's identity within 20
days so the case can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Doe's attorney, Megan Gray, said she will appeal the ruling.
She claimed Xircom's defamation lawsuit lacks merit, but said the
company could retaliate against her client if Doe's real name is
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been filed to harass John Doe and to chill the
speech of other individuals, in our theory of the case,'' Gray said
about the lawsuit. ``So we want an opportunity to come back into
court and show that this case does not have a likelihood of success
on the merits.''

WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATORS SET TO ENTER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ War crimes investigators will enter Kosovo on Tuesday to
start their most sweeping inquiry since conflicts began in the
former Yugoslavia in 1991, officials of the war crimes tribunal
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the international tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, are putting together at least 12 teams of
investigators involving some 300 people. The teams will consist of
both tribunal personnel and police experts on loan from various
countries who will work simultaneously across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first teams are scheduled to spend at least a week doing
surveying work, such as photographing, filming, and mapping out
sites to record crime-scene evidence that risks being lost or
changed, Paul Risley, a tribunal spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase, eight or ten days from now, forensic
experts are expected to begin digging up areas that are suspected
of holding mass graves of slain Albanians, Risley said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are following in the footsteps of NATO
peacekeepers who are tracking sites in which the court is
particularly interested.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, troops cordoned off the first such sites, including
three suspected mass graves near the village of Kacanik in southern
Kosovo. Before investigators can get to work, they need clearance
from the military, assuring them that no mines, booby traps or live
ammunition remain on a site. It is this safeguarding of the sites,
tribunal officials explained, that has delayed the investigators'
work.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, a tribunal staff of close to 30 people has been
working at offices in Skopje, Macedonia. But the group is expected
to swell tenfold once the experts promised by numerous countries
are in place.
</P>
<P>
   A team of British forensic experts has already arrived in
Skopje, according to Risley. The first of a group of agents from
the FBI and experts from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are
expected in Skopje on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said. Others
countries, including France, Germany and Norway, have pledged to
send specialists in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This operation will be a massive undertaking,'' said Graham
Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor of the tribunal in The Hague. ``It
will be unique in terms of the scale and the speed with which we
will operate.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he said, investigators who began to work in Bosnia
and Croatia in 1995 usually had to do their work months or even
years after the events. They were often blocked by Bosnian Serb
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The police detectives and forensic experts coming in from abroad
are expected to bring their own equipment, like cameras, tools and
storage space for evidence. They also may have to learn some new
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people will be briefing the outside experts on the
procedures used by the tribunal, on what evidence we need and how
we must safeguard that evidence,'' Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said that targets for investigation included six towns
and villages in Kosovo listed in the tribunal's recent indictment
of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia; they will be
investigated for mass graves. The surveying teams will also be
looking for other crimes, Risley said. For example, they will
consider whole villages that were destroyed either by arson and
looting, or by shelling. And they will try to corroborate accounts
from refugees, including accounts that Yugoslav police at border
posts had taken away and destroyed their documents before they let
them cross into Macedonia or Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Finding such evidence, however modest it may appear beside
atrocities, is essential for tribunal prosecutors as they prepare
their charges, Risley said.

AIRPLANE MAKERS DISAGREE ON DEMAND FOR SUPERJUMBO JETS 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-BOEING-OUTLOOK-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There was a jumbo size disagreement Monday between The
Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   The two airplane makers presented their current global aircraft
market outlook for the next 20 years, and they could not have come
to more different conclusions about the market for a plane bigger
than the 747.
</P>
<P>
   With its 747, Boeing today enjoys a monopoly on planes that can
carry more than 400 passengers. Airbus wants to break that Boeing
stranglehold and is planning to develop a plane called the A3XX
that will be able to carry upward of 600 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is a market for such a large plane has been one of
the industry's hottest topics for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Baseler, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, told reporters at a morning briefing Boeing believes
there is a 360-plane market worldwide for a plane bigger than the
747 between now and 2018.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those planes will not be needed until after 2008, he
said. Over the next 10 years, the market for a so-called superjumbo
is only 80 planes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly enough planes to justify the huge development
costs, and Boeing has decided for now not to build anything bigger
than the 747, though it may eventually stretch the current version
of plane to carry about 100 more passengers. Stretching the 747
would cost far less than building a new plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a niche market,'' Baseler said of the potential
customer base for something bigger than a 747.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps going down and down and down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 360-plane figure is down about 100 planes from Boeing's
market forecast a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus sees this market much differently, which is why it
maintains it will go ahead with the development by next year of the
A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   In his briefing Monday, Adam Brown, vice president of
forecasting and strategic planning for Airbus, said the market for
a plane the size of the A3XX is about 1,500 aircraft, which
includes about 300 freighters.
</P>
<P>
   If Boeing is right, Airbus could be building a white elephant.
If Airbus is right, Boeing could be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, a
market analysis firm, said Monday that Boeing's numbers are
probably too low and those of Airbus are almost certainly too high.
But Boeing is probably closer to the actual market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that's the smartest thing to do,'' he said
of the Airbus decision to proceed with development of the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing and Airbus don't agree about the need for a bigger
plane, they do agree that the world's aircraft market over the next
20 years will grow significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is forecasting that the world's airliner fleet will more
than double to 28,425 aircraft by 2018, representing some $1.38
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   That's close to the Airbus prediction that 15,500 new jetliners
valued at $1.3 trillion will be needed by passenger and cargo
airlines over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Baseler said the largest share of the market, more than
$570 billion, will be dedicated to intermediate twin-aisle planes
such as its 767 and 777.
</P>
<P>
   Market fragmentation and less regulation, especially in the
Asia-Pacific region, will open many new routes, he said.

ON PRO BASKETBALL: AT LAST, A RING FOR ROBINSON OR EWING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Robinson's life will be easier without Patrick Ewing to
guard him in the middle this week. He can roam the key freely, have
an inch or two more of room to shoot his left-handed rainbow jumper
and not have to worry about defending against Ewing's fakes and
fallaways on the other end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a part of Robinson that wishes Ewing were playing,
the part that feels for his counterpart _ the way only another
aging center who has been unable to lead to his team to a title
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish an injury on anybody at this time of the
year,'' Robinson said. ``This opportunity doesn't come around very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point Tuesday at the Alamodome after practices, Robinson
will meet up with Ewing. The two 7-footers will presumably segue
from a handshake into an embrace, exchange pleasantries. Then they
will go about their duties in the National Basketball Association
finals beginning in San Antonio tomorrow night: Robinson spinning
along the baseline, combining his talents with Tim Duncan's for the
San Antonio Spurs; Ewing pumping his right arm in the air from the
Knicks' bench, emotionally charging his team because physically he
is no longer able.
</P>
<P>
   And in two weeks, one will be fitted for a ring, killing the
perception that neither was ever of championship ilk. Whether it's
Ewing or Robinson, a semblance of justice will be meted out for the
two most maligned players in the NBA's Top 50 of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that way,'' Robinson said of measuring a
player's greatness by the championship rings he wears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you do night in and night out is what matters,''
he added after the Spurs' practice in San Antonio. ``But if that's
the standard that people are going to set, then you have to go out
and get it.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Being a champion is the most important thing in
our sport because there are a lot of guys who are just good out
there. Being able to get over that hump, and figure out what it
takes to move to that next level, is a big part of the measurement
that people use for greatness. I want to learn how to win it.
That's what's fun for me. Where I fit in history? I couldn't really
care less.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft, that's what the Admiral was often called. Before this
playoff run, he was on his way to being remembered as a frustrated
silver medalist in San Antonio the way Ewing was in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where players become aloof entertainment moguls
before some reach age 21, Robinson was said to be too accommodating
and pleasant for his own good. Scowling people like Bill Russell
won titles, it was said.
</P>
<P>
   The kinship between Ewing and Robinson goes beyond their
bittersweet careers. They played college basketball in the
Washington area: Ewing at Georgetown and Robinson at Navy. No. 1
draft picks in different years, their careers were defined more by
Hakeem Olajuwon's dominance of them in the mid-1990's than by what
they accomplished themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, they have also had the invisible mantle of Franchise
Player lifted from their name plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, they were called upon to score to get the team
over the top,'' said Herb Williams, the 41-year-old Knick reserve
center. ``Now that their teams added talent around them, they don't
try to go out and do everything they did before, because then you
start to step on people's feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a good player _ no, a great player _ to understand
the game of basketball and where he fits in. And that he needs to
play his role, night in and night out. Both of those guys did the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing accepted a reduced role more begrudgingly than did
Robinson, who welcomed Duncan into the fold like a brother from
whom he had been separated at birth. New York's Big Fella did not
speak much to Marcus Camby when he was first acquired and was
privately concerned about Latrell Sprewell's shot selection the
first few months _ many of his shots being launched before Ewing
crossed midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he had previously placed trust in Allan Houston, Ewing
eventually gained confidence in his new teammates this season and
understood how their athleticism could make life easier for him.
Post-Up U. was suddenly becoming Up-Tempo State, and the
possibilities were tantalizing for Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Urging his teammates to ``get me my ring'' during the Pacers
series, the day after a partly torn Achilles' tendon sidelined him
for the season, he began to see the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of great players go through this league and never get a
ring,'' Williams said. ``It's so tough to get there and so many
things can go wrong. You got to be good, but you also got to be
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you need help. One player does not win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   For so long, Robinson and Ewing have been deemed unreliable in
the clutch _ as if they were somehow the main reasons their teams
faltered in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, the labels will begin to die. ``Soft'' will slowly
become ``determined'' and ``stubborn'' may eventually become
``unselfish.'' And maybe, just maybe, two of the great centers of
their era will get their due.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both champions in my mind; they have been forever,''
Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``But now I think the outside
world is going to recognize one, at least, as a champion. And
hopefully, people can get by the fact of whether you have a ring or
not as being the sole determinant of who's a champion and who's
not.'' &QL;

JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS SUIT AGAINST OXFORD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an action that legal experts said made an
out-of-court settlement more likely in a shareholder class action
lawsuit against Oxford Health Plans, a federal district judge in
White Plains has rejected an Oxford motion seeking to have the suit
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Also affected by the ruling were other defendants, including 10
former and current senior executives and board members of Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders class, including the Colorado Public Employees
Retirement Association, accused the Oxford officials of knowingly
making false and misleading statements about the company's
financial problems in 1996 and 1997. The value of Oxford stock
plunged 62 percent in October 1997 after the company disclosed that
it would report a loss in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, which has since reorganized and appointed Norman Payson
as chief executive, had attributed its troubles to computer
problems, which it repeatedly said were being solved. On the
contrary, the plaintiffs charged, a computer consulting firm, the
Oracle Corp., determined in October 1996 that the Oxford computer
system was ``so deficient that Oxford should stop adding functions
and related data to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also accuses the officials, including Stephen Wiggins,
the founder and former chief executive of Oxford, of selling common
stock in late August 1997 for a total of more than $78 million,
with total profits of $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles L. Brieant said in a June 8 ruling that was made
available Monday by plaintiffs' lawyers that the defendants'
arguments in asking dismissal were ``without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rulings cannot be appealed and are rarely reversed,
according to lawyers familiar with the issues. They added that most
shareholder class action lawsuits were settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia M. Hynes of the plaintiffs' law firm, Milberg Weiss
Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, said the judge's latest ruling ``permits us
to go forward with discovery and to litigate the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also include William Sullivan, president of
Oxford; Andrew Cassidy, former executive vice president and chief
financial officer; Jeffrey Boyd, executive vice president and
general counsel; Robert Smoler, former chief of the New York
region; David Finkel and Dr. Thomas Travers, former vice
presidents; Dr. Benjamin Safirstein, a board member and former
medical director; Brendan Shanahan, vice president and controller,
and Robert Milligan, an outside member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   The individual defendants would presumably be covered by
liability insurance for Oxford directors and officers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giuffra, Jr., a lawyer for Oxford, said Monday that the
big managed health care company was ``disappointed that its motion
was denied and intends to defend this action vigorously.'' Giuffra,
a member of the Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell law firm, said that the motion
was preliminary, and he noted that the judge had not made any
findings on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Brieant said that under court rules for deciding on
motions to dismiss, he was required to assume, at this stage, that
the charges were true. In a parallel action on May 25, the judge
denied a request for dismissal of a class action lawsuit against
KPMG, the accounting firm that Oxford dismissed last summer. KPMG
asked Judge Brieant to reconsider that ruling last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John Fidler, a spokesman for KPMG, said Monday that the May 25
ruling was ``just another procedural step in the process.'' He
added, ``We expect ultimately that the case will be dismissed,
because we believe the allegations are false and cannot be
proven.''

U.S. DROPS A JOINT VENTURE FOR INTERNET ACCESS TO ITS DATA 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Commerce has officially pulled
out of an Internet partnership with a private company after the
project raised concerns about fee-based access to government
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which was designed to let paying customers find
government information on the Internet quickly and easily, was
officially started Monday, but as a strictly private venture.
</P>
<P>
   The department's National Technical Information Service had
planned to begin the service last month with the private company,
Northern Light Technology, but the venture was held up after
critics questioned whether it contradicted the Clinton
Administration's pledge to make the Internet and government
information more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   So as top-level commerce officials who had been unaware of the
partnership investigated the matter, Northern Light began offering
free trials of the search service.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of government participation in the venture will not
constrain what is offered through the service, since it searches
publicly available data bases and no license is required. But the
decision does mean a loss of potential revenue for the National
Technical Information Service, a for-profit agency of the commerce
department that was going to receive half the fees.
</P>
<P>
   Monday commerce officials said the department was officially out
of the venture. And Northern Light, which built the service,
announced a revised pricing plan for the search engine, which
enables Internet users to more easily find information from
millions of government Web pages, data bases and proprietary news
articles and periodicals. The service makes it possible to search
quickly for information on topics as general as ``abortion'' or
``missile technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive feedback we have received has clearly
demonstrated the need for this service and the value it offers to
anyone wishing to gain easy, pinpoint access to the vast amounts of
information produced by, for and about the U.S. government,'' David
Seuss, chief executive officer of Northern Light, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would make the service available free
to schools and libraries, and it dropped its planned price for
one-day access to the site from $15 to $5. Monthly and yearly
subscriptions for individuals will be $30 and $250, respectively.
Prices for corporations and other groups will be based on the
number of users.

NORTEL SAYS ITS PRESIDENT WILL RESIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David L. House, president of the Nortel Networks Corp. of
Canada, the communications equipment giant, will resign as soon as
this summer, Nortel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   House had been chief executive of Bay Networks Inc., a big maker
of data communications gear. Nortel, formerly Northern Telecom
Ltd., bought Bay last summer for $9.1 billion in stock in a bid to
bolster its presence in the Internet market. Nortel, like many
other big makers of traditional phone gear, is moving fast to
expand into offering advanced data communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   House did not outline any specific future plans. Nortel said it
had no plans to fill the post and that John Roth, vice chairman and
chief executive, would assume House's operational and management
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market may very well view House's departure as good
for Nortel. At Bay, he had at best a mediocre track record in
delivering consistent earnings growth, and the stock was known as a
roller coaster. Cisco Systems Inc., one of Bay's main competitors,
far outstripped Bay in delivering advanced products and stellar
financial returns.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel is facing the formidable technical challenge of
integrating Bay's data-networking technology with Nortel's
traditional telephone equipment. If House's departure demoralizes
former Bay executives, that may set back the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, North America's biggest maker of
communications equipment and Nortel's longtime rival, may soon face
similar issues. In January, Lucent announced a $20 billion deal for
Ascend Communications Inc., another big data-networking concern.
The deal is set to be completed in the next few weeks, but few
analysts expect Ascend's senior leadership to remain intact as part
of Lucent. Many analysts expect Mory Ejabat, Ascend's chief
executive, to depart Lucent within months of the deal's closing.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Nortel also created the new position of chief
technology officer and named Bill Hawe, a former Bay Networks
technology executive, to fill it. Hawe will oversee Nortel's
technology strategy and investments in and acquisitions of smaller
technology companies. &QL;

HUMAN EMBRYOS USED, BUT NOT CLONED, IN GERON'S RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Geron Corp., which has sponsored the leading research on
primordial human cells, said Monday that it was conducting research
on discarded human embryos in the hope of learning how to convert
the ordinary cells of a patient into stem cells that can be used
for self-repair.
</P>
<P>
   The company denied a report Monday that it was trying to create
cloned human embryos and said that it had no intention of doing so.
Rather, its recently announced collaboration with the Roslin
Institute of Scotland, the cloner of Dolly the sheep, was an effort
to understand how eggs ``reprogram'' the nucleus of an adult cell,
said Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice-president for research.
</P>
<P>
   If the reprogramming process was understood, biologists might be
able to take an ordinary cell from a patient and convert it into a
stem cell, using the reprogramming factors found in an egg. A group
of the stem cells might then be used to repair the patient's
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Okarma said Geron was working with animal eggs and with human
eggs rejected by fertility clinics because they were not viable.
The company's biologists said they hoped to see what factors from
the fluid, or cytoplasm, of the egg bind to its nucleus, in the
hope that these factors would show how the nucleus was
reprogrammed. An article on the company's research appeared in The
Washington Post on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Geron, a biopharmaceutical company in Menlo Park, Calif.,
financed the research of two university scientists who isolated
human embryonic stem cells last year for the first time. Congress
has forbidden the use of federal funds for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Geron, a company whose goal is to combat aging, worked to
isolate human embryonic stem cells because the cells have the
potential of turning into liver cells, eye cells, neurons _ all of
the body's cell types. Stem cells, can in principle, be used to
repair all of these tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But Geron's human embryonic stem cells are likely to be rejected
by most patients because they belong to an individual with an
incompatible immune system. Though there are theoretical ways to
fix the problem, the company has decided to take a leaf from the
animal cloners' book.
</P>
<P>
   In animal cloning, the nucleus of an adult cell from one sheep,
say, is inserted into a second sheep's egg cell, whose own nucleus
has been removed. Adult cells typically have their genes
permanently switched off, save those needed for specific roles.
Unknown factors in the cytoplasm of the recipient egg can
apparently release the switched-off genes in the adult cell's
nucleus, reprogramming it so it can take over the egg cell,
creating an embryo that grows into a twin of the animal that
provided the nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Geron said it was not interested in cloning animals or people
but in discovering the reprogramming factors and applying them to
mature cells from a patient, to avoid rejection by the patient's
immune system and any ethical problems of using cells from a
discarded human embryo.
</P>
<P>
   At no stage of the process, as it has been described, would a
human embryo be created. Though human embryonic stem cells can
generate all the tissues of the body, the tissues are not formed in
an orderly fashion unless the cells are inside the hollow sphere of
an early human embryo. The cells that form the sphere, known as
trophoblasts, seem to be responsible for organizing the inner cell
mass, from which embryonic stem cells are derived, into a properly
formed embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Embryos are created, however, in the process being pursued at
Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Mass., which announced last
November that it had transferred nuclei from human cells into cow
eggs. The human nuclei are thought to take over the cow egg, so
that the hybrid embryo quickly becomes human during the few days it
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The company's experiment was performed several years ago and
then halted. But Dr. Robert Lonza, an official at ACT, said Monday
the experiments had been resumed recently with two goals in mind.
One, like Geron's, is to discover factors that enable the egg to
reprogram the nucleus. The other is to create embryonic stem cells
from a patient by inserting a nucleus from the patient's cells into
a cow egg and then take the stem cells from the hybrid embryo,
which would be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are skeptical of this approach because of
evidence that mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in the
cytoplasm of the cow egg, would not work well with a human nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Lonza said that recently, Dr. Neil First of the University of
Wisconsin formed hybrid embryos using denucleated cow eggs and
nuclei from mice, monkeys and other animals. The embryos did not
grow to term in a cow's uterus, suggesting, he said, that cow-human
hybrid embryos would not be viable. Lonza said the company was
considering ways to replace the cow mitochondria with human
mitochondria.

ASTROS MANAGER TO UNDERGO BRAIN SURGERY TUESDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID BARRON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astros manager Larry Dierker will undergo brain
surgery Tuesday at Methodist Hospital, where doctors will attempt
to remove a 1 1/2-inch tangle of blood vessels that triggered his
violent seizures Sunday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will operate at about 7:30 a.m. to repair a condition
known as an arteriovenous malformation, removing a 4-cm clump of
vessels in the frontal portion of Dierker's brain that caused the
52-year-old manager to begin convulsing during an Astros-San Diego
Padres game.
</P>
<P>
   While the condition requires surgery that could sideline Dierker
for several weeks, doctors ruled out the presence of a tumor and
graded Dierker's condition as the least serious on a five-point
scale of potential scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the least-risky types of brain surgery that
could be performed,'' said Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
``I'm not going to say that this is the same as breaking an arm and
setting the bone, but under the circumstances, they (Methodist
physicians) are optimistic and feel he will have a full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker remained hospitalized Monday in stable condition at
Methodist's intensive-care unit. Televisions and radios are not
allowed in Dierker's room, but Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said
nurses were asked to give him inning-by-inning updates on Monday
night's Astros-Atlanta Braves game.
</P>
<P>
   At the ballpark, the Astros saluted their absent manager by
hanging his familiar No. 49 jersey in their dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Dierker was visited at Methodist by Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio. Both were
buoyed by Dierker's upbeat demeanor and the optimistic prognosis _
especially since they had been told Sunday night there was a 95
percent chance Dierker was suffering from a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in good spirits,'' Bagwell said. ``He's got a big day
ahead of him, but obviously being the other end of what it could
have been is a lot better. And that's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dierk's talking about being back on the bench in two weeks.
That's nice. It makes it a lot easier on us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio added, ``Maybe our thoughts and prayers were answered
yesterday in getting some of the results back.''
</P>
<P>
   Methodist Hospital officials, citing privacy requirements, would
not discuss arteriovenous malformations, known in medical shorthand
as AVMs, as they related to Dierker's case.
</P>
<P>
   However, the hospital said it annually performs about 350
craniotomies, or surgical openings of the skull, to remove AVMs or
tumors. A large number of those procedures involve tumors,
Methodist said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Rose, a professor of neurological surgery at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston, said the type of surgery faced
Tuesday by Dierker usually takes three to seven hours to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovery depends on the size and location of the malformation,
but after surgery, the patient typically spends a day in the ICU
and three days more in the hospital,'' Rose said. ``Usually,
patients resume normal activity in four to six weeks, but I'd think
Dierker could probably get back in the saddle in a couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that estimate and Dierker's comments to Bagwell,
Hunsicker would not speculate on when the manager could return.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker
said. ``The only thing on my mind is that the operation is
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said he was told that the tangled vessels had been
present for at least two or three years. Other authorities said
such conditions can be present at birth.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor familiar with Dierker's case said hemorrhaging
associated with the mass produced swelling in the brain, which in
turn triggered the seizures that affected Dierker for up to 20
minutes Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The mass was said to be in a ``noneloquent'' portion of the
brain, meaning an area that is not associated with motor, language
or visual skills.
</P>
<P>
   Headaches are cited as warning signs of AVMs, and Hunsicker said
Dierker had suffered headaches in recent days. He said the manager
remembered little about Sunday's game, which the Astros led 4-1 in
the bottom of the eighth inning when play was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was sorry he missed the grand slam (by Derek Bell
in the sixth inning, which accounted for the Astros' four runs),''
Hunsicker said. ``In fact, he didn't know what inning the game was
in when (the seizures) hit him. He remembers the first couple of
innings, but after that, he doesn't remember the rest of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said Sunday that Dierker had suffered a seizure
in San Diego in June 1996, a year in which he had several medical
problems. However, Hunsicker said Monday those reports were
incorrect. He would not elaborate on the nature of Dierker's health
at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was taken to Methodist Hospital Sunday after he was
stricken with a series of full-body seizures in the Astros' dugout.
He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam, or MRI, Sunday
night and an arteriogram on Monday that confirmed the presence of
the AVM and ruled out a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Players gathered in prayer on the field after Dierker was
removed by ambulance, a scene Hunsicker said typified the quality
of Astros players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of our success here is the people,'' Hunsicker
said. ``We've got special people here, on and off the field, and
yesterday was just a great example of how this team came together
in a time of crisis and showed the public what they're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Astros fans visited the team's World Wide Web site
Monday in record numbers to receive updates on Dierker's condition
or offer recovery wishes. About 1,675 visitors left e-mail get-well
messages for Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, the Astros said about 15 fans
visited Astrodome ticket windows Sunday to demand refunds from the
suspended Astros-Padres game. No refunds were granted, but the
Astros said they would consider giving a free ticket for a weekend
game to Sunday's ticket holders.

SOUTH KOREANS SINK NORTHERN NAVY BOAT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Ed.: The following story is an added starter on The New York Times
front page)  (nk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korea's naval forces sank an armed North Korean
boat Monday as a fierce gunbattle erupted in the Yellow Sea, and
South Korea put its entire armed forces on combat-level alert.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea said it fired in reaction to shots fired by North
Korean torpedo boats in the disputed waters, where the two navies
had been taunting each other in a nine-day standoff. The exchange
of fire lasted nearly 30 minutes, according to South Korean news
reports, and a South Korean government spokesman said that one of
the North Korean ships was sinking.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to firing by the North Korean navy, our naval
vessels fired immediately, according to military regulations,''
said Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs
of Staff. ``We have placed all naval forces in the area on combat
alert status.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``A North Korean torpedo boat was sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said late Monday through a spokesman that it would
have no comment until Tuesday at the earliest. ``We know something
has occurred. We have no details on it,'' said Army Lt. Col. Steve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   A high-speed South Korean patrol boat fired 76 mm rounds at the
North Koreans. South Korea also said it is ``taking measures to
contain the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government-owned Yonhap News Agency quoted a local
fisherman in a small village as saying that he had heard an
explosion at about 9:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean patrol boats had intruded early Monday morning into
the disputed waters south of the effective demarcation line
separating the countries' waters. The North does not recognize the
line, but it has never challenged it this openly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The armistice ending the 1950-53 Korea War, signed by the U.N.
Command and North Korea, never outlined the maritime border off the
Korean peninsula's central western coast.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Command unilaterally demarcated the sea frontier in
1953 and created a buffer zone south of it to avoid armed clashes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, North Korean boats, armed with torpedoes, apparently
surfaced near the disputed area, but no shots were fired. The U.N.
Command, led by U.S. military officers and supported by 37,000
American troops stationed in South Korea, then called upon North
Korea to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed to talk to U.N. military officials as part of
an effort to resolve the increasingly belligerent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, South Korean patrol boats had been
defending the line by ramming into at least three North Korean
vessels, as rising tensions have forced South Korea's Defense
Ministry to order warships to the area in a show of force. South
Korea has asked the United States to put some of its forces on
alert.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea instructed it servicemen that they are not to fire
unless they are fired upon first. However, they have been
explicitly warned by Adm. Lee Soo Yong not to ``concede even an
inch of our territories.''
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula was divided into North and South Korea in 1945.
Because the Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty,
the countries are technically still at war.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astros manager Larry Dierker will undergo brain
surgery Tuesday at Methodist Hospital, where doctors will attempt
to remove a 1 1/2-inch tangle of blood vessels that triggered his
violent seizures Sunday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will operate at about 7:30 a.m. to repair a condition
known as an arteriovenous malformation, removing a 4-cm clump of
vessels in the frontal portion of Dierker's brain that caused the
52-year-old manager to begin convulsing during an Astros-San Diego
Padres game.
</P>
<P>
   While the condition requires surgery that could sideline Dierker
for several weeks, doctors ruled out the presence of a tumor and
graded Dierker's condition as the least serious on a five-point
scale of potential scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the least-risky types of brain surgery that
could be performed,'' said Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
``I'm not going to say that this is the same as breaking an arm and
setting the bone, but under the circumstances, they (Methodist
physicians) are optimistic and feel he will have a full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker remained hospitalized Monday in stable condition at
Methodist's intensive-care unit. Televisions and radios are not
allowed in Dierker's room, but Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said
nurses were asked to give him inning-by-inning updates on Monday
night's Astros-Atlanta Braves game.
</P>
<P>
   At the ballpark, the Astros saluted their absent manager by
hanging his familiar No. 49 jersey in their dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Dierker was visited at Methodist by Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio. Both were
buoyed by Dierker's upbeat demeanor and the optimistic prognosis _
especially since they had been told Sunday night there was a 95
percent chance Dierker was suffering from a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in good spirits,'' Bagwell said. ``He's got a big day
ahead of him, but obviously being the other end of what it could
have been is a lot better. And that's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dierk's talking about being back on the bench in two weeks.
That's nice. It makes it a lot easier on us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio added, ``Maybe our thoughts and prayers were answered
yesterday in getting some of the results back.''
</P>
<P>
   Methodist Hospital officials, citing privacy requirements, would
not discuss arteriovenous malformations, known in medical shorthand
as AVMs, as they related to Dierker's case.
</P>
<P>
   However, the hospital said it annually performs about 350
craniotomies, or surgical openings of the skull, to remove AVMs or
tumors. A large number of those procedures involve tumors,
Methodist said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Rose, a professor of neurological surgery at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston, said the type of surgery faced
Tuesday by Dierker usually takes three to seven hours to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovery depends on the size and location of the malformation,
but after surgery, the patient typically spends a day in the ICU
and three days more in the hospital,'' Rose said. ``Usually,
patients resume normal activity in four to six weeks, but I'd think
Dierker could probably get back in the saddle in a couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that estimate and Dierker's comments to Bagwell,
Hunsicker would not speculate on when the manager could return.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker
said. ``The only thing on my mind is that the operation is
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said he was told that the tangled vessels had been
present for at least two or three years. Other authorities said
such conditions can be present at birth.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor familiar with Dierker's case said hemorrhaging
associated with the mass produced swelling in the brain, which in
turn triggered the seizures that affected Dierker for up to 20
minutes Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The mass was said to be in a ``noneloquent'' portion of the
brain, meaning an area that is not associated with motor, language
or visual skills.
</P>
<P>
   Headaches are cited as warning signs of AVMs, and Hunsicker said
Dierker had suffered headaches in recent days. He said the manager
remembered little about Sunday's game, which the Astros led 4-1 in
the bottom of the eighth inning when play was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was sorry he missed the grand slam (by Derek Bell
in the sixth inning, which accounted for the Astros' four runs),''
Hunsicker said. ``In fact, he didn't know what inning the game was
in when (the seizures) hit him. He remembers the first couple of
innings, but after that, he doesn't remember the rest of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said Sunday that Dierker had suffered a seizure
in San Diego in June 1996, a year in which he had several medical
problems. However, Hunsicker said Monday those reports were
incorrect. He would not elaborate on the nature of Dierker's health
at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was taken to Methodist Hospital Sunday after he was
stricken with a series of full-body seizures in the Astros' dugout.
He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam, or MRI, Sunday
night and an arteriogram on Monday that confirmed the presence of
the AVM and ruled out a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Players gathered in prayer on the field after Dierker was
removed by ambulance, a scene Hunsicker said typified the quality
of Astros players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of our success here is the people,'' Hunsicker
said. ``We've got special people here, on and off the field, and
yesterday was just a great example of how this team came together
in a time of crisis and showed the public what they're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Astros fans visited the team's World Wide Web site
Monday in record numbers to receive updates on Dierker's condition
or offer recovery wishes. About 1,675 visitors left e-mail get-well
messages for Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, the Astros said about 15 fans
visited Astrodome ticket windows Sunday to demand refunds from the
suspended Astros-Padres game. No refunds were granted, but the
Astros said they would consider giving a free ticket for a weekend
game to Sunday's ticket holders.

 &HT;    The Tim Duncan bio
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Television cameras scanning the NBA Finals
for effusive gestures from its most acclaimed player will have to
settle for nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan will not hang from the rim and swing his legs like
Shaquille O'Neal does. He will not invent moves en route to a
twisting, off-balance shot, like any number of young players. He
will not pound his chest so everyone knows that he has heart.
</P>
<P>
   When the Finals begin Wednesday night in San Antonio, the Spurs
forward might cut through the heart of the New York Knicks, using a
soft jump hook, a deft drop step, or a quick, spinning move to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   No, the NBA, which sells glitz with its games, will just have to
live with fundamentally correct, old-school basketball _ with the
reality that Duncan did not arrive in the league cable-ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has no MTV in him at all,'' Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich
said. ``Tim's disposition is such that his priorities are
unbelievably mature for his age (23). He just comes out and does
his work. He's not interested in attention or whether people ooh
and ah.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan might never develop a mega-watt personality like Michael
Jordan or Magic Johnson, nor does he appear interested in that. He
does not record CDs or act in movies. He prefers not to indulge the
media, merely enduring sessions with reporters and keeping them as
brief as possible. Inquiries about his laid-back, seemingly aloof
personality are among the few things that seem to agitate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help me. It doesn't hurt me,'' Duncan said. ``I
don't really care. I've never been one who is up or down. It's who
I am. I'm not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Duncan arrived last season from Wake Forest
University with post moves better than anyone this side of Hakeem
Olajuwon and with impeccable footwork that others required years to
master. Duncan's San Antonio sidekick, David Robinson, figured all
of that out before they had ever played in an NBA game together.
Robinson, a renowned defender, considered Duncan's ability to score
against him the ultimate test of the rookie's acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was passing it a little too well,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is so impressive that Robinson did not complain when
Popovich appointed the younger, more polished offensive player as
go-to guy this season. For nine years, the 7-foot-1-inch Robinson
held the job, averaging 25 points a game. He was the league's most
valuable player in 1995. This season, taking fewer shots, Robinson
averaged 15.8, while expending more energy in his new role as the
Spurs' anchor on defense. Even so, he sometimes at least shares the
primary role with Duncan if an opponent puts a weaker defender on
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   After an adjustment period during which Robinson said he was not
sure of his role in the offense, Robinson has excelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there was an adjustment,'' Robinson said. ``Before,
I was used to getting the ball as much as I wanted and pretty much
doing whatever I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have a guy like Tim, you have to use his talents,''
Robinson said. ``I don't have a problem with that. The biggest
thing about Tim is that he wants to get better. He cares about what
he's doing. He's willing to work, and he's very unselfish. Those
are combinations that are hard to find in such a talented player.
You've got to enjoy working with a player like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Popovich predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right from the beginning that Tim would be a good match
for David, because there would be respect between them,'' Popovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who has two years left on his contract, can exercise
an option to get out of the deal after this season. He said that is
unlikely. Few, if any, teams could pay him under the NBA's salary
cap the $13.3 and $14.7 million he would receive from the Spurs the
next two seasons. Robinson enjoys the Spurs' success, and he is a
pillar of the city, having given several million dollars to
educational programs and the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Having two versatile, athletic 7-footers in the game has
provided the Spurs with more talent than opponents can counter. Los
Angeles Lakers Coach Kurt Rambis assigned his biggest player,
O'Neal, to guard Robinson, which left no one to contend with
Duncan. Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy focused more on Duncan, and
Robinson elevated his offensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned to use each other,'' Duncan said. ``I think it
was limiting at first, but we've found ways to feed off each other
instead of get in each other's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he works best around the basket, Duncan is dangerous from
farther out, shooting bank shots from the wings or jumpers from
beyond the free-throw line, skills normally associated with smaller
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is as fundamentally strong as any big man I've seen,''
veteran teammate Steve Kerr said. ``He has the great post moves,
the terrific footwork. You have to really understand the game to
see how fundamenally sound he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich said that when he pointed out a tactical error that
Duncan made a few weeks ago, Duncan cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got about one word out of my mouth, and he said `I know,' ''
Popovich said. ``He understands the game the way Magic Johnson did
or Larry Bird did.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who averaged 21.7 points and 11.4 rebounds a game during
the regular season, is producing at a similar pace in the playoffs
_ 21.5 and 10.4. He averaged 29 points during the Spurs' four-game
sweep of the Lakers, who had the temerity to guard him with one
player, sending useless help to the scene of destruction as Duncan
laid the ball in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan hit the winning shot in game two, a jump hook from the
baseline. He scored 70 points in the two Los Angeles games without
taunting the Lakers or high fiving Jack Nicholson at courtside. At
one point in the series' third game, teammate Mario Elie came to
the startling realization that the score was Duncan 20, the Lakers
22.
</P>
<P>
   Most of time Duncan performs without expression. But Duncan does
make subtle gestures, though, like after he and Minnesota star
Kevin Garnett dueled basket for basket during one playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point that we both looked at each other and
winked, like `Good shot. Good shot,' `` Garnett said. ``Tim is a
great competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The highly emotional Elie once wondered about Duncan, confusing
his calm demeanor for a lack of passion. That was about the time
the Spurs were 6-8, and Elie, new to the team, was shooting verbal
arrows across the locker room at Duncan, Robinson and Sean Elliott,
criticizing them as being too soft to succeed against top
competition. The Lakers' O'Neal had already dismissed Duncan and
Robinson as lightweights unfit to compete against him.
</P>
<P>
   Elie and O'Neal, the latter swept from the playoffs, have since
come to appreciate and understand how Duncan operates. How could
they not? The Spurs have won 42 of 48 since their 6-8 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one fiercer on the court than my man Tim,'' Elie
now says.''I thought early in the year our guys were getting pushed
around. Then we progressed and said, `Hey, we're not going to get
pushed around any more.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Elie calls Duncan the 'Big Easy', a reference to the elegance
with which he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is so laid-back and cool,'' Elie said. ``He has such a
smooth game, and he looks like he does everything effortlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Jordan retired as the NBA's king last winter, media
pundits who are part of the league's fabric began trying to
identify the next Jordan. No one has passed inspection, not Grant
Hill, Penny Hardaway, O'Neal or Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Smart money says no one will elevate himself to the rarified air
in which Jordan worked, but many suggest that Duncan will soon be
the best player in the NBA if he is not already.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr, who played with Jordan in Chicago for more than three
seasons, detects important similarities between Jordan and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy has the work ethic and the talent that reminds me of
(Jordan),'' Kerr said. ``They have a passion for the game. Tim
really loves to play. Loves to. And Michael was the same way.
Usually what separates the great players from the good ones is that
the guys who have unbelievable talent and passion become great
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan might play like a throwback and conduct himself with
restraint, but he is not 23 going on 43. He competes seriously
against teammates at video games. He has a few tattoos. He wears
his shorts backward in practice. And he has a sharp wit,
particularly when needling his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Duncan is so unlike many contemporary young players
that he did not even make an issue of the new NBA collective
bargaining agreement, and no one stands to lose more money than he
does. Under the old rules, a player whose contract expired could
re-sign with his team for any amount the owner was willing to pay.
Several NBA players have six-year contracts totaling more than $100
million. Now, if Duncan remains with the Spurs after his rookie
contract expires next season, he can receive $71 million for six
years, perhaps $100 million less than he could have grabbed before.
</P>
<P>
   If Duncan cannot sell the game with personality, he might
enhance it with his mastery of the fundamentals. Many young players
who have tried to emulate Jordan work harder on style _
degree-of-difficulty dunks _ than skill. Jordan himself came to the
NBA with great athleticism, but it was only through exhausting
effort that he developed one of the deadlier jump shots, something
missing from many repertoires today. That is one reason scoring
continues to decrease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all grew up with Jordan's `Come Fly with Me' video,''
Detroit's Grant Hill once said. ``We're the slam-dunk generation.
Nobody would work on their skills on the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has taken responsibility for what he sired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some of that crept in because of myself and Charles
Barkley,'' he said last season. ``With our ability to take over a
game and sell ourselves as individuals, we have infected the game
as much as we have helped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young players who watch Duncan will not find fancy dunks to
copy. They might learn to use proper footwork and the backboard _
old-fashioned stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, formerly a competitive swimmer, began learning
basketball skills after Hurricane Hugo in 1989 destroyed the pool
he worked out in back home in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands. He
didn't like swimming in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Tim is a new millennium player,'' Spurs point
guard Avery Johnson said. ``All of the kids on the playgrounds are
trying to do crossover moves and shoot threes and dunks. When
people really get a chance to see Tim in the finals, I want kids to
run to the playgrounds and shoot jump hooks. Work on their
footwork. He's just a different kind of player, and that's what I'm
excited about.''

 &HT;    Miccosukees open casino in Everglades
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stand on the shoulder of the Tamiami
Trail west of Miami for long enough and any number of shapes will
rise before you from the infinite expanse of water and grass that
is the Everglades: a sleek, snowy egret; the fat neck of a bull
alligator; a black cloud of mosquitos; a blacker thunder cloud.
</P>
<P>
   A casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukee Resort and Convention Center is open for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Miccosukee tribal elders and casino management hosted a
ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday afternoon for the new casino, and
then partied into the night to the sounds of the Four Tops, Little
Richard, Hootie and the Blowfish and Chuck Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks blazed and WWF wrestlers thumped each other to the
wild applause of hundreds of VIP invitees and thousands of South
Floridians who braved a three-hour, six-mile traffic jam on Tamiami
Trail. They were answering the call to celebrate ``in one of the
last remaining natural wonders of the world: the South Florida
Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   The $50-million, nine-story, 302-room resort was built after the
federal government granted virtual sovereignty to the Miccosukee
tribe within almost 700 acres of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is not new to the Everglades. The Seminole tribe has
sponsored bingo for more than 20 years, the Miccosukee for nine.
But a gaming resort of this size is usually seen in Las Vegas or
Atlantic City. Nationwide, gaming resorts built on Indian land
bring in more than $6 billion and are filling once empty tribal
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Everglades is environmentally unique. Except for a
portion of the Bangladeshi coast, there is nothing quite like the
Everglades on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an inconsistency with developing a slice of the
Everglades just as Washington is getting set to spend $7 billion on
cleaning up the ecosystem?
</P>
<P>
   Is there an irony in the Miccosukee _ traditional protectors of
the Everglades since they settled here almost 150 years ago _
turning their land into a tourist destination?
</P>
<P>
   Promise to protect
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here first and have always protected the land and
continue to do so,'' tribal Chairman Billy Cypress said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pollution is a threat to the Everglades, entertainment is
not,'' he said. ``The federal government sets standards for the
Everglades yet they build prisons and immigration detention centers
out here. Our hotel is 20 miles from our homeland, on the edge of
the Everglades. It's not a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The new hotel will also benefit the tribe's 470 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel will employ 500 people, including many tribal
members,'' said hotel director of marketing, Janice Jefferson.
``We're sold out already for our first convention, the United South
and Eastern Tribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Depiction of early lifestyle
</P>
<P>
   A large wall mural behind the resort's registration desk depicts
a Miccosukee family in traditional garb among the untouched flora
and fauna that once was the Everglades. Monday night, their
descendants were gathered around the slot machines.

 &HT;    Duo convicted of hate crime murder
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The beating death of 29-year-old Steven
Goedereis by two teens last year was fueled not by fear or
retribution, but by the pair's prejudice against gays, two juries
said Monday in convicting the teens of hate crimes in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Donahue, 17, and Billy Dodge, 18, both of Greenacres,
Fla., could face more than 30 years in jail after they were
convicted by two separate juries Monday that heard testimony
together for much of the three-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery as a
hate crime, while Dodge was convicted of third-degree murder as a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the teens beat and kicked Goedereis more than
20 times after Donahue encountered Goedereis walking down 10th
Avenue North late one night. Donahue and Goedereis each were on
their way home, and both had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became head hunters,'' said Assistant State Attorney
Renelda Mack. ``They didn't stop until they got enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue told police Goedereis called him ``pretty'' and grabbed
him. In response, Donahue punched Goedereis and ran off to find his
friend Dodge; the two then returned to continue beating Goedereis
on the pavement outside a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers largely conceded the teens' roles in the
beating. The question for jurors became one of motive: Did they
beat up Goedereis because he was gay, as prosecutors said, or was
their thinking more complicated?
</P>
<P>
   Donahue's lawyer, Joe Atterbury, said his client felt threatened
by Goedereis' overture, and suggested that Goedereis was committing
a crime himself by propositioning a minor for sex. When Donahue
went back to his friends, he told them someone had tried to rape
him, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge went with Donahue to find this would-be rapist and to see
if the man was the same person who had been stalking Dodge's
girlfriend, said Mitch Beers, Dodge's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in Donahue's case quickly rejected his argument of
self-defense, convicting Donahue in just over an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't buy that he was threatened at all,'' said juror
Jeffrey Labelle of Boynton Beach. ``They showed us no evidence that
Steven even said anything to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, John Gramling of Lake Worth, said the fact that
Donahue went back to the street with Dodge looking for Goedereis
belied any argument that he was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue also was convicted of robbery as a hate crime because he
took Goedereis' book bag after punching him.
</P>
<P>
   The second jury struggled more with Dodge's case, deliberating
for 3 1/2 hours before convicting him of the lesser crime of
third-degree murder. Specifically, the jury found Dodge committed
the third-degree felony of aggravated battery that led to
Goedereis' death.
</P>
<P>
   Beers argued that Goedereis' injuries were not so obviously
severe that Dodge should have known the man's life was in danger.
He called the verdict a ``major victory'' for his client.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that Dodge's crime was a hate crime, Dodge
could face a more severe prison term. He and Donahue are scheduled
to be sentenced in September by Palm Beach County Circuit Judge
Harold Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Goedereis' family was reserved after the final verdict was read
Monday night. ``We'll see what happens at sentencing,'' his father
said.

IS L.A. READY FOR THE ARENA `AVENGERS`?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles' newest sports franchise got a name
and a face put to it Monday, and the mayor's designee to the
ceremony had but one wish. ``I don't know what the name is,'' said
senior adviser Steve Soboroff, ``but as long as it's not the
`Raiders,' I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Coliseum awaits a new, NFL-sanctioned tenant, the only
football team certain to call the city home is the Avengers of the
Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Casey Wasserman, granted the indoor league's 17th
franchise last fall, unveiled the Avengers name and logo _ a
futuristic-looking, helmeted warrior in blue, gold and red _ Monday
morning outside Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers, co-tenants with the Lakers, Clippers and Kings,
will begin play at Staples next April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a name that would ... capture the spirit and
imagination of Los Angeles,'' said the 24-year-old Wasserman. The
team name, he said, is ``an embodiment of ideals _ power,
excitement, unpredictability.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman, his advisers and marketing consultants considered
several names, and in the end, chose Avengers over Knights.
</P>
<P>
   All the team needs now is a coach and 20 players. Wasserman
hopes to hire a coach-general manager by the end of August, and
he'll be allowed to sign free agents after the ArenaBowl on Aug.
22. The roster will be filled out via an expansion draft in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman said he'll try to find a coach with NFL experience,
``maybe a name,'' but possibly a fresh face to go with the newborn
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   This will be L.A.'s second entrant in the Arena league. The
Cobras played one season at the Sports Arena in 1988, when the
fledging league was still struggling for an identity. Wasserman
expects better results and ambitiously envisions a sellout crowd of
18,500 at Staples for the Avengers' debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have bought the team if I didn't think
that was achievabe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are on sale by phone at 877-4-Avengers, and more
information is available online, at www.LAavengers.com.

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Irwin Simon, the chief executive of
Hain Food Group, has spent millions of dollars assembling an empire
of natural-food products ranging from snack foods and soy milk to
condiments like mayonnaise. His company made its latest acquisition
in May, paying $70 million for the privately held Natural Nutrition
Group and its collection of brands that include Health Valley
cereals. The move lifted Hain's projected annual sales to $300
million, about triple what they were in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 27 brands and more than 1,000 products, the company is
confronting the problem of how to attract consumers' attention and
build brand loyalty, especially among people who are not already
buying natural foods. It is a tall order, considering the intensely
competitive natural-foods business, which is rife with rival
products, and the challenge of making bland names like
``Breadshop'' and ``Westsoy'' zingy and memorable to the average
shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others who follow the industry argue that consumers
have only the foggiest awareness of even the most venerable brands
in the health-food business and that Simon faces an uphill battle
to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so many brands that it would be difficult to
delegate the marketing dollars efficiently,'' said Steve Hoffman,
publisher of Natural Business, an industry newsletter. ``This is a
day and age when it's become more and more competitive and brand
building, brand recognition and brand ownership are becoming more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because the natural-foods business has grown so fast _
between 10 percent and 15 percent a year recently _ retailers that
specialize in it have begun to market their own brands, competing
directly with Hain, which already has competition within the
category. ``You're seeing a rise in private label products in
stores like Wild Oats and Whole Foods,'' Hoffman said, ``and they
say that's because there's no brand recognition in the natural-food
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers, particularly baby boomers, are turning to such foods
as part of an effort to live healthier and maybe longer. And
natural products often cost more _ increasing the profit potential
for stores that carry them.
</P>
<P>
   But as companies like Hain elbow their way into mainstream food
stores, they must go head to head with the colorful and heavily
advertised products of companies like Nabisco Group Holdings'
Nabisco and General Mills. While consumers may want them and
retailers may like them, that does not always mean there is plenty
of shelf space available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that, until now most of Hain's advertising budget was
spent on marketing to retailers. That effort has paid off, with
Hain present in many supermarket chains, including Kroger, Fred
Meyer and Food Lion. It has also been pushing to get its brands _
which include Weight Watchers snacks, licensed from H.J. Heinz, and
the Estee line of artificially sweetened foods aimed primarily at
diabetics _ into drugstores and other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Those advertising priorities are about to change, according to
Maureen Putman, the company's vice president for marketing. ``In
fiscal 2000, which starts July 1, we are swinging the pendulum to
consumer advertising,'' she said. That includes hiring outside
agencies for the first time. Lotas Minard Patton McIver in New York
is working on a campaign for Terra Chips, the designer vegetable
chips acquired by Hain last summer, and another Manhattan agency,
Hard Hats Inc., is developing a campaign for Westsoy, a soy-milk
beverage line Hain took over when it bought Westbrae Natural in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns will consist of radio and print ads and are still
on the drawing board, Mrs. Putman said, adding that she expected
Hain to spend ``around 6 percent of sales'' on advertising, which
would put the spending for the coming fiscal year at about $18
million. ``We first needed to get the products into distribution,''
she said, explaining Hain's original advertising strategy. ``Now we
need to let consumers know about them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Terra Chips has a distinctive name, product and package,
the campaign's goal is to increase sales. The Westsoy effort is
slightly more challenging: Not only are the ads supposed to get
people who do not drink soy milk to try it but also to win over
people who buy some other manufacturer's product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big obstacle here of course is taste,'' said Karin
Miksche, the creative director of Hard Hats, a three-year-old
agency with billings of $14 million. ``Most people, when you say
`soy beverage' go `Yuck!' or `Ewww.' That's what we have to
overcome to generate trials.'' Most print ads for soy milk show a
glass of it, or a cereal bowl, and she plans to get away from those
well-worn paths, she said, although she would not give any further
details.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Putman said advertising on Web sites would also become a
priority in the coming months. ``It is an expensive proposition,''
she said, noting that new Web sites can cost $50,000 to $100,000
each, ``but for brands like ours that require education, Web sites
are important.'' The Earth's Best line of baby food, made by Hain
and sold in natural-food stores under a license agreement with
Heinz, is advertised through a link on Baby.com, she said. Other
advertising efforts include direct mailings and coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, whose background in sales and marketing at Slim-Fast
Foods Co. and the Haagen-Daz unit of Diageo reveals that he is not
exactly to the health-food manner born, has used debt to acquire
companies almost continuously since he formed the publicly traded
Hain in 1993. With his pinstriped suits and his summer place in
East Hampton, Simon appears much more the financier than the
counterculturist. Along with the new ad campaigns, he plans to drop
some products, particularly those that overlap with others in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at what are the three or four pillars of each
brand,'' he said, noting that the company's Health Valley unit was
known for soup, cereal and baked goods, while Westbrae was
considered ``vegetarian and organic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new product introductions seem to have been
key to the company's growth. Just this year, Hain introduced 14 new
products, including a ``Hain Kidz'' line, which consisted of
marshmallow-crisp cereal and snack bars, animal cookies and a
company riff on gummy bears; two new cracker lines; four Westsoy
products, including a soy-milk pudding, and Terra Stix snacks.
Since it acquired Terra Chips last July as part of an $80 million
buyout of the Shansby Group, Hain has widened distribution and
introduced Terra Blues, a blue potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   The Hain Kidz line, while it was a timely move, immediately ran
up against ``Whole Kids,'' a line of staples like apple juice and
peanut butter from Whole Foods, one of the biggest natural-food
retailers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not all natural products have done well for Hain. Its 1997 net
sales fell by more than 5 percent, largely because it was deeply
vested in the rice-cake business. And while profits have usually
tracked sales in percentage increases, some wonder whether that
will continue once Hain slows the pace of its acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said investors seemed to like what's going on. The
company's shares closed at $21 Monday, up from their 52-week low of
$10.75 in October but down from their 52-week high of $28.625 in
June 1998. ``People are looking at what the growth is in our
existing businesses,'' he said. ``You can't mask that with
acquisitions.''

CATHOLIC BISHOPS CALL FOR OVERHAUL OF NEW YORK DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state's Roman Catholic bishops called on the
governor and the state Legislature Monday to overhaul New York's
stiff drug laws, saying they have filled the state's prisons with
addicts who would be better served in drug treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page statement, the New York State Catholic Conference,
the lobbying organization for the state's Catholic bishops, also
said the laws' tough mandatory sentences had caused New York's
prison population to swell at enormous public expense since their
enactment in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``As moral teachers, we believe the time has come, after a
quarter-century of experience, to urge all New Yorkers to advocate
for a more humane and effective system to rehabilitate addicts and
protect public safety,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, adopted in 1973 under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, call
for some of the toughest prison sentences in the nation for drug
offenses. Critics have charged that the laws have needlessly
clogged the state's prisons with drug offenders, many of them
nonviolent addicts, who might have a better chance of
rehabilitation in a drug treatment program or some other, cheaper
alternative to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The statement released by the bishops on Monday came as a broad
coalition of judges, criminologists and politicians from both
parties began an aggressive campaign urging Gov. George Pataki and
the Legislature to scale back the drug laws drastically, if not
repeal them, in the current legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Under the drug laws, judges must abide by rigid sentencing
guidelines that require long prison terms for drug offenses,
including lower-level crimes like possessing a small amount of
narcotics. For example, someone convicted of selling more than two
ounces of cocaine, heroin or other controlled substances, or
possessing more than four ounces, must get at least 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, the bishops backed two of the main goals
sought by critics of the drug laws: the abandonment of the current
sentencing structure for drug crimes and the restoration of
discretion to trial judges in determining the punishment for drug
offenders. The statement also said the laws' mandatory drug
sentences put far too many nonviolent drug offenders behind bars
without addressing their fundamental problem: their addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who are currently incarcerated and serving long
and costly sentences in our state prisons are persons with
addictions,'' the bishops said. ``The individual and common good
would be better served if these persons were treated for their
illness in an addiction treatment program rather than a prison or
county jail.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear whether lawmakers will heed the growing
calls to overhaul the state's drug laws this year. Pataki, a
Republican, has proposed some changes to the laws, but his plan is
being opposed by Democrats in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes the governor is seeking is allowing appellate
judges to cut the minimum sentence to as little as 10 years,
although only in cases involving first-time felons convicted of
relatively minor crimes like possessing a small amount of drugs
above the four-ounce minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 9,063 people went to state prison for drug offenses.
That brought the total of people serving state prison terms for
nonviolent drug crimes to slightly more than 22,000, or almost a
third of the state prison population of 70,000, according to the
state.

BRITISH INDUSTRY SEEKING A SHARE OF BALKAN REBUILDING WORK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Three days after British troops led the NATO advance
into Kosovo, British government officials plan to meet with
business leaders Tuesday to devise a strategy for securing Kosovo
reconstruction contracts.
</P>
<P>
   They will try to offset a widespread view that British companies
lost out in the race to rebuild Kuwait after the Gulf War eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at the Department of Trade and Industry here, is
expected to focus on making sure that British companies know well
in advance how to bid for contracts that the European Union has
estimated could be worth as much as $3.5 billion in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is much smaller than the likely cost of rebuilding
power-supply installations, roads, bridges and other big capital
projects damaged by bombing in the rest of Serbia. Those costs have
been estimated by European officials at $30 billion to $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of rehabilitation in the worst-damaged areas is
clouded by political opposition in Washington and London. Both
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair oppose the idea of
spending money on reconstruction in Serbia outside Kosovo while
President Slobodan Milosevic remains in power. Clinton has also
insisted that the bulk of reconstruction money come from the
Europeans, not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the initial focus will be on rebuilding in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall aim is that British companies are well placed to
bid for contracts,'' said Carrie Deverell, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Trade and Industry. The creation of what she called a
task force is certain to be part of a broader European race to
compete for contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the allied bombing was under way with no immediate
likelihood of a suspension, senior European officials met with
business leaders in Brussels on May 19 for informal discussions,
during which Goran Lindahl, chief executive of the giant
Swiss-Swedish engineering company ABB, proposed the creation of a
body to oversee the rebuilding and revival of the entire Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to the text of a speech he gave in
the presence of officials including Romano Prodi, incoming head of
the European Commission, Lindahl warned that without bold action to
reduce the financial risks of operating in the region, private
companies would ``wait a long time for stabilization to be achieved
before they commit new investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's assumption, according to Pauline Shearman, a
strategist at the Confederation of British Industry, is that the
European Union and international financial institutions will
provide the bulk of international financing for reconstruction
projects. She said that the confederation, as the main umbrella
group for British manufacturers, wanted to insure that ``British
companies have suitable access to the opportunities and the
information'' required to bid for projects.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the British strategy are still vague. But, Ms.
Shearman said, companies that are already scouting for business in
Croatia and Bosnia would probably seek contracts in road building,
power generating and water supply in the Kosovo region. ``As far as
we are concerned there are no immediate plans for the Serbia
situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Adams, executive director of the British Consultants
Bureau, a lobbying group financed by consulting firms in a broad
range of industries, said British companies did not want to be left
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point to bear in mind,'' he said, ``is that there is often
a perception that British companies can be slow off the mark. We
felt that in Kuwait we could have managed things a little better,
and there was a feeling that British companies could have won more
contracts. The whole objective is to make sure that we have our
loins properly girded, and have a clear plan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said nearly 60 of the British Consultants Bureau's 300
members had shown interest in seeking Kosovo contracts. They
include companies specializing in work ranging from agricultural
revival to civil engineering to mine clearing.
</P>
<P>
   One British company reported to be interested is Amec PLC, a
civil-engineering business that played a big part in repairing
Sarajevo's gas system from Bosnia war damage, and is now looking
for contracts in water supply, health care, power, railroads and
oil and gas supply.
</P>
<P>
   Other British construction-engineering concerns said to be
interested in reconstruction work are Ove Arup &AMP; Partners and Mott
MacDonald.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
When Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio visited Larry Dierker at
Methodist Hospital on behalf of their Astros teammates Monday
afternoon, their fallen manager left them with a message.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He told us to take three out of four from the Braves,''
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go for the sweep?
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't want us to get too greedy,'' Bagwell added.
</P>
<P>
   One day after surviving the scare of his life, Dierker still
wasn't out of the woods. But he was in a lighthearted mood, and
that was enough to inspire his players to move forward without him.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who suffered a grand mal seizure during the eighth
inning of Sunday's suspended game against the San Diego Padres,
learned Monday that he has a condition known as arteriovenous
malformation, a collection of blood vessels that dislodged and
caused the seizure. He will undergo brain surgery today.
</P>
<P>
   According to Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker, doctors say
the prognosis is excellent. Although no definitive timetable has
been placed on Dierker's recovery and subsequent return to the
dugout, Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. indicated Dierker could be
away from the team for as long as a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Elizabeth, and I visited Larry today, and he was very
upbeat,'' McLane said. ``He told us he thought he could be back in
two weeks, but the doctors say a month is more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the team with the best record in the National League
is under the guidance of interim manager Matt Galante, who
officially began his tenure as Dierker's fill-in when he presented
the Astros' lineup card to home-plate umpire Wally Bell before
Monday's game against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Galante also visited Dierker at the hospital Monday, although
the two didn't talk much about the direction of the team. They
mostly talked about Sunday _ things Dierker remembered and a few he
did not, such as Derek Bell's sixth-inning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did remember the last conversation we had before his
seizure, which surprised me,'' Galante said. ``I asked Dierk, `Was
I so boring that I put you to sleep?' He was in good spirits, and
that was good to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The news regarding Dierker's condition was better than some
feared _ there was legitimate concern Sunday night that he might
have a tumor _ and Hunsicker believes that will help the club move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is relieved,'' Hunsicker said after meeting with the
players to update them on Dierker's situation. ``This could have
been a lot worse. You can't take brain surgery lightly, but the
prognosis has taken some of the tension out of the clubhouse. I
clearly saw a much more relaxed team (than on Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who was at the plate when Dierker's seizure began, said
seeing his manager Monday eased some of his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like seeing the same old Dierk,'' Bagwell said.
``Obviously, there's nothing exciting about brain surgery, but the
prognosis is better than when we thought he might have a tumor.
Last night, it looked about 95 percent bad. Hearing today's news
was like getting the good 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante, 49, has served as Dierker's bench coach since the
beginning of the 1998 season, and he will handle both roles until
Dierker returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, managers didn't have much help,'' Galante
said. ``It's always going to be awkward when you come in as the
replacement; I did it twice in the minor leagues. But it's less
awkward here because I've been around some of these guys for so
long. I know the personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every decision I make is not going to be perfect. But we have
good players, and they're going to win games. Hopefully, when Dierk
comes back, our (National League Central) lead will be even bigger
than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante reiterated that Dierker's absence won't bring about
drastic changes regarding the way the Astros are managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no real differences as far as the game goes,''
said Galante, who has extensive experience as a minor-league
manager and also has overseen teams in the Caribbean winter
leagues. ``Larry and I always discussed every situation anyway. It
was his choice when it came to making those decisions, but we
always talked about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing that you have to keep in mind is that we have
very good players, and those guys know how to play the game. I'm
here to mind the store and keep Dierk's seat warm until he gets
back. If his absence is short-term or long-term, so be it. I'm just
minding the store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can only hope business will remain good.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr has apparently decided to tie up the many loose
ends of his mammoth investigation with a final, detailed report on
a range of questionable activities involving Bill and Hillary
Clinton that disappeared from public view the moment Monica
Lewinsky came along. According to the law and by precedents set by
earlier independent counsels, the public deserves a final
accounting, and Starr has the right to give his view on matters
that did not rise to criminal indictments. But what he does not
have a right to do is disrupt New York's Senate campaign, which is
likely to include Mrs. Clinton. He should not time his report to
the electoral calendar or slant it to present her in the worst
light.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Starr can partly repair his reputation for bad judgment
by getting this report right as to both timing and tone. Given the
fact that his predecessor, Robert Fiske, began investigating
Whitewater five years ago, there is no reason that Starr cannot
present his report in fairly short order. To wait until next year,
when Mrs. Clinton's campaign would be in full swing, would simply
confirm her allies' worst suspicions. In addition, the report
should be an evenhanded recitation of the evidence, including any
exculpatory findings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any report on Whitewater, the mysteriously migrating
Rose Law Firm records, Travelgate and Filegate is likely to
discomfit Mrs. Clinton. So may the two forthcoming trials involving
Webster Hubbell, the former associate attorney general and a
longtime friend of the Clintons. But since Starr has decided not to
indict Mrs. Clinton, the task of bringing these matters into the
electoral arena belongs to her prospective Senate opponents, not
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, it is to be hoped that if Mrs. Clinton does enter
New York politics, she will remember all the harm that
Arkansas-style stonewalling did to her husband's administration and
to the nation. The Clintons' decision not to answer reasonable
questions about Whitewater led directly to the appointment of a
special prosecutor. Congress, in turn, was repeatedly frustrated by
the White House's blocking tactics, by its meddling with legitimate
investigative arms of the federal government and by its refusal,
from the 1992 campaign onward, to provide a consistent factual
narrative of the Clintons' financial history. Had the president and
his associates provided all the evidence on Whitewater and the
other assorted scandals when they were invited to, Mrs. Clinton
would not have to worry about Starr's final report. Indeed, she and
her husband might not even have encountered Starr to begin with.

EDITORIAL: BACK TO BASICS WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   One of Washington's top diplomats, Thomas Pickering, is leading
a team of American officials to Beijing to explain and once again
apologize for the mistaken NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade. Pickering's visit on Wednesday should end the period of
icy hostility brought about by this incident, which killed three
Chinese journalists. In the coming days, Beijing should resume
discussions with Washington on the World Trade Organization and
other important matters that it has frozen since the embassy
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration needs to give China and the American
people a fuller explanation of the events that produced the
apparently accidental bombing. In an age of computer targeting and
laser-guided bombs, mistakes this egregious should not happen.
Washington must also fairly compensate the families of the three
Chinese victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, for their part, have assumed from the start that
the attack was deliberate. That judgment should be put aside and
Pickering, who comes prepared to offer a detailed reconstruction of
the incident, should be given a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Beijing have an important agenda to attend to,
headed by the issue of China's admission to the WTO. The two
countries came close to agreeing on entry terms during the visit of
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to America this spring. If Beijing is
ready to resume discussions where they broke off, a deal should be
possible quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Talks should also be renewed on other matters, including human
rights, relations between the two countries' armed forces and trade
rules for militarily sensitive items like computers and satellites.
There is also the unresolved question of alleged Chinese political
contributions to American election campaigns. These are all
sensitive issues, even more so after the recent Cox committee
report on Chinese nuclear espionage. But discussing them is more
productive than dwelling on the bombing.

REDS BEAT METS, 8-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Getting runners on base has not been a problem for
the Mets this season. Driving them home has, at times. On Monday
night, they left the bases loaded twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds erupted for five runs after Jason Isringhausen was
lifted for a pinch-hitter in the top of the sixth inning, three of
them on Aaron Boone's tie-breaking home run off Turk Wendell, as
Cincinnati scored an 8-4 victory over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when your two best hitters are given the evening
off. Or when your bullpen has to come in game after game before the
eighth inning, almost always in a tight game.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell was pitching one night after recording a save. The
right-hander had come on in relief of Greg McMichael, who was
pitching for the third time in four games since coming off the
disabled list. McMichael walked the first two batters he faced
after the Mets had gotten Isringhausen off the hook in the top of
the sixth when they tied the game at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael came back to strike out the next two batters. On came
Wendell, who has now appeared in 35 of the Mets' first 63 games.
Two pitches later, Boone homered to left and it was a 6-3 game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McMichael (0-1) and Wendell were tired. Manager Bobby
Valentine thought Mike Piazza and John Olerud were. The Mets'
lineup had a decidedly different look. Last week, Valentine had
said Bobby Bonilla would sit out six games. For the first time in
eight days, Bonilla _ who did not start the last six games _ was in
the lineup. But it was at first base and not in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine gave his regular Nos. 3 and 4 hitters, Olerud and
Piazza, the night off, as the Mets began a road trip after winning
six of their last seven games. The switch-hitting Bonilla batted
cleanup against left-hander Ron Villone, while Benny Agbayani, who
hits right-handed, batted third.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said that Piazza, who had started every game since May
20, had requested the day off. Piazza said Valentine suggested it
and he agreed. General manager Steve Phillips said the Mets were
playing Bonilla, who has feuded with Valentine, merely to give a
day off to Olerud, who started 61 of the Mets' first 62 games, and
that the team was not trying to showcase Bonilla for a trade. ``I
think he can play first base,'' Valentine said of Bonilla, who had
made one other start there this year. ``I wouldn't put him there if
I didn't. He said, `Whatever we need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine added that Bonilla would not be rejoining the outfield
rotation any time soon. ``But I don't see that we have any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And Phillips said he still felt as he did on Saturday, when he
said of last week's feuding between Valentine and Bonilla, ``It's
resolved.'' There was a pause. ``For the time being,'' Phillips
continued, adding that a meeting last weekend between Bonilla and
Valentine has taken ``some of the urgency off any of the other
options we have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Those options include trading Bonilla or even releasing him. For
his part, Bonilla said: ``I've got no more to say. I'm tired and
I'm exhausted. That's to everyone. There'll be no more from Bo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla finished 0 for 5, but he did drive in a run, in the
first inning, when he grounded into a force at second with the
bases loaded and nobody out. Villone _ who issued four of his seven
walks in the first _ walked Roger Cedeno on a full-count pitch with
two outs to force in another run, giving the Mets a 2-0 lead on
just one hit, Edgardo Alfonzo's single.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only hit the Mets would record against Villone, who
tossed 36 pitches in the first. The Englewood, N.J., native was not
charged with another run until the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied the game on solo homers from Michael Tucker (with
two outs in the third) and Barry Larkin (with one out in the
fourth). And when Michael Cameron singled with two outs in the
fourth, stole second and scored on Aaron Boone's double that
rattled around the left field corner, the Reds had a 3-2 lead
against Jason Isringhausen.
</P>
<P>
   Villone was removed after walking the first batter of the sixth
inning, but the Mets tied the game against Scott Williamson when
Rey Ordonez lined a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded and nobody
out. But just as they had in the first, the Mets left the bases
loaded as Alfonzo struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Mets' bullpen collapsed.

 &HT;    Glavine feeling frustrated
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's been almost a month since Tom Glavine got a win,
and while he continues to feel better about his recent work on the
mound, last year's Cy Young award winner is starting to get
impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets old going in afterward and saying `I feel good about
what I'm doing and I'm giving the guys a chance to win,''' said
Glavine, who is 3-7 and has three losses and a no-decision in his
past four starts. ``I'm still sitting there with a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said in his previous start against the Devil Rays, he
had ``great stuff'' and he continues to try and build on that. The
key for him is to incorporate some new strategy into his approach
against hitters, something he's had to do because his control
hasn't been what he wanted and possibly because the strike zone
hasn't been as forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm throwing some pitches when in the back of my mind I'm
wondering if that's the right pitch for the situation,'' Glavine
said. ``There's still some uncertainly because I'm trying to change
my pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   For Glavine, that means pitching inside more and mixing in more
breaking balls, instead of using predominantly his sinking
fastballs and change-ups away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at my best, my change-up is always a good pitch,''
Glavine said. ``I'm trying to get out of that pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Even still, Glavine's not going to get too torn up about his
record at the moment, especially when he pitches tonight in the
Astrodome, site of Astros manager Larry Dierker's collapse on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot worse things in life than being 3-7,''
Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz absent
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz did not travel to Houston with the Braves for their
four-game series here. Manager Bobby Cox said he had given Smoltz
permission to stay home for a family engagement and wasn't sure
when he would rejoin the team. Smoltz did not return messages at
his Duluth, Ga. home Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Smoltz made his third start since coming off the
disabled list for an inflamed elbow, the one that's given him
problems for much of his career. Smoltz gave up a season-high seven
runs in his shortest outing of the season _ 2 1/3 innings _ against
the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Television shots of Smoltz showed him wincing in pain while
warming up Sunday night, though Smoltz said afterward his elbow was
not a factor. Cox and Glavine reiterated that on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I looked up it was a 94 mph fastball,'' said
Glavine, who said Smoltz didn't mention anything to him about his
elbow. ``I think it was one of those nights when he made a good
pitch and gave up a blooper, made a bad pitch and got
</P>
<P>
   hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasting loss
</P>
<P>
   After getting swept by the Orioles over the weekend, scoring
only three runs in the three losses of 6-2, 5-0 and 22-1, the
Braves admitted feeling a bit jolted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss is a loss, but a butt-kicking is a butt-kicking,'' said
cleanup hitter Brian Jordan, who was 2-for-10 in the series with no
RBIs. ``A shellacking is a shellacking. It was almost one of those
games where you feel hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said it was tough to work back from big first-inning
deficits like 4-0 Saturday and 5-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that they say `What goes around comes around?' '' said
Jordan, referring to the Braves 20-5 victory against the Rockies in
Colorado on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan scored the only run on Sunday night when he scored from
third on a short fly ball by Ryan Klesko. TV replays showed
third-base coach Ned Yost throwing up a stop sign, but Jordan said
he didn't see the sign, he only heard Yost say ``ho, ho'' and he
thought he said ``go.'' Jordan stuck by his aggressive play in that
situation and said Yost agreed.

 &HT;    Pitching dooms Braves again
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This Braves team is having a hard time finding ways to
pick itself up and pull itself together and the Astros weren't
about to make it any easier on Atlanta Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, the team with the National League's best record at
38-23, continued the trend by beating the Braves 10-4 in the first
game of a four-game series at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a three-double night from Craig Biggio and three
consecutive run-scoring hits off Kevin McGlinchy in the sixth
inning, the Astros extended their winning streak to four games and
prolonged Atlanta's losing streak to four in a row after a weekend
sweep by the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The emotionally-drained Astros were the ones who picked
themselves up Monday night. In the previous 24 hours they had seen
their manager, Larry Dierker, collapse in a seizure in their dugout
and learned he would have to undergo brain surgery today for a
treatable blood vessel condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves nipped at the Astros' heels by cutting their leads to
2-1, 3-2, and 4-3 but never found enough of an offensive push to
make a difference, stranding runners at third base twice, before
Houston pulled away late. Atlanta's pitching held out for five
innings, before the bottom fell out in the sixth when the Astros
batting around.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four starts, Braves rookie pitcher Odalis
Perez pitched poorly. He walked a season-high seven batters, ran
counts full on a regular basis, and bore the headache of at least
two baserunners in each of the six innings he pitched. Through the
first five innings, he'd thrown almost twice the pitches Houston
left-hander Mike Hampton had, 111-58.

NIGERIAN PLAYER A POSSIBLE MEDIA DARLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup tournament, which
begins this weekend, could make a media darling of Nigeria's
``Marvelous'' Mercy Akide before it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Her team, with players who wear basketball-style, knee-length
shorts and a goalkeeper with Dennis Rodman-like blonde hair, will
get its fair share of attention, too.
</P>
<P>
   Akide, the leader of the Super Falcons, speaks softly and has a
glowing smile. Her words convey confidence in a team ready to shock
the soccer world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come here for a vacation,'' said Akide, when asked
if she's enjoyed her stay in Los Angeles. ``We went to Hollywood
and enjoyed some of your French fries, but our mission isn't to
look around the city. Our mission is to make our country proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians failed to get a victory in the previous two
Women's World Cup tournaments, in 1991 and '95, but stormed through
the African women's soccer championships to qualify for this World
Cup, outscoring opponents, 25-0.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the same group as the United States, but first will
face North Korea on Sunday at the Rose Bowl. It's the second game
of a doubleheader that pits Germany against Italy in the first
game.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Nigerians rarely face competition outside of Africa,
few soccer experts have given them much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But as China, one of the pre-tournament favorites, found out
during a 4-3 scrimmage loss to the Super Falcons at West L.A.
College over the weekend, they're dangerous and extremely
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone during the FIFA world all-star game in
February that we are going to surprise the world,'' Akide said. ``I
told the media we are not afraid of anything, not the United
States, not anyone. They are all just girls like us. We have the
experience of the past two World Cups and, with God on our side,
we'll do something special in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will get its shot at the United States on June 24 in
Chicago, and Akide has an interesting way of describing the
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid of them,'' she said. ``Like I've been saying,
they're just ladies like us. That will be an exciting game because
the U.S. has great players. But it will be our chance to show the
world how good we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Akide has enjoyed her celebrity status in Nigeria. She led the
Falcons with 10 goals during WWC qualifying and, because of her
5-foot-11 stature, she's easy to spot on the field and on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk around, they call me Miss Marvelous,'' said Akide
proudly. ``I walk the streets and they give me gifts along the way.
I feel like a queen; it's a wonderful feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the WWC qualifying tournament, Akide was relatively
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the competition, I fasted for a week, praying all the
time,'' she said. ``I asked God to make me popular in the country.
I wanted to be a heroine, to prove wrong those who didn't believe
in me. I am glad that God answered my prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the huge attention the Nigerian team has received back
home, many of the players believe they're on a mission from God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sing prayers before and after the game because God owns
this team,'' Akide said. ``Whatever we do, we put God first before
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience Avre, who scored three goals in the scrimmage against
China, said God is their secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is watching over us,'' she said. ``We sing to Him, we pray
to Him and if He wants us to win, we will do it for Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian coach Ismaila Mabo said the team sings for other
reasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The singing makes them forget any troubles and focus on what
they're going to accomplish,'' Mabo said. ``They also sing in order
to psyche themselves and get ready for the game. And they sing
about conquering their opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a strong Nigerian following in Los Angeles.
Roughly 200 supporters appeared for the scrimmage against China.
They cheered throughout the match, hugging each other after every
Nigerian goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is a wonderful medicine for the people,'' Mabo said.
``We have tremendous support back home. And to see the people in
L.A. come out really does a lot for this team. We play with passion
that God and our people give us. Because of that support, we have
that extra effort to win.''

EDITORIAL: GANGS, GAMBLING AND THE SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court does not lightly overturn federal and state
laws enacted with a worthwhile social purpose in mind. But in two
of its latest rulings, the court quite correctly struck down a
Chicago ordinance intended to combat gang activity and a federal
law aimed at curbing the problems associated with legal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-to-3 ruling last week in the Chicago case recognized the
terrible impact gang activity can have on neighborhoods. But,
following a line of cases going back decades, the majority decision
_ written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices
Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy _ also recognized the inherent danger
to basic freedoms when police are given too much discretion to
target innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   The vaguely worded statute made it a crime to ``remain in any
one place with no apparent purpose'' in the presence of a suspected
gang member when ordered by a police officer to move on. Before
lower courts put the law on hold in 1995, the Chicago police
arrested more than 42,000 people, most of them young
African-American and Latino men often guilty of nothing more than
standing outside with their friends and not dispersing as ordered.
At a moment when the problem of racial profiling by police is
coming under heightened scrutiny, the court's concern about vague
statutory language providing a cover for arbitrary police behavior
was especially welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's unanimous ruling against the federal ban on broadcast
advertising by gambling casinos turned on free-speech principles.
At issue was a federal law that outlawed such advertising even in
states, like Louisiana, where casino gambling is legal. The Justice
Department had defended the ban, emphasizing the problem of
compulsive gambling and gambling's link to organized crime. The
court, again with Stevens writing, did not quarrel with the
government's aim of discouraging gambling, but noted that the
regulatory scheme was riddled with exceptions _ permitting ads for
state lotteries and casinos run by Indian tribes, for example,
notwithstanding the potential social costs. That has left the
airwaves saturated with lottery and other gambling advertising,
making it impossible for the government to show that its
interference with commercial speech was tailored to advance the
stated governmental interest.

   NEW YORK _ A jury has ordered the New York City Health and
Hospitals Corp. to pay $76.4 million to a 12-year-old girl who
suffered brain damage and other permanent injuries during her birth
in what her lawyer called a botched delivery.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the largest medical malpractice verdicts recorded
against the corporation, which runs the city's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The award, returned last Friday by a jury in Manhattan, was made
to Gaelle Prindilus, who was born on Jan. 16, 1987. Her lawyer,
Thomas A. Moore, said Monday that she was born with her umbilical
cord wrapped around her neck and with no medical personnel in the
hospital room to attend her mother, Yverose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the infant was already severely compromised for 17
hours, and was strangled by her own umbilical cord and was not
breathing, every second was crucial,'' he said. ``Yet there was no
one on hand to administer immediate resuscitation and live-saving
measures. This was a classic example of the indifferent and
horrendous care that the city's HHC has been chastised for.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Borenstein, the chief counsel to the hospitals
corporation, denied that there had been anything improper in the
delivery and insisted that the care at Harlem Hospital Center had
been ``excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city would move to have the verdict set aside as
``grossly excessive'' and, failing that, would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gaelle's mother, Yverose Prindilus, is a housewife and her
father, Sensois Prindilus, has worked as a kitchen helper and a
janitor to pay for her medical care. Gaelle suffers from cerebral
palsy, requires a wheelchair and round-the-clock care and cannot
read or write. The family _ there are five other children _ lives
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the verdict included $35 million for future medical
care and loss of earning capacity, $5 million for past suffering,
and $36.4 million for future suffering. He said the city had
refused a settlement offer of $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Previous medical malpractice awards against the city include
$112 million awarded by a Queens jury last year in an obstetrics
case that was later reduced in a settlement to $4.5 million. Also
last year, a Manhattan jury awarded $49 million in another
obstetrics case, and a Bronx jury in 1995 ordered the hospitals
corporation to pay $42 million to the mother of a girl injured at
birth.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 15:
</P>
<P>
   As college graduation season draws to a close, it is evident
that the gap between the experiences and expectations of the
graduating class and their commencement speakers has never been
greater. The speakers for the most part grew up in a world of
economic highs and lows. They, or their parents, lived through the
Great Depression, or at least a series of recessions, and learned
to write on a typewriter. Today's graduates have not seen a
recession since they were in junior high school and may never have
touched a typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Who could better capture the economic moment, past and present,
than Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board? He
addressed the Harvard commencement last week, telling students
there, and by extension across the country, that they would shape
the future state of the world's ``cultural, legal and economic
institutions.'' It seemed fitting that one of the architects of the
longest period of peacetime prosperity in American history would
address men and women entering the working world at a time of
unimaginable opportunities as well as unparalleled challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming. The labor market is the tightest it has
been in 30 years and is unusually strong in all sectors. The
unemployment rate for college graduates, ages 20 to 24, registered
just 4.2 percent in May. The explosive growth of the computer
industry has made the entry-level job market especially exciting
and lucrative for this and recent graduating classes. The
information-technology industry beckons the young. Growing up with
computers and the Internet, they are well equipped to take
advantage of the entrepreneurial possibilities such technology
offers. Career-services offices at colleges report that increasing
numbers of students are starting their own companies or joining
newly created firms. Many believe they have nothing to lose and may
soon join the expanding roster of young millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial programs at colleges across the country are
expanding. Columbia University, for example, has more than doubled
such course offerings for undergraduates in the last several years.
The Columbia Business School administers an entrepreneurial
initiative fund, which invests in the companies of budding
businessmen, allowing them to get on their feet with minimal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in the information and technology sector, such as systems
analysts, computer engineers and database administrators, are
projected to more than double by 2006, and opportunities through
the Internet seem limitless. The confidence and optimism are
admirable, but the Class of '99 should not naively expect that the
current economic expansion will be endless.

TWO TEAMS HAVE LOGISTIC PROBLEMS

   LOS ANGELES _ Since FIFA Women's World Cup officials aren't
officially in charge until Wednesday -- the four countries (Italy,
Germany, North Korea and Nigeria) participating in Sunday's opening
doubleheader at the Rose Bowl are expected to make their own
arrangements for training.
</P>
<P>
   Well, North Korea was the first to experience bad luck, missing
their scheduled training at Pomona Pitzer College because the van
that was supposed to pick them up at their Arcadia hotel never
showed up. According to German players who are staying at the same
hotel, the Korean's waited for at least an hour before calling it
an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Germans were late to Monday's training at Pomona, as
their van was a half hour late because of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were late because of an accident or something,''
said German coach Tina Theune-Meyer. ``But it's OK, today was a
light day.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of Germany's players were given the day off because
they played in the German club championships on Saturday. They
spent the day at Santa Monica beach.
</P>
<P>
   ___German defender Steffi Jones, the daughter of an American
serviceman, said the toughest adjustment is getting use to the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temperature here is much higher than in Germany,'' she
said. ``I'm glad we're training near the end of the day because the
weather is tough on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans will visit Universal Studio's this morning before
resuming training at Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   ___Those who would like to see the Nigerian national team can
attend a free scrimmage at West L.A. College today at 3 p.m. The
Nigerians are facing a Torrance Club team.

KENNETH S. DAVIS, 86, FDR BIOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Sidney Davis, the author of a four-volume biography of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, died on Thursday at University Hospital
in Madison, Wis. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did not belong to the fraternity of trained historians.
Yet, like Shelby Foote, another nonacademic chronicler of the past,
Davis had a respect for detail and an understanding of the sweep
and the interlocking significance of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a real grasp of the historical craft,'' said Alan
Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University. The
Roosevelt work is ``a wonderful narrative biography and probably
the most thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   The volumes of Davis' ``FDR'' biography _ ``The Beckoning of
Destiny, 1882-1928,'' ``The New York Years, 1928-1933,'' ``The New
Deal Years 1933-1937'' and ``Into the Storm, 1937-1940'' _ were a
lifetime project, representing more than 30 years of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis traced Roosevelt's transformation from a Hudson Valley
aristocrat with an instinctive conservatism to the architect of the
New Deal. He argued that it was Roosevelt's exposure to the liberal
traditions of New York state politics, including child welfare
reform and trade unionism, that made possible his radical
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But in writing about Roosevelt, Davis did not fall prey to the
biographer's occupational hazard of being awed by his subject. He
was unstinting in his assessment of Roosevelt's character, seeing
him as at once charming and aloof, superficial and profound,
idealistic and opportunistic, even at times capable of ``a thin,
steely edged cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis criticized Roosevelt for his refusal to support
antilynching legislation in Congress and for not coming to the aid
of the Jews in World War II. He found fault with his attempt to
pack the Supreme Court, his ``isolationist sentiments'' during the
1930s, and particularly his failure to take early action against
Japanese aggression in China.
</P>
<P>
   `` Davis' picture of a cautious, ineffective leader is
overdrawn,'' Robert Dallek wrote in 1993 in a New York Times review
of ``Into the Storm.'' Nonetheless, he added, the work, ``despite
its many questionable judgments, will take its place in the
Roosevelt literature as a standard against which other, more
sympathetic historians will have to argue.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Roosevelt biography, Davis was the author,
co-author or editor of some 20 books, including biographies of
Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles A. Lindbergh and Adlai E. Stevenson.
In his early life, however, Davis seemed destined for a career in
agriculture rather than history. Born in Salina, Kan., where his
father was a college professor, Davis was educated at the Kansas
State University of Agriculture and Applied Science (now Kansas
State University). He received a master's degree in science at the
University of Wisconsin. After working briefly as a reporter at The
Topeka Daily Capital in Kansas, he became an information specialist
at the Soil Conservation Service in the Midwest, where he worked
until 1942.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Davis was a war correspondent for Doubleday
&AMP; Co., attached to the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied
Expeditionary Forces in London and Normandy. After the war, he
became a public relations assistant to Milton Eisenhower, the
younger brother of Dwight D. Eisenhower, at the U.S. Commission for
UNESCO. In 1955, he was a speechwriter for Stevenson. When asked to
name his favorite among his three biographical subjects, Lindbergh,
Roosevelt or Stevenson, Davis answered: ``Adlai Stevenson. He would
have made a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' first wife, Marie Olenhouse, died in 1988. Two years
later, he married Jean Dormer. He is also survived by a sister,
Ella Rae Friel of Sacramento, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Jane
Mitchell of Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis began writing his Roosevelt biography he was
determined, he said, to make it only one volume. Instead, he said,
``my first volume grew and grew.'' In December, he finished a fifth
volume, ``The War President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was finished,'' his wife said on Monday. ``We left
for Arizona. And there the cancer was diagnosed.'' Robert Loomis,
Davis' editor at Random House, said he did not know when the last
volume would be published.

HENRY GRUNFELD, 95, CO-FOUNDER OF S.G. WARBURG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Grunfeld, a refugee from Nazi Germany who helped his
fellow expatriate Siegmund G. Warburg build an investment banking
empire that transformed the British financial world after World War
II, died Thursday. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld was a senior adviser to Warburg Dillon Read, the
successor firm to S.G. Warburg. Until the day before his death, he
reported daily for work at the firm's headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Financial Times shortly after his 90th birthday that
he continued working ``because I enjoy it _ because it's healthy
and because I can make a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld's presence provided rare continuity to a firm that has
seen its ownership change markedly, as investment banking has grown
from a world of smaller, specialized firms into a business of
global giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all benefited from his commitment to continue working with
us,'' said Marcel Ospel, chief executive of UBS AG, the Swiss bank
that is now the parent company of Warburg Dillon Read. ``He will be
very much missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their long association, which began in London in 1935
and ended with Sir Siegmund's death in 1982, Grunfeld left the
public stage and newspaper headlines to his more flamboyant and
mercurial partner. But his steady skepticism and painstaking
intellect were crucial to the success of the firm, historians and
banking veterans agree.
</P>
<P>
   The firm carried the Warburg name ``but `Warburg, Grunfeld &AMP;
Co.' would have been the more accurate style,'' said Sir David
Scholey, a former chairman of the firm, in an essay published in
The Financial Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The author Ron Chernow, who chronicled the history of the
Warburg family, said that Grunfeld brought a wariness from his
refugee experience that his sometimes credulous partner lacked.
Moreover, Grunfeld, a lawyer by training, was a superb technician
whose mastery of financial details gave reality to his partner's
brilliant if sometimes vague dreams.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, it is a truism that a successful firm needs both
convivial salesmanship and backstage expertise. And from the first,
S.G. Warburg ``followed the classic pattern _ a brilliant,
visionary and socially active `Mr. Outside' and a very intense and
hard-working, introverted `Mr. Inside,' '' Chernow said Monday.
``Henry Grunfeld was the consummate Mr. Inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of this marriage of quiet skill and volatile energy
were ``really nothing short of miraculous,'' Chernow continued.
``In a world that was anti-German, anti-Semitic and hostile to the
sort of innovation that these men represented _ and despite their
status as outsiders, as German Jewish refugees _ they were able in
a single generation to build a firm that became one of the most
powerful financial houses in London.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, the Warburg firm initiated the first hostile takeover
in British-American finance, the acquisition of British Aluminium
by a trans-Atlantic joint venture led by the American company
Reynolds Metals. Such fights would become a regular feature of the
American market, but the British establishment was shocked and
shaken by the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Although British Aluminium enlisted the persuasive powers of the
Bank of England in its defense, in January 1959 the Warburg forces
won ``the aluminum war.'' According to Chernow's account, Grunfeld
once explained the firm's success by saying, ``We just didn't make
any mistakes, and the other side did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, the firm capitalized on the United States'
restrictive tax policies by helping to create the euro market,
where dollar-denominated bonds could be traded outside the U.S.
market. That innovation gave London a much-needed lift in its
financial competition with New York and established a thriving
global marketplace that remains an important feature of modern
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Grunfeld was born in 1904 in Breslau, Germany _ now the
Polish city of Wroclaw _ where his family had substantial steel and
chemical interests. He set out to study law, but devoted himself
instead to rescuing the family business from the punishing
hyperinflation that engulfed Germany after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   His success made his early reputation in Germany's steel
industry, but could not protect him and his Jewish family from Nazi
hostility. In 1934, the Grunfeld fortune was seized by the
government, and Grunfeld was briefly detained by the Gestapo in
Berlin. He won his release by citing his status as an honorary
Spanish consul, and promptly went into hiding to prepare his
escape.
</P>
<P>
   The next year in Britain, he learned that another German exile,
Siegmund Warburg of the well-established banking family in Hamburg,
was in London seeking someone with industrial experience to help
him form a new financial firm. The two men met and became partners
in New Trading Co., which in 1946 changed its name to S.G. Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld became chairman of the firm when Sir Siegmund retired
in 1964. In 1974, he retired from the chairmanship but held the
office of president until 1995, when the company was acquired by
UBS. He then became a senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld married Berta Lotte Oliven in 1931, and was the father
of two children. His daughter died in 1986; he is survived by a
son.
