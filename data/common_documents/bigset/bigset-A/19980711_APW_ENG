Salmon fishermen may face partial ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government may ban anglers and netters from
catching wild salmon at the beginning of each season as part of a
response to dwindling stocks, which have fallen to a record low,
environment officials say.
	   Britain's Environment Agency said Friday it was the first time
it had considered such far-reaching restrictions, but believed the
measures could reverse the decline in Britain's rivers.
	   Officials are currently discussing their plans with fishing and
environmental groups before they make their recommendation to the
government. The ban could be introduced during next year's fishing
season, which starts in the spring and runs until
	   Last month, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Association
disclosed that salmon stocks throughout southern European waters
had declined.
	   The reason for the dwindling salmon stocks is disputed, but it
officials say it could be due to temperature changes in the north
Atlantic. Other factors could include pollution of rural rivers,
changes in water flow through the rivers, and over-fishing.
	   ``Our monitoring of salmon stocks up to the end of May suggests
that 1998 will be another poor year for spring salmon in most
rivers,'' said David Clarke, head of the fisheries division at the
Environment Agency.
	   ``Whilst we cannot change temperature patterns in the north
Atlantic, it is essential that we act to protect stocks where we
can and this consultation is the first step towards introducing
national restrictions on catch,'' he said.

Second man hangs self over World Cup bet

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A sugar mill owner hanged himself after
losing his business on a World Cup bet, a newspaper reported
Saturday. It was the second suicide in Vietnam over a wager on the
soccer tournament
	   The man, who was not identified, staked his mill on Germany
beating Croatia in the quarterfinal, but the Croats scored a 3-0
upset, the Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper said.
	   It was not clear how big the sugar mill was. Efforts to contact
local officials by telephone Saturday were unsuccessful.
	   A 24-year-old man earlier hanged himself after losing his
motorcycle on the Germany-Yugoslavia match. There also has been at
least one other attempted suicide over the World Cup in Vietnam.
	   Soccer-crazy Vietnam has been mesmerized by the World Cup, even
though the country never has qualified for the sport's biggest
event.
	   Matches are being shown live on state television, and streets
are virtually deserted when they are aired. With the semifinals and
finals being aired at 2 a.m., many workers have been showing up
bleary-eyed at the office.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Politicians took to the streets in a final day of
campaigning Saturday for a set of nationwide elections dominated by
concerns over how to pull this country out of its worst recession
in decades.
	   At stake in the elections Sunday are half of the 252 seats in
Parliament's upper house.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is in no danger of losing its hold on power because it enjoys
a strong majority in Parliament's more influential lower house.
	   But concerns over Japan's deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings plunging to record lows over the past
several weeks, and experts say a poor showing could be enough to
force a leadership change.
	   ``This election is effectively about confidence in the Hashimoto
administration,'' the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said in a
front-page story Saturday.
	   Analysts had until recently predicted that voter apathy and an
ineffectual opposition would allow the LDP to regain control of the
upper chamber for the first time since 1989.
	   Turnout for Sunday's election is expected to be among the lowest
ever, possibly falling below 50 percent of all registered voters.
	   But recent polls have indicated the LDP may be facing a tougher
battle than expected, forcing the party to revise downward its
earlier predictions of significant gains.
	   Now, the party _ which represents conservative interests and
business _ says it is aiming to gain the 61 seats that would allow
it to break even.
	   If that happens, the ruling party would again have to seek
outside partners to pass legislation. It had previously worked with
two much smaller parties _ the Socialists and another liberal group
_ in a rather precarious coalition.
	   Sunday's elections are the first upper house elections since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996. As a member of the more
powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself does not stand for
reelection.
	   Even so, his nervousness ahead of the election has frequently
come to the fore.
	   On the campaign trail he wobbled several times on his policy
toward slashing taxes. Permanent tax cuts are seen by many
economists as a potentially potent stimulus to boost the economy.
	   Hashimoto at one point last week said he supported ``permanent
tax reforms'' and then seemed to backtrack two days later by saying
the reforms wouldn't reduce the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   On Wednesday, Hashimoto finally came out in favor of income tax
cuts, though he stopped short of saying how big they'd be.
	   Senior LDP officials now say they are considering a 4 trillion
yen (dlrs 28.4 billion) cut.
	   Sunday's vote will also mark the national debut of a recently
formed opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party is the second largest in Parliament, with
38 seats in the upper house, but political watchers remain divided
over how well it will do with the voters because of its vague
stance on major issues.
	   Hashimoto's biggest challenge may well come from within the
Liberal Democratic party itself.
	   His flip-flops have strengthened calls within the party for him
to step down if it does not fare well Sunday, and party veterans
such as Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi are reportedly jockeying to
replace him.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto may have to resign if
his party wins less than 61 seats _ and that may be difficult.
	   The Nihon Keizai, Japan's largest business daily, released a
poll on Tuesday of 37,600 voters showing the party will win only 60
seats.
	   As with most Japanese polls, the Nihon Keizai didn't give a
margin of error.

Overall retail sales up slightly, but per-capita figure down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Retail sales in Vietnam jumped 1.6 percent
in the first six months of 1998 compared with the same period last
year, the Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper reported Saturday.
	   But per-capita sales actually fell when population growth was
taken into account, the newspaper said, citing General Statistics
Office figures.
	   Thanh Nien said purchasing power remains weak and the activities
of state-owned enterprises in commercial services are inefficient.
	   Total retail sales of commodities and services for the first
half totaled 80.85 trillion dong (dlrs 6.22 billion), the newspaper
said. The consumer price index rose 8.7 percent from a year ago.
	   State-owned enterprises fetched 16.8 trillion dong (dlrs 1.3
billion) in retail sales, down 5.5 percent from the same period
last year.
	   The non-state sector grew by 12.2 percent to 63.07 trillion dong
(dlrs 4.9 billion), accounting for 78 percent of the total, up from
76 percent last year.
	   About 25,000 enterprises are operating in Vietnam, of which
nearly 6,000 are owned by the state. Prime minister Phan Van Khai
recently said about a third of the state-owned enterprises are
losing money.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents plan to talk their way out of a confrontation, which has
sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward compromise.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic resident of
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to try to
find a durable solution to a march that has sparked violence for a
third summer.
	   The violent potential of Northern Ireland's ancient sectarian
hatreds has been evident in the disorders that erupted across the
province after Orange marchers were stopped Sunday by police and
soldiers.
	   In London and Ireland, police arrested 10 people and said they
had foiled plans by Irish Republican Army dissidents to attack
targets in the British capital.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in Britain and Ireland were detaining 10
people Saturday after thwarting an imminent bomb attack on the
British capital by IRA splinter groups opposed to the peace
agreement in Northern Ireland.
	   London came ``within minutes'' of a terrorist attack, said
Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's
Yard's anti-terrorist branch. He refused to give details about
possible targets or the number of devices discovered. Police in
London made their first arrests shortly before the evening
rush-hour Friday.
	   Police have warned that factions opposed to cease-fires called
by Northern Ireland's major paramilitary groups, including the
Irish Republican Army, continue to threaten the April peace
agreement. The IRA was founded in 1969 to abolish Northern Ireland
as a British province and unite it with the Republic of Ireland to
the south.
	   Six arrests in London on Friday followed four arrests earlier in
the day by police in the Irish cities of Dublin, Wexford and
Dundalk, authorities said.
	   The Irish police operation, which had been under way for months,
targeted hard-line organizations determined to foil the peace
accord. Information uncovered during the arrests in Ireland
prompted Irish police to contact their London counterparts and led
to the arrests by anti-terrorist officers here.
	   Three men who were arrested near university buildings in London
had explosives they were just minutes from using, Grieve said.
	   Officers later arrested a woman near Oxford Street, one of the
capital's busiest shopping districts, and a man and a woman near
the new, multimillion-pound (dollar) British Library near the
King's Cross railway station, Scotland Yard said.
	   No shots were fired, and no one was injured during the
operation.
	   Witnesses to Friday's arrests south of the River Thames said
police with guns swooped into the area and arrested two men within
yards (meters) of each other outside a supermarket.
	   ``I saw them yell at a studenty-looking man, who was carrying a
rucksack, `Put the bag on the floor!' When he did that, they
shouted `Get down on the floor! Get down on the floor!''' said
Ann-Marie Wholey, 14. ``I stayed watching for what seemed like a
few minutes. I just couldn't move. Then one of the men with a gun
turned round and said `Get down the street, just move, move.'''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, congratulated the authorities Friday after the
arrests. Ahern said his government ``will continue to underpin the
peace process by tackling the terrorist threat from whatever
source.''
	   IRA dissidents have rejected the peace agreement, even though
the IRA called a truce in July 1997 and its allied Sinn Fein party
was one of eight political parties that joined in negotiations with
the British and Irish governments to forge the accord.
	   The agreement, ratified by voters in May, set up a new
provincial assembly with power to be shared between Protestants and
Roman Catholics.
	   IRA dissidents have said they will settle for nothing short of a
union between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   They have attacked mainly in Northern Ireland, although Irish
police in April intercepted a car packed with explosives just
before it was to board a ferry to Britain.
	   Before it agreed to a truce, the IRA had often struck in London
_ sometimes with small explosives or incendiary devices and
occasionally with larger, more devastating bombs.
	   The group set off bombs at Hyde Park in 1982, Harrods department
store in 1983 and the London Stock Exchange in 1990. In 1991, a
mortar shell fired from an abandoned van exploded 50 feet (15
meters) behind 10 Downing St., the prime minister's official
residence.
	   The IRA called a truce in 1994 but broke it in February 1996
with a bomb in London's Docklands business area. The blast killed
two men and wounded scores of people. The IRA blamed British delays
over peace talks for its reversion to violence.
	   The group resumed a cease-fire in July 1997 and has maintained
it since.

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief has warned that
Washington's failure to pay back dues and the resulting loss of its
General Assembly vote would shock Americans and make relations with
the world body even more acrimonious.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has lobbied U.S. politicians,
businessmen and celebrities to get the United States to pay its
dues, said Friday that he has scaled back his contacts with
Washington so that his efforts would not backfire.
	   ``They know the rules, they know how much is required of them,
they know how much they have to pay in order not to lose their
vote,'' he said.
	   However, such a move would not affect the American vote or veto
power on the U.N. Security Council, where most of the key issues
facing the world body are decided.
	   Last year, the Senate approved a bill to pay most of the U.S.
debt, which the United Nations estimates at about dlrs 1.3 billion.
	   But House conservatives tacked on anti-abortion language that
U.S. President Bill Clinton refused to accept. This year, Clinton
threatened to veto a similar measure.
	   U.N. diplomats say the failure to resolve the debt issue has
encumbered American efforts to build support for U.S. foreign
policy within the United Nations.
	   Washington could lose its vote in the General Assembly if it
doesn't pay between dlrs 211 million and dlrs 241 million by Dec.
31, according to a June report by the U.S. Congress watchdog arm,
the General Accounting Office.
	   ``I'm sure ... many Americans and ordinary citizens will be
shocked that the U.S. finds itself in that situation,'' Annan said.
	   While Congress has held up payments of U.N. debts for years to
demand reduction in U.S. payments and streamlining in the world
organization, Annan has courted American financial, entertainment
and other industries to press the U.N.'s case.
	   Annan said his last discussion with Clinton on the matter was
during the June 8-11 U.N. drug conference, and said he had no
indication that Clinton would change his mind about vetoing the
latest bill from Congress.
	   ``I think the president's position on a bill with an amendment
with the unrelated domestic issue amendment attached to it is very
clear,'' Annan said. ``And he did not given me any indication that
he has shifted from that position.''

Chinese police detain at least six dissidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained at least six Chinese democracy
campaigners in a crackdown exiled dissidents said proves U.S.
President Bill Clinton left China without securing progress on
human rights.
	   The six, veterans of past democracy movements, have tried to set
up a political party to challenge the Communist Party's monopoly on
power. Their push coincided with Clinton's China trip and his less
confrontational appeals to Chinese leaders to improve human rights.
	   Police began the wave of detentions Friday morning, taking Wu
Gaoxing from his home in eastern Zhejiang province's Taizhou city,
dissident groups in Hong Kong and the United States said.
	   Around 8 p.m. Friday, 250 kilometers (150 miles) to the
northwest in Hangzhou city, police swarmed over the home of Wang
Youcai and led away Wang, Wang Peijian and Cheng Fan, the groups
said.
	   The U.S.-based Chinese Democratic Justice Party said Wang
Youcai's wife reported that police detained two other people
visiting her husband but whom she didn't recognize.
	   In separate raids on their Hangzhou homes, police took away Zhu
Yufu and Wang Donghai, the Chinese Democratic Justice Party said.
	   Police confiscated notebooks, tapes, at least one computer and
manifestos and literature for the China Democracy Party, according
to the U.S.-based dissidents and the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Wang Youcai, Wang Peijian and one other dissident announced June
25, the start of Clinton's nine-day China tour, that they wanted to
set up the China Democracy Party and would register the group with
authorities as required by law.
	   Since then Wang Youcai, Zhu Yufu and another dissident were each
detained at least once before Friday's clampdown. They were
released with warnings to stop campaigning for the party and
authorities have refused to register the group.
	   In reporting the detentions, the exiled groups criticized
Clinton's China policy as a failure. Clinton used his trip to try
to showcase a more modern, tolerant China to a skeptical American
public while cajoling Chinese leaders to allow more dissent.
	   ``This is equivalent to giving Clinton a box on the ears,'' the
Information Center said in a statement. It added that the
detentions ``prove Clinton returned home from his China tour
empty-handed.''
	   ``What we said about President Clinton's policy of constructive
engagement with China was accurate, that the Chinese government
will not work with the free world to improve human rights because
they are a brutal communist dictatorship,'' said Lian Shengde, a
student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in
1989 and now the head of the Washington-based Free China Movement.
	   Like Lian, most of the detained dissidents took part in the 1989
protest movement. Wang Youcai, Wang Peijian and Cheng Fan were
students in Beijing. Wang Donghai and Wu Gaoxing staged sympathy
protests in Hangzhou.
	   Wang Youcai spent four years in prison and Wang Donghai and Wu
Gaoxing three years in the nationwide crackdown that followed the
military's brutal quelling of the protests in Beijing.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents plan to talk their way out of a confrontation, which has
sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward compromise.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic resident of
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to try to
find a durable solution to a march that has sparked violence for a
third summer.
	   The violent potential of Northern Ireland's ancient sectarian
hatreds has been evident in the disorders that erupted across the
province after Orange marchers were stopped Sunday by police and
soldiers.
	   In London and Ireland, police arrested 10 people and said they
had foiled plans by Irish Republican Army dissidents to attack
targets in the British capital.
	   Police fired plastic bullets Friday night at Protestant
hard-liners who again tried to break through barricades around the
Drumcree Anglican church, where the Orange march was stopped
Sunday. However, the crowd on a cool and rainy night Friday was
substantially smaller than the estimated 20,000-plus of the night
before.
	   Police later reported that the crowd had used a grappling hook
attached to a car to try to pull away the barbed wire on the
barricade. The attempt failed, but a spokesman said the
4,000-strong crowd forced the lines of defence to be reinforced, as
officers took cover behind armored vehicles.
	   A blast bomb was also thrown at police lines and protesters
fired shots at police. No officers were hurt.
	   Later, three people were injured in a shooting incident in north
Belfast and one man was seriously hurt after being shot in the
knee.
	   Roads in the south of the city were closed after bomb disposal
experts were called to inspect a suspicious device discovered near
a car showroom.

Norwood retains WBA featherweight title against Mendoza
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Freddie Norwood successfully defended his WBA
featherweight title with a convincing unanimous decision over
Colombia's Luis Mendoza Friday night.
	   Making his second title defense in less than a month, Norwood
went at Mendoza with left and right combinations to the head and
body throughout the 12-round bout at Miccosukee Indian Gaming.
	   Norwood, of St. Louis, nearly knocked out Mendoza in the final
seconds of the fight when he caught the challenger with a flurry of
head and body shots along the ropes and then sent him to the canvas
with a straight left to the head.
	   Mendoza, a former WBA junior featherweight champion, beat the
10-count, but his fate was sealed.
	   Judge Mark Streisand scored the bout 117-108, Luis Rodriguez had
Norwood winning 118-108, and Hubert Earle scored it 117-109.
	   Norwood (31-0-1) was disappointed the bout went the distance.
	   ``This was my worst performance, I have to give myself a D,''
Norwood said. ``When I had a chance to put him away, I didn't.
	   ``But the key to being a champion is to win the fight even on an
off night,'' he said.
	   Mendoza did counter some of Norwood's flurries. In the fifth,
Mendoza (37-7-2) briefly staggered Norwood with a short right to
the head.
	   But that was his best shot.
	   The fight's other knockdown was in the second, when Norwood
floored Mendoza with a right to the side of the head. As Mendoza
went down, Norwood caught him with another left to the head,
prompting referee Brian Garry to deduct a point from Norwood for a
late hit.
	   Norwood, who stopped Genaro Rios in eight rounds in his first
defense on June 13, weighed 125 pounds (56.70 kilos) for Friday's
bout. Mendoza weighed 126 (57.15 kilos).
	   In another bout, former three-time world junior welterweight
champion Frankie Randall stopped Danny Sanchez of Homestead,
Florida, in five rounds.

Volcanologist warns villagers to prepare for possible evacuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Authorities have ordered 6,000
villagers living on the slopes of Indonesia's biggest volcano to
prepare for possible evacuation after lava and hot gases poured out
of its top, a news report said Saturday.
	   Official Antara news agency quoted a volcanologist as saying an
old and previously solid lava dome on the peak had cracked and new
hot lava was beginning to flow.
	   There was no immediate danger to seven villages on the lower
slopes of Mount Merapi, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   However, volcanologist Atje Purbawinata said local government
authorities should get ready for the possibility of evacuation.
	   ``Currently the situation is under control, but we continue to
pay close attention to the volcano's behavior every hour,'' Antara
quoted Purbawinata as saying.
	   In 1994, a steam cloud flattened a village on Merapi's slopes,
killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning others.
	   The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain is the most active of 500
Indonesia volcanoes.
	   In its most destructive eruption this century, Merapi killed
1,300 people in 1930.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 37th home run, tying Mark
McGwire for the major-league lead by connecting Friday night in

Wee Ice Mon II: Leonard comes of age at British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Maybe it was his heartfelt, humble
acceptance speech after he won the British Open.
	   Perhaps it was the way Justin Leonard wore his hat, pulled snug,
barely above his eyes, as if to block out everything and everyone
around him during a 6-under 65 that ranks as one of the great
closing rounds in Open history.
	   Whatever the case, the British gallery took to Leonard the way
it did another Texan at Carnoustie in 1953 _ Ben Hogan, whose name
is stitched on Leonard's hat and whose cool precision seems
implanted in his psyche.
	   ``I went back and played in the Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews and
really enjoyed all the people and all the great things that they
said and did,'' Leonard said. ``That's a big reason why I'm looking
forward to going back.''
	   Not to mention the golf.
	   It was last year at Royal Troon where the 26-year-old Leonard
emerged as one of the top young players in golf, becoming the first
player since James Barnes in 1925 to overcome a five-stroke deficit
in the final round of the Open.
	   Leonard doesn't have the sheer power of Tiger Woods or the
elegant, fluid swing of Ernie Els, two of his Generation X rivals.
But he has become as much, if not more, a major threat when the
stakes are high.
	   It was Leonard who bit at the heels of Davis Love III at Winged
Foot last year before Love pulled away at the U.S. PGA
Championship. And it was Leonard who again came from five strokes
behind, this time to win the dlrs 720,000 first prize at The
Players Championship in March.
	   ``That's one of the things that has really come from the Kemper
Open last year and the British Open last year,'' Leonard said.
``That's the kind of confidence and mind set that I have now.''
	   For nearly four hours, Leonard grinded away under an unusually
warm sun shining off the Firth of Clyde. What the British remember
just as fondly is a champion's acceptance speech that lasted just
more than five minutes.
	   Holding the Claret Jug and fighting to maintain his composure
for the first time, Leonard thanked the members of the championship
committee and the course superintendent.
	   He thanked Royal and Ancient secretary Michael Bonallack for a
chance to play, saying if he ever had to qualify for the Open _
which he won't _ he would do so gladly.
	   He thanked his playing partner, Fred Couples, and those he shot
past on the leaderboard, Darren Clarke and Jesper Parnevik.
	   He thanked his coach, Randy Smith, and his family, who stayed
behind in Dallas.
	   And then he cried.
	   ``I've had as much response about that speech as about the way I
played,'' Leonard said.
	   His play was worthy of all the applause the Brits could muster.
Leonard hit every green in making the turn in 31. He saved par
three times from off the green on the difficult back nine of Troon,
the biggest a 15-foot (4.57-meter) putt on No. 15.
	   He birdied the par-5 16th from 15 feet, (4.57 meters) then took
the lead with a 35-foot (10.67-meter) birdie on the par-3 17th, a
putt that Leonard said made the hair stand on the back of his neck.
	   It was a synopsis of his career, starting with his junior days
when Leonard often had to compensate for his small physique with a
Texas-sized heart and the course management of a tested pro.
	   ``Growing up small, I had to learn to manage my game and get it
around the golf course,'' he said. ``Not making mistakes, keeping
it in play, giving myself a chance. ... I like a mental battle.''
	   His game seems naturally suited for the U.S. Open _ Leonard won
the U.S. Amateur in 1992 _ but he has never finished better than a
tie for 36th. He tied for 40th at The Olympic Club last month,
where he was agitated by his play and by the histrionics of amateur
Matt Kuchar's father-caddie.
	   ``It's just been a matter of making a couple of mistakes and
really paying for it,'' Leonard said. ``It seems like when you're
playing well, you make a mistake and somehow get away with it.
	   ``At the same time, I know there's not a lot wrong.''
	   Defending his title next week is no small task. The last British
Open champion to repeat was Watson in 1983 _ also at Royal
Birkdale.
	   Leonard, organized and meticulous on and off the course, plans
to stick to his routine. He arrived in Scotland last year on Sunday
having never laid eyes on Royal Troon, then picked apart the course
until he felt comfortable.
	   That took until Tuesday.
	   ``It may not take as long at Birkdale, but I'm going to get over
there in plenty of time so that I've got enough time to figure that
out,'' he said.

	   A hole-by-hole description of Royal Birkdale Golf Club, site of
the 127th British Open championship:
	   The course was designed by George Lowe and opened in 1889. In
1932, it was redesigned into its championship layout by Fred
Hawtree and five-time British Open champion J.H. Taylor. All 18
greens were redone after the 1991 Open, and several trees and brush
have been cleared from the sand dunes.
	   No. 1, 449 yards (410.42 meters), par 4: A difficult opening
hole, starting with the tee shot. The drive must be placed between
out of bounds right and a mound to the left. With a good drive, the
flag can be seen over an intervening mound on the right. Ranked the
third-toughest hole at the 1991 Open.
	   No. 2, 421 yards (384.83 meters), par 4: This plays into the
prevailing wind, with most of the trouble left. Picturesque
approach into a tight green surrounded by bunkers and rough banks.
	   No. 3, 407 yards (372.03 meters), par 4: The easiest hole in
1991 and the first good chance for birdie. A tee shot down the left
side flirts with very heavy rough, but also give an open approach
to a low, flat green.
	   No. 4, 203 yards (185.56 meters), par 3: The only par 3 over 200
yards (182.82 meters). Slightly elevated green makes club selection
and wind judgment critical. Bunkers left and right guard the front
of the green.
	   No. 5, 344 yards (314.44 meters), par 4: Fairway moves left to
right off the tee, with deep rough on both sides. Seven bunkers
surround a severely sloped green. An approach that goes over the
green could spell disaster.
	   No. 6, 480 yards (438.76 meters), par 4: Two fairway bunkers to
beware of on this long par 4. The green has been lengthened since
the last Open and requires careful study of pace. This played as
the toughest hole in 1991, yielding just 18 birdies.
	   No. 7, 177 yards (161.79 meters), par 3: Plays into the
prevailing wind and is 20 yards (18.28 meters) longer than it was
in 1991. Green is a small target surrounded by bunkers.
	   No. 8, 457 yards (417.73 meters), par 4: A classic links driving
hole from an elevated tee to a fairway that curves to the left,
favoring a draw to provide an open angle to the green. Four fairway
bunkers must be avoided. The green is above the fairway, and there
are no easy pin positions because of the many subtle contours.
	   No. 9, 411 yards (375.69 meters), par 4: A blind tee shot with
trouble lurking left and right. Approach is played across a shallow
valley to a plateau green. Anything short will not get up the
slope, which has a bunker in the right face. Anything long will
finish in the long rough. The green is flat and open to sea
breezes.
	   FRONT NINE: 3,349 yards (3061.24 meters), par 34.
	   No. 10, 403 yards (368.37 meters), par 4: A sharp, dogleg left
puts emphasis on the tee shot, with a bunker on the right 260 yards
(237.66 meters) out. Anything left of center makes the approach
difficult to a sheltered green surrounded by typical Birkdale sand
hills. Green has a severe ridge on the left and slopes down to the
fairway, requiring the approach to be bold.
	   No. 11, 408 yards (372.94 meters), par 4: Good driving hole
played from an elevated tee with a ridge of rough ground left and
four bunkers down the right. Approach looks straightforward, but
the shape of the green could provide a tough pin placement back
right, where rough borders the putting surface.
	   No. 12, 183 yards (167.28 meters), par 3: Spectacular hole, with
the green set between large sand dunes. It always plays the full
yardage and leave no room for error. The bunkers are very deep on
both sides of the flat green, which looks like a small target from
the tee.
	   No. 13, 498 yards (455.21 meters), par 4: If length isn't
enough, bunkers are on both sides of the fairway and a ditch lurks
menacingly down the left. Bunkers left and right of the green
tighten up the approach. The hole lies directly down the prevailing
wind and should play shorter than its yardage.
	   No. 14, 198 yards (180.99 meters), par 3: The last par 3, and a
tough test at this stage in the round. Tee box is set deep in the
sand dunes, so players will have a tough time gauging the wind.
Club selection will be vital. The green is large, open and exposed
to the elements, and the bunkers are particularly deep and set well
below the green.
	   No. 15, 544 yards (497.26 meters), par 5: Wondering where all
the par 5s are? This is the first of two in the final four holes.
There are 13 bunkers to negotiate. The first three make the fairway
a mere 14 yards (12.80 meters) wide from about 260 yards (237.66
meters) out. Should players decide to lay up, eight bunkers in the
fairway require a well-executed shot. The green has severe
undulations.
	   No. 16, 416 yards (380.26 meters), par 4: Off the fairway to the
right is a plaque commemorating Arnold Palmer's dramatic recovery
in the final round of his 1961 victory. A long carry off the tee
requires a disciplined shot at a critical moment in the round. The
green is large and raised, making deep bunkers left and right
difficult to negotiate.
	   No. 17, 547 yards (500.00 meters), par 5: A new tee added 20
yards (18.28 meters) to this hole, which yielded 38 eagles and 357
birdies in 1991. That has turned the hole into a slight dogleg
left. The two-tiered green is guarded front and rear by bunkers.
	   No. 18, 472 yards (431.44 meters), par 4: Magnificent finishing
hole once again requires a great tee shot. The longer hitters will
try to drive over the lone bunker on the right, giving them a
shorter approach. The green has been raised and changed from a
previously flat surface to one with testing contours.
	   BACK NINE: 3,669 yards (3353.75 meters), par 36.
	   COURSE: 7,018 yards (6414.99 meters), par 34-36_70.

<TEXT>
	   In Phoenix, Brett Tomko pitched seven shutout innings and won
his fourth straight start as the Cincinnati Reds picked up where
they left off at the All-Star break with a victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks.
	   Reggie Sanders led off the game with a home run and Sean Casey
also connected, sending the Reds toward their fifth straight win.
They won for the 10th time in 11 games.
	   Rookies Danny Klassen and Travis Lee each hit two-run homers in
the Arizona ninth off Danny Graves. Lee's 18th home run came with
two outs.
	   Tomko (9-6) gave up six hits and improved his ERA to 1.69 in his
last four starts. He has not lost since St. Louis beat him 6-5 on
May 15.
	   Sanders hit a 3-2 pitch off Andy Benes (6-10) over the
left-field wall for his 10th homer of the season to begin the
game.
 &UR; Dodgers 6, Padres 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Gold Glove third baseman Ken Caminiti's throwing
error keyed Los Angeles' five-run rally in the eighth inning, and
the Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres.
	   The Dodgers trailed 2-1 when Juan Castro singled with one out in
the eighth off Dan Miceli (7-4) and took third on a single by
Adrian Beltre.
	   Eric Young followed with a grounder toward the hole that
Caminiti fielded, but he threw the ball over catcher Carlos
Hernandez's head while trying to get Castro. Beltre also made it
all the way around before Miceli could get the ball back to
Hernandez.
	   Antonio Osuna (5-0) retired the only two batters he faced for
the win.
	   Jeff Shaw, the All-Star reliever traded from Cincinnati to Los
Angeles last Saturday, made his Dodgers debut and pitched a perfect
ninth.

U.S. tourists venture to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A ``Death to the U.S.A.'' sign welcomed the
exhausted American tourists to their hotel. But despite that
ominous beginning, Jeanne Marie DeGiacomo said she and her party
were treated like celebrities in Iran.
	   Americans are paying up to dlrs 5,000 to join tours to exotic
cities and towns in the land that denounced America as the ``Great
Satan.''
	   ``The greatest thrill we had was the way we were treated by the
people. They were so enthusiastic about having us there,'' said
DeGiacomo, a Boston resident who went to Iran in May because she
wanted to learn more about the culture.
	   Since Iran's new president, Mohammad Khatami, called for a
``dialogue of civilizations'' in January, the United States and the
Islamic republic have taken tentative steps, such as exchanging
scholars and athletes, toward ending almost two decades of enmity.
	   But some Americans, like DeGiacomo, are not waiting for a
resumption of full diplomatic relations to explore one of the
world's oldest civilizations.
	   They're jamming organized tours that take them exotic Iranian
cities and towns such as Shiraz, where the Persian poet Hafiz is
buried; Isfahan, whose Royal Square contains masterpieces of 17th
century Islamic architecture; and Bam, which has a medieval
fortress with wide views of the valley below.
	   Three companies in the United States are offering group or
individual trips to Iran, lasting up to 24 days and for up to dlrs
5,000. Tour operators describe their clients as experienced
travelers, usually older than 40.
	   The tours are being organized despite a State Department travel
warning urging Americans to ``defer travel to Iran,'' citing
evidence of hostility toward the United States and a trade embargo
on Iran that allows Americans to bring back only dlrs 100 worth of
gifts and publications.
	   But a State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said despite the risks, the administration has
encouraged people-to-people contacts, ``so basically these trips
are fine with us.''
	   Ann Aylwin, regional director for Geographic Expeditions in San
Francisco recalled the first trip she organized to Iran in 1993 as
a ``logistical nightmare'' because the Iranians were not granting
Americans tourist visas. Her group of four had to wait for a
personal invitational visa arranged through a mountaineering group.
	   Things have become easier since last year when Iran began
granting tourist visas for Americans.
	   Tour operators and travelers agree that these are not luxury
trips.
	   ``It would be considered a fascinating experience, but it's not
the kind where you prop up your feet and say, 'Wow, this is really
living,''' said DeGiacomo, 72.
	   A low point, she said, was arriving at the Homa Hotel in Mashad
and being greeted by the ``Death to the U.S.A.'' sign.
	   ``We were startled,'' she recalled.
	   But she said the Iranian people were unexpectedly cordial and
treated them like celebrities.
	   The hotels where they stayed, most of them Western chains now
run by local companies, had hot water, air-conditioning and toilets
that flush. But they needed refurbishing. Mattresses tended to sag,
the furniture was old and most had no direct dial, making access to
electronic-mail difficult.
	   Then there's the question of the chador, the long shawl that
Iranian women use to cover themselves and that female tourists are
required to wear. DeGiacomo and Aylwin found that leaving only
their hands and face uncovered was a bit oppressive. Aylwin
exchanged her silk scarf for a cotton one because it kept slipping
off her head.
	   David Herriman, 66, a real-estate developer and investor in
Covington, Kentucky, who is planning a trip in October, said Iran's
victory over the United States in World Cup soccer will make it
easier to go.
	   ``It's got to make the Iranians ... feel much better about
themselves and they must be proud of beating the United States,''
said Herriman.

North Korea demands Washington to lift economic sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea demanded Saturday that
Washington end economic sanctions against the famine-stricken
communist state to open the way for bigger and swifter supplies of
food and medicine.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency carried the
demand and reported that the country's food stock has run out and
many people were living on ``substitute food,'' meaning grass, bark
and roots.
	   Quoting the U.N. World Food Program and other relief agencies,
North Korea said the outside world needs to ``pay deep concern''
for North Korea, where farm crops were damaged again this year by
bad wether.
	   ``The United States should, in response to their humanitarian
appeal, lift the unreasonable ban on the Democratic People's
Republic of (North) Korea as early as possible for wide-ranging
assistance,'' KCNA said.
	   Floods, drought and other bad weather have devastated North
Korea's farm industry since 1995, worsening its chronic food
shortages caused by inefficient collective-farming techniques.
	   On Thursday, North Korea said its potato, barley and wheat crops
were again destroyed this year by drought, tidal waves and cold
weather.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program says North Korea will need
another 500,000 tons of food aid this year in addition to the
800,000 tons already pledged by donor nations.
	   Under the Trading With The Enemy Act, U.S. companies are
prohibited from doing business with North Korea.
	   Washington promised to ease its trade embargoes under a 1994
deal in which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear facilities,
suspected of bomb development. Since then, the United States has
allowed emergency food aid.
	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung is among those who advises
the United States to lift punitive sanctions against North Korea
and use greater political and economic engagement as a means to
moderate the behavior of the world's last Stalinist state.

Indonesian president suggests licenses for journalists: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ After earlier making promises to
increase media freedoms, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has
reportedly suggested that journalists be required to obtain
licenses to work.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper reported Saturday that the president,
who has pledged to push through sweeping democratic changes, said
permits should be issued to journalists in the same way doctors
need licenses.
	   Habibie made the comments at a meeting with officials from media
organizations.
	   ``He pointed out the necessity to get a license or practicing
permit for journalists,'' Parni Hadi, the secretary general of the
Indonesian Journalists' Association, reportedly said.
	   The Post quoted Parni as saying a permit could be issued for one
year and could be revoked or not extended if a journalist was found
to be unqualified or unprofessional.
	   Habibie took office in May when former autocratic leader
Suharto, stepped down after 32 years in power.
	   Under Suharto, media organizations were strictly controlled and
were sometimes closed down if they upset his government.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents plan to talk their way out of a confrontation, which has
sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward compromise.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic resident of
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to try to
find a durable solution to a march that has sparked violence for a
third summer.
	   The violent potential of Northern Ireland's ancient sectarian
hatreds has been evident in the disorders that erupted across the
province after Orange marchers were stopped Sunday by police and
soldiers.
	   In London and Ireland, police arrested 10 people and said they
had foiled plans by Irish Republican Army dissidents to attack
targets in the British capital.
	   Police fired plastic bullets Friday night at Protestant
hard-liners who again tried to break through barricades around the
Drumcree Anglican church, where the Orange march was stopped
Sunday. However, the crowd on a cool and rainy night Friday was
substantially smaller than the estimated 20,000-plus of the night
before.
	   Police later reported that the crowd had used a grappling hook
attached to a car to try to pull away the barbed wire on the
barricade. The attempt failed, but a spokesman said the
4,000-strong crowd forced the lines of defence to be reinforced, as
officers took cover behind armored vehicles.
	   A blast bomb was also thrown at police lines and protesters
fired shots at police with a rifle and a handgun. No officers were
hurt.
	   Later, three people were injured in a shooting incident in north
Belfast and one man was seriously hurt after being shot in the
knee.
	   Roads in the south of the city were closed after bomb disposal
experts were called to inspect a suspicious device discovered near
a car showroom. It was later declared a hoax.
	   Police arrested 18 people after they broke away from the crowd
in Dumcree and attacked a house, while a blast bomb thrown through
the window of a house just outside Portadown caused extensive
damage to a kitchen but hurt nobody.

Police seize truck fearing bombing ahead of South Asian summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police seized a rice-laden truck from
northern Sri Lanka out of fear that Tamil Tiger rebels may have
planted bombs in it ahead of the seven-nation South Asian summit,
officials said Saturday.
	   The truck was intercepted Friday outside the capital, Colombo,
after arriving from Vavuniya, 210 kilometers (130 miles) to the
north, a police official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Intelligence reports had indicated that the Tigers would attack
targets in Colombo ahead of the July 28-31 summit.
	   The rebels normally attack military and government facilities,
but they also aim for civilian targets to dramatize their 15-year
campaign for a separate homeland for the country's minority Tamils.
	   The militants say the Tamils are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese. More than 50,000 people have been killed in
years of fighting between the rebels and government forces.
	   Police in Colombo detained the truck's driver and his two
assistants and checked the vehicle to see if it contained bombs.
	   Separately, police questioned 20 Tamils in the city in
connection with security arrangements for the regional summit.
	   Heads of governments from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal,
Maldives, Pakistan and host Sri Lanka will meet in an annual
gathering of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.

Head of problem-plagued Hong Kong airport offers to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to resign after revelations of a security
breach added to concerns over cargo delays so severe that they
could reduce economic growth.
	   The Chek Lap Kok airport, built at a cost of dlrs 20 billion,
has provoked complaints since it opened Monday about lengthy delays
before passengers could get off airplanes or collect luggage and
confusing flight information.
	   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Kwo-yan, said he
took responsibility for the problems and offered to resign when his
term ends in November, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
There was no immediate word whether Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa would accept the resignation.
	   The head of Hong Kong's civil service, Anson Chan, said Friday
that the government would appoint two outside experts and an
influential Hong Kong figure to investigate the problems at the
airport.
	   The Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes
bound for Amsterdam violated safety rules by taking off with the
bags of two passengers who weren't aboard. Airlines are required to
remove the bags of passengers who fail to board in an attempt to
guard against explosives being put aboard planes anonymously.
	   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage
numbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff
to check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said
Albert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.
	   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport
Authority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport
security.''
	   The chairman of the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific defended
the management of the airport, saying he didn't know of any
security problems.
	   ``Certainly on Cathay Pacific we are very satisfied with our
check-in porocedures,'' Peter Sutch said on government radio.
``There's still a long way to go, but every day is showing solid
progress.''
	   Newspaper commentaries and legislators were wary of Chan's
proposal to have a government-appointed panel investigate the
airport. Lee Wing-tat of the opposition Democratic Party said on
government radio that the proposed panel was ``inadequate.''
	   Legislators want a committee appointed by the Hong Kong
legislature, which they say would ensure impartiality.
	   The company that handles cargo for the airport imposed a
moratorium on cargo shipments this week in order to clear away a
backlog. Exempted are perishable goods, newspapers and magazines
and lifesaving materials.
	   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the
company managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of
freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217
million).
	   The delays could reduce Hong Kong's economic growth this year by
0.1 percentage points ``provided that the period of moratorium is
limited to what they say,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said
late Friday.
	   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kms (22
miles) west of the Hong Kong city center.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents hoped that talks Saturday will diffuse the confrontation,
which has sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward
compromise.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic residents
of the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to talk in
Northern Ireland through intermediaries to try to find a durable
solution to a march that has sparked violence for a third summer.
	   The violent potential of Northern Ireland's ancient sectarian
hatreds has been evident in the disorders that erupted across the
province after Orange marchers were stopped Sunday by police and
soldiers.
	   In London and Ireland, police arrested 10 people and said they
had foiled plans by Irish Republican Army dissidents to attack
targets in the British capital.
	   Police fired plastic bullets Friday night at Protestant
hard-liners who again tried to break through barricades around the
Drumcree Anglican church, where march was stopped. However, the
crowd on a cool and rainy night Friday was substantially smaller
than the estimated 20,000-plus of the night before.
	   The crowd had used a grappling hook attached to a car to try to
pull away the barbed wire on the barricade early Saturday. The
4,000-strong crowd forced the lines of defense to be reinforced, as
officers took cover behind armored vehicles. Protesters also shot
at police and threw bombs.
	   Later, three people were injured in a shooting incident in north
Belfast, and 18 people were arrested after they broke away from the
crowd in Dumcree and attacked a house. In a separate incident, a
bomb thrown through the window of a house just outside Portadown
caused extensive damage to a kitchen.
	   The Orangemen and their Catholic opponents won't meet directly,
but will relay proposals through intermediaries. Having failed in
similar contacts the past two years, both sides were cautious about
the prospects.
	   ``For our part we would view this as a small first step toward
what we would hope would be face-to-face dialogue with the Orange
Order,'' said Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of the residents group.
	   The Orange Order said in a statement: ``It is our objective to
deliver the Portadown brethren safely on their return down the
Garvaghy Road. We intend to establish our inalienable rights and
freedom to express our culture.''
	   The Orange Order has refused any direct contact with the
residents group, because MacCionnaith is a former IRA prisoner. The
order insists it has a historic right to march on any public
highway.
	   ``What we want to see is this issue resolved and resolved in a
way that is acceptable so that things can return to normal, not
just this year but every year,'' said David Trimble, newly elected
first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly created by the
peace agreement negotiated in April.
	   Indirect talks were attempted in 1996 and 1997, but both times
failed to resolve the conflict over the Garvaghy Road march. In
1996, police and soldiers stopped the march but backed down after
four nights of Protestant violence across Northern Ireland. Last
year, police clubbed protesters off the road to let the Orangemen
through.
	   This year, Blair said he will enforce the decision of the new
Parades Commission that the Orangemen could not go down the
Garvaghy Road. The only way that part of the march could proceed,
Blair said, is through an agreement between marchers and residents.
	   Tensions are likely to peak this weekend with the 12th of July
holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the defeat of
Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.

Wave of Oregon fugitives making a run for Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANS GREIMEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ For nearly a year, Frank Nimz has lived
with the pain of his son's brutal murder. What turns his anguish to
anger is that the suspected killers may be lounging on a Mexican
beach.
	   Some of Oregon's most notorious fugitives are staying a step
ahead of U.S. law by vanishing into the barrios and badlands of
Mexico, aided by diplomatic red tape and a little help from their
friends.
	   Since last summer, two men suspected of killing a couple in
Seaside have eluded capture and are believed to be hiding out in
Mexico. Last month, a Portland high school student wanted in a
string of armed robberies partied in Mazatlan with classmates who
all kept silent on his whereabouts.
	   ``Mexican authorities don't do anything,'' said Nimz, whose son
_ also named Frank _ was one of the Seaside victims. ``These punks
are getting the idea that they're home free. They're down there
laughing at us. What's going on?''
	   Since 1980, more than 500 Americans have fled to Mexico to avoid
prosecution, said Jorge Ricardo Garcia-Villalobos, West Coast legal
attache for the Mexican attorney general. Of those, 212 are still
at large, but only 17 were returned to the United States within the
last year under extradition treaties.
	   ``Over the past 10 years, the number of American fugitives in
Mexico is rising,'' he said. ``Criminals are feeling a lot of
pressure on the U.S. side of the border, and they think that on the
Mexican side they will be safe.''
	   FBI agent Hadley McCann estimates that a couple dozen Oregon
fugitives have fled to other countries, but many of the prominent
ones flee to Mexico.
	   The most infamous are Jesse McAllister, 21, and Bradley Price,
22, who fled after the July 14 execution-style murder of Nimz's
36-year-old son and a friend, Gabriela Brooke Goza, 26.
	   They were shot in the head as they sat on the beach waiting for
sunrise. Police say it was a random killing based on the movie
version of the true-crime book ``In Cold Blood,'' which the
suspects had rented at least four times in the month before the
murders.
	   The 1977 Chevy Impala believed to be the killers' getaway car
was found in southern Baja California, on the western coast of
Mexico, last October. But no hard leads have been found since.
	   It took four years to find another Oregon killer _ 24-year-old
Michael Webber, who was brought back last year and convicted in the
1993 stabbing death of his father in Oregon City. His new Mexican
wife turned him in.
	   In April, Tom Curtis, the 18-year-old class president and
homecoming king at Portland's Grant High School, fled south of the
border after he was accused in a yearlong spree of 19 robberies.
His accomplice and classmate, Ethan Thrower, has been arrested and
charged.
	   Dozens of friends who were aware of the allegations against
Curtis said they relaxed with him at poolside last month in sunny
Mazatlan, drinking beer and eating tacos.
	   They kept quiet about their visit until they returned to Oregon,
where a warrant is out for Curtis' arrest. Then, before authorities
could react, Curtis vanished into the tourist towns of Mexico's
Pacific Coast.
	   Authorities said it's not easy to bring fugitives in Mexico to
justice.
	   When American police pursue fugitives in other states, they can
communicate with police stations nationwide via computers. No such
connections span the Rio Grande, and if they did, many American
police would confront a language barrier with their
Spanish-speaking colleagues.
	   Local U.S. officials also are barred by international treaties
from conducting investigations in Mexico. They must pinpoint the
fugitive before asking Mexican officials to make an arrest.
	   Also helping the fugitives is a favorable exchange rate that
makes a dollar go far.
	   Norm Frink, the deputy district attorney trying to catch Curtis,
summed up the frustration faced by fugitive hunters.
	   ``The thing that makes it hardest,'' he said, ``is when you have
other people helping them.''

Ousted Cambodian co-premier accused of still having armed forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government has filed a
complaint accusing the leading opposition party of having illegal
armed forces, the body charged with overseeing the country's
upcoming elections said Saturday.
	   The Ministry of Defense has written a letter to the National
Election Committee accusing Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party of having ``illegal troops,'' said committee spokesman Leng
Sochea. He did not say if the ministry had included any evidence
with its letter.
	   FUNCINPEC denied the allegation, which surfaced earlier this
week in comments from high-ranking government officials belonging
to the Cambodian People's Party of strongman Hun Sen. They extended
the accusation to prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, a political ally
of Ranariddh.
	   Political parties are banned from having their own military
forces. It is unclear whether the election committee could take any
action on the basis of such a complaint, but if criminal charges
were filed, they could be used to stymie FUNCINPEC's election
hopes.
	   Political parties are prohibited from having their own armies,
Leng Sochea said at a weekly press conference, but the election
committee will take no action against Ranariddh unless the
government asks the body to investigate the charges and ``there is
a decision by the court.''
	   With the court system loyal to Hun Sen's party, FUNCINPEC would
be hard-pressed to defend itself against any legal action, which
could include invalidating the results of the upcoming July 26
election should Ranariddh's party win.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who ousted the prince as his
co-premier in a bloody coup one year ago, called for elections to
proceed this year in an effort to win back legitimacy and aid after
his power grab.
	   After Ranariddh was deposed he and two of his top military aides
were tried and convicted in a show trial of plotting their own
takeover. Ranariddh was granted an amnesty, allowing him to return
from exile to contest the July elections.
	   But the amnesty was not extended to his generals, Nhek Bunchhay
and Serei Kosal, who lead a small resistance force of the prince's
loyalists in northern Cambodia.
	   Peace talks aimed at reintegrating the prince's troops into the
Royal army have repeatedly failed, and the area of O'Smach along
the Thai border remains one of the few areas of Cambodia not under
the control of Hun Sen's government.
	   Ranariddh left for Bangkok on Saturday, a trip the prince's
aides said was previously scheduled.
	   ``We strongly deny these allegations,'' said Kong Vibol, a
member of the prince's cabinet, adding that while Nhek Bunchhay's
forces are loyal to the prince they are officially part of the
Royal army. ``FUNCINPEC has no illegal troops or armed forces.''
	   Meanwhile, ballot boxes and voting papers for the polls will be
delivered to 23 provinces by July 20, said Samraing Kamsan, an
advisor to election committee chairman Chheng Phon.
	   The election committee will deliver the supplies by car and
truck, and in remote areas by helicopter and even elephant, he
said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to step down after revelations of a

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to step down at the end of his term after
revelations of a security breach added to concerns over cargo
delays so severe that they could reduce economic growth.
	   The Chek Lap Kok airport, built at a cost of dlrs 20 billion,
has provoked complaints since it opened Monday about lengthy delays
before passengers could get off airplanes or collect luggage and
confusing flight information.
	   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Po-yan, said he took
responsibility for the problems and offered not to seek another
term when it expires in November, government-run Radio Hong Kong
reported. There was no immediate word whether Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa would accept the resignation.
	   The head of Hong Kong's civil service, Anson Chan, said Friday
that the government would appoint two outside experts and an
influential Hong Kong figure to investigate the problems at the
airport.
	   The Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes
bound for Amsterdam violated safety rules by taking off with the
bags of two passengers who weren't aboard. Airlines are required to
remove the bags of passengers who fail to board in an attempt to
guard against explosives being put aboard planes anonymously.
	   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage
numbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff
to check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said
Albert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.
	   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport
Authority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport
security.''
	   The chairman of the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific defended
the management of the airport, saying he didn't know of any
security problems.
	   ``Certainly on Cathay Pacific we are very satisfied with our
check-in porocedures,'' Peter Sutch said on government radio.
``There's still a long way to go, but every day is showing solid
progress.''
	   Newspaper commentaries and legislators were wary of Chan's
proposal to have a government-appointed panel investigate the
airport. Lee Wing-tat of the opposition Democratic Party said on
government radio that the proposed panel was ``inadequate.''
	   Legislators want a committee appointed by the Hong Kong
legislature, which they say would ensure impartiality.
	   The company that handles cargo for the airport imposed a
moratorium on cargo shipments this week in order to clear away a
backlog. Exempted are perishable goods, newspapers and magazines
and lifesaving materials.
	   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the
company managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of
freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217
million).
	   The delays could reduce Hong Kong's economic growth this year by
0.1 percentage points ``provided that the period of moratorium is
limited to what they say,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said
late Friday.
	   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kms (22
miles) west of the Hong Kong city center.

 &UR; Ballot boxes for Cambodian elections sent to provinces

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The ballot boxes for Cambodia's July
26 elections will be delivered to remote provinces on the backs of
elephants or lowered by cranes from hovering helicopters, officials
overseeing the polls said Saturday.
	   National Election Committee spokesman Samraing Kamsan said at a
press conference that 12,500 ballot boxes and millions of ballots
will be delivered nationwide by July 20, six days before Cambodians
are scheduled to go to the polls.
	   ``In Rattanakiri and other remote provinces, we can't use trucks
or other forms of transportation,'' he said, explaining that
elephants can get to hard-to-reach places even during heavy rains.
	   The elections are the first since last July's coup d'etat, when
Cambodian leader Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-premier, shattering a tense dual premiership formed after the
U.N.-supervised elections in 1993.
	   In a bid to win back international legitimacy and aid following
his violent takeover, Hun Sen agreed to hold the elections.
	   The cash-strapped election committee said that transportation
problems pose the biggest challenge to holding the election on
time.
	   The committee appealed to aid organizations Saturday to donate
use of their vehicles _ especially four-wheel drive cars suitable
for rough roads _ so that the ballots and ballot boxes could be
delivered on time.
	   Another mode of transportation will be two helicopters, which
the government will lease from a Western European nation to carry
the sturdy boxes _ which were donated by Japan _ to remote regions,
said Samraing Kamsan.
	   He said elephant trainers will also be asked to rent or donate
the use of their beasts to carry ballots.

Four killed as flooding worsens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Four people have died in recent days as
the result of flooding that continues to worsen in northern
Vietnam, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Two people were killed in Tuyen Quang province, where the Lo
River has overrun its banks, driving 3,000 families in 36 villages
from their homes and flooding 1,625 hectares (4,000 acres) of
crops.
	   Another two people were killed and four injured in a landslide
while workers were reinforcing dikes in Ha Tay province.
	   The flood waters have inundated 6,765 hectares (16,700 acres)
nationwide _ more than 1 percent of all land under cultivation in
Vietnam.

Head of problem-plagued Hong Kong airport offers to step down
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to step down after revelations of a
security breach added to concerns over cargo delays so severe that
they could slow economic growth.
	   The dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport has provoked complaints
since it opened Monday about lengthy delays before passengers could
get off airplanes or collect luggage and confusing flight
information.
	   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Po-yan, said he took
responsibility for the problems and offered to step down when his
term ends in November, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
There was no immediate word from Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa.
	   The government said Friday it would appoint two outside experts
and an influential Hong Kong figure to investigate the problems.
Legislators criticized the proposal, saying they want a panel
appointed by the Hong Kong legislature to ensure the government
doesn't try to conceal its own mistakes.
	   Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes
violated safety rules by taking off with the bags of two passengers
who weren't aboard. Airlines are required to remove the bags of
absent passengers to guard against explosives.
	   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage
numbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff
to check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said
Albert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.
	   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport
Authority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport
security.''
	   The company handling cargo at the airport imposed a moratorium
on new shipments this week in order to clear away a backlog.
	   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the
company managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of
freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217
million).
	   Delays in shipments have forced sellers of fresh seafood to
close.
	   The delays could shave economic growth this year by at least 0.1
percentage points, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said late
Friday.
	   It was the first official estimate for losses caused by problems
at the airport.
	   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kilometers
(22 miles) west of the Hong Kong's city center in one of the
world's biggest construction projects.
	   Hong Kong leaders had hoped its opening would revive public
confidence in the midst of Asia's economic slump. Instead, it has
created a public-relations disaster.
	   ``On the fundamental question on whether the airport has been
put in good hands, the answer is no,'' wrote commentator Chris
Yeung in the South China Morning Post.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Rain-swollen rivers have flooded parts
of northern Bangladesh, displacing at least 50,000 villagers who
had taken shelter on the embankments, officials said Saturday.
	   Another 300,000 people were trapped in villages in several
northern districts, according to the Flood Information Center in
Dhaka.
	   Authorities reported no casualties.
	   The Jamuna and Brahmmaputra Rivers burst their banks following
monsoon rains Thursday and Friday about 100 miles (160 kilometers)
north of Dhaka, the capital.
	   In another development, floods that struck the southern Cox's
Bazar district last month eased as rains relented Friday. The
southern floods killed at least 10 people and displaced 100,000
others.
	   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 120 million people, is
buffeted by floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people every
year.

Head of problem-plagued Hong Kong airport offers to step down

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to show chairman offered to step down after term
ends

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to step down once his term ends after
revelations of a security breach added to concerns over cargo
delays so severe that they could reduce economic growth.
	   The dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport has provoked complaints
since it opened Monday about lengthy delays before passengers could
get off airplanes or collect luggage and confusing flight
information.
	   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Po-yan, said he took
responsibility for the problems and offered to step down when his
term ends in November, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
There was no immediate word from Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa.
	   The government said Friday it would appoint two outside experts
and an influential Hong Kong figure to investigate the problems.
Legislators criticized the proposal, saying they want a panel
appointed by the Hong Kong legislature to ensure the government
doesn't try to conceal its own mistakes.
	   Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes
violated safety rules by taking off with the bags of two passengers
who weren't aboard. Airlines are required to remove the bags of
absent passengers to guard against explosives.
	   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage
numbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff
to check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said
Albert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.
	   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport
Authority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport
security.''
	   The company handling cargo at the airport imposed a moratorium
on new shipments this week in order to clear away a backlog.
	   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the
company managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of
freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217
million).
	   Delays in shipments have forced sellers of fresh seafood to
close.
	   The delays could reduce economic growth this year by 0.1
percentage points ``provided that the period of moratorium is
limited to what they say,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said
late Friday.
	   It was the first official estimate for losses caused by problems
at the airport.
	   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kilometers
(22 miles) west of the Hong Kong's city center in one of the
world's biggest construction projects.
	   Hong Kong leaders had hoped its opening would revive public
confidence in the midst of Asia's economic crisis. Instead, it has
created a public-relations disaster.
	   ``On the fundamental question on whether the airport has been
put in good hands, the answer is no,'' wrote commentator Chris
Yeung in the South China Morning Post.

Four rockets hit Kabul airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Four rockets slammed into the airport
in Afghanistan's capital on Saturday, just one day after the United
Nations announced it was suspending its flights into Kabul.
	   Opposition soldiers led by ousted military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood fired the rockets. Invading Taliban troops drove Massood
from Kabul in 1996.
	   Opposition fighters vowed to continue their rocket assaults in
an attempt to prevent Taliban jet fighters from using the airport's
runway.
	   Authorities reported no deaths or injuries in the attack.
	   The United Nations stopped all its flights into Kabul after
rockets landed twice at the airport while a U.N. aircraft was
parked on the tarmac. The rocketing has occurred almost daily for
the last two weeks.
	   Several of the rockets have gone astray and landed in nearby
residential areas, killing at least three people and wounding
several others.
	   The Taliban army controls about 85 percent of Afghanistan,
including Kabul, while its opponents rule about 15 percent of the
country, mostly in the north. The opposition is a collection of
small groups that mostly represent Afghanistan's ethnic minorities.
	   The Taliban religious army has imposed a harsh form of Islamic
law in the areas it controls. The Taliban forbids women from
working and girls from going to school, while it requires men to
pray in mosques and publicly beats any who shave their beards.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents hope that talks Saturday will diffuse the confrontation,
which has sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward
compromise.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic residents
of the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to talk in
Northern Ireland through intermediaries to try to find a durable
solution to a march that has sparked violence for a third summer.
	   The Northern Ireland Office said the start of talks had been
delayed. It gave no reason, but there were reports of wrangling
over the venue and the participants.
	   ``The important thing is that we get the matter resolved in a
way that enables both sides to feel that their rights have been
vindicated,'' David Trimble, newly elected first minister of the
Northern Ireland Assembly and leader of the province's largest
Protestant party, told BBC Radio 4. ``We are dealing here with a
conflict of rights, there's right on both sides.''

Malaysia unveils Commonwealth Games stadium amid snafus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia unveiled its Commonwealth
Games sporting complex Saturday, bringing to reality the recurring
dream of placing the Southeast Asian country on the international
sports map.
	   The 1.2 billion ringgit (dlrs 300 million) National Sports
Complex, with the Bukit Jalil Main Stadium that can seat 100,000
sports fans, is yet another Malaysian mega-project slathered in
superlatives.
	   The stadium boasts a cable-tension membrane roof that covers
38,000 square meters, making it the biggest of its kind in the
world, according to sports authorities.
	   Its adjoining, 25 million ringgit (dlrs 6.2 million) squash
complex is claimed to be the biggest and best equipped squash arena
in the world.
	   More than 4,100 athletes from 67 countries are expected to
participate in the 16th Commonwealth Games, ranked second only to
the Olympics. Malaysia is the first Asian host for the games.
	   Amid all the hoopla over the new stadium, however, the
organizers are still struggling to raise millions before the Games
open Sept. 11.
	   Ticket sales are dismal and a major sponsor, Carlsberg, pulled
out when the government said its beer advertisements were not
allowed in the mostly Muslim country.
	   A practice run for the Games did not get off to a good start.
Several teams competing in the Commonwealth pre-Games this week
were left stranded at the airport Friday when the organizers, Sukom
'98, made no arrangements to pick them up.
	   Malaysian Amateur Athletic Union secretary Karim Ibrahim told
The Star newspaper Saturday that the Taiwanese team was forced to
wait five hours for transportation. The Singapore team was stranded
for two hours.
	   ``Sukom '98's inefficiency is certainly going to put Malaysia in
a bad light among the participating teams,'' said Karim.
	   The squash participants were to have checked into the Games
Village on Thursday, but they opted not to stay there because of
dirty facilities, according to The Star, which said some rooms did
not even have furniture.

In first for China, TV offers nation glimpse of trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a first for China, state-run television beamed
a live court trial nationwide Saturday, bringing a touch of
openness to the nation's spotty, corrupt and opaque legal system.
	   Under the hot glare of TV lights, attorneys for ten major
Chinese film studios argued for over a million yuan (dlrs 120,000)
in damages and fees from three companies for violating sales and
distribution contracts on video discs of 27 well-known feature
films.
	   Riveting television it wasn't. The attorneys exhibited little of
the media savvy displayed in high-profile U.S. trials. Seated
behind high brown desks, they read lengthy statements with only
quick glances from their papers. Their largely technical arguments
centered on interpretations of copyright and contract laws.
	   But the 4 1/2-hour broadcast marked significant, if slight
progress in transforming Chinese courts from instruments of state
power to arbiters of the law and encouraged public scrutiny of the
courts.
	   ``This is an attempt by Chinese legal officials to make the
judicial system more transparent and thereby more accountable to
people and the plaintiffs,'' said Phyllis Chang, a legal expert for
the U.S.-based Ford Foundation who advises Chinese lawyers.
	   The broadcast followed on the heels of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's nine-day barnstorming of China. He praised Chinese
efforts to build a fairer, more modern legal system and offered
U.S. assistance to train judges and improve civil liberties laws.
	   Credit for the progress belongs to the Chinese government, not
Clinton. Two decades of fitful, plodding progress has quickened.
Since March, Supreme People's Court President Xiao Yang has ordered
most trials open to news coverage. Beijing this month opened
proceedings at one court to ordinary citizens.
	   ``If all court proceedings were so open and so transparent, then
the bad, mediocre judgments of all courts would be, if not
eliminated, then reduced,'' said Ma Shijie, a retired worker
watching Saturday's broadcast while eating breakfast in a Beijing
restaurant.
	   The broadcast was the first time a trial aired live nationwide,
although 20 local television stations have carried cases in whole
or part before, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Despite the seemingly arcane offering of an intellectual
property dispute as legal lesson, the court case was partly made
for television. The suit involved famous movies from the 1950s on
known to almost all Chinese. China Central Television, the premier
government-run network, showed clips from the movies and offered
expert commentary to explain the issues.
	   Proceedings at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court
were by the book. Three judges in light blue military-style
uniforms sat behind a raised desk in front of the state seal.
Attorneys argued from their seats to the side. There was no jury.
	   If dry, the coverage emphasized the rights of both sides and the
judges' role in weighing arguments. In the past, high-profile court
cases of criminals and political dissidents stressed the authority
of the communist government.
	   Legal-change advocates hope open court proceedings and TV
broadcasts will reform a substandard and corrupt judiciary that is
undermining confidence in the budding legal system. Tales are
legion of plaintiffs and defendants wining and dining court
officers.
	   ``This was a measure to oppose corruption,'' said Cai Dingjian,
a legal expert for China's national legislature. ``In the past when
trials weren't open, they've been subjected to behind-the-scenes
bargaining.''
	   Demystification of court proceedings only went so far. Cai
believed the government chose an intellectual property case was
chosen because the arguments were complicated, unlike a criminal
case where ``everybody would be able to judge.''
	   A business case also underscores China's more complete code of
commercial laws, in contrast to incomplete and often unenforced
human rights protections. On Friday, at least six dissidents were
detained in eastern Hangzhou, apparently for trying to form and
legally register an opposition political party.
	   ``This is all a performance put on to make people feel good,''
said Li Ping, a private businessman from Sichuan province. He
ignored the broadcast while eating breakfast in a Beijing
restaurant.
	   Legal experts also cautioned that the broadcast was only ``a
first step.'' Pre-trial procedures, appeals, evidence gathering and
access for lawyers all need to be improved.
	   ``What needs to be done is to not only open courts to occasional
filming, but to open them completely to the Chinese public,'' said
Chang, the Ford Foundation expert.

Miners may lift may blockade if government pays up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking coal miners will consider lifting a
blockade on the Trans-Siberian railway if the government agrees to
immediately pay back wages, union officials said Saturday.
	   Strike committee officials have prepared a package of demands,
which includes a demand that a government commission works out a
protocol on the financial support of all 20 towns and cities in the
Kemerovo region, the Interfax news agency said.
	   A strike committee spokesman said if the government agrees to
immediately pay back wages, which have gone unpaid for up to six
months, the miners will consider lifting their 9-day blockade of
the Trans-Siberian railway, Interfax said.
	   About 30 freight trains were idled Saturday, but several trains
carrying dangerous cargo were allowed through, Interfax said.
	   A government commission and the miners failed to reach a
settlement this week that would end the blockade, which has forced
some factories to shut down because of a lack of fuel and
equipment.
	   Losses along western sections of the railway alone topped 12
million rubles (dlrs 2 million) by Thursday night, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.

Albanian sources: Serbs launch heavy attack on Albanina stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of attack near Pec. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees are streaming
from Kosovo's second city Saturday amid intense nearby fighting
between secessionist guerrillas and Serb security forces, ethnic
Albanian sources said.
	   Reporters on the scene said residents of Pec, 50 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Pristina are jamming bus and gas stations to
flee after Serb security forces launched an intense attack early
Saturday on the village Lodja, a guerrilla strong-hold outside of
Pec.
	   ``This is an all out attack,'' said a spokesman from the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Information Center. ``Residents (of Pec) are
fleeing in panic.''
	   On Friday, Yugoslav troops sought to cut the flow of arms from

Musashimaru, Takanohana still tied at 7-0 lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana and
ozeki (champion) Musashimaru from Hawaii remained undefeated and
shared a 7-0 lead Saturday in the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   One victory behind at 6-1 were three wrestlers, down from
Friday's seven _ yokozuna Akebono, No. 4-maegashira (senior
wrestler) Dejima and No. 9-ranked maegashira Kotonowaka.
	   Takanohana pulled down No. 4-maegashira Tochinowaka's hand,
sending the opponent to the ground. Tochinowaka is winless.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, grabbed No.
5-maegashira Ganyu's loin belt firmly with both hands and dragged
him out of the ring. Ganyu is 2-5.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, thrust out sekiwake (junior
champion) Chiyotaikai (5-2) after swaying to the side as the
opponent sidestepped to avoid him.
	   Dejima lowered his head and bulldozed over No. 5-maegashira
Tochiazuma (5-2).
	   Kotonowaka toppled No. 13-ranked Mitoizumi (3-4) by lifting his
left thigh.
	   No. 2-maegashira Tochinonada threw himself on top of new
yokozuna Wakanohana after shoving him to the ringside, securing his
first victory after six losses. Wakanohana suffered his second
defeat in a row against five victories.
	   Ozeki Takanonami almost shoved out No. 3-maegashira Shikishima
but was thrown out himself after losing balance at the ringside.
Takanonami slipped to 5-2 and Shikishima is 3-4.
	   In other major bouts, No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or
Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, flipped No. 15-maegashira Kinkaiyama
(2-5) with an overarm throw. He is 4-3.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also from
Mongolia, was thrown out by Kitakachidoki, who is top-ranked in
juryo, the division just below the senior makuuchi, leaving both at
2-5.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 2-ranked Hoshitango,
or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, pushed down No. 4-ranked
Futatsukuba for his third victory against one defeat. No. 16-ranked
Kaishinzan, or American Henry Armstrong Miller, shoved out No.
13-ranked Wakakinryu, also for a 3-1.
	   No. 50-ranked Ikemori, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori was thrown
down by No. 47-ranked Gokokuyama, and remained winless. His fellow
Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, or No. 56-ranked Kitaazuma (2-2), tossed
out No. 55-ranked Komachikara.
	   In sandanme, or the second highest junior division, No.
17-ranked Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, was shoved
out by No. 10-ranked Tokugozan to suffer his first defeat against
three victories. No. 64-ranked Azumakaze (3-1), or Brazilian
Tussato Giuliano Kotinda, pushed out by No. 69-ranked Ohnowaka.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Singapore man quits job to travel to World Cup finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Faced with the choice of keeping his job or
watching the World Cup finals in person, a Singapore man didn't
hesitate.
	   He chose the game.
	   Larry Wee, a 30-year-old tour operator, won two tickets for the
World Cup finals from a Singapore television station last month _
but couldn't get permission from his new employer to take off four
days.
	   So he quit.
	   ``This is a once in a lifetime'' chance, the diehard fan of the
Brazilian national team told The New Paper, which published his
story on Saturday.
	   Wee made the choice despite rising unemployment, dwindling job
openings and falling salaries in Singapore, which has suffered from
the economic slowdown in Southeast Asia.
	   And what did his wife say? She supported his decision.
	   ``It didn't take us long to decide... a couple of days,'' Helena
Lim told the newspaper.
	   ``And I'm not worried about him not getting another job.''

Swiss realize they may wind up paying in Holocaust dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ After 3 1/2 years of international arm-twisting in
the debate over assets owed to Holocaust victims, the Swiss are
angry, worried and weary over new sanction threats from the United
States.
	   From the diplomatic center of Geneva to the financial capital of
Zurich, many Swiss, including some Jews, are crying foul.
	   ``It's shameless that they are trying to declare economic war on
Switzerland, which bears no responsibility for the Holocaust,''
said Sigi Feigel, president-emeritus of the Jewish Community in
Zurich.
	   In 1996, Switzerland's then-president, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz,
was accused of anti-Semitism after he labeled as ``blackmail''
Jewish demands for a dlrs 250 million Holocaust compensation fund.
Now that term is being used by a wide spectrum of the Swiss public.
	   At a July 1 meeting in New York, American city and state finance
officials moved toward imposing sanctions on Switzerland's two
largest commercial banks and later on the whole country. The
officials supported U.S.-based Jewish groups that rejected a dlrs
600 million offer from the banks to settle claims to dormant
Holocaust-era accounts.
	   Swiss people interviewed by The Associated Press said it was
right for Switzerland to pay back assets of Holocaust victims as
well as help needy survivors of Nazi atrocities.
	   But they said their small neutral country, which was surrounded
by the armies of Nazi Germany and its allies during World War II,
today is being unfairly tied to Nazi atrocities.
	   ``Now we are the victim,'' said Annette Keller, 57, a program
manager for an environmental organization.
	   She said the wry humor of a recent newspaper cartoon sums up her
anxieties about the dispute. It pictured a Switzerland reduced to
one mountain, one lake and one farmer milking a cow, but ridiculed
the man for taking pleasure in at least protecting his own nest egg
_ a few Swiss francs in a sock.
	   Patrick Brutsch, a 36-year-old security expert, said pressures
by foreigners are getting ``more threatening.''
	   ``If instead of dlrs 1.5 billion you say, `OK, from every house
we're going to take 1,000 francs (dlrs 670),' then suddenly people
get concerned,'' he said.
	   A letter writer to the newspaper Le Temps in Geneva said the
United States is ignoring its own period of neutrality during the
first two years of World War II.
	   ``If the Americans really wanted to stop the Nazis, they could
have joined the Allies in 1939,'' wrote Mike Sale of La
Chaux-de-Fonds. ``But they didn't do it. They even continued to
invest in Nazi Germany until 1941.''
	   Keller said she and her friends think the United States wouldn't
be making such threats if Switzerland were in the European Union
because that would mean taking on a powerful bloc.
	   ``It seems so unfair to just boycott one country,'' Keller said.
``Why us and not France and other countries? Why only us?''
	   The Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce has condemned the
sanctions threat, and the Swiss government is considering a
complaint to the World Trade Organization.
	   The weekly newspaper Weltwoche, which devoted four full pages to
``Switzerland under pressure'' on Thursday, said business leaders
think more is needed.
	   One idea is aiming a lobbying campaign at governors of each
American state where large Swiss companies have invested billions
of dollars. That might help to head off an economic and trade war,
the paper said.
	   In a national poll a week ago, the Swiss surveyed overwhelmingly
rejected having their country retaliate with sanctions of its own
against U.S. businesses.
	   But a group of bank stockholders, who contend the value of their
investments is being unfairly damaged, announced it would sue New
York City and state if they imposed sanctions.
	   Tensions have been building between foreign Jewish organizations
and Switzerland since 1995, when 50th anniversary observances of
the end of World War II renewed interest in the era's unfinished
business.
	   Switzerland was put in the spotlight by the decades of
difficulty many heirs of Holocaust victims have had in reclaiming
assets that their relatives succeeded in getting to Swiss banks
before they perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   The Swiss launched an effort to find dormant assets and return
them to rightful heirs, set up a fund to help needy Holocaust
victims and began a thorough review of newly released wartime
archives for an examination of Switzerland's dealings with the
Nazis.

Palestinians condition talks on Israeli acceptance of pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Rebuffing an appeal from the Clinton
administration, Palestinians say they will negotiate face-to-face
with Israel only if it accepts U.S. proposals for a West Bank
pullback.
	   ``The Palestinian side is fully ready to resume negotiations ...
at the moment the Israeli government announces its willingness to
negotiate and its acceptance of the American initiative,'' the
Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement after its Friday night
meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   On Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Israel and the Palestinians had to negotiate in order
to settle their own differences on the American pullback plan,
which has been widely reported but never formally unveiled.
	   The United States has been trying to win an Israeli agreement to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
Palestinians now fully or partly control 27 percent of it.
	   ``There is a limited amount that the United States or anyone can
do if the parties themselves do not talk with each other to resolve
the remaining difficult issues,'' Albright said.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, just back from
Washington, was evasive when asked about Albright's call for direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
	   ``We never said that the Americans should negotiate on our
behalf,'' he told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement on a mountaintop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
American pullback proposal, citing security concerns. He also says
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has failed to implement previous
agreements _ a position he repeated in an interview Friday night.
	   ``He already promised us that he'd fight terror, stop incitment,
decrease the Palestinian police force, stop murders, turn over
wanted _ all these things he said, he didn't do anything,'' he told
Israel's Channel Two.
	   Arafat accepted the American pullback proposal in January and
said he would not renegotiate the terms. He dispatched two senior
Palestinian negotiators to Washington last week at Albright's
request.
	   The Clinton administration has indicated it would reassess its
role as mediator in the talks if it saw no progress. Erekat said it
would be Israel's fault if the peace process dead-ends now.
	   ``This cannot go on this way,'' he said. ``The question is not
about percentages, but whether this Israeli government is willing
or capable of implementing (them).''

Indonesia to free political prisoners, but not East Timor leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia plans to release 90 more
political prisoners next week, but an East Timorese rebel commander
will not be among them, the justice minister said Saturday.
	   President B.J. Habibie has promised to free most of Indonesia's
200 political prisoners, jailed under his autocratic predecessor,
former President Suharto.
	   So far, 28 dissidents have been released on the orders of
Habibie, who also plans to enact sweeping democratic reforms and
hold elections next year.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Justice Minister Muladi
as saying 90 more would be released next week.
	   Habibie has said imprisoned guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao can
be freed as well, but only in return for international recognition
of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
	   ``The release of Xanana Gusmao has to be part of the whole
solution for East Timor,'' Muladi told The Associated Press at a
meeting of the ruling Golkar party.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it a year later.
	   The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments refuse
to recognize Indonesia's claim over the territory, which has
endured decades of guerrilla war and human rights abuse.
	   Next week, Jamsheed Marker, a special U.N. envoy on the East
Timor problem, is scheduled to visit Indonesia for talks. However,
it is unclear whether he will go ahead with a plan to visit East
Timor because of security concerns.
	   In recent weeks, two people were shot to death and others were
wounded after troops opened fire to quell pro and anti-Indonesian
demonstrations staged there during visits by foreign diplomats.

More killed in troubled South African province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ Just a day before President Nelson
Mandela was to help bury victims of a bar shooting, violence
continued Saturday in troubled KwaZulu-Natal province when five
people were found dead.
	   Police Superintendent Henry Budrham said the bodies of a
murdered mother and her baby were found overnight and three more
bodies were found Saturday morning. Details were not immediately
available.
	   On Sunday, Mandela was scheduled to attend the burial of some of
eight people who were killed on July 3 when masked gunmen burst
into a bar and opened fire.
	   Police were investigating whether the attack was linked to
conflicts between supporters of the governing African National
Congress and the opposition United Democratic Movement party.
	   Political violence in KwaZulu-Natal has claimed the lives of
more than 10,000 people in the last decade.
	   Supporters of another group, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party, have also been involved in attacks in the eastern
province.
	   With the latest attacks, 25 people have been killed in Richmond,
located 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the provincial capital of
Pietermaritzburg, since May.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to cut guerrilla supply
lines to Albania, Serbs launched a strong attack Saturday on a
suburb of Kosovo's second largest city, sending hundreds of
frightened civilians streaming from the area.
	   ``This is an all out attack,'' said a spokesman for the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Information Center. ``Residents are fleeing in
panic.''
	   The spokesman said Serb security forces began shelling the
village of Lodja, about three kilometers (2 miles) from Pec and
that shells were exploding at the rate of about one every minute.
	   Lodja is reputedly a key weapons smuggling point for the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia. Ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Serb sources had no report on the fighting. But reporters at the
scene confirmed the attack. One said by telephone that he could see
smoke rising from Lodja.

Far-right members form new political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Disgruntled far-right members have
formed a new political party, Dutch newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The National Party Netherlands claims to have 300 members who
were recruited from various existing extreme-right groups,
according to the national daily Trouw.
	   The party views immigration as a major problem and vows to fight
against crime. But the party is ``without hate,'' its leader Egbert
Peree, 73, was quoted as saying in the newspaper's weekend edition.
	   A representative from the National Party Netherlands was not
immediately available for comment.
	   A spokesman for the country's Anti-Fascism Action said he was
not surprised by the establishment of the new political party.
	   It was clear that many members of the country's main
extreme-right Nationalists Party were fed up with their leader Hans
Janmaat, Anti-Fascism Action spokesman P. Kraaijer told the
national news agency ANP.
	   Janmaat's party, which won three seats in parliament in 1994
with an anti-foreigner platform, lost all its seats earlier this
year during general elections in May.
	   Back in the early 1990s, asylum-seekers were pouring into the
country, and far-right parties gained political ground by blaming
immigrants for problems like unemployment and crime.
	   But as the economy boomed and the number of asylum-seekers
stabilized in recent years, these parties have been relegated to
the sidelines.
	   Their leaders have also been repeatedly fined for inciting
racial hatred.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia: earlier fighting.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Hundreds have been killed since Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February on Albanian separatists
who had been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   The Lodja attack appears part of a strategy to step up pressure
on supply lines which the KLA uses to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Yugoslav troops clashed with Albanian smugglers in at
least two locations southeast of Pec, killing at least four,
capturing two and seizing a large quantity of ammunition and
weapons, including anti-tank land mines.
	   A Yugoslav officer at the scene of one of the engagements said
it was the first time troops had captured such mines destined for
the rebels. KLA commanders have told reporters that tanks have
given Yugoslav troops a strong advantage in battles with the
lightly-armed rebels.
	   Meanwhile, Serb officials said police Friday raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in the Serb-controlled towns of Urosevac and
Kacanik, arresting 11 ethnic Albanians and seizing weapons and maps
of police and military facilities.
	   According to the report, 22 other suspected KLA members escaped.
Police accused them of staging three ``terrorist attacks'' in
recent weeks against police stations in the area, located south of
Pristina.
	   As part of the international campaign to end the violence,
France and Britain plan to introduce a resolution in the U.N.
Security Council threatening new sanctions unless Serb and ethnic
Albanian forces accept a cease-fire and agree to talks on
``substantial autonomy'' for Kosovo.
	   But the major powers oppose independence, fearing it could
trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
Albanian communities. The United States and European powers want
the KLA to accept the leadership of moderate politician Ibrahim
Rugova, who has disavowed violence.
	   But Rugova also supports independence, and on Friday he called
on Washington and the Europeans to back that call.
	   On Friday, a senior Austrian envoy, Albert Rohan, met separately
with Rugova and KLA officials to urge them to unite and enter peace
talks with Milosevic.
	   But Rohan told the Austrian newspaper Die Presse that Kosovo's
Albanian politicians were ``totally fragmented.'' Rohan said the
rebels showed no interest in negotiating anything short of full
independence.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained nine Chinese democracy
campaigners in a crackdown exiled dissidents said Saturday proves
U.S. President Bill Clinton left China without securing progress on
human rights.
	   The nine, mostly veterans of past democracy movements, have
tried to set up a political party to challenge the Communist
Party's monopoly on power. Their push coincided with Clinton's
China trip and his less confrontational appeals to Chinese leaders
to improve human rights.
	   Police began the wave of detentions Friday morning, taking Wu
Gaoxing from his home in eastern Zhejiang province's Taizhou city,
dissident groups in Hong Kong and the United States said.
	   Around 8 p.m. Friday, 250 kilometers (150 miles) to the
northwest in Hangzhou city, police swarmed over the home of Wang
Youcai and led away Wang, Wang Peijian and Cheng Fan and three
others _ all members of the China Democracy Party, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement said.
	   In separate raids on their Hangzhou homes, police took away Zhu
Yufu and Wang Donghai, the Information Center and the U.S.-based
Chinese Democratic Justice Party reported.
	   Police confiscated notebooks, tapes, at least one computer and
manifestos and literature for the China Democracy Party, according
to the groups.
	   Wang Youcai, Wang Peijian and one other dissident announced June
25, the start of Clinton's nine-day China tour, that they wanted to
set up the China Democracy Party and would register the group with
authorities as required by law.
	   Since then Wang Youcai, Zhu Yufu and another dissident were each
detained at least once before Friday's clampdown. They were
released with warnings to stop campaigning for the party, and
authorities have refused to register the group.
	   In reporting the detentions, the exiled groups criticized
Clinton's China policy as a failure. Clinton used his trip to try
to showcase a more modern, tolerant China to a skeptical American
public while cajoling Chinese leaders to allow more dissent.
	   ``This is equivalent to giving Clinton a box on the ears,'' the
Information Center said in a statement. It added that the
detentions ``prove Clinton returned home from his China tour
empty-handed.''
	   ``What we said about President Clinton's policy of constructive
engagement with China was accurate, that the Chinese government
will not work with the free world to improve human rights because
they are a brutal communist dictatorship,'' said Lian Shengde, a
student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in
1989 and now the head of the Washington-based Free China Movement.
	   Like Lian, most of the detained dissidents took part in the 1989
protest movement. Wang Youcai, Wang Peijian and Cheng Fan were
students in Beijing. Wang Donghai and Wu Gaoxing staged sympathy
protests in Hangzhou.
	   Wang Youcai spent four years in prison and Wang Donghai and Wu
Gaoxing three years in the nationwide crackdown that followed the
military's brutal quelling of the protests in Beijing.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center also reported that
dissident Fan Yiping, held since March, will be put on trial Monday
for helping prominent democracy campaigner Wang Xizhe flee China to
avoid arrest.

Six more transferred to custody of Rwanda tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Six more people have been transferred to
the tribunal hearing cases of those charged with involvement in the
1994 genocide in Rwanda, bringing to 31 the number in custody, the
body said Saturday.
	   Four men suspected of plotting the genocide, another already
under indictment and a former Rwandan military officer who
surrendered to the tribunal all arrived Friday in this northern
Tanzanian town where the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda sits.
	   The former officer, Maj. Bernard Ntuyahaga, was in charge of
logistics at the main military camp in the Rwandan capital, Kigali,
when the genocide began the night of April 6-7, 1994 and is
suspected of having transported 10 Belgian peacekeepers to the camp
where they were subsequently killed.
	   ``The Office of the Prosecutor believes that the Belgian
soldiers were massacred in his (Ntuyahaga's) presence, and he
failed to take any action to prevent these massacres,'' a statement
from the tribunal said.
	   Emmanuel Bagambiki, a former prefect of the southwestern
prefecture of Cyangugu, was indicted on charges of genocide and
crimes against humanity. He was arrested in Togo last month.
	   The other four suspects are Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of
the former Rwandan ruling MRND party; Edouard Karemera, former MRND
vice-president; Joseph Nzirorera, former secretary-general of the
MNRD and Omar Serushago, a businessman and leader of the
Interahamwe militia in northwestern Gisenyi prefecture. All four
had been living in West Africa.
	   The MRND (National Revolutionary Movement for Democracy and
Development) was set up as Rwanda's sole party by President Juvenal
Habyarimana in 1974, a year after he overthrew Gregoire Kayibanda.
All Rwandans were obliged to join.
	   The Hutu-dominated party grew increasingly extreme and refused
to countenance the return of hundreds of thousands of minority
Tutsi exiles.
	   The shooting down of Habyarimana's plane by yet-to-be-identified
gunners on April 6, 1994 was the spark that set off the 90-day orgy
of killing in which at least half a million people died. Most of
the victims were Tutsis. But a number of moderate Hutus who favored
a power-sharing agreement with Tutsi rebels were also slaughtered.

Ko stays on top in Toyo Suisan Ladies Hokkaido
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITA-HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Overnight leader Ko Woo-soon
overcame the occasional rain and fired a 2-under-par 70 Saturday to
extend her lead to three strokes after two rounds in the 54-hole
Toyo Suisan Ladies Hokkaido.
	   Ko, a South Korean regular on the Japan tour, made a
birdie-birdie start and sank two more birdies on the front nine.
	   But the 34-year-old, in contention for her first victory of the
season and sixth overall in Japan, was off a little on her game and
bogeyed the 12th and the 17th holes on her return to the clubhouse.
	   The round left her at an 8-under 136 total, three strokes ahead
of Yuri Fudo, Tomiko Ikebuchi and Nayoko Yoshikawa.
	   ``I was planning to race away today by building a 5-stroke
lead,'' said Ko. ``Against my plan, however, I failed to score a
birdie on the par-5 16th and bogeyed the par-3 17th.''
	   ``I may have a good chance tomorrow if I can concentrate on my
play and shoot another 2-under 70,'' she said.
	   Ko has said she was inspired by her 20-year-old compatriot Se Ri
Pak's victory in the U.S. Women's Open in the playoff Monday.
	   Ikebuchi shot a 68, Fudo a 69 and Yoshikawa a 70.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in Britain and Ireland held 10 people
Saturday in connection with a thwarted bomb attack on the British
capital by IRA splinter groups opposed to the peace agreement in
Northern Ireland.
	   London came ``within minutes'' of a terrorist attack, said
Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland's
Yard's anti-terrorist branch. He did not give details about
possible targets or the number of devices discovered. Police in
London made their first arrests shortly before the evening
rush-hour Friday.
	   Scotland Yard said it would not release further details on
Saturday, and would not identify the four men and two women being
questioned in London. They are being held under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act, which permits police to hold them for seven days
without charge.
	   Irish police said they could hold the four people arrested in
the Irish cities of Dublin, Dundalk and Wexford, for 48 hours
without charge. None has been identified.
	   Police have warned that factions opposed to cease-fires by
Northern Ireland's major paramilitary groups, including the Irish
Republican Army, continue to threaten the April peace agreement.
The IRA was founded in 1969 to abolish Northern Ireland as a
British province and unite it with the Irish Republic.
	   The Irish police operation, which had been under way for months,
targeted hard-line organizations determined to foil the peace
accord. Information uncovered during the Irish arrests prompted
Irish police to contact their British counterparts and led to the
anti-terrorist branch action in London.
	   Grieve said the arrests thwarted an ``imminent planned terrorist
attack in London.''
	   He said three men arrested near university buildings in the
capital had explosive devices, and ``we believe these terrorist
devices were intended to be used in London within minutes.''
	   Officers later arrested a woman near Oxford Street, one of
London's busiest shopping districts, and a man and a woman near the
new British Library near King's Cross railway station, Scotland
Yard said.
	   No shots were fired, and no one was injured during the
operation.
	   Witnesses to Friday's arrests near university buildings south of
the River Thames said police arrested two men within yards (meters)
of each other outside a supermarket.
	   ``I saw them yell at a studenty-looking man, who was carrying a
rucksack, `Put the bag on the floor!' When he did that, they
shouted `Get down on the floor! Get down on the floor!''' said
Ann-Marie Wholey, 14. ``I stayed watching for what seemed like a
few minutes. I just couldn't move. Then one of the men with a gun
turned round and said `Get down the street, just move, move.'''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, congratulated police Friday after the arrests. Ahern
said his government ``will continue to underpin the peace process
by tackling the terrorist threat from whatever source.''
	   IRA dissidents have rejected the peace agreement, even though
the IRA called a truce in July 1997 and its allied Sinn Fein party
was one of eight political parties that joined in negotiations with
the British and Irish governments to forge the accord.
	   The agreement, ratified by voters in May, set up a new
provincial assembly with power to be shared between Protestants and
Roman Catholics.
	   IRA dissidents have said they will settle for nothing short of a
union between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   They have attacked mainly in Northern Ireland, although Irish
police in April intercepted a car packed with explosives just
before it was to board a ferry to Britain.
	   Before it agreed to a truce, the IRA had often struck in London
_ sometimes with small explosives or incendiary devices and
occasionally with larger, more devastating bombs.
	   The group set off bombs at Hyde Park in 1982, Harrods department
store in 1983 and the London Stock Exchange in 1990. In 1991, a
mortar shell fired from an abandoned van exploded 50 feet (15
meters) behind 10 Downing St., the prime minister's office.
	   The IRA called a truce in 1994 but broke it in February 1996
with a bomb in London's Docklands business area. The blast killed
two men and wounded scores of people. The IRA blamed British delays
over peace talks for its reversion to violence.
	   The group resumed a cease-fire in July 1997 and has maintained
it since.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia: earlier fighting.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Hundreds have been killed since Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February on Albanian separatists
who had been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   The Lodja attack appears to be part of a strategy to increase
pressure on supply lines the KLA uses to smuggle weapons into
Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Yugoslav troops clashed with Albanian smugglers in at
least two locations southeast of Pec, killing at least four people,
capturing two and seizing a large quantity of ammunition and
weapons, including anti-tank land mines.
	   A Yugoslav officer at the scene of one of the engagements said
it was the first time troops had captured such mines destined for
the rebels. KLA commanders have told reporters that tanks have
given Yugoslav troops a strong advantage in battles with the
lightly-armed rebels.
	   Meanwhile, Serb officials said police raided suspected guerrilla
hideouts in the Serb-controlled towns of Urosevac and Kacanik on
Friday, arresting 11 ethnic Albanians and seizing weapons and maps
of police and military facilities.
	   According to the report, 22 other suspected KLA members escaped.
Police accused them of staging three ``terrorist attacks'' in
recent weeks against police stations in the area, located south of
Pristina.
	   As part of the international campaign to end the violence,
France and Britain plan to introduce a resolution in the U.N.
Security Council threatening new sanctions unless Serb and ethnic
Albanian forces accept a cease-fire and agree to talks on
``substantial autonomy'' for Kosovo.
	   But the major powers oppose independence for the contested
province, fearing it could trigger rebellions in other Balkan
countries with substantial Albanian communities. The United States
and European powers want the KLA to accept the leadership of
moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova, who has disavowed violence.
	   But Rugova also supports independence, and on Friday he called
on Washington and the Europeans to back that call.
	   On Friday, a senior Austrian envoy, Albert Rohan, met separately
with Rugova and KLA officials to urge them to unite and enter peace
talks with Milosevic.
	   But Rohan told the Austrian newspaper Die Presse that Kosovo's
Albanian politicians were ``totally fragmented.'' Rohan said the
rebels showed no interest in negotiating anything short of full
independence.

Chechens believe British captives in Ingushetia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen authorities believe that two Britons
kidnapped a more than a year ago are probably being held in
neighboring Ingushetia, a news agency said Saturday.
	   Magomed Magomadov, the Chechen deputy prosecutor general, told
the ITAR-Tass news agency that the latest tips indicated that the
abductors of charity workers Camilla Carr and Jon James had moved
them to Ingushetia.
	   The British couple, seized on July 4, 1997, were on a charitable
mission in Chechnya with a Quaker affiliate, the Center for
Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has offered a dlrs 100,000
reward for information leading to their release.
	   Magomadov said he believed that the two Britons were taken to
Ingushetia along with two abducted Hungarians, Istvan Olah and
Gabor Dunaiski.
	   Since its 1994-96 war to secede from Russia, Chechnya has been
plagued by soaring crime, including a wave of kidnapping of
Russians and foreigners motivated by ransom.
	   About 60 abduction victims are in captivity, including the main
Russian envoy to the region.

Zoo bear kills four-year-old girl

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A bear in a zoo in southern Iran pulled a
four-year-old girl into its cage and killed her, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
	   Samira Ahmadi and her 16-year-old brother, Dariush, were walking
past the cage when the bear pulled her in through the food slot,
the agency reported.
	   Workers at the zoo in the city of Hormozgan were unable to force

Brazil faces France in the dream final of World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ It's the dream final.
	   Brazil and France, soccer's royalty and their gallant hosts,
duel on Sunday in the City of Lights for the glory of the biggest,
longest and most-watched World Cup in history.
	   After 31 days and 63 games, the record field of 32 countries has
been whittled to these two. The perennial champions and a
first-time finalist. The No. 1 offense and the top defense. The
hometown team and everybody else's favorite.
	   It's every bit the drama and pageantry the world expects from
the French, and a billion-something people around the planet are
expected to tune in to watch the last Cup of the century.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo, who has won four World Cups as a
player, coach or assistant, knows what this game means.
	   ``This is the biggest sporting event of the century,'' he said.
``We are representing the Americas, and we cannot let this chance
escape from our hands.''
	   If the Brazilians feel they belong here, the French have never
gotten past the semifinals. It's all a little heady.
	   ``We have to realize our adventure is not over yet,'' said coach
Aime Jacquet.
	   Jacquet's trump card is a stingy defense that has given up just
two goals in six games, the best in the Cup. But Laurent Blanc, a
bulwark of the back line, won't be there.
	   The Olympique Marseille defender was expelled and drew a
two-game suspension for pushing Croatia's Slaven Bilic in the face
in the semifinal. Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf will start alongside
Marcel Desailly and get the task of stopping Ronaldo, Bebeto and
company.
	   ``We have an anti-Ronaldo plan ready. It's called Marcel
Desailly,'' said French captain Didier Deschamps.
	   Jacquet also must find a solution for his punchless attack. A
French striker hasn't found the net since the first round _
defenders Blanc and Lilian Thuram did the all scoring as France
squeaked by Paraguay and Croatia.
	   The key is playmaker Zinedine Zidane. The Juventus attacker had
a so-so game against Croatia and must shine against Brazil,
unlocking the defense for Inter Milan striker Youri Djorkaeff, or
ir that fails, for himself.
	   For ``Zizou,'' as the French affectionately call him, the
underdog role suits France fine.
	   ``Brazil is the favorite. The whole world sees the Brazilians
winning against us. So much the better,'' he said.
	   Of course, the Brazilians see themselves winning, too. But they
also have something to prove.
	   Despite scoring 13 goals and showing flashes of greatness,
Brazil hasn't been the overwhelming force everyone expected. They
often played just well enough to get by, and the defense has shown
alarming lapses.
	   Ronaldo also is looking for consecration in his final game. The
two-time player of the year has been brilliant only in bursts, and
his four goals are below his potential.
	   ``I'll do anything to win. If it takes more sacrifice from me,
I'll do it,'' he said. ``Nothing and nobody will stand in our
way.''
	   The defense, which looked tenuous against Denmark and the
Netherlands, welcomes back Cafu after a one-game suspension. And
the team has renewed faith in goalie Taffarel, who saved two
penalty kicks in a tiebreaker shootout against the Dutch.
	   Zagallo feels the cliffhanger against the Dutch was a crucible
that steeled his team for the final.
	   ``In the end, nerves were on our side,'' he said. ``And against
France, nerves are on our side again.''
	   For Zagallo, tradition and experience are powerful allies in a
Cup final. Brazilians call it ``the jersey,'' _ and they have it.
	   ``Never has Brazil gone in so certain of winning,'' he said.
``France is playing for the first time, and this is a heavy weight.
And they'll be facing the yellow-and-green, which makes it even
heavier.''
	   History might give the Brazilians some extra incentive. It was
the French that knocked them out of the 1986 Cup in Mexico in a
quarterfinal penalty shootout.
	   Team coordinator Zico, who missed a penalty in that fateful 1986
match, says the team has learned from past failures. He says Brazil
knows how and when to attack the French.
	   ``France was passive against Croatia,'' he said. ``Brazilian
soccer is different. When we come, we come to kill.''
	   Experience has taught Brazil not to beat itself, Zico said.
	   ``Our players must have the emotional control,'' he said. ``They
know that heart is important in a final, that you have to give more
than all you have.''

Palestinians condition talks on Israeli acceptance of pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Rebuffing an appeal from the United
States, Palestinians say they will negotiate face-to-face with
Israel only if it accepts U.S. proposals for a West Bank pullback.
	   ``The Palestinian side is fully ready to resume negotiations ...
at the moment the Israeli government announces its willingness to
negotiate and its acceptance of the American initiative,'' the
Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement after its Friday night
meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   On Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Israel and the Palestinians had to negotiate in order
to settle their own differences on the American pullback plan,
which has been widely reported but never formally unveiled.
	   The United States has been trying to win an Israeli agreement to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
Palestinians now control 27 percent of it either partly or in full.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   ``There is a limited amount that the United States or anyone can
do if the parties themselves do not talk with each other to resolve
the remaining difficult issues,'' Albright said.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, just back from
Washington, was evasive when asked about Albright's call for direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
	   ``We never said that the Americans should negotiate on our
behalf,'' he told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began building a new Jewish settlement on a
mountaintop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
American pullback proposal, citing security concerns. He also says
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has failed to put into effect
previous agreements _ a position he repeated in an interview Friday
night.
	   ``He already promised us that he'd fight terror, stop
incitement, decrease the Palestinian police force, stop murders,
turn over wanted _ all these things he said, he didn't do
anything,'' he told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Arafat accepted the U.S. pullback proposal in January and said
he would not renegotiate the terms. He dispatched two senior
Palestinian negotiators to Washington last week at Albright's
request.
	   The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has indicated
it would reassess its role as mediator in the talks if it saw no
progress. Erekat said it would be Israel's fault if the peace
process stops dead now.
	   ``This cannot go on this way,'' he said. ``The question is not
about percentages, but whether this Israeli government is willing
or capable of implementing (them).''

Fears of eruption increase after explosion rocks volcano
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with details of volcanic explosion

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Fears of eruption by Indonesia's most
active volcano heightened Saturday after it was shaken by a loud
explosion that spewed gray ash over a wide area, volcanologists
said.
	   There were no reports of injuries or damage, said volcanologist
Agus Sampurno.
	   Nevertheless authorities upgraded an alert around Mount Merapi
and called on 6,000 people living in seven villages on its slopes
to prepare for possible evacuation.
	   The explosion happened three days after lava and hot gases began
to pour out of the top of the volcano, which lies in the middle of
the island of Java, one of the world's most densely-populated
areas.
	   Residents said the blast rattled their homes before dawn
Saturday and could be heard 20 kilometers (12 miles) away.
	   Earlier hundreds of tremors were recorded from inside the
mountain, leading to fears that a major eruption could be possible
soon.
	   Authorities declared a stage-three alert _ the second-highest
warning in Indonesia's four-stage system _ around the peak, near
the city of Yogyakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   Gray volcanic ash fell over land to the east near the town of
Magelang, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) away from the mountain.
	   ``Activity decreased soon after the explosion but we are still
monitoring the situation,'' Agus said in a telephone interview.
	   Another volcanologist, Atje Purbawinata, said local government
authorities were preparing for the possibility of evacuating
villagers who live and farm on Merapi's fertile lower slopes.
	   ``Currently the situation is under control, but we continue to
pay close attention to the volcano's behavior every hour,'' Antara
quoted Purbawinata as saying.
	   The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain is the most active of 500
Indonesia volcanoes.
	   In 1994, a steam cloud flattened a village on Merapi's slopes,
killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning others.
	   In its most destructive eruption this century, Merapi killed
1,300 people in 1930.

Riots dissipate, body of Abiola brought to Lagos

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ After three days of rioting and violence,
Nigeria woke up to relative calm Saturday, but authorities feared
the anticipated funeral of the country's top political prisoner
could trigger a resurgence of anger.
	   The body of Moshood Abiola, who died Tuesday while still in
military custody, has been brought to Nigeria's commercial capital
of Lagos and now rests at his residence.
	   His family were still making preparations for a funeral.
	   Abiola's death triggered days of rioting and violence in Lagos
and elsewhere in southern Nigeria, where at least 55 people have
been killed and more than 400 arrested.
	   A team of foreign pathologists have completed an autopsy on
Abiola, which will help determine the cause of death. Nigeria's
ruling military junta says Abiola died of a heart attack, but the
opposition leader's family suspect foul play.
	   The results of the autopsy and that of another performed earlier
by the government were to be made public after Abiola's body is
buried.
	   The apparent winner of annulled presidential elections in 1993,
Abiola was jailed in 1994 after he was accused of treason by the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in early June.
	   Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was
preparing to release Abiola when he fell ill and died.
	   Outrage at Abiola's death while still in the hands of the
military has resulted in widescale violence, some of which has been
drawn up along ethnic lines.
	   Abiola, an immensely popular southern businessman from the
Yoruba clan posed a serious threat to the ruling military's
stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper echelons of power are
all controlled by conservative northern Muslims from the Hausa
clan.
	   Fearing an escalation in ethnic violence sparked by Abiola's
death, riot police continued to watch over the city's mosques on
Saturday.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through military rule, Hausa and closely
related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
	   Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from
their Hausa and Fulani compatriots, have long resented what they
consider the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other
minerals _ by northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas were discovered earlier in the week in
a predominantly Yoruba neighborhood, backing up fears of
inter-ethnic violence.
	   The military since Abacha's death on June 8 has been scrambling
to offer an olive branch. Abubakar has released a group of
political prisoners and promised to free the rest.
	   He also has vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to
civilian rule.

Albanian sources: Serbs launch heavy attack on Albanina stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to cut guerrilla supply
lines from neighboring Albania, Serbs launched a strong attack
Saturday on a suburb of Kosovo's second-largest city, sending
hundreds of frightened civilians streaming from the area.
	   ``This is an all-out attack,'' said a spokesman for the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Information Center. ``Residents are fleeing in
panic.''
	   The spokesman said Serb security forces began shelling the
village of Lodja, about three kilometers (two miles) from Pec and
that shells were exploding at the rate of about one every minute.
	   Lodja is reputedly a key weapons smuggling point for the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Serb sources had no report on the fighting. But reporters at the
scene confirmed the attack. One said by telephone that he could see
smoke rising from Lodja.
	   Reporters said Serb and Albanian civilians alike were fleeing
the area, jamming bus and gas stations to try to escape the
fighting. Mobs of angry Serb civilians were gathering in other
villages near Pec, one reporter said.
	   Pec, which is 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of the Albanian
border, has about 120,000 residents, most of them ethnic Albanians.
But the population has swelled in recent months as villagers
throughout the region have sought shelter from the fighting.
	   The offensive against Lodja was the second this week. The KLA
reported heavy losses when Serb forces shelled Lodja on Tuesday and
Wednesday. The Serb Media Center said two policemen were killed and
several wounded in the earlier fighting.
	   Hundreds have been killed since Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February on Albanian separatists
who had been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   The Lodja attack appears to be part of a strategy to increase
pressure on supply lines the KLA uses to smuggle weapons into
Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Yugoslav troops clashed with Albanian smugglers in at
least two locations southeast of Pec, killing at least four people,
capturing two and seizing a large quantity of ammunition and
weapons, including anti-tank land mines.
	   A Yugoslav officer at the scene of one of the engagements said
it was the first time troops had captured such mines destined for
the rebels. KLA commanders have told reporters that tanks have
given Yugoslav troops a strong advantage in battles with the
lightly-armed rebels.
	   Meanwhile, Serb officials said police raided suspected guerrilla
hideouts in the Serb-controlled towns of Urosevac and Kacanik on
Friday, arresting 11 ethnic Albanians and seizing weapons and maps
of police and military facilities.
	   As part of the international campaign to end the violence,
France and Britain plan to introduce a resolution in the U.N.
Security Council threatening new sanctions unless Serb and ethnic
Albanian forces accept a cease-fire and agree to talks on
``substantial autonomy'' for Kosovo.
	   But the major powers oppose independence for the contested
province, fearing it could trigger rebellions in other Balkan
countries with substantial Albanian communities. The United States
and European powers want the KLA to accept the leadership of
moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova, who has disavowed violence.
	   But Rugova also supports independence, and on Friday he called
on Washington and the Europeans to back that call.
	   On Friday, a senior Austrian envoy, Albert Rohan, met separately
with Rugova and KLA officials to urge them to unite and enter peace
talks with Milosevic.
	   Rohan told the Austrian newspaper Die Presse that Kosovo's
rebels showed no interest in negotiating anything short of full
independence.

Marchers, Catholic opponents try talks to solve impasse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on contacts to arrange talks, 20 people
injured at Drumcree, one critically; edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents hope that talks Saturday will defuse the confrontation,
which has sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward
compromise.
	   At the main flashpoint in Portadown, police fired plastic
bullets Friday night at Protestant hard-liners who again tried to
break through barricades around the Drumcree Anglican church.
	   Twenty people were injured by the plastic bullets and seven
remained hospitalized Saturday, including a 26-year-old man in
critical condition at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, medical
authorities said.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic residents
of the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to talk in
Northern Ireland through intermediaries to try to find a durable
solution to a march that has sparked violence for a third summer.
	   But the start of the talks was delayed, and Blair's office said
efforts continued by telephone to find a venue and settle details.
	   ``The important thing is that we get the matter resolved in a
way that enables both sides to feel that their rights have been
vindicated,'' David Trimble, newly elected first minister of the
Northern Ireland Assembly and leader of the province's largest
Protestant party, told BBC Radio 4. ``We are dealing here with a
conflict of rights. There's right on both sides.''
	   The violent potential of Northern Ireland's ancient sectarian
hatreds has been evident in the disorders that broke out across the
province after Orange marchers were stopped Sunday by police and
soldiers.
	   In London and Ireland, police arrested 10 people and said they
had foiled plans by Irish Republican Army dissidents to attack
targets in the British capital.
	   The 4,000-strong crowd at the Drumcree Anglican church, where
the march was stopped, was substantially smadller on a cool and
rainy night Friday than the estimated 20,000-plus of the night
before. But again, hard-liners tried to break through barricades.
	   Using a grappling hook attached to a car, the crowd tried to
pull away the barbed wire on the barricade early Saturday. Police
reinforced their lines and officers took cover behind armored
vehicles. Protesters also threw bombs and shot at police, who fired
plastic bullets.
	   Later, three people were injured in a shooting in north Belfast,
and 18 were arrested after they broke away from the crowd in
Dumcree and attacked a house.
	   Both sides were cautious about the prospects of the indirect
talks, after the failure of similar contacts in the past two years.
	   ``For our part we would view this as a small first step toward
what we would hope would be face-to-face dialogue with the Orange
Order,'' said Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of the residents group.
	   The Orange Order said in a statement: ``It is our objective to
deliver the Portadown brethren safely on their return down the
Garvaghy Road. We intend to establish our inalienable rights and
freedom to express our culture.''
	   The Orange Order has refused any direct contact with the
residents group, because MacCionnaith is a former IRA prisoner. The
order insists it has a historic right to march on any public
highway.
	   In 1996, police and soldiers stopped the march but backed down
after four nights of Protestant violence across Northern Ireland.
Last year, police clubbed protesters off the road to let the
Orangemen through.
	   This year, Blair said he will enforce the decision of the new
Parades Commission that the Orangemen could not go down the
Garvaghy Road. The only way that part of the march could proceed,
Blair said, is through an agreement between marchers and residents.
	   Tensions are likely to peak this weekend with the 12th of July
holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the defeat of
Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia moved closer to democracy
Saturday when its biggest political organization overwhelmingly
elected a reformist as its new chairman over a rival linked to
former President Suharto.
	   The victory for State Secretary and Cabinet minister Akbar
Tanjung came at the end of a three-day special congress of the
ruling Golkar party.
	   Akbar's election, the first of its kind in Golkar's history,
will bolster the leadership of new President B.J. Habibie, who has
promised more democracy for the world's fourth most populous
nation.
	   Akbar, who won 17 out of the 27 votes cast, is a close Habibie
aide and was the president's personal choice for the party
chairmanship.
	   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
	   Suharto quit in May after violent protests erupted over lack of
political freedom and a crippling economic crisis.
	   During his 32 years in power, Suharto blatantly used Golkar to
dominate a largely symbolic form of parliamentary democracy that
legitimized his authoritarian rule.
	   Some have speculated that he had wanted to maintain his
influence within Golkar to protect his family's huge wealth from an
ongoing corruption investigation.
	   However, Saturday's ballot appears to have ended any chance of
that.
	   ``Suharto's power is now over politically,'' said Rizal Ramli,
an analyst with Econit, a Jakarta thinktank.
	   Although the party has millions of members and plenty of money,
doubts remain about its future as new parties are founded ahead of
next year's promised free elections.
	   Rival candidate Edy Sudradjat, a retired army general and a
former defense minister backed by supporters of Suharto, attracted
only 10 votes.
	   Golkar officials said they expected Akbar will quickly remove
many Suharto cronies from party positions, including two of
Suharto's six children who hold key jobs within the party.
	   A leadership council over which Suharto still wields influence
is also expected to be scrapped.
	   ``There is no place for the Suharto family in the new Golkar,''
said Sarwono Kusumaatmajda, a former environment minister who was
dumped from Suharto's old Cabinet earlier this year.
	   Saturday's ballot was the first time Golkar delegates were asked
to vote for a new party chief since the party was formed in 1964.
	   In the past chairmen were chosen by Suharto and a small group of
advisors and then endorsed by the party machine.
	   Analysts say Suharto's followers, many of them retired generals,
had wanted Sudradjat to win so they could impede change within
Golkar and slow down political reform to protect the positions they
gained under Suharto.
	   Akbar's victory followed a strong call for reform made by
Habibie in a speech to the congress on Thursday.

	   Also Saturday, the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore quoted a

the KLA would keep fighting if the KLA is excluded from peace talks
with the government.
	   ``If anybody holds talks with Serbia without our consultation,
we shall continue fighting,'' Jakup Krasniqi told the newspaper
Koha Ditore. ``And we are against any secret talks.''
	   A spokesman for the Kosovo Information Center, which is aligned
with ethnic Albanians, said Serb security forces were barraging the
village of Lodja, about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from Pec, with
shells that were exploding at the rate of about one a minute.

	   In the interview with the Albanian language newspaper, Krasniqi
rejected Rugova as a leader ``he has not fulfilled conditions to be
president of Kosovo...We need to free ourselves first and then form
political pluralism and later call for elections.''
	   Rugova also supports independence, and on Friday he called on
Washington and the Europeans to back that call.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government has filed a
complaint accusing the leading opposition party of having illegal
armed forces, the body charged with overseeing the country's
upcoming elections said Saturday.
	   The Ministry of Defense has written a letter to the National
Election Committee accusing Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party of having ``illegal troops,'' said committee spokesman Leng
Sochea. He did not say if the ministry had included any evidence
with its letter.
	   FUNCINPEC denied the allegation, which surfaced earlier this
week in comments from high-ranking government officials belonging
to the Cambodian People's Party of strongman Hun Sen. They extended
the accusation to prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, a political ally
of Ranariddh.
	   The defense minister hinted the government would not take action
before the election, fearing criticism of interference in the
polls.
	   ``Yes, it's true they are gathering troops, but we don't want to
say anything now because of the upcoming election,'' Defense
Minister Tea Banh told The Associated Press. ``Everyone knows that
FUNCINPEC has troops.''
	   Political parties are prohibited from having their own armies,
election committee spokesman Leng Sochea said at a weekly press
conference, but the election committee will take no action against
Ranariddh unless the government asks the body to investigate the
charges and ``there is a decision by the court.''
	   It is unclear whether the election committee could legally take
any action on the basis of such a complaint, but if criminal
charges were filed, they could be used to stymie FUNCINPEC's
election hopes.
	   With the court system loyal to Hun Sen's party, FUNCINPEC would
be hard-pressed to defend itself against any legal action, which
could include invalidating the results of the upcoming July 26
election should Ranariddh's party win.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who ousted the prince as his
co-premier in a bloody coup one year ago, called for elections to
proceed this year in an effort to win back legitimacy and aid after
his power grab.
	   After Ranariddh was deposed, the prince and two of his top
military aides were tried and convicted in a show trial of plotting
their own takeover. Ranariddh was granted an amnesty, allowing him
to return from exile to contest the July elections.
	   But the amnesty was not extended to his generals, Nhek Bunchhay
and Serei Kosal, who lead a small resistance force of the prince's
loyalists in northern Cambodia.
	   Peace talks aimed at reintegrating the prince's troops into the
Royal army have repeatedly failed, and the area of O'Smach along
the Thai border remains one of the few areas of Cambodia not under
the control of Hun Sen's government.
	   Ranariddh left for Bangkok on Saturday, a trip the prince's
aides said was previously scheduled.
	   ``We strongly deny these allegations,'' said Kong Vibol, a
member of the prince's cabinet, adding that while Nhek Bunchhay's
forces are loyal to the prince they are officially part of the
Royal army. ``FUNCINPEC has no illegal troops or armed forces.''
	   Meanwhile, ballot boxes and voting papers for the polls will be
delivered to 23 provinces by July 20, said Samraing Kamsan, an
advisor to election committee chairman Chheng Phon.
	   The election committee will deliver the supplies by car and
truck, and in remote areas by helicopter and even elephant, he
said.

Ethiopia rounds up more than 1,000 members of Eritrean party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has rounded up and plans
to deport more than 1,000 members of Eritrea's ruling party on
suspicion of spying for Asmara in the two-month border conflict
between the former allies in the Horn of Africa, the government
said Saturday.
	   ``All the Eritrean nationals who have been rounded up will be
deported, but they will be allowed to appoint agents to manage
their businesses and property,'' spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said.
``Their families will be allowed to stay in Ethiopia if they so
wish.''
	   Many of those rounded up are well-known businessmen who own
transport companies, garages, retail shops, bars and beauty
parlors.
	   Selome said the Ethiopians decided to move when the government
of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki ``started to reactivate its
party members for espionage and fund-raising activities for the
Eritrean war effort.''
	   The Eritrean People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the
successor to the rebel movement that fought Ethiopia for 30 years
to obtain independence, had an extensive network in Ethiopia.
	   Last month, the government closed down the EPFDJ's main office
and its leaders were among the 1,047 Eritreans deported.
	   The conflict over borders set by Italian colonizers in the early
20th century erupted May 6 when Eritreans moved into areas claimed
by Ethiopia. Both sides bombed each other over the weekend of June
5-7, causing at least 100 casualties on the Ethiopian side.
	   There has been no fighting reported for several weeks, but there
is a stalemate in efforts to bring both sides together to talk
peace.
	   Each side has begun to charge the other with abusing its
citizens.
	   Afwerki's Eritrean People's Liberation Front played key role in
helping the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
overthrow a 17-year military regime in 1991.
	   In recompense, EPRDF leader and now Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
gave the green light to Eritrean independence, a move strongly
opposed by the majority Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups. Meles is
from the northern Tigray region that borders Eritrea.
	   Selome said the International Committee of the Red Cross would
be allowed to visit the detainees before they are deported.
	   She said 400 Ethiopians deported from the Assab port area in
southern Eritrea have arrived in Djibouti. But she said the
whereabouts of another 600 Ethiopians picked up by the Eritrean
government remains unknown and the Red Cross has been denied access
to them.
	   George Cominos, the head of the ICRC in Ethiopia, said the Red
Cross has visited the 163 Eritrean prisoners of war being held at
Fitche, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Addis Ababa where
another 1,000 Eritrean military personnel and conscripts are also
held. Cominos said 664 of those had been registered.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met Saturday with his top
financial advisers and urged them to wind up talks with
international lenders on a financial bailout plan for Russia.
	   Yeltsin met at his country residence with Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadarnov, Central Bank Chairman
Sergei Dubinin and Anatoly Chubais, Russia's liaison with
international lenders.
	   Yeltsin was brought up to date on the latest talks with the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders, the Kremlin press
service said.
	   Yeltsin approved the negotiators' progress in talks with
international financial institutions ``and he instructed them to
complete the talks as soon as possible,'' the service said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   Russia is seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in loans
from the IMF and other lenders, including the World Bank.
	   The Kremlin and the IMF reached agreement on the majority of key
issues during talks between Chubais and IMF representative John
Odling-Smee that lasted into early Saturday morning, said Andrei
Trapeznikov, an aide to Chubais.
	   The discussion of a text on an agreement on additional financial
assistance from the IMF were to continue later Saturday, he said.
	   ``There is every reason to believe the final text of this
document will be coordinated within a few days,'' Trapeznikov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   On Friday, Yeltsin appealed directly to IMF head Michel
Camdessus by telephone, and pledged to put Russia's fiscal house in
order if the fund comes through with the loan.
	   ``The president of Russia emphasized his firm intention to use
all his strength to implement the suggested government measures,''
the Kremlin said in a statement.
	   Yeltsin also spoke to a series of Western leaders, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, asking them for support to help Russia
out of its economic crisis.
	   In addition to Clinton, Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac, all of whom voiced support for
Russia's anti-crisis economic program, the Kremlin said.
	   The Russian economy was beginning to show signs of growth when
it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, and a drop in
world oil prices.

In first for China, TV offers nation glimpse of trial

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a first for China, state-run television beamed
a live court trial nationwide Saturday, bringing a touch of
openness to the nation's spotty, corrupt and opaque legal system.
	   Under the hot glare of TV lights, attorneys for ten major
Chinese film studios argued for over a million yuan (dlrs 120,000)
in damages and fees from three companies for violating sales and
distribution contracts on video discs of 27 well-known feature
films.
	   Riveting television it wasn't. The attorneys exhibited little of
the media savvy displayed in high-profile U.S. trials. Seated
behind high brown desks, they read lengthy statements with only
quick glances from their papers. Their largely technical arguments
centered on interpretations of copyright and contract laws.
	   But the 4 1/2-hour broadcast marked significant, if slight
progress in transforming Chinese courts from instruments of state
power to arbiters of the law and encouraged public scrutiny of the
courts.
	   ``This is an attempt by Chinese legal officials to make the
judicial system more transparent and thereby more accountable to
people and the plaintiffs,'' said Phyllis Chang, a legal expert for
the U.S.-based Ford Foundation who advises Chinese lawyers.
	   The broadcast followed on the heels of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's nine-day barnstorming of China. He praised Chinese
efforts to build a fairer, more modern legal system and offered
U.S. assistance to train judges and improve civil liberties laws.
	   Credit for the progress belongs to the Chinese government, not
Clinton. Two decades of fitful, plodding progress has quickened.
Since March, Supreme People's Court President Xiao Yang has ordered
most trials open to news coverage. Beijing this month opened
proceedings at one court to ordinary citizens.
	   ``If all court proceedings were so open and so transparent, then
the bad, mediocre judgments of all courts would be, if not
eliminated, then reduced,'' said Ma Shijie, a retired worker
watching Saturday's broadcast while eating breakfast in a Beijing
restaurant.
	   The broadcast was the first time a trial aired live nationwide,
although 20 local television stations have carried cases in whole
or part before, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Despite the seemingly arcane offering of an intellectual
property dispute as legal lesson, the court case was partly made
for television. The suit involved famous movies from the 1950s on
known to almost all Chinese. China Central Television, the premier
government-run network, showed clips from the movies and offered
expert commentary to explain the issues.
	   Proceedings at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court
were by the book. Three judges in light blue military-style
uniforms sat behind a raised desk in front of the state seal.
Attorneys argued from their seats to the side. There was no jury.
	   Chief Judge Sun Jian delivered a mixed verdict. She called for
more evidence gathering on complaints by four of the film studies,
but ordered the defendants _ a copyright house and two video disc
distributors _ to pay 480,000 yuan (dlrs 58,000) in damages to the
other six and print a public apology in the Legal Daily newspaper.
	   If dry, the coverage emphasized the rights of both sides and the
judges' role in weighing arguments. In the past, high-profile court
cases of criminals and political dissidents stressed the authority
of the communist government.
	   Legal-change advocates hope open court proceedings and TV
broadcasts will reform a substandard and corrupt judiciary that is
undermining confidence in the budding legal system. Tales are
legion of plaintiffs and defendants wining and dining court
officers.
	   ``This was a measure to oppose corruption,'' said Cai Dingjian,
a legal expert for China's national legislature. ``In the past when
trials weren't open, they've been subjected to behind-the-scenes
bargaining.''
	   Demystification of court proceedings only went so far. Cai
believed the government chose an intellectual property case because
the arguments were complicated, unlike a criminal case where
``everybody would be able to judge.''
	   A business case also underscores China's more complete code of
commercial laws, in contrast to incomplete and often unenforced
human rights protections. On Friday, at least six dissidents were
detained in eastern Hangzhou, apparently for trying to form and
legally register an opposition political party.
	   ``This is all a performance put on to make people feel good,''
said Li Ping, a private businessman from Sichuan province. He
ignored the broadcast while eating breakfast in a Beijing
restaurant.
	   Legal experts also cautioned that the broadcast was only ``a
first step.'' Pre-trial procedures, appeals, evidence gathering and
access for lawyers all need to be improved.
	   ``What needs to be done is to not only open courts to occasional
filming, but to open them completely to the Chinese public,'' said
Chang, the Ford Foundation expert.

World Cup: On eve of finale, chief organizer filled with praise,
</HEADLINE>
emotion &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ He played with passion, and a decade later Michel
Platini used the same fiery presence to organize the World Cup. On
Saturday, that emotion spilled over as he recalled golden moments
and a departed friend.
	   As 60 million French citizens eagerly awaited Sunday's
championship match against Brazil, their greatest soccer hero said
he was happy to be one of them for bringing off the world's biggest
single sports event in a joyful atmosphere.
	   Then Platini cried, not for the passing of his youth or the end
of a job that has consumed him for six years. His tears were for
Fernand Sastre, the father of this very French World Cup, who died
on the eve of play after a long battle with cancer.
	   ``I'm very proud,'' Platini said. ``And Fernand is looking at us
from above, and probably very proud as well.''
	   Heavier now, a chainsmoker away from the cameras, Platini still
has the curly black hair that marked him on the field, although
it's a bit thinner on top than when he was captain of World Cup
semifinal teams in 1982 and 1986.
	   That second Cup featured another meeting between France and
Brazil, in the quarterfinals in Guadalajara, Mexico, and France won
4-3 in a shootout after a 1-1 tie through overtime. Platini scored
the French goal on a very special day.
	   ``I have great memories,'' he said, the tears for Sastre now
stopped and his dark eyes flashing. ``It was my birthday, and we
beat Brazil. And I scored my last goal for the national team.''
	   As co-presidents of France 98, Platini and Sastre secured
government financial guarantees that helped bring the tournament
here, then organized an event that came off in true French form _
cutting-edge technology, stylish appearance, a little arrogance
around the edge.
	   At a news conference to mark the winding down of the biggest
World Cup yet, Platini and officials from French and international
soccer bodies acknowledged again that the event had been marred by
ticket scandals and street violence in Marseille and Lens.
	   French prosecutors are investigating several cases of brokers
and tour operators defrauding visiting fans, who were left without
game tickets far from home. In Lens, a northern industrial town, a
policeman remains in a coma after German neo-Nazis bashed his head
in with an iron bar after the Germany-Yugoslavia match.
	   No problems were reported in or around the stadiums, though, and
the games produced exciting soccer before enthusiastic sellout
crowds, with no major glitches.
	   ``I've had a very easy task,'' said Lennart Johansson, head of
FIFA's World Cup organizing panel. ``Almost everything went
perfectly well.''
	   Claude Simonet, president of the French soccer federation and
the official host of the tournament, said the success of the
organizers was heightened by the success of the host team. France
invented the World Cup 70 years ago, but this is the first time
it's playing for the title.
	   ``I wouldn't only want my team to win the World Cup. That's not
the objective,'' Simonet said. ``We showed we were up to the event.
We have added a glorious page to French football.''
	   ``We've enjoyed our stay,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter said.
``We'll be back.''
	   Platini, who campaigned hard for Blatter in the presidential
race against Johansson and is expected to take a high-level job in
soccer's new administration, said his country had come through.
	   And the unified response of a nation beset with racial problems
to a team of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds was
heartwarming, he said.
	   ``We don't wait for the World Cup to fight racism and xenophobia
in soccer,'' Platini said. ``The players may be from different
backgrounds, but they all sweat the same sweat, laugh when they win
and cry the same tears when they lose.
	   ``I'm very proud to be a Frenchman. I think France can achieve
great things.''

Big party elects reformer as Indonesia moves closer to democracy

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia moved closer to democracy
Saturday when its biggest political organization overwhelmingly
elected a reformist as its new chairman over a rival linked to
former President Suharto.
	   The victory for State Secretary and Cabinet minister Akbar
Tanjung came at the end of a three-day special congress of the
ruling Golkar party.
	   Akbar's election, the first of its kind in Golkar's history,
will bolster the leadership of new President B.J. Habibie, who has
promised more democracy for the world's fourth most populous
nation.
	   Akbar, who won 17 out of the 27 votes cast, is a close Habibie
aide and was the president's personal choice for the party
chairmanship.
	   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
	   Suharto quit in May after violent protests erupted over lack of
	   political freedom and a crippling economic crisis.
	   During his 32 years in power, Suharto blatantly used Golkar to
dominate a largely symbolic form of parliamentary democracy that
legitimized his authoritarian rule.
	   Some have speculated that he had wanted to maintain his
influence within Golkar to protect his family's huge wealth from an
ongoing corruption investigation.
	   However, Saturday's ballot appears to have ended any chance of
that.
	   ``Suharto's power is now over politically,'' said Rizal Ramli,
an analyst with Econit, a Jakarta thinktank.
	   Although the party has millions of members and plenty of money,
doubts remain about its future as new parties are founded ahead of
next year's promised free elections.
	   Rival candidate Edy Sudradjat, a retired army general and a
former defense minister backed by supporters of Suharto, attracted
only 10 votes.
	   Golkar officials said they expected Akbar will quickly remove
many Suharto cronies from party positions, including two of
Suharto's six children who hold key jobs within the party.
	   A leadership council over which Suharto still wields influence
is also expected to be scrapped.
	   ``There is no place for the Suharto family in the new Golkar,''
said Sarwono Kusumaatmajda, a former environment minister who was
dumped from Suharto's old Cabinet earlier this year.
	   Saturday's ballot was the first time Golkar delegates were asked
to vote for a new party chief since the party was formed in 1964.
	   In the past chairmen were chosen by Suharto and a small group of
advisors and then endorsed by the party machine.
	   Analysts say Suharto's followers, many of them retired generals,
had wanted Sudradjat to win so they could impede change within
Golkar and slow down political reform to protect the positions they
gained under Suharto.
	   Akbar's victory followed a strong call for reform made by
Habibie in a speech to the congress on Thursday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met Saturday with his top
financial advisers and urged them to wind up talks with
international lenders on a financial bailout plan for Russia.
	   Yeltsin met at his country residence with Prime Minister Sergei

Odling-Smee that lasted into early Saturday morning, said Andrei
Trapeznikov, an aide to Chubais.
	   The discussion of a text on an agreement on additional financial
assistance from the IMF were to continue later Saturday, he said.
	   ``There is every reason to believe the final text of this
document will be coordinated within a few days,'' Trapeznikov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   On Friday, Yeltsin appealed directly to IMF head Michel
Camdessus by telephone, and pledged to put Russia's fiscal house in
order if the fund comes through with the loan.
	   ``The president of Russia emphasized his firm intention to use
all his strength to implement the suggested government measures,''
the Kremlin said in a statement.
	   Yeltsin also spoke to a series of Western leaders, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, asking them for support to help Russia
out of its economic crisis.
	   In addition to Clinton, Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac, all of whom voiced support for
Russia's anti-crisis economic program, the Kremlin said.
	   The Russian economy was beginning to show signs of growth when
it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, and a drop in
world oil prices.

Reactor shut down at Ukraine's Yuzhnaya nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Reactor No. 6 at the Yuzhnaya nuclear power
plant in southern Ukraine was shut down for repairs, officials said
Saturday.
	   The reactor was shut down late Friday because of water leaks in
one of its sections and will be undergoing repairs until the end of
next week, according to the state nuclear energy company
Energoatom.
	   There were no radiation leaks, said Energoatom. Two other
reactors at the Yuzhnaya plant, Ukraine's second-largest, are
currently shut down for planned repairs.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear plants account for more than 40 percent
of the former Soviet republic's electricity production.

Ethiopia rounds up more than 1,000 members of Eritrean party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator &QL; 
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has rounded up and plans
to deport more than 1,000 members of Eritrea's ruling party on
suspicion of spying for Asmara in the two-month border conflict
between the former allies in the Horn of Africa, the government
said Saturday.
	   ``All the Eritrean nationals who have been rounded up will be
deported, but they will be allowed to appoint agents to manage
their businesses and property,'' spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said.
``Their families will be allowed to stay in Ethiopia if they so
wish.''
	   Many of those rounded up are well-known businessmen who own
transport companies, garages, retail shops, bars and beauty
parlors.
	   Selome said the Ethiopians decided to move when the government
of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki ``started to reactivate its
party members for espionage and fund-raising activities for the
Eritrean war effort.''
	   The Eritrean People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the
successor to the rebel movement that fought Ethiopia for 30 years
to obtain independence, had an extensive network in Ethiopia.
	   Last month, the government closed down the EPFDJ's main office
and its leaders were among the 1,047 Eritreans deported.
	   The conflict over borders set by Italian colonizers in the early
20th century erupted May 6 when Eritreans moved into areas claimed
by Ethiopia. Both sides bombed each other over the weekend of June
5-7, causing at least 100 casualties on the Ethiopian side.
	   There has been no fighting reported for several weeks, but there
is a stalemate in efforts to bring both sides together to talk
peace.
	   Each side has begun to charge the other with abusing its
citizens.
	   Afwerki's Eritrean People's Liberation Front played key role in
helping the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
overthrow a 17-year military regime in 1991.
	   In recompense, EPRDF leader and now Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
gave the green light to Eritrean independence, a move strongly
opposed by the majority Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups. Meles is
from the northern Tigray region that borders Eritrea.
	   Selome said the International Committee of the Red Cross would
be allowed to visit the detainees before they are deported.
	   She said 400 Ethiopians deported from the Assab port area in
southern Eritrea have arrived in Djibouti. But she said the
whereabouts of another 600 Ethiopians picked up by the Eritrean
government remains unknown and the Red Cross has been denied access
to them.
	   George Cominos, the head of the ICRC in Ethiopia, said the Red
Cross has visited the 163 Eritrean prisoners of war being held at
Fitche, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Addis Ababa where
another 1,000 Eritrean military personnel and conscripts are also
held. Cominos said 664 of those had been registered.

Brazil faces France in the dream final of World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to change dateline to AP style &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's the dream final.
	   Brazil and France, soccer's royalty and their gallant hosts,
duel on Sunday in the City of Lights for the glory of the biggest,
longest and most-watched World Cup in history.
	   After 31 days and 63 games, the record field of 32 countries has
been whittled to these two. The perennial champions and a
first-time finalist. The No. 1 offense and the top defense. The
hometown team and everybody else's favorite.
	   It's every bit the drama and pageantry the world expects from
the French, and a billion-something people around the planet are
expected to tune in to watch the last Cup of the century.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo, who has won four World Cups as a
player, coach or assistant, knows what this game means.
	   ``This is the biggest sporting event of the century,'' he said.
``We are representing the Americas, and we cannot let this chance
escape from our hands.''
	   If the Brazilians feel they belong here, the French have never
gotten past the semifinals. It's all a little heady.
	   ``We have to realize our adventure is not over yet,'' said coach
Aime Jacquet.
	   Jacquet's trump card is a stingy defense that has given up just
two goals in six games, the best in the Cup. But Laurent Blanc, a
bulwark of the back line, won't be there.
	   The Olympique Marseille defender was expelled and drew a
two-game suspension for pushing Croatia's Slaven Bilic in the face
in the semifinal. Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf will start alongside
Marcel Desailly and get the task of stopping Ronaldo, Bebeto and
company.
	   ``We have an anti-Ronaldo plan ready. It's called Marcel
Desailly,'' said French captain Didier Deschamps.
	   Jacquet also must find a solution for his punchless attack. A
French striker hasn't found the net since the first round _
defenders Blanc and Lilian Thuram did the all scoring as France
squeaked by Paraguay, Italy and Croatia.
	   The key is playmaker Zinedine Zidane. The Juventus attacker had
a so-so game against Croatia and must shine against Brazil,
unlocking the defense for Inter Milan striker Youri Djorkaeff, or
ir that fails, for himself.
	   For ``Zizou,'' as the French affectionately call him, the
underdog role suits France fine.
	   ``Brazil is the favorite. The whole world sees the Brazilians
winning against us. So much the better,'' he said.
	   Of course, the Brazilians see themselves winning, too. But they
also have something to prove.
	   Despite scoring 13 goals and showing flashes of greatness,
Brazil hasn't been the overwhelming force everyone expected. They
often played just well enough to get by, and the defense has shown
alarming lapses.
	   Ronaldo also is looking for consecration in his final game. The
two-time player of the year has been brilliant only in bursts, and
his four goals are below his potential.
	   ``I'll do anything to win. If it takes more sacrifice from me,
I'll do it,'' he said. ``Nothing and nobody will stand in our
way.''
	   The defense, which looked tenuous against Denmark and the
Netherlands, welcomes back Cafu after a one-game suspension. And
the team has renewed faith in goalie Taffarel, who saved two
penalty kicks in a tiebreaker shootout against the Dutch.
	   Zagallo feels the cliffhanger against the Dutch was a crucible
that steeled his team for the final.
	   ``In the end, nerves were on our side,'' he said. ``And against
France, nerves are on our side again.''
	   For Zagallo, tradition and experience are powerful allies in a
Cup final. Brazilians call it ``the jersey,'' _ and they have it.
	   ``Never has Brazil gone in so certain of winning,'' he said.
``France is playing for the first time, and this is a heavy weight.
And they'll be facing the yellow-and-green, which makes it even
heavier.''
	   History might give the Brazilians some extra incentive. It was
the French that knocked them out of the 1986 Cup in Mexico in a
quarterfinal penalty shootout.
	   Team coordinator Zico, who missed a penalty in that fateful 1986
match, says the team has learned from past failures. He says Brazil
knows how and when to attack the French.
	   ``France was passive against Croatia,'' he said. ``Brazilian
soccer is different. When we come, we come to kill.''
	   Experience has taught Brazil not to beat itself, Zico said.
	   ``Our players must have the emotional control,'' he said. ``They
know that heart is important in a final, that you have to give more
than all you have.''

Police investigate alleged doping link to Festina team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Hours before Saturday's start of the 85th
Tour de France, an employee of the French team Festina was behind
bars while police investigated whether drugs found in his team car
were destined for the cyclists.
	   The man, not identified by name but said to be a health
specialist for the team, was arrested Thursday by customs officials
at the French-Belgian border, police said. He was driving a car
marked with the Festina colors.
	   Police sources said that several hundred grams of steroids were
found in the car. France Info radio said that 400 bottles of drugs
were seized.
	   The man has maintained that the drugs were for his personal use,
categorically denying they were destined for the team in the
grueling three-week race.
	   Festina, one of 21 teams riding in this year's Tour de France,
is among the favorites.
	   The Tour de France was starting in Dublin, Ireland, this year.

Australia wins rugby test against New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian fullback Matthew Burke
led his team to a 24-16 win over New Zealand with a record points
haul in a thrilling start to the tri-nations series Saturday.
	   Burke had a magnificent match, scoring all of the Wallabies
points from two tries, four penalties and a conversion, to end
Australia's run of seven straight losses against the All Blacks
stretching back to 1994.
	   It was a refreshingly tense and high quality match after the two
southern giants had played five tests between them this season for
easy wins over England and Scotland. Australia will play South
Africa in its second match in Perth next week.
	   Australia had the better of the early play against an unsettled
opponent and Burke had a chance to kick the hosts ahead in the
third minute following a lineout infringement, but his penalty
bounced back off a post.
	   After absorbing the pressure in the opening 20 minutes the All
Blacks started to send the ball wide through their exciting
backline and the move caught Australia out.
	   Winger Jeff Wilson crossed in the 20th minute after Christian
Cullen had cruised around Joe Roff and sent a kick infield, but the
try was denied because of a knock on.
	   Center Scott McLeod then busted through Australia's midfield
defense and captain Taine Randell crossed only to have the play
called up for a forward pass. New Zealand got a penalty for an
earlier Australian infringement and fly-half Andrew Mehrtens
converted it for the opening points on 22 minutes.
	   A minute later Mehrtens sliced through the defense and passed to
Wilson whose kick ahead was hurried into touch by Roff. The All
Blacks won the lineout and controlled the ball well before flanker
Josh Kronfeld took the ball in the maul and drove through the
fractured opposition for an 8-0 lead.
	   Mehrtens missed the conversion and the All Blacks then
momentarily lost the plot.
	   Burke kicked a penalty for 8-3 and then good Australian forward
play set the fullback up for a 15 meter unopposed run to the line
to level the score. Burke converted and then put Australia further
ahead in the 36th minute, completing his second try after a crucial
break from center Daniel Herbert.
	   Mehrtens gave the game another twist before the break when he
broke through to send Wilson down the right wing. Wilson was
gathered in near the line but turned a pass inside to send lock Ian
Jones across for a try and cut Australia's half-time lead to 15-13.
	   Burke kicked two further penalties in 12 minutes after the break
while Mehrtens, and then his replacement Carlos Spencer missed
regulation chances.
	   Spencer got a second chance and scored to cut Australia's lead
to 21-16 and All Blacks coach John Hart tried to lever the game
open by bringing 1995 World Cup star Jonah Lomu on as a replacement
for Joeli Vidiri.
	   Lomu had an immediate impact, running over the top of Larkham
and then handling twice in a threatening surge down the left that
Australia was lucky to clean up without suffering damage.
	   Burke's fourth penalty, coming 11 minutes from the end put
Australia ahead 24-16, restoring the margin of more than a
converted try.
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 24 (Matthew Burke 2 tries; Burke 1 goal, 4 penalty
goals) def. New Zealand 16 (Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones tries; Andrew
Mehrtens 1 penalty goal, Carlos Spencer 1 penalty goal).
	   Lineups:
	   Australia: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu (Willie
Ofahenguae), David Wilson, Matthew Cockbain, Tom Bowman, John Eales
(captain), Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns (Jeremy Paul), Richard Harry
(Dan Crowley).
	   New Zealand: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Scott McLeod (Andrew
Mehrtens), Walter Little, Joeli Vidiri (Jonah Lomu), Andrew
Mehrtens (Carlos Spencer), Justin Marshall, Taine Randell
(captain), Josh Kronfeld, Michael Jones (Isitolo Maka), Robin
Brooke, Ian Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd.

<TEXT>
	   ROUGEMONT, Switzerland (AP) _ Prince Nicholas Romanov shares the
name of Russia's last czar and heads what remains of the deposed
dynasty _ a loose network of distant cousins who often disagree
over what it means to be a Romanov.
	   Unlike some of those cousins, the prince expresses no nostalgia
for the days of the czars, who for three centuries ruled an empire
that covered one-sixth of the earth. To the contrary _ he is an
avowed republican, who says the last thing Russia needs now is a
monarchy. As a result, some of his cousins consider him almost a
leftist, a label that makes him smile.
	   ``I am not any `-ist', but I am a lover of history and I have
learned from it,'' he says.
	   The tall, French-born prince, 75, is a key adviser to Russian
officials preparing the July 17 funeral ceremonies for Czar
Nicholas II and his family. The royal family died 80 years ago,
murdered along with their physician and three servants by Bolshevik
zealots.
	   It was the prince who proposed that the entire group, from the
czar to the footman, be entombed together in the St. Peter and St.
Paul Cathedral where Romanov czars have been buried since Peter the
Great.
	   Romanov wants Friday's ceremony to be a ``signal of
forgiveness.''
	   ``The history of the new Russia, at peace with its past, should
truly begin on that day,'' he says.
	   At home in this alpine resort, the prince said arrangements for
the ceremony have kept him busy for more than three years. Phone
calls, faxes and piles of paper next to a laptop in his book-lined
studio showed his work was continuing up to the last minute.
	   Romanov says he is convinced that the remains exhumed in 1991
are those of the czar, his half-English wife, three daughters and
the four other victims.
	   Still missing are the remains of one daughter and the heir,
Alexei. Along with thousands of other victims of Soviet rule, all
were canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile, to
which Nicholas belonged.
	   He says he understands why the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow
has not yet made Nicholas II a saint, and accepts that Patriarch
Alexy II cannot attend the funeral for that reason.
	   ``They have to be prudent. Many Russians who have returned to
the faith still remember what they consider were positive aspects
of the Communist period,'' he said.
	   The two churches, bitter rivals in the Soviet period, are making
tentative steps toward reconciliation. But relations remain
prickly.
	   ``But I don't understand why my church is so adamantly against
the burial. They claim it would be a false signal. They are still
mentally fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks.''
	   A similar split exists among some branches of the exiled
dynasty. There are those who reviled the Soviet regime, consider
the current government its extension, and seek a restoration of the
monarchy. And there are those, like Romanov, who value their
family's legacy but believe their role in Russian history is over.
	   The split will be visible during the funeral. More than 50
Romanovs will be in attendance, coming from Europe, Australia and
the United States.
	   But others are refusing to attend. Most prominent among those is
Nicholas' cousin Maria Vladimirovna. She claims the title of grand
duchess, and says her son Georgy, 17, is the rightful heir to the
throne.
	   Her claim, supported by some monarchist groups inside Russia, is
disputed by the other branches of the Romanovs and the
authoritative Almanac de Gotha on European royal families.
	   Romanov says Maria Vladimirovna and her family will not attend.
``The Russians told her she was very welcome if she would come as a
member of the Romanov family and not as pretender to the throne,''
he explains.
	   Another cousin told Romanov that Maria Vladimirovna said she did
not want to be part of a deal with ``Bolsheviks'' unless they
``kneel and repent for their sins.''
	   In the end, he says, all Russians, whether at home or in exile,
should see the funeral as ``moment of repentance, understanding and
mutual pardon.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerians woke to relative calm Saturday
after three days of rioting and violence, but authorities feared
that the funeral of the country's top political prisoner could
trigger a resurgence of anger. The body of Moshood Abiola, who died
Tuesday in military custody, was brought to Nigeria's commercial
capital, Lagos, and lay at his residence in preparation for his
funeral. A team of foreign pathologists completed an autopsy on
Abiola to help determine the cause of death. Nigeria's ruling
military junta said Abiola died of a heart attack, but the
opposition leader's family suspected foul play. The results of the
autopsy and that of one performed earlier by the government were to
be made public after Abiola's burial. (NIGERIA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to cut guerrilla supply
lines from neighboring Albania, Serbs launched a fierce attack
Saturday on a suburb of Kosovo's second-largest city, sending
hundreds of frightened civilians streaming from the area. Also
Saturday, the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore quoted a
self-styled spokesman of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army as saying
the KLA would keep fighting if the group were excluded from peace
talks with the government. Serb sources had no statement about the
fighting. But reporters at the scene confirmed the attack. One said
by telephone that he could see smoke rising from Lodja. Reporters
said Serb and Albanian civilians were fleeing the area, jamming bus
and gas stations to escape the fighting. Mobs of angry Serb
civilians were gathering in other villages near Pec, one reporter
said. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents hope that talks Saturday will defuse the confrontation,
which has sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward
compromise. At the main flashpoint in Portadown, police fired
plastic bullets Friday night at Protestant hard-liners who again
tried to break through barricades around the Drumcree Anglican
church. Twenty people were injured by the plastic bullets and seven
remained hospitalized Saturday, including a 26-year-old man in
critical condition, medical authorities said. Representatives of
the Orange Order and the Catholic residents of the Garvaghy Road in
Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast, accepted Prime
Minister Tony Blair's invitation to talk through intermediaries to

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained nine Chinese democracy
campaigners in a crackdown exiled dissidents said Saturday proves
U.S. President Bill Clinton left China without securing progress on
human rights. The nine, mostly veterans of past democracy
movements, have tried to set up a political party to challenge the
Communist Party's monopoly on power. Their push coincided with
Clinton's China trip and his less confrontational appeals to
Chinese leaders to improve human rights. Police began the wave of
detentions Friday morning, dissident groups in Hong Kong and the
United States said. Police confiscated notebooks, tapes, at least
one computer and manifestos and literature for the China Democracy
Party, according to the groups. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Politicians took to the streets in a final day of
campaigning Saturday for a set of nationwide elections dominated by
concerns over how to pull Japan out of its worst recession in
decades. At stake in the elections Sunday are half of the 252 seats
in Parliament's upper house. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party is in no danger of losing its hold
on power because it enjoys a strong majority in Parliament's more
influential lower house. But concerns over Japan's deepening
economic morass have sent Hashimoto's support ratings plunging to
record lows over the past several weeks, and experts say a poor
showing could be enough to force a leadership change.

Some prominent relatives of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II

 &UR; With BC-Russia-Czar-The Other Nicholas
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some relatives of Russia's last czar seek a restoration of the
monarchy, but others are content to commit the family's royal
status to the past. Here are several prominent members of the
Romanov dynasty and their positions on Friday's burial ceremonies:
 &UR; Georgy Hohenzollern-Romanov, 17
	   Claimant to the throne, but labeled by most Russian monarchist
groups as a pretender. Romanov tradition passed the throne only
along male bloodlines, and his would pass through his mother. Does
not accept the authenticity of the czar's bones, and is boycotting
the St. Petersburg ceremonies. Instead, he plans to attend a
requiem service at the Sergeyev Posad monastery outside Moscow.
	   ---
 &UR; Maria Vladimirovna Romanova, 45
	   Mother of Georgy. When her parents failed to have a son, her
father declared her Curatrix of the Russian Throne so the claim
could pass through her to her son. Will accompany her son to
Sergeyev Posad.
	   ---
 &UR; Leonida Georgievna Romanova, 84
	   Georgy's grandmother and widow of Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov,
the son of Kirill Romanov, the eldest cousin of Nicholas II. In
1922, four years after his cousin's death, Kirill proclaimed
himself heir to the throne.
	   ---
 &UR; Nicholas Romanovich Romanov, 76
	   Considered by all other branches of Romanov descendants to be
head of the dynasty. He is a great-great-grandson of Czar Nicholas
I and a distant cousin of Nicholas II. He does not support a return
of the monarchy, and disputes Georgy's claim to the throne. Will
attend the burial ceremonies in St. Petersburg.
	   ---
 &UR; Paul Ilyinsky, 70
	   The mayor of Palm Beach, Florida. He is a great-grandson of czar
Alexander II, the same relationship to the last czar as Georgy's
grandfather, and could make a claim to the throne. However, he says
the only job he wants is the one he already has. His name in
Russian is Pavel Dmitriyevich Romanov-Ilyinsky. He will attend the
burial services in St. Petersburg.

Police catch 35 would-be immigrants in Spanish enclave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ Police said they caught 35 would-be
immigrants from Morocco as they attempted to cross the Strait of
Gibraltar to enter Spain illegally Saturday.
	   The boat, carrying 34 men and a woman, was stopped shortly just
off the coast of the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, at the northern tip
of Morocco, the state news agency EFE reported.
	   All those detained were taken into custody before being
repatriated.
	   Poverty and unemployment in Africa lead many to try and seek a
better life in Europe.
	   Spain is a main entry point to Europe with hundreds of people,
mostly from northwest Africa, taking their chances in crossing the
often treacherous Strait of Gibraltar, which at its narrowest point
is 14 kilometers (9 miles) wide.
	   Most of the immigrants cross the strait at night in packed
single-engine boats.

Becker topples Rios to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Will be UPDATED with later semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Semi-retired Boris Becker toppled
world number two Marcelo Rios in straight sets Saturday in the
semifinals of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open tennis tournament, coming
a step closer to his 50th career singles title _ and first on clay.
	   Defeating the top-seed 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), Becker has only one final
hurdle to overcome in order to finally claim the clay-court title
which has eluded him throughout his illustrious career.
	   ``Clay compared to the other surfaces is not my best,'' said
Becker, the winner of six Grand Slams. ``But that doesn't mean I
can't play on it.
	   ``With this altitude and the temperature making the ball faster,
I can combine that with my serve and be dangerous to play.''
	   Though ranked just 119 in the world, falling out of the top 100
this week for the first time in 13 years, the 30-year-old German
has shown he still has what it takes, marching over France's Cedric
Pioline, and the 1997 champion Felix Mantilla of Spain in the
quarterfinals before humbling Rios.
	   ``I'm very content and surprised,'' said Becker, whose last
title dates back to the 1996 Grand Slam Cup. ``I played a very good
match against a very good player.
	   ``Obviously today he wasn't playing at his best, but I didn't
give him the opportunity to.''
	   Becker also denied the Chilean the opportunity to regain the
world's top ranking from Pete Sampras, when the German defeated
Mantilla on Thursday.
	   Rios, who briefly replaced Sampras as world number-one earlier
this year, needed bonus points from wins over both Mantilla and
Spaniard Alex Corretja to reclaim the top rank.
	   ``He played really fast and served really well,'' said Rios,
whose previous best performances were quarterfinal appearances in
1994 and 1995.
	   ``And I couldn't feel the ball so well,'' added the 22-year-old,
who has vowed not to go out at night before winning another title.
	   The result marked the German's first final of the season, and
only the eighth defeat for Rios in 1998.
	   Keeping the rallies short and preventing Rios from playing his
game, Becker broke the Chilean's rythm, as well as his serve, to
jump to a 4-2 lead in the first set.
	   Rios had an opportunity to immediately break back but failed to
convert two break-points, allowing Becker to advance to 5-3, then
close the set on serve. In total, the Chilean was to squander eight
break points throughout the match.
	   Becker will meet the winner of the other semifinal between
third-seed and French Open finalist Alex Corretja of Spain and
Belgium's Filip Dewulf.

Hollywood Godzilla makes debut in Japan at record 385 theaters
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Thousands of Japanese fans crowded into movie
theaters Saturday to see the return of their legendary hero, this
time from Hollywood.
	   The U.S.-made movie ``Godzilla'' premiered at a record 385
theaters on its opening day in the country that first created the
monster 44 years ago.
	   In Tokyo's Yurakucho shopping district, more than 1,000 fans
lined up in front of the Nihon Gekijo theater to catch the nation's
earliest showing at 7:20 a.m. (2220 GMT Friday). Nearly 100 camped
overnight to be among the first to get inside.
	   The original Japanese Godzilla, holding an American and Japanese
flag in each hand, welcomed the crowd.
	   Some Japanese Godzilla fans have expressed concerns about
drastic changes made in the U.S. version, including the monsters's
iguana-like looks and his character.
	   They said the American Godzilla relied too much on sophisticated
special effects, losing the low-budget, hand-made charm of the
original.
	   Also, unlike the Japanese Godzilla, which in later movies
defended Japan from monsters and other threats, the American
Godzilla merely destroys everything.
	   But Hidekazu Takahashi, a 30-year-old Godzilla fan who spent the
night outside the theater entrance, said he is just as happy to see
his hero's return.
	   ``This one looks different from the Japanese Godzilla, but I
think he is handsome,'' Takahashi told reporters. ``I'm looking
forward to seeing Godzilla show his rage and go wild.''
	   Promoted for more than a year with a campaign theme, ``size
matters,'' the film earned dlrs 55.5 million in the United States
over the holiday weekend in May _ barely enough to cover the cost
of its marketing.
	   Facing poor reviews, Sony Picture's ``Godzilla'' came nowhere
near shattering the dlrs 90.2 million record held by ``Lost World:
Jurassic Park,'' which made its debut during the same weekend last
year.
	   But Godzilla's Japanese distributor, Toho, said it expects the
movie to beat the first-day audience record of 300,000 viewers set
here by the ``Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' Kyodo News reported.
	   TriStar Pictures spent dlrs 100 million making the Hollywood
version of the monster classic, compared to the dlrs 8 million that
Toho spent to create its most recent Godzilla sequel two years ago.
	   In that sequel, ``Godzilla vs. Destroyer,'' a nuclear-powered
Godzilla dies of a meltdown after overheating in a battle with a
giant oxygen-sucking scorpion.
	   The first of the 22 Japanese ``Godzilla'' movies was released in
1954.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian fullback Matthew Burke
led his team to a 24-16 win over New Zealand with a record points
haul in a thrilling start to the tri-nations series Saturday.
	   Burke had a magnificent match, scoring all of the Wallabies
points from two tries, four penalties and a conversion, to end
Australia's run of seven straight losses against the All Blacks
stretching back to 1994. Burke's haul, in front of 75,000 fans at
the Melbourne Cricket Ground, broke his own record, of 20 points,
for an Australian against New Zealand.
	   ``The rest of the team really made it easy for me tonight,''
said Burke. ``The forwards really laid the platform for our win.''
	   Captain John Eales described the victory as a ``great feeling.''
	   ``All around the ground we made a lot less mistakes than we have
against New Zealand in the last few years and that was the
difference,'' Eales said. ``If you don't make those mistakes you
can maintain pressure over a long period.''
	   Taine Randell, leading the All Blacks against their arch rivals
for the first time, praised the Wallabies.
	   ``Well done Australia, they deserved to win,'' said Randell.
``We're gutted.''
	   It was a refreshingly tense and high quality match, after the
two southern giants had played five tests between them this season
for easy wins over England and Scotland, and doubled as the first
of three matches for the Bledisloe Cup. Australia will play South
Africa in its second match of the tri-nations series in Perth on
July 18.
	   Australia started impressively but, after absorbing the pressure
in the opening 20 minutes, the All Blacks started to send the ball
wide through their exciting backline and the move caught Australia
out.
	   Winger Jeff Wilson crossed in the 20th minute after Christian
Cullen had cruised around Joe Roff and sent a kick infield, but the
try was denied because of a knock on.
	   Center Scott McLeod then busted through Australia's midfield
defense and Randell touched down only to have the play called up
for a forward pass. New Zealand got a penalty for an earlier
Australian infringement and fly-half Andrew Mehrtens converted it
for the opening points on 22 minutes.
	   A minute later Mehrtens sliced through the defense and passed to
Wilson whose kick ahead was hurried into touch by Roff. The All
Blacks won the lineout and controlled the ball well before flanker
Josh Kronfeld took the ball in the maul and drove through the
fractured opposition for an 8-0 lead.
	   Burke kicked a penalty for 8-3 and then good Australian forward
play set the fullback up for a 15 meter unopposed run to the line
to level the score. Burke converted and then put Australia further
ahead in the 36th minute, completing his second try after a crucial
break from center Daniel Herbert.
	   Mehrtens gave the game another twist before half-time when he
broke through to send Wilson down the right wing. Wilson was
gathered in near the line but turned a pass inside to send lock Ian
Jones across for a try and cut Australia's half-time lead to 15-13.
	   Burke kicked two further penalties in 12 minutes after the break
while Mehrtens, and then his replacement Carlos Spencer, missed
regulation chances.
	   Spencer got a second chance and scored to cut Australia's lead
to 21-16 and All Blacks coach John Hart tried to lever the game
open by bringing 1995 World Cup star Jonah Lomu on as a replacement
for Joeli Vidiri.
	   Lomu had an immediate impact, running over the top of Stephen
Larkham and then handling twice in a threatening surge down the
left which Australia was lucky to clean up without suffering
damage.
	   Burke's fourth penalty, coming 11 minutes from the end, gave
Australia an eight point margin again while Spencer fluffed another
penalty near the end.
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 24 (Matthew Burke 2 tries; Burke 1 goal, 4 penalty
goals) def. New Zealand 16 (Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones tries; Andrew
Mehrtens 1 penalty goal, Carlos Spencer 1 penalty goal).
	   Lineups:
	   Australia: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu (Willie
Ofahenguae), David Wilson, Matthew Cockbain, Tom Bowman, John Eales
(captain), Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns (Jeremy Paul), Richard Harry
(Dan Crowley).
	   New Zealand: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Scott McLeod (Andrew
Mehrtens), Walter Little, Joeli Vidiri (Jonah Lomu), Andrew
Mehrtens (Carlos Spencer), Justin Marshall, Taine Randell
(captain), Josh Kronfeld, Michael Jones (Isitolo Maka), Robin
Brooke, Ian Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd.

Monk draws criticism for `aggressive' Buddha statue

<TEXT>
	   BAN PHO, Thailand (AP) _ A statue of the Buddha that some Thais
call inspired but others find offensive may cost the monk who had
it built his job.
	   The 10-meter- (33-foot-) high statue in Chachoengsao province,
30 kilometers (19 miles) miles east of Bangkok, depicts the Buddha
standing with his right foot atop a large globe of the world.
	   Phra Khru Sopitsutakhun, the 61-year-old abbot of Sanamchan
temple, has said the statue was inspired by a dream he had and
represents the Buddha protecting the globe while spreading his
teachings.
	   Academics, other monks and government officials dispute his
vision, condemning the statue as bizarre and offensive to the
Buddhist religion.
	   Several have described the pose as ``aggressive,'' a concept
contrary to Buddhist teachings.
	   Phra Mahajerm Surako, a monk who is director of the Buddhism
Research Institute at the country's main institution of higher
religious learning, noted that the pose is not one of the 60
accepted styles of the Buddha's image.
	   He and other critics said such a pose could create an uneasy
feeling among people rather than help them achieve peace of mind.
	   ``It may be against the Buddhist principles that teach followers
to be modest,'' said Woraphong Vechamaleenonda of the Thai
Inter-Religious Commission for Development, a non-governmental
organization.
	   The religious affairs department of the education ministry sent
a team to the temple Saturday to interview the abbot.
	   Ministry officials have said the controversial statue could be
demolished and the abbot kicked out of the monkhood if it is found
to be contrary to religious regulations, the newspaper The Nation
reported Saturday.
	   ``Posing with one foot on the globe is like sneering at the
world,'' Education Minister Chumpol Silapa-archa was quoted saying.
``There is no such thing in either the Buddha's teachings or in our
traditions.''
	   The monk's devotees, however, feel he has done nothing wrong.
	   Thanom Heng-somboon, 45, a temple attendant for 23 years,
believes that the statue has no ill impact on Buddhism, but rather
demonstrates the goodwill of the abbot in spreading the faith.
	   He said the abbot is respected by followers and monks in the
province as a self-taught architect and artist, having designed
many statues and wall-paintings based on his dreams.
	   The colorful statues of animals and people from religious tales
that fill the temple grounds each represent a different moral
teaching, said Thanom.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Hours before Saturday's start of the 85th
Tour de France, an employee of the French team Festina was behind
bars while police investigated whether drugs found in his team car
were destined for the cyclists.
	   The man, not identified by name but said to be a health
specialist for the team, was arrested Thursday by customs officials
at the French-Belgian border, police said. He was driving a car
marked with the Festina colors.
	   Police sources said that several hundred grams of steroids were
found in the car. France Info radio said that 400 bottles of drugs
were seized, purchased in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.
	   The man has maintained that the drugs were for his personal use,
categorically denying they were destined for the team in the
grueling three-week race.
	   Festina's manager, speaking on France 2 television, said the
team has not been officially notified of the arrest or
investigation.
	   ``All my information today comes from the press ...,'' said
Bruno Roussel, speaking from Dublin, Ireland, where the race begins
this year. ``If on my arrival in France, I'm summoned ... I'll
answer any questions in all honest with nothing to hide.''
	   Jean-Claude Killy, the skiing champion who is president of the
Societe de Tour de France,'' said he is ``following the affair by
the millimeter.''
	   Festina, one of 21 teams riding in this year's Tour de France,
is among the favorites.

Fugitive crime boss arrested in Naples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Police Saturday arrested one of Italy's top
fugitives, a crime clan boss known for fathering two children with
his wife while he was supposedly on the run and she was living in
the family's heavily guarded villa.
	   Francesco Schiavone, 44, reputed head of the Casalesi crime
family, a leading band in the city's Camorra crime syndicate, was
captured in a crawl space along a street in the Naples suburb of
Casal di Principe, where his family lives, Italian news reports
said.
	   Schiavone, who had been on the run for more than two years,
reputedly led one of the bloodiest clan wars that left dozens dead
in the Caserta area over the last few years, the news reports said.
	   Naples' chief prosecutor called a news conference for later in
the day to give details of the arrest.
	   Schiavone, dubbed because of his thick, dark beard after
``Sandokan,'' the legendary brigand, reputedly had close ties with
local politicians. He was arrested in 1990 in the villa of a local
commissioner in Casal di Principe. But he went into hiding a few
months later when he was released in jail.
	   Recaptured some time later, he again disappeared while free on
technicalities.

Zanzibar holds first international film festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZANZIBAR, Tanzania (AP) _ The first Zanzibar International Film
Festival _ the brainchild of an American hotelier with strong ties
to this historic Indian Ocean island _ was set to begin Saturday
with the premiere of ``Maangamizi,'' a Tanzanian-U.S.
co-production.
	   The eight-day festival conceived and organized by Emerson
Skeens, who runs two hotels and a roof-top restaurant in Zanzibar's
historic Stone Town, is highlighting some 70 films and videos
produced by or about people of the so-called Dhow countries that
have been linked through Indian Ocean trade.
	   The dhow is a graceful wooden boat with one or two lateen sails
powered by trade winds that is still used to transport people,
livestock and goods from the Gulf States to eastern Africa,
semi-autonomous Zanzibar and Pemba Islands and the Comoros
archipelago.
	   ``The Zanzibar Film Festival presents a wonderful chance to
expand audience perspectives beyond kung-fu and second-rate
Hollywood films that are usually shown in these areas, and a major
aim is to provide films with cultural relevance to our East African
audience,'' the organizers said in a statement.
	   Films from Africa, Iran, India, Pakistan, the Gulf States and
Indian Ocean island communities will be presented in categories of
the Dhow Countries and the Sheherezade International Panorama for
works that explore illusion and reality.
	   Many of the 1001 Tales from the Arabian Nights, told by the
legendary Princess Sheherezade to gain her freedom, take place in
Zanzibar.
	   The Sultanate of Oman had its headquarters in Zanzibar for
several hundred years and was only dislodged by the British in the
late 19th century. Numerous settlers also arrived from Shiraz in
what is now Iran.
	   The festival will also hold a seminar on international copyright
laws.
	   The ZIFF statement said many African and Indian Ocean artists,
musicians and writers have had their works plagerized or stolen
outright because of the lack of legal protection for intellectual
property.
	   Organizers also hope to bring the films and videos to at least
half a million people on Unguja (Zanzibar) and Pemba islands
through a travelling show to 26 towns and villages.
	   ZIFF organizers plan a long-term project with festivals every or
every other year, depending on resources.
	   Several European Union nations as well as private backers have
provided dlrs 200,000 to fund the project.

U.N. sending team to Iraq to test warhead parts for VX gas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations is sending scientists to
Iraq to transport parts of missile warheads that may have been
loaded with deadly VX gas to France and Switzerland for testing, a
U.N. official said Saturday.
	   A U.S. laboratory last month revealed that Iraq loaded the gas
into missile warheads before the 1991 Gulf War. A few drops of VX
gas can kill a person.
	   Iraq disputed the finding and the United Nations agreed to send
the parts to European laboratories for further testing.
	   The scientists, scheduled to arrive Sunday, will take metal
missile parts dug up recently in Iraq to laboratories in the two
countries for analysis, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The team will consist of at least six scientists, including
three from France.
	   The experts will pack the parts in special containers before
airlifting them to Swiss and French laboratories, the official
said.
	   The spokeswoman for the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq, Janet
Sullivan, confirmed that the scientists will fly to Iraq from
Bahrain on Sunday.
	   Most of the parts were recovered at al-Nibai, the site where
Iraq in 1991 unilaterally destroyed and buried warheads designed to
carry chemical chemical weapons.
	   The U.S. tests, conducted at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in
Maryland, showed for the first time that Iraq loaded the gas in
warheads.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed against Iraq for invading Kuwait in
1990 will not be lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify that
Baghdad has eliminated all its banned weapons.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government has accused
the leading opposition party of having illegal armed forces, the
body charged with overseeing the country's upcoming elections said
Saturday.
	   The Ministry of Defense has written a letter to the National
Election Committee accusing Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party of having ``illegal troops,'' said committee spokesman Leng
Sochea. He did not say if the ministry had included any evidence
with its letter.
	   FUNCINPEC denied the allegation, which surfaced earlier this
week in comments from high-ranking government officials belonging
to the Cambodian People's Party of strongman Hun Sen. They extended
the accusation to prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, a political ally
of Ranariddh.
	   The defense minister hinted the government would not take action
before the election, fearing criticism of interference in the
polls.
	   ``Yes, it's true they are gathering troops, but we don't want to
say anything now because of the upcoming election,'' Defense
Minister Tea Banh told The Associated Press. ``Everyone knows that
FUNCINPEC has troops.''
	   Political parties are prohibited from having their own armies,
election committee spokesman Leng Sochea said at a weekly press
conference, but the election committee will take no action against
Ranariddh unless the government asks the body to investigate the
charges and ``there is a decision by the court.''
	   It is unclear whether the election committee could legally take
any action on the basis of such a complaint, but if criminal
charges were filed, they could be used to stymie FUNCINPEC's
election hopes.
	   With the court system loyal to Hun Sen's party, FUNCINPEC would
be hard-pressed to defend itself against any legal action, which
could include invalidating the results of the upcoming July 26
election should Ranariddh's party win.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who ousted the prince as his
co-premier in a bloody coup one year ago, called for elections to
proceed this year in an effort to win back legitimacy and aid after
his power grab.
	   After Ranariddh was deposed, the prince and two of his top
military aides were tried and convicted in a show trial of plotting
their own takeover. Ranariddh was granted an amnesty, allowing him
to return from exile to contest the July elections.
	   But the amnesty was not extended to his generals, Nhek Bunchhay
and Serei Kosal, who lead a small resistance force of the prince's
loyalists in northern Cambodia.
	   Peace talks aimed at reintegrating the prince's troops into the
Royal army have repeatedly failed, and the area of O'Smach along
the Thai border remains one of the few areas of Cambodia not under
the control of Hun Sen's government.
	   Ranariddh left for Bangkok on Saturday, a trip the prince's
aides said was previously scheduled.
	   ``We strongly deny these allegations,'' said Kong Vibol, a
member of the prince's cabinet, adding that while Nhek Bunchhay's
forces are loyal to the prince they are officially part of the
Royal army. ``FUNCINPEC has no illegal troops or armed forces.''
	   Meanwhile, ballot boxes and voting papers for the polls will be
delivered to 23 provinces by July 20, said Samraing Kamsan, an
advisor to election committee chairman Chheng Phon.
	   The election committee will deliver the supplies by car and
truck, and in remote areas by helicopter and even elephant, he
said.

 &UR; Austrian envoy finds Albanian politicians fragmented

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A senior Austrian envoy who met with
ethnic Albanian politicians and guerrillas in Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province found the ethnic Albanian leadership ``totally
fragmented,'' a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Albert Rohan, secretary-general of the Austrian foreign
ministry, met Friday in Kosovo with moderate politician Ibrahim
Rugova and representatives of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army as
part of the international effort to halt the fighting.
	   But in a telephone interview with the Vienna newspaper Die
Presse, Rohan said ``the political leadership of the Kosovo
Albanians is totally fragmented,'' despite U.S. and European
efforts to encourage them to rally behind Rugova, who has disavowed
violence.
	   The newspaper said Rohan was disturbed about the lack of
political consensus among the Albanian majority on how to deal with
the Yugoslav government.
	   Both Rugova and the KLA have called for independence for the
Serb province. The United States and the Europeans oppose
independence but are trying to arrange a cease-fire and talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on ``substantial autonomy''
for the province, where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   After the meeting with Rugova, Die Presse said Rohan visited the
KLA-controlled town of Malisheva, where he conferred with several
self-described KLA figures.
	   They included Gani Krasniqi, who described himself as the
``mayor'' of the town. Die Presse quoted Rohan as saying he left
with the impression that the KLA lacks a central command structure
but consists of a series of independent units.
	   That could complicate international efforts to encourage the KLA
and others to rally behind Rugova in talks with Milosevic.
	   The newspaper also said Rohan left with the view that the rebels
would accept nothing short of ``complete independence,'' which both
Yugoslavia and the major powers have rejected.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Arab and European legislators from 36
countries met Saturday to promote cooperation and economic ties
between their countries.
	   The three-day Arab-European Parliamentary Dialogue will focus on
partnership talks between the European Union and Egypt, Algeria,
Syria and Lebanon.
	   Abdul-Kadder Kaddoura, the speaker of Syria's parliament, said
at the opening session that Arab countries are looking forward to
an Arab-European economic relationship ``that would be a good
example of good cooperation between the north and south.''
	   He also called on Europe to exert more efforts to restart the
stalemated Middle East peace process.
	   ``In addition to its political weight, Europe has economic
leverage that enables her to put matters on the right course for
the benefit of the peace process,'' Kaddoura told the gathering.
	   Arabs have urged the European Union to work to revive the peace
talks, which have been deadlocked since March 1997.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian basketball stars Andrew Gaze
and Shane Heal bounced back from a lackluster game three to lead
Australia to a 3-1 win over Canada in their world championship
warm-up series.
	   Gaze and Heal contributed nine points between them Friday but
backed up with 25 and 17 respectively Saturday as Australia won
88-70.
	   Both teams will compete at the world titles in Athens, Greece,
later this month.
	   Canada, which shot only 47 percent from the free throw line, was
best served by guard Rowan Barrett, who finished with 13 points.
University of Washington's Todd MacCulloch rounded off an

Balkan neighbors try forestall economic impact of Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Prime ministers of Bulgaria, Roomania and
Turkey moved Saturday to boost trade among their countries and with
Europe to forestall economic isolation of the region which could
result from possible trade sanctions on Yugoslavia.
	   Bulgaria and Turkey signed a free trade accord that phases out
tariffs on 60 percent of Bulgaria's and 40 percent of Turkey's
exports.
	   Turkey's prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz, said he expected annual
trade turnover with Bulgaria to grow to dlrs 1 billion a year from
the current 500 million dollars as a result from the accord, that
takes effect Jan. 1.
	   ``This accord will give a powerful impetus to trade and economic
ties between our two countries,'' Yilmaz said after ministers of
trade Valentin Vasilev of Bulgaria and Isin Celebi of Turkey signed
the document.
	   A similar accord between Romania and Turkey has helped their
annual trade grow to dlrs 1 billion from dlrs 200 million,
Romania's premier, Radu Vasile, told Bulgarian counterpart, Ivan
Kostov.
	   At separate meetings with Yilmaz and Vasile, Bulgarian President
Petar Stoyanov and Kostov insisted that the three Balkan countries
join efforts to build a second bridge over the Danube river, which
makes the border between Bulgaria and Romania.
	   The only bridge that now links Bulgaria's Danube port of Ruse
with Romania's Giurgiu turned to be insufficient to convey trade
traffick during previous economic sanctions on Yugoslavia. Bulgaria
says it has incurred more than dlrs 3 billion in trade losses
because of them.
	   Bulgarian state radio quoted Stoyanov as saying a new bridge
``would prevent Bulgaria from becoming an economic hostage'' should
the west impose economic sanctions on Yugoslavia because of its
crackdown on independence seeking Albanians in its southern
province of Kosovo.
	   Bulgaria and Romania agree they need a second bridge but are
still discusssing where to build it.
	   At separate meetings government officials of the three countries
discussed plans to establish international Balkan peace keeping
military corps and increase of Bulgarian electricity exports to
Turkey.

Four British soldiers in Germany accused of rape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four British soldiers based in Germany have been
accused of raping the daughter of a fellow soldier, the Ministry of
Defense said Saturday.
	   An investigation began following an incident in Bergen, northern
Germany, in the early hours of Saturday morning, a ministry
spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The alleged victim is a British woman and the four accused are
serving with the 7th Armored Division, which is based in Bergen,
the spokesman said.
	   One of the four soldiers was arrested Saturday morning and the
other three are being sought by military police, he said.
	   Since no German nationals are involved,, the investigation is
being handled by the military police's Special Investigations
Branch, the spokesman said.

Farmland flooded, but waters receding in southeastern Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A flood alert was lifted in one of three
southeastern provinces Saturday after rains that had soaked farms
in the region abated.
	   Flood alerts remained in effect for the other two provinces, but
officials expected high water in local rivers to subside later in
the day.
	   ``We are not expecting any serious danger,'' said Maria
Hadlo-Nyklewicz, an emergency official in Rzeszow province, 280
kilometers (174 miles) southeast of Warsaw.
	   Low floods Thursday and Friday in the nearby Krosno province
forced the evacuation of 12 farms before the alert there was lifted
Saturday, the PAP news agency reported.
	   In Rzeszow and Przemysl provinces, several farms were under
water Saturday and flood alerts remained in effect. But no
evacuations were necessary and the rains stopped. High water on the
Wislok river, a Wisla tributary, was expected to subside later in
the day.
	   This time last year, rain-swelled rivers started overflowing
their banks in southern and western Poland in a deluge that lasted
into August. The flooding killed 55 people, swamped 46,000 homes
and caused an estimated 12 billion zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in
damage.
	   In April, flooding in southeastern Poland swamped hundreds of
farms in 290 villages and 13 towns.

Italian director honored in Israel for Holocaust film
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) with screening, audience
reax, appearance by Benigni
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In Holocaust-shadowed Israel, a darkly comic
film set in a Nazi concentration camp might be expected to touch a
raw nerve.
	   Instead, Italian director-actor Roberto Benigni is being praised
and feted as his award-winning film ``Life is Beautiful'' has its
premiere in Israel.
	   Prior to the film's sold-out screening Saturday at the Jerusalem
Film Festival, Benigni was being presented with special
commendations from Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and the festival
organizers.
	   ``Life is Beautiful,'' directed by and starring Benigni, is
about a father who uses a desperate and sometimes wildly funny ruse
to try to shield his young son from the horrors of a Nazi death
camp: telling the boy it is all an elaborate game.
	   The film was a hit at the Cannes festival, winning an emotional
ovation and taking home the runner-up Grand Prize. ``Life is
Beautiful'' has also enjoyed huge commercial and critical success
in Italy.
	   Benigni's warm reception is noteworthy in Israel, where
sensitivities over the Holocaust often set off controversies in the
arts and elsewhere.
	   Last month, parliament held a public forum on whether to end the
country's 50-year de facto ban on the music of Richard Wagner, a
virulent anti-Semite who was Adolf Hitler's favorite composer.
	   At that hearing, some weeping Holocaust survivors pleaded for a
continuation of the informal ban, saying works of Wagner _ which
were blared over loudspeakers in death camps _ brought back too
many horrific memories.
	   The film's distributors say that while the notion of using humor
in connection with the Holocaust is potentially explosive, the
film's compassion and sensitivity make it a unique vehicle for
exploring the darkness of the Nazi past.
	   ``He uses comedic material, yes, but it is intertwined
throughout the movie with a great sadness,'' said Aryeh Barak of
Forum Films, the distributor. ``People can laugh, but they're not
laughing at the Holocaust.''
	   Before deciding to show the film in Israel, distributors and
festival organizers screened it privately for Israeli critics and
representatives of Holocaust-survivors support groups. Barak said
the response was uniformly positive.
	   Benigni is revered in Italy for a highly physical comic style
that critics liken to that of Charlie Chaplin. Abroad, he is best
known for hilarious, manic performances in Jim Jarmusch's ``Down By
Law'' and ``Night on Earth.''

Election could be rough ride for Hashimoto and ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS throughout with detail, quotes. Polls open at
2330 GMT Saturday
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters across Japan were to head to the polls
Sunday in an election that has become a test of survival for Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto _ blamed by many for sinking Japan into
its worst recession since World War II.
	   The elections for half of the 252 seats in Parliament's upper
house are the first in that chamber since Hashimoto came to power
in early 1996.
	   As a member of the more powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself
does not stand for reelection. And his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is in no danger of losing its hold on power _ it has a strong
majority in the lower house.
	   But the elections have become a referendum on the prime
minister's handling of Japan's economic woes, and his party is
expected to face a rough ride.
	   If it does poorly, Hashimoto may have to step down.
	   Concerns about the deepening economic morass, a major factor in
the broader financial crisis throughout Asia, had sent Hashimoto's
support ratings to record lows over the past several weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percent last year _ just as the
economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed
to backtrack two days later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce
the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   He now says he supports cuts.
	   One factor expected to be in the ruling party's favor was voter
apathy _ turnout was expected to be among the lowest ever, possibly
falling below 50 percent of all registered voters.
	   Many analysts said a low turnout was likely because of an
increasing number of voters who don't feel comfortable with any of
the parties' candidates.
	   A higher turnout, they said, would likely hurt the ruling party
because it would bring out more protest votes.
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would mean the ruling party would
again have to seek outside partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have deliberately
distanced themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to
survive.
	   Other opposition parties have also had trouble capitalizing on
the LDP's sagging support.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party is the second largest in Parliament, with
38 seats in the upper house. But Kan's personal popularity has been
clouded by the party's vague stance on major issues.
	   The only other party seen as being in a position to make
significant gains was the Communists, who currently have only 14
seats in the upper house.
	   They were not expected to win enough to become a serious
challenge to the LDP, however.

Burundi peace minister meets mediator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Nine days ahead of the second
round of peace talks on Burundi, the central African nation's
minister for peace and reconciliation has met with mediator Julius
Nyerere, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Issues discussed between Ambrose Niyonsaba, who is representing
President Pierre Buyoya at the peace talks, and Nyerere were not
disclosed, the independent Guardian newspaper said.
	   A second round of all-party peace talks is to begin July 20 in
the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   However, earlier this month, a Burundian official told the East
African weekly that Burundi would send someone to see Nyerere to
determine who heads the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD) whose armed wing is fighting the Burundi army.
	   Buyoya's government says it was puzzled when Jerome Ndiho,
Brussels-based CNDD spokesman, issued a statement saying Leonard
Nyangoma, who signed the agreement at the end of the first round of
talks agreeing to a cease-fire among other things, is no longer the
CNDD leader.
	   Last month, Nyerere told reporters he recognized Nyangoma, a
former Burundi interior minister, as an authentic leader of the
Hutu armed group.
	   For the first time in five years, leaders of Burundi's
antagonistic parties met in mid-June to discuss ways of ending the
violence that has claimed at least 200,000 lives in Burundi since
October 1993.
	   The minority Tutsis have ruled Burundi for all but four months
since independence from Belgium in 1962. The country's only Hutu
president was assassinated by Tutsi paratroopers four months after
his June 1993 election, setting off the latest wave of killings.
	   Buyoya seized power for the second time in July 1996, claiming
only he could put an end to the bloodshed.

longest and most-watched World Cup in history.
	   After 31 days and 63 games, the record field of 32 countries has
been whittled to these two. The perennial champions and a
first-time finalist. The No. 1 offense and the top defense. The
hometown team and everybody else's favorite.
	   It's every bit the drama and pageantry the world expects from
the French, and a billion-something people around the planet are
expected to tune in to watch the last Cup of the century.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo, who has won four World Cups as a
player, coach or assistant, knows what this game means.
	   ``This is the biggest sporting event of the century,'' he said.
``We are representing the Americas, and we cannot let this chance
escape from our hands.''
	   If the Brazilians feel they belong here, the French have never
gotten past the semifinals. It's all a little heady.
	   ``We have to realize our adventure is not over yet,'' said coach
Aime Jacquet.
	   Jacquet's trump card is a stingy defense that has given up just
two goals in six games, the best in the Cup. But Laurent Blanc, a
bulwark of the back line, won't be there.
	   The Olympique Marseille defender was expelled and drew a
two-game suspension for pushing Croatia's Slaven Bilic in the face
in the semifinal. Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf will start alongside
Marcel Desailly and get the task of stopping Ronaldo, Bebeto and
company.
	   ``We have an anti-Ronaldo plan ready. It's called Marcel
Desailly,'' said French captain Didier Deschamps.
	   Jacquet also must find a solution for his punchless attack. A
French striker hasn't found the net since the first round _
defenders Blanc and Lilian Thuram did the all scoring as France
squeaked by Paraguay, Italy and Croatia.
	   The key is playmaker Zinedine Zidane. The Juventus attacker had
a so-so game against Croatia and must shine against Brazil,
unlocking the defense for Inter Milan striker Youri Djorkaeff, or
ir that fails, for himself.
	   For ``Zizou,'' as the French affectionately call him, the
underdog role suits France fine.
	   ``Brazil is the favorite. The whole world sees the Brazilians
winning against us. So much the better,'' he said.
	   Of course, the Brazilians see themselves winning, too. But they
also have something to prove.
	   Despite scoring 13 goals and showing flashes of greatness,
Brazil hasn't been the overwhelming force everyone expected. They
often played just well enough to get by, and the defense has shown
alarming lapses.
	   Ronaldo also is looking for consecration in his final game. The
two-time player of the year has been brilliant only in bursts, and
his four goals are below his potential.
	   ``I'll do anything to win. If it takes more sacrifice from me,
I'll do it,'' he said. ``Nothing and nobody will stand in our
way.''
	   The defense, which looked tenuous against Denmark and the
Netherlands, welcomes back Cafu after a one-game suspension. And
the team has renewed faith in goalie Taffarel, who saved two
penalty kicks in a tiebreaker shootout against the Dutch.
	   Zagallo feels the cliffhanger against the Dutch was a crucible
that steeled his team for the final.
	   ``In the end, nerves were on our side,'' he said. ``And against
France, nerves are on our side again.''
	   For Zagallo, tradition and experience are powerful allies in a
Cup final. Brazilians call it ``the jersey,'' _ and they have it.
	   ``Never has Brazil gone in so certain of winning,'' he said.
``France is playing for the first time, and this is a heavy weight.
And they'll be facing the yellow-and-green, which makes it even
heavier.''
	   History might give the Brazilians some extra incentive. It was
the French that knocked them out of the 1986 Cup in Mexico in a
quarterfinal penalty shootout.
	   Team coordinator Zico, who missed a penalty in that fateful 1986
match, says the team has learned from past failures. He says Brazil
knows how and when to attack the French.
	   ``France was passive against Croatia,'' he said. ``Brazilian
soccer is different. When we come, we come to kill.''
	   Experience has taught Brazil not to beat itself, Zico said.
	   ``Our players must have the emotional control,'' he said. ``They
know that heart is important in a final, that you have to give more
than all you have.''

Armed bandits carjack, rob six Belgian tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Armed bandits carjacked, robbed and
abandoned six Belgian tourist on a game drive in a national park in
central Kenya, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The independent Daily Nation, quoting district officer Johnstone
Wesonga, said attack occurred Thursday in Buffalo Springs National
Park about 220 kilometers (138 miles) northeast of Nairobi.
	   The bandits drove the tourists for about 12 kilometers (7 miles)
before abandoning them near Uaso Nyiro river after stealing
cameras, watches, shoes, assorted clothing, personal effects and
cash, the newspaper said.
	   Wesonga said the tourist did not offer any resistance.
	   ``The tourists obeyed the signal to stop when they noticed the
men were armed with sophisticated weaponry, and neither did they
offer any resistance,'' the newspaper quoted Wesonga as saying.
	   The bandits, who are believed to be ethnic Somalis from
neighboring Wajir district, did not harm the tourists or their
driver, the newspaper said.
	   Wesonga said police had been deployed to track down the bandits,
but no arrests have been made.
	   Police spokesman Emmanuel Mwashiti was not available for
comment.

Election could be rough ride for Hashimoto and ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede; Polls open at 2330 GMT Saturday
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sunday's elections in Japan are shaping up to be a
test of survival for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto _ blamed by a
growing number of people here for sinking the country into its
worst recession since World War II.
	   The elections for half of the 252 seats in Parliament's upper
house are the first in that chamber since Hashimoto came to power
in early 1996.
	   As a member of the more powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself
does not stand for re-election. And his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is in no danger of losing its hold on power _ it has a strong
majority in the lower house.
	   But the elections have become a referendum on the prime
minister's handling of Japan's economic woes, and his party is
expected to face a rough ride.
	   If it does poorly, Hashimoto may have to step down.
	   Concerns about the deepening economic morass, a major factor in
the broader financial crisis throughout Asia, had sent Hashimoto's
support ratings to record lows over the past several weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percent last year _ just as the
economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed
to backtrack two days later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce
the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   He now says he supports cuts.
	   One factor expected to be in the ruling party's favor was voter
apathy _ turnout was expected to be among the lowest ever, possibly
falling below 50 percent of all registered voters.
	   Many analysts said a low turnout was likely because of an
increasing number of voters who don't feel comfortable with any of
the parties' candidates.
	   A higher turnout, they said, would likely hurt the ruling party
because it would bring out more protest votes.
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would mean the ruling party would
again have to seek outside partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have deliberately
distanced themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to
survive.
	   Other opposition parties have also had trouble capitalizing on
the LDP's sagging support.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party is the second largest in Parliament, with
38 seats in the upper house. But Kan's personal popularity has been
clouded by the party's vague stance on major issues.
	   The only other party seen as being in a position to make
significant gains was the Communists, who currently have only 14
seats in the upper house.
	   They were not expected to win enough to become a serious
challenge to the LDP, however.

Mika Hakkinen takes sixth pole of season in British BP

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of McLaren won the
pole for Sunday's British Grand Prix _ his sixth of the season _
with the No. 2 starting spot going to Ferrari's Michael Schumacher.
	   Hakkinen, the series leader with 50 points, followed by
Schumacher (44) and McLaren's David Coulthard (30), clocked a time
Saturday of 1 minute 23.271 seconds, almost a half second ahead of
Schumacher's 1:23.720.
	   Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams _ the defending series champion
and winner of the last two British GPs _ was third in 1:24.102. It
was his best qualifying effort this season.
	   David Coulthard, who has won the other three poles this season,
was fourth for McLaren in 1:24.310 followed by Eddie Irvine of
Ferrari and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.
	   Damon Hill, the 1996 series champion, took seventh in a Jordan
for Sunday's 60-lap race on the Silverstone circuit.
	   Hakkinen, the serious-minded Finn always rated as one of F1's
quickest drivers, has emerged this season as the man to beat in his
McLaren _ the quickest car all season.
	   Hakkinen, 29, has won four of the eight races this season but
hasn't won since the Monaco Grand Prix in late May as his lead has
slipped from 22 to six points.
	   Despite McLaren's early-season success, they've slipped slightly
in the last three races _ prompting Irvine to put on the
psychological pressure suggesting they've ``blown'' the season.
	   ``They (McLaren) should have been a lot further ahead than they
are,'' said Irvine. ``They've made strategy mistakes, reliability
mistakes. Over the season, I'd put my money on Michael.''
	   McLaren owner Ron Dennis shot back.
	   ``You would all be delighted if I allowed myself to get involved
in a game of verbal tennis with Eddie,'' he said, glancing at
Irvine.
	   ``I have unusual respect for Grand Prix drivers, it is a pretty
difficult task. But he's wrong. Most opinions that drivers express
are wrong.''

Head of problem-plagued Hong Kong airport offers to step down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS graf 3, ADDS graf 4 to show Wong was appointed to
three-year term, is offering not to seek reappointment
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to step down once his term ends after
revelations of a security breach added to concerns over cargo
delays so severe that they could reduce economic growth.
	   The dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport has provoked complaints
since it opened Monday about lengthy delays before passengers could
get off airplanes or collect luggage and confusing flight
information.
	   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Po-yan, said he took
responsibility for the problems and offered not to seek
reappointment when his term ends in November, government-run Radio
Hong Kong reported. There was no immediate word from Hong Kong's
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Wong was appointed by the Hong Kong government to a three-year
term as head of the airport authority in 1995.
	   The government said Friday it would appoint two outside experts
and an influential Hong Kong figure to investigate problems at the
airport. Legislators criticized the proposal, saying they want a
panel appointed by the Hong Kong legislature to ensure the
government doesn't try to conceal its own mistakes.
	   Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes
violated safety rules by taking off with the bags of two passengers
who weren't aboard. Airlines are required to remove the bags of
absent passengers to guard against explosives.
	   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage
numbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff
to check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said
Albert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.
	   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport
Authority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport
security.''
	   The company handling cargo at the airport imposed a moratorium
on new shipments this week in order to clear away a backlog.
	   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the
company managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of
freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217
million).
	   Delays in shipments have forced sellers of fresh seafood to
close.
	   The delays could reduce economic growth this year by 0.1
percentage points ``provided that the period of moratorium is
limited to what they say,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said
late Friday.
	   It was the first official estimate for losses caused by problems
at the airport.
	   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kilometers
(22 miles) west of the Hong Kong's city center in one of the
world's biggest construction projects.
	   Hong Kong leaders had hoped its opening would revive public
confidence in the midst of Asia's economic crisis. Instead, it has
created a public-relations disaster.
	   ``On the fundamental question on whether the airport has been
put in good hands, the answer is no,'' wrote commentator Chris
Yeung in the South China Morning Post.

Riots dissipate, body of Abiola brought to Lagos

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerians woke up to relative calm
Saturday after three days of destructive and deadly rioting, but
authorities feared the funeral of the country's top political
prisoner could trigger a resurgence of anger.
	   The body of Moshood Abiola, who died Tuesday while in military
custody, has been brought to Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos
and was resting at his residence. His family was making
preparations for the funeral, which was scheduled for late Saturday
afternoon.
	   Riot police and soldiers surrounded Abiola's family home in the
sprawling Lagos district of Ikeja. Thousands of students and other
Abiola supporters waiting outside say they will launch new violent
protests if the security detail does not leave the area.
	   A team of foreign pathologists have completed an autopsy on
Abiola, which will help determine the cause of death. Nigeria's
ruling military junta says he died of a heart attack, but the
opposition leader's family suspects foul play.
	   The results of the autopsy _ as well as an earlier examination
performed by the government _ were to be made public after Abiola's
body is buried.
	   The death of the popular opposition leader triggered rioting and
violence in Lagos and elsewhere in southern Nigeria, where at least
55 people have been killed and more than 400 arrested.
	   The apparent winner of annulled presidential elections in 1993,
Abiola was jailed in 1994 after he was accused of treason by the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in early June. Nigeria's
new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, was preparing to
release Abiola when he fell ill and died during a meeting with a
U.S. delegation in Abuja.
	   Outrage at Abiola's death has begun to fracture the country
along ethnic lines. Abiola, an immensely popular southern
businessman from the Yoruba clan, posed a serious threat to the
ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper
echelons of power are controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas were discovered earlier in the week in
a predominantly Yoruba neighborhood. Fearing more of the same with
the country still raw over Abiola's death, riot police continued to
watch over the city's mosques today.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from their
Hausa and Fulani compatriots, have long resented what they consider
the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other minerals _ by
northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since Abacha's death on June 8, the new military junta has been
scrambling to gain public trust. Abubakar has released a group of
political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also has
vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to civilian rule.

Turkish activists protest grounding of oil tanker in Bosporus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo IST101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ As maritime officials struggled for a
second day on Saturday to free an oil tanker that ran aground in
the Bosporus Strait, a few activists protested the risks of tanker
traffic for this metropolis.
	   No leaks were reported from the Maltese-flagged Seasalvia,
carrying 81,000 tons (89,100 short tons), from Russia to Italy,
since it was stranded on a sandbar late Thursday.
	   But four members of the Nature Warriors, an Istanbul-based
environmental group, approached the ship aboard a fishing boat and
wrote ``S.O.S.'' on the Seasalvia.
	   ``That's enough,'' the activists shouted in anger as authorities
tried to flush out some crude oil from the Seasalvia in a bid to
lighten the ship.
	   The rescue operation closed the Bosporus to traffic for a few
hours on Friday but the passageway, which bisects Istanbul, was
open on Saturday.
	   Some 200 accidents in the Bosporus Strait over the last decade
have caused oil spills and fires that shut down the passageway for
days.
	   The stakes are rising because of a Russian project to ship
Caspian Sea oil from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk through the
Bosporus. Turkey opposes the proposal, citing safety risks.
	   Already 440 million barrels of oil transit the Bosporus
annually. The new Caspian production could add hundreds of millions
more.

Jordan signs land mine treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMM101

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan signed a global land mine treaty
Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact,
which prohibits the use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.
	   The announcement was made by Queen Noor, King Hussein's
American-born wife.
	   ``I would like to begin by announcing with great pride and hope
that, as of this morning, the Jordanian Cabinet approved the
signing of the Ottawa convention,'' Noor told more than 250 people
from more than 20 countries at a conference on land mines.
	   Delegates at the two-day meeting are discussing ways of
assisting mine victims in the Middle East. It is hosted by the
Landmine Survivors Network, a private organization based in
Washington, D.C.
	   The Ottawa convention, which was reached in Canada last
December, has been signed by 127 nations. Only 10 countries,
however, have ratified the treaty, which prohibits the use,
production, stockpiling and transferring of anti-personal land
mines.
	   In her 30-minute address, Noor said that Jordan stopped
importing land mines in 1974 ``and will never import them
anymore.''
	   But she stressed that Jordan needs technical assistance and
equipment to clear the 185,000 remaining mines, the bulk of them
planted along the border with Israel since the 1967 Middle East
war.
	   Jordan has already cleared 65,000 mines in the last five years,
but its efforts have slow, apparently because of the lack of the
necessary equipment, said Jerry White, executive director of the
Landmine Survivors Network.
	   Nasser Majali, a Jordanian army general responsible for clearing
mines, said that from 1973 until 1993 more then 80 Jordanians were
killed and 621 injured, including 400 civilians, from mines.
	   Since March 1993, only 29 people were injured and there were no
deaths, Majali added.

Three years after the fall of Srebrenica, survivors claim they are

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Angry survivors of Europe's
worst massacre since World War II gathered Saturday in front of the
office of Bosnia's top international official to mark the third
anniversary of the carnage and ask: why?
	   In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces overran the U.N.-protected
Muslim enclave of Srebrenica while U.N. peacekeepers watched
helplessly. Serb forces are believed to have executed thousands of
Muslim males and buried them in mass graves.
	   Four months later, former Bosnian Serb military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic and former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic were
indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for genocide in
the Srebrenica massacre. They remain at large.
	   Angered that the world has forgotten them, about 300 women and
children assembled in front of the office of the chief
international representative, Carlos Westendorp, and demanded the
world determine what happened to their husbands, fathers, brothers
and sons.
	   Some of the women complained that international officials _ who
are supposed to be assisting the country's recovery _ earn lavish
salaries while doing nothing to help account for thousands missing
in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war.
	   The third anniversary develops under the motto ``Not to be
forgotten,'' but this is exactly how Mina Nukic, 50, who lost 12 of
her closest relatives felt, she said.
	   ``We are damned,'' she sobbed. ``Why are we damned? Nobody wants
us.''
	   The women unfurled a 100-meter (yard)-long list of the names of
missing men from the eastern Bosnian town. Mrs. Nukic broke into
tears when she saw the names of four of her sons.
	   ``I hope this will never happen to anybody ever again on this
planet,'' she said.
	   A group of children, who lost one or both parents in Srebrenica,
presented a letter to Westendorp's deputy, Hanns Schumacher.
	   ``We want to remind you that we were not brought by storks to
this world,'' the letter said. ``We had our parents and now we
don't have them any more, and we don't know where they are. How
could you allow 10,000 people to disappear between July 11 and 18,
1995? Why, if we trusted you when we, in God's name, became a
(U.N.) safe zone?''
	   On Friday, Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, said
that Srebrenica and other U.N. ``safe zones'' turned ``out to be
the unsafest zones in the world.''
	   Izetbegovic praised the British U.N. commander at the time, Gen.
Rupert Smith, as a ``fair soldier and a honest man'' for wanting to
help stop the Bosnian Serb attack.
	   But he denounced Smith's superiors _ French Gen. Bernard Janvier
and the senior U.N. official in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi
Akashi of Japan _ for failing to halt the attack.
	   ``Janvier or Akashi, most likely one of them, stopped NATO's
military action against the Serbs,'' Izetbegovic said.

Becker topples Rios to reach final against Corretja
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second semifinal, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Semi-retired Boris Becker toppled
world number two Marcelo Rios in straight sets Saturday in the
semifinals of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open tennis tournament, coming
a step closer to his 50th career singles title _ and first on clay.
	   The German will face third-seed and French Open finalist Alex
Corretja in Sunday's final, the Spaniard winning his semifinal 6-3,
6-7 (3-7), 6-3 over Belgium's Filip Dewulf.
	   Upsetting the top-seed 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), Becker has only one final
hurdle to overcome in order to finally claim the clay-court title
which has eluded him throughout his illustrious 15-year career.
	   ``Clay compared to the other surfaces is not my best,'' said
Becker, the winner of six Grand Slams, in all but the French Open.
``But that doesn't mean I can't play on it.
	   ``With this altitude and the temperature making the ball faster,
I can combine that with my serve and be dangerous to play.''
	   Though ranked just 119 in the world, falling out of the top 100
this week for the first time in 13 years, the 30-year-old German
has shown he still has what it takes, marching over France's Cedric
Pioline, and the 1997 champion Felix Mantilla of Spain in the
quarterfinals before humbling the 22-year-old Rios.
	   ``I'm very content and surprised,'' said Becker, whose last
title dates back to the 1996 Grand Slam Cup. ``I played a very good
match against a very good player.
	   ``Obviously today he wasn't playing at his best, but I didn't
give him the opportunity to.''
	   Becker also denied the Chilean the opportunity to regain the
world's top ranking from Pete Sampras, when the German defeated
Mantilla on Thursday.
	   Rios needed bonus points from wins over both Mantilla and
Spaniard Alex Corretja to reclaim the top rank he briefly held
earlier this year.
	   ``He played really fast and served really well,'' said Rios, who
has vowed not to go out at night before winning another title.
``And I couldn't feel the ball so well.''
	   The result marked the German's first final of the season, and
only the eighth defeat for Rios in 1998.
	   Keeping the rallies short and preventing Rios from playing his
game, Becker broke the Chilean's rythm, as well as his serve, to
jump to a 4-2 lead in the first set.
	   Rios had an opportunity to immediately break back but failed to
convert two break-points, allowing Becker to advance to 5-3, then
close the set on serve. The Chilean was to squander eight break
points throughout the match.
	   While Becker is still seeking his first clay-court title,
Corretja, in his fifth appearance in Gstaad, will be looking for
his fifth. The Spaniard, who lost to compatriot Carlos Moya in the
final of Roland Garros, owns five ATP titles, his most recent in
Dubai this year.

Jordan signs land mine treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan signed a global land mine treaty
Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact
barring use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.
	   Queen Noor, King Hussein's American-born wife, made the
announcement to more than 250 people from more than 20 countries
gathered for a conference on land mines.
	   Delegates to the two-day meeting were discussing ways of
assisting mine victims in the Middle East. It was hosted by the
Landmine Survivors Network, a private organization based in
Washington, D.C.
	   The Ottawa convention, reached in Canada in December, has been
signed by 127 nations. Only 10 countries have ratified the treaty,
which prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transferring
of anti-personnel mines.
	   In her 30-minute address, Noor said Jordan needs technical
assistance and equipment to clear the 185,000 mines in its
territory, the bulk of them planted along the border with Israel
since the 1967 Middle East war.
	   Jordan has cleared 65,000 mines in the last five years, but its
efforts have been slow, apparently because of the lack of
equipment, said Jerry White, executive director of the Landmine
Survivors Network.

Ethiopia rounds up more than 1,000 members of Eritrean party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-9 with Eritrean comment; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has rounded up and plans
to deport more than 1,000 members of Eritrea's ruling party on
suspicion of spying for Asmara in the two-month border conflict
between the former allies in the Horn of Africa, the government
said Saturday.
	   ``All the Eritrean nationals who have been rounded up will be
deported, but they will be allowed to appoint agents to manage
their businesses and property,'' spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said.
``Their families will be allowed to stay in Ethiopia if they so
wish.''
	   Many of those rounded up are well-known businessmen who own
transport companies, garages, retail shops, bars and beauty
parlors.
	   Selome said the Ethiopians decided to move when the government
of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki ``started to reactivate its
party members for espionage and fund-raising activities for the
Eritrean war effort.''
	   The Eritrean People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the
successor to the rebel movement that fought Ethiopia for 30 years
to obtain independence, had an extensive network in Ethiopia.
	   Last month, the government closed down the EPFDJ's main office
and its leaders were among the 1,047 Eritreans deported.
	   The Eritrean News Agency said among those being rounded up were
families of Eritreans already deported to Ethiopia and who had been
assured by the Ethiopians that they would be allowed to stay if
they wished.
	   In a statement issued Friday, the state-run news agency accused
the Ethiopian government of deporting people ``because of their
ethnic origin.''
	   Ethiopia has dismissed accusations by Mary Robinson, head of the
U.N.'s human rights agency, that it violated international human
rights principles by carrying out the deportations.
	   The conflict over borders set by Italian colonizers in the early
20th century erupted May 6 when Eritreans moved into areas claimed
by Ethiopia. Both sides bombed each other over the weekend of June
5-7, causing at least 100 casualties on the Ethiopian side.
	   There has been no fighting reported for several weeks, but there
is a stalemate in efforts to bring both sides together to talk
peace.
	   Each side has begun to charge the other with abusing its
citizens.
	   Afwerki's Eritrean People's Liberation Front played key role in
helping the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
overthrow a 17-year military regime in 1991.
	   In recompense, EPRDF leader and now Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
gave the green light to Eritrean independence, a move strongly
opposed by the majority Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups. Meles is
from the northern Tigray region that borders Eritrea.
	   Selome said the International Committee of the Red Cross would
be allowed to visit the detainees before they are deported.
	   She said 400 Ethiopians deported from the Assab port area in
southern Eritrea have arrived in Djibouti. But she said the
whereabouts of another 600 Ethiopians picked up by the Eritrean
government remains unknown and the Red Cross has been denied access
to them.
	   George Cominos, the head of the ICRC in Ethiopia, said the Red
Cross has visited the 163 Eritrean prisoners of war being held at
Fitche, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Addis Ababa where
another 1,000 Eritrean military personnel and conscripts are also
held. Cominos said 664 of those had been registered.

Egyptian health minister performs operations in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Egyptian Health Minister Ismael Salam has
performed three heart operations since arriving in Baghdad, Iraqi
doctors said Saturday.
	   Salam, a heart surgeon, was shown on state television late
Friday operating on Iraqi patients at Saddam Heart Surgery
Hospital.
	   Salam arrived in Iraq on Friday.
	   Salam also opened a pharmaceutical fair in Baghdad in which 14
Egyptian companies are participating, the official Iraqi News
Agency said Saturday.
	   A large group of Egyptian doctors are accompanying Salam and the
news agency said they were all busy operating in Iraqi hospitals.
	   Egypt has been seeking trade deals with Iraq since the start of
its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations in December 1996.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions have led to widespread civilian suffering in Iraq
and are unpopular in Arab countries.

Russia, Germany discuss `creative' solutions for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Russia and Germany
discussed ``new, creative possibilities'' Saturday for a solution
to the crisis in Kosovo, but their comments after the meeting
suggested little change in their positions.
	   Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Yevgeny Primakov of Russia refused
to elaborate on the new approaches they said they discussed, except
to stress that they did not include a military assault on
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
separatists in Kosovo who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   The United States and other Western countries have threatened to
use military force if necessary to halt the violence. Russia, which
shares a Slavic culture with the Serbs, has strongly opposed a
military strike.
	   At a news conference following their meeting, Kinkel and
Primakov said they agreed that Yugoslavia's territorial integrity
must be maintained, and that the ultimate solution for Albanians in
Kosovo would be autonomy. But they didn't say how that could be
achieved.
	   Kinkel said that after returning to Bonn later Saturday, he
would brief the European Union and the foreign secretaries of the
six-nation Contact Group that coordinates international policy in
the Balkans.

Hughes promises Southampton two good years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea discard Mark Hughes promised Premier
League soccer team Southampton two good years as he completed a
650,000-pound (dlrs 1.08 million) transfer deal Saturday.
	   The veteran Welsh striker admitted he was sorry to leave
Chelsea, European Cup Winners' Cup holders, but was looking forward
to helping Southampton push for a place in the European
competition.
	   ``I enjoyed my time at Stamford Bridge but this is the right
time to leave because at my age I need to play regularly,'' he
said.
	   ``Chelsea operate with a big squad, and there are not as many
chances for me as I would have liked.
	   ``Southampton proved last season they mean business and are
looking to do more than just survive in the Premiership.''
	   Hughes, who turns 35 in November, signed a two year deal with an
option on a third year and became Southampton's fifth signing in 10
days.
	   Southampton manager Dave Jones said Hughes had tremendous
experience to bring to the club
	   ``There is still plenty of football left in him,'' Jones said.
	   Hughes represented Wales and was a key forward at Manchester
United for the bulk of his career, playing a vital role in numerous
FA Cup and League winning campaigns. He joined Chelsea in 1995.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia moved closer to democracy
Saturday when its ruling party overwhelmingly elected a new
reformist chairman who immediately dumped former President Suharto
as the party's chief patron.
	   Key Suharto supporters were also expected to be purged from the
ranks of the Golkar party, including two of his super-rich
children, who with their father are fighting off allegations of
corruption.
	   ``Suharto's power is now over politically,'' said Rizal Ramli,
an analyst with Econit, a Jakarta-based thinktank.
	   Saturday's election of State Secretary and Cabinet minister
Akbar Tanjung came at the end of a three-day special congress of
Golkar members held less than two months after violent protests
forced Suharto to step down, ending 32 years in power.
	   The ballot, the first of its kind in Golkar's history, is a
major boost for the leadership of new President B.J. Habibie, who
has promised more democracy for the world's fourth most populous
nation.
	   Akbar won 17 out of the 27 votes cast by party delegates.
	   Rival candidate Edy Sudradjat, a retired army general and a
former defense minister backed by supporters of Suharto, attracted
only 10 votes.
	   Akbar is a close Habibie aide and was the president's personal
choice for the party chairmanship.
	   Within hours of his victory, party officials said Akbar had
formally dissolved Golkar's board of patrons, headed by Suharto.
Until now the body had been instrumental in deciding party policy.
	   The officials said Suharto's eldest daughter, Tutut, a former
Cabinet minister, would be replaced as a junior party chairwoman.
Second son Bambang would lose his job as party treasurer.
	   ``There is no place for the Suharto family in the new Golkar,''
said Sarwono Kusumaatmajda, a former environment minister.
	   During his three decades in power, Suharto blatantly used Golkar
to dominate a largely symbolic form of parliamentary democracy that
legitimized his authoritarian rule.
	   Some have speculated that he had wanted to maintain his
influence within Golkar to protect his family's huge business
interests in the face of an ongoing corruption investigation.
	   However, Saturday's ballot appears to have ended any chance of
that.
	   Although the party has millions of members and remains
organizationally and financially strong, there are doubts about its
future as new parties are founded ahead of promised free elections
next year.
	   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
	   Saturday's ballot was the first time Golkar delegates were asked
to vote for a new party chief since it was formed in 1964.
	   In the past chairmen were chosen by Suharto and a small group of
advisors and then endorsed by the party machine.
	   Analysts said Suharto's followers, many of them retired
generals, had wanted Sudradjat to win so they could impede change
within Golkar and slow down political reform to protect the
positions they had gained under Suharto.
	   Akbar's victory followed a strong call for reform made by
Habibie in a speech to the congress on Thursday.

Flight delays to continue throughout summer

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Passengers continued to suffer long delays
at Athens airport Saturday because of heavy air traffic.
	   Dozens of flights were delayed up to two hours. Air traffic was
complicated because of a work-to-rule by Olympic Airways pilots.
	   Airport officials said delays would continue throughout August
because of the Eurocontrol system, which regulates air traffic in
European Union airports.

German networks reject idea of broadcasting star's childbirth live
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A German soap opera actress wants to
share her childbirth with fans in a live TV broadcast. But
Germany's major networks so far have said: no, thanks.
	   The 23-year-old Susanna Wellenbrink's offer to show the event
live already drew sharp criticism earlier this week from the German
Society for Gynecology. Germany's major networks are now refusing
to participate, Munich-based Focus magazine said Saturday.
	   Two of the networks, Pro 7 and Sat 1, say parents should keep
such an event intimate, the magazine said in a brief advance of its
report to appear in Monday's edition. The magazine did not say when
the birth was due.
	   The head of the gynecology society, Klaus Diedrich, said Monday
that such a broadcast would be ``pure commercialism.'' The public
can be better informed about childbirth through existing
documentaries, Diedrich added.

World Cup: Ronaldo is ready, but fears the French
</HEADLINE>

Sports-Soccer-Brazil-Ronaldo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Watch out, France. Soccer's best player says he may
have some surprises in store in Sunday's World Cup final.
	   ``The most beautiful victory is when you realize that you've
succeeded in surpassing yourself, that you've done something you
didn't think you were capable of,'' says Ronaldo, a two-time FIFA
player of the year considered something of an under-achiever here
despite his four championship goals.
	   ``I have done a lot to help Brazil get a fifth title but I know
I should do better.''
	   Interview with French daily L'Equipe Saturday, the 21-year-old
soccer superstar said he was impressed by the France lineup the
Brazilians meet in the final.
	   ``It's a good team composed of great players,'' Ronaldo said.
``Honestly it's going to be a very difficult match because there's
a quality team facing us.''
	   He most fears French play maker Zinedine Zidane.
	   ``The whole French team plays around him, it's Zidane that makes
the team good or not, he determines everything,'' he said.
	   By his standards, Ronaldo has been low key in this World Cup.
He's scored four goals but hasn't been the driving force of the
Brazil team people expect him to be. The Inter Milan striker offers
little excuse for his lack of brilliance.
	   ``They say that a player should give everything during a World
Cup, but what if you've already given everything before the World
Cup started?'' he told L'Equipe. ``It is difficult.
	   ``Pressure is part of my job and it's only normal that people
ask more and more from me. I know that the whole of Brazil expects
a lot from me at every match.''
	   Ronaldo said he had some trouble with the Brazilian style of
play which was different from the Inter Milan tactics he is used
to. ``I had to change my style,'' he said.
	   Although the Brazilian team is a gathering of brilliant
individual stars, Ronaldo says it is really together for this
match. ``We are all here to get the same thing, a fifth title,'' he
said.
	   Constant attention from the media doesn't really faze Ronaldo.
He dismissed rumors that he's getting too fat.
	   ``It's not even worth it to talk about that. I've always said
there is a lot of space to fill in Brazilian newspapers, on the
radio or on television,'' Ronaldo said.
	   ``Whether you're the best player in the world or the worst one,
it's the same thing. The press doesn't make a distinction and
doesn't hand you things for free either.''
	   But the Inter Milan striker is getting tired of questions about
his future. Ronaldo won't talk about the possibility of becoming
Brazil's captain or even coaching after he retires from playing.
	   ``Later, I'll think about another life,'' he said. ``But for now
I can live with the pressure.''

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After six nights of violence
and displays of force, Protestant marchers and their Catholic
opponents hope that talks Saturday will defuse the confrontation,
which has sorely tested Northern Ireland's recent turn toward
compromise.
	   At the main flashpoint in Portadown, police fired plastic
bullets Friday night at Protestant hard-liners who again tried to
break through barricades around the Drumcree Anglican church.
	   Twenty people were injured by the plastic bullets and seven
remained hospitalized Saturday, including a 26-year-old man in
critical condition at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, medical
authorities said.
	   Representatives of the Orange Order and the Catholic residents
of the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast, accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's invitation to talk in
Northern Ireland through intermediaries to try to find a durable
solution to a march that has sparked violence for a third summer.
	   The talks, which were scheduled to start Saturday morning,
finally got underway in mid-afternoon, the Northern Ireland Office
said. Telephone contacts went on for several hours before agreement
was reached on a venue and details of the negotiations.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office stressed that ``considerable
difficulties still remain.''

Palestinians condition talks on Israeli acceptance of pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh comment from Palestinian
officials &QL; 
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Rebuffing an appeal from the Clinton
administration, Palestinians say they will negotiate face-to-face
with Israel only if it accepts U.S. proposals for a West Bank
pullback.
	   ``The Palestinian side is fully ready to resume negotiations ...
at the moment the Israeli government announces its willingness to
negotiate and its acceptance of the American initiative,'' the
Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement after its Friday night
meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   ``Resuming direct talks with Israel depends on its declaration
of commitment to the U.S. initiative,'' said Palestinian negotiator
Hasan Asfour.
	   On Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Israel and the Palestinians had to negotiate in order
to settle their own differences on the American pullback plan,
which has been widely reported but never formally unveiled.
	   The United States has been trying to win an Israeli agreement to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
Palestinians now fully or partly control 27 percent of it.
	   ``There is a limited amount that the United States or anyone can
do if the parties themselves do not talk with each other to resolve
the remaining difficult issues,'' Albright said.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman said during
talks earlier this week in Washington between Albright and
Palestinians negotiators, `` the American side presented Israeli
ideas that were rejected by the Palestinian side.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, just back from
Washington, was evasive when asked about Albright's call for direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
	   ``We never said that the Americans should negotiate on our
behalf,'' he told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Asfour blamed the United States for failing to take a tougher
stand with Israel.
	   ``There is an attempt on the American side to hold both sides
responsible for the failure, instead of holding Israel responsible
for the failure of implementation of the American initiative and
instead of forcing Israel to accept that initiative. This is not
fair.''
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement on a mountaintop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
American pullback proposal, citing security concerns. He also says
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has failed to implement previous
agreements _ a position he repeated in an interview Friday night.
	   ``He already promised us that he'd fight terror, stop
incitement, decrease the Palestinian police force, stop murders,
turn over wanted _ all these things he said, he didn't do
anything,'' he told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Arafat accepted the American pullback proposal in January and
said he would not renegotiate the terms. He dispatched two senior
Palestinian negotiators to Washington last week at Albright's
request.
	   The Clinton administration has indicated it would reassess its
role as mediator in the talks if it saw no progress. Erekat said it
would be Israel's fault if the peace process dead-ends now.
	   ``This cannot go on this way,'' he said. ``The question is not
about percentages, but whether this Israeli government is willing
or capable of implementing (them).''

Mika Hakkinen takes sixth pole of season in British BP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; ADDS quotes from Hakkinen, Schumacher, Villeneuve &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of McLaren won the
pole for Sunday's British Grand Prix _ his sixth of the season _
with the No. 2 starting spot going to Ferrari's Michael Schumacher.
	   Hakkinen, the series leader with 50 points, followed by
Schumacher (44) and McLaren's David Coulthard (30), clocked a time
Saturday of 1 minute 23.271 seconds, almost a half second ahead of
Schumacher's 1:23.720.
	   Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams _ the defending series champion
and winner of the last two British GPs _ was third in 1:24.102. It
was his best qualifying effort in a season that's yet to yield a
top-three finish.
	   David Coulthard, who has won the other three poles this season,
was fourth for McLaren in 1:24.310 followed by Eddie Irvine of
Ferrari and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.
	   Damon Hill, the 1996 series champion, took seventh in a Jordan
for Sunday's 60-lap race on the Silverstone circuit.
	   Hakkinen, the serious-minded Finn always rated as one of F1's
quickest drivers, has emerged as the man to beat in his McLaren _
the quickest car all season.
	   Hakkinen, 29, has taken four of the eight F1s so far but hasn't
won since the Monaco Grand Prix in late May as his lead has slipped
from 22 to six points.
	   The team has also had various mechanical problems in the last
few races _ specifically fuel problems for Coulthard in the French
Grand Prix two weeks ago.
	   ``I guess it (mechanical problems) are a worry for every team,''
Hakkinen said. ``It's impossible to start thinking about the
problems that could happen.
	   ``We have worked very hard since the last race to understand the
problem and improve the car. I would be surprised if we experienced
problems again.''
	   Rain is forecast for Sunday, suggesting Schumacher could have an
advantage because of his strong wet-weather record, a notion he
dismissed.
	   ``We have been good so far in mixed circumstances, taking a
decision on which way to go,'' Schumacher said. ``We've been lucky,
you can go the right or wrong way.''
	   ``If it's clear what the circumstances are, all of us can drive
well in the rain.''
	   ``The point is how good the Bridgestone or Goodyears (tires)
are, that's something we haven't seen so far in real wet
circumstances.''
	   For Villeneuve, it was just good to be back in the top three _
even if it was just qualifying.
	   ``I didn't remember my way back here, the first time this
year,'' the Canadian said. ``It's good to finally get back for
something.''
	   ``The car the whole weekend has been stronger. It's been
stronger in Magny Cours (French Grand Prix) but here it's stronger
again.''
	   ``We could have put our nose closer to Michael with a perfect
lap,'' he added. ``That's the first time this season we've had a
package strong enough to fight like that.''

BayStars beat Dragons 6-5

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose combined for three runs Saturday,
including a two-run homer, as the Central League's front-running
Yokohama BayStars edged the Chunichi Dragons 6-5.
	   The victory was the third in a row for the BayStars. They are
now 2 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Yomiuri Giants. The
Dragons slipping to third.
	   Rose, formerly of the California Angels, gave the BayStars a 2-0
lead with his two-run homer in the bottom of the first inning. He
has six home runs this season.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Hideki Matsui hit a solo homer in the bottom of
the first inning, lifting the Giants to a 7-5 lead over the Hanshin
Tigers and second place in the league.
	   Matsui leads both the leagues with 18 homers.
	   Balvino Galvez, a former Texas Rangers hurler, gave up eight
hits and walked five, while striking out five over eight-plus
innings to collect his seventh victory this season.
	   At Hiroshima, Tetsuya Iida drove in three runs as the Yakult
Swallows edged the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 4-3.
	   Iida batted in two runs on a single in the top of the second
inning, then added a winning run in the seventh as he was struck by
a pitch from Carp starter Makoto Kito with the bases-loaded.
	   In Pacific League action, Phil Clark belted back-to-back two-run
homers and Hiroshi Takamura threw a five-hitter, giving the
Kintetsu Buffaloes a 7-0 shutout victory over the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks in Osaka.
	   Saturday's victory was the third in a row for the Buffaloes.
	   Buffaloes starter Takamura (6-5) completed the game with 121
pitches, striking out five and walking one. It was his third
shutout of the season.
	   At Chiba, Kiyoshi Hatsushiba arched a winning solo homer in the
bottom of the 10th inning as the Chiba Lotte Marines beat the
first-place Nippon Ham Fighters 6-5.
	   Hatsushiba batted in another run on a single in the sixth.
	   He has 14 home runs this season.
	   The Seibu Lions and Orix BlueWave were rained out.

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ Just a day before President Nelson
Mandela was to help bury victims of a bar shooting, violence
continued Saturday in troubled KwaZulu-Natal province when five
people were found dead.
	   The bodies of a murdered mother and her baby were found
overnight and three more bodies were found Saturday morning, said
police Superintendent Henry Budrham. Details were not immediately
available.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said some residents suspected
police of complicity in the violence. Trust must be restored and
police must find a way to halt the violence, Mbeki said.
	   ``Clearly, it will be necessary to do something quite radical to
improve the capacity of the police in this area to deal with this
problem,'' Mbeki told reporters in Pretoria, the capital.
	   Mbeki did not specify what steps might be taken. He said
national Police Commissioner George Fivaz has been ordered to
personally deal with the situation.

Turkish activists protest grounding of oil tanker in Bosporus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with ship freed &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An oil tanker which ran aground two days
earlier in the Bosporus Strait was freed Saturday, and authorities
said there was no danger of a spill in the heavily traveled
waterway.
	   Martime workers managed to free the Maltese-flagged Seasalvia
from a sandbar by flushing out some of crude oil aboard, said a
maritime official, Ahmet Topcu.
	   ``It is swimming again, and there is no leak,'' Topcu said.
	   The Seasalvia, carrying 81,000 tons (89,100 short tons) of oil
from Russia to Italy, was stranded late Thursday.
	   Shortly before the tanker became loose, four members of the
Nature Warriors, an Istanbul-based environmental group, approached
the ship aboard a fishing boat and wrote ``S.O.S.'' on the
Seasalvia.
	   ``That's enough,'' the activists shouted in anger as authorities
flushed out some of the crude.
	   The rescue operation closed the Bosporus to traffic for a few
hours on Friday but the passageway, which bisects Istanbul, was
open on Saturday.
	   Some 200 accidents in the Bosporus Strait over the last ecade
have caused oil spills and fires that shut down the passageway for
days.
	   The stakes are rising because of a Russian project to ship
Caspian Sea oil from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk through the
Bosporus. Turkey opposes the proposal, citing safety risks.
	   Already 440 million barrels of oil transit the Bosporus
annually. The new Caspian production could add hundreds of millions
more.

Palestinians condition talks on Israeli acceptance of pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh comment from Palestinian
officials. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Rebuffing a U.S. appeal, Palestinians
say they will negotiate face-to-face with Israel only if it accepts
American proposals for a West Bank pullback.
	   ``The Palestinian side is fully ready to resume negotiations ...
at the moment the Israeli government announces its willingness to
negotiate and its acceptance of the American initiative,'' the
Palestinian Cabinet said in a statement after a Friday night
meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   ``Resuming direct talks with Israel depends on its declaration
of commitment to the U.S. initiative,'' Palestinian negotiator
Hasan Asfour said.
	   On Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Israel and the Palestinians had to negotiate in order
to settle their differences on the American pullback plan, which
has been widely reported but never formally unveiled.
	   The United States has been trying to win an Israeli agreement to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
Palestinians now fully or partly control 27 percent of it.
	   ``There is a limited amount that the United States or anyone can
do if the parties themselves do not talk with each other to resolve
the remaining difficult issues,'' Albright said.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, just back from
Washington, was evasive when asked about Albright's call for direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
	   ``We never said that the Americans should negotiate on our
behalf,'' he said after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Asfour blamed the United States for failing to take a tougher
stand with Israel.
	   ``There is an attempt on the American side to hold both sides
responsible for the failure, instead of holding Israel responsible
for the failure of implementation of the American initiative and
instead of forcing Israel to accept that initiative. This is not
fair,'' Asfour said.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement on a mountaintop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the
American pullback proposal, citing security. He also says
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has failed to implement previous
agreements _ a position he repeated in an interview Friday night.
	   ``He already promised us that he'd fight terror, stop
incitement, decrease the Palestinian police force, stop murders,
turn over wanted _ all these things he said, he didn't do
anything,'' he told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Arafat accepted the American pullback proposal in January and
said he would not renegotiate the terms. He dispatched two senior
Palestinian negotiators to Washington last week at Albright's
request.
	   The Clinton administration has indicated that it will reassess
its role as mediator if it sees no progress. Erekat said it would
be Israel's fault if the peace process dead-ends now.
	   ``This cannot go on this way,'' he said. ``The question is not
about percentages, but whether this Israeli government is willing
or capable of implementing (them).''

Election could be rough ride for Hashimoto and ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Hashimoto comment in 6th graf; Polls open at 2330 GMT
Saturday
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sunday's elections in Japan are shaping up to be a
test of survival for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto _ blamed by a
growing number of people here for sinking the country into its
worst recession since World War II.
	   The elections for half of the 252 seats in Parliament's upper
house are the first in that chamber since Hashimoto came to power
in early 1996.
	   As a member of the more powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself
does not stand for re-election. And his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is in no danger of losing its hold on power _ it has a strong
majority in the lower house.
	   But the elections have become a referendum on the prime
minister's handling of Japan's economic woes, and his party is
expected to face a rough ride.
	   If it does poorly, Hashimoto may have to step down.
	   ``We did everything we could,'' Hashimoto was quoted as saying
Saturday night by Kyodo News as he wrapped up 17 days of
campaigning on behalf of his party. ``All we can do now is to wait
for the judgment.''
	   Concerns about the deepening economic morass, a major factor in
the broader financial crisis throughout Asia, had sent Hashimoto's
support ratings to record lows over the past several weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percent last year _ just as the
economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed
to backtrack two days later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce
the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   He now says he supports cuts.
	   One factor expected to be in the ruling party's favor was voter
apathy _ turnout was expected to be among the lowest ever, possibly
falling below 50 percent of all registered voters.
	   Many analysts said a low turnout was likely because of an
increasing number of voters who don't feel comfortable with any of
the parties' candidates.
	   A higher turnout, they said, would likely hurt the ruling party
because it would bring out more protest votes.
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would mean the ruling party would
again have to seek outside partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have deliberately
distanced themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to
survive.
	   Other opposition parties have also had trouble capitalizing on
the LDP's sagging support.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party is the second largest in Parliament, with
38 seats in the upper house. But Kan's personal popularity has been
clouded by the party's vague stance on major issues.
	   The only other party seen as being in a position to make
significant gains was the Communists, who currently have only 14
seats in the upper house.
	   They were not expected to win enough to become a serious
challenge to the LDP, however.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Passengers continued to suffer long delays
at Athens airport Saturday because of heavy air traffic.
	   Dozens of flights were delayed up to two hours. Air traffic was
complicated by a work-to-rule by Olympic Airways pilots.
	   Airport officials said delays would continue throughout August
because of the Eurocontrol system, which regulates air traffic in
European Union airports.

Divers find German WWII submarine off Greek coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A team of Greek divers found the wreckage
of a German submarine sunk by a mine during World War II, local
media reported Saturday.
	   The U-133 sub was found in the Saronic Gulf south of Athens 78
meters (260 feet) below the sea's surface, according to Athens
daily Ta Nea.
	   The report said the submarine hit a Greek mine in 1942 after
leaving a naval station at Salamina, an island about 10 kilometers
(six miles) west of Athens, where it had docked for repairs.
	   All 45 seamen who were aboard died. The German and Italian
navies were unable to find the wreckage of the 67-meter (220-foot)
long submarine at the time.
	   The diving team could not be reached to confirm the reports.

Tehran mayor finishes his defense, expecting to be found guilty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ In a final address to the court Saturday,
the mayor of Tehran denied all charges of graft but spoke as if he
expected a verdict of guilty.
	   ``As mayor of Tehran, I earned 10 trillion rials (dlrs 3.3
billion) for the Islamic Republic and spent 10 trillion rials for
it. I think that with such great sums some mistakes have to be
accepted. But I never stole anything,'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi
said.
	   Karbaschi has been accused of embezzling millions of dollars'
worth of public funds, in part to finance last year's election
campaign by President Mohammad Khatami.
	   The trial, which has gripped Iran since it opened a month ago,
is widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in the ruling hierarchy
to topple key officials allied with the moderate Khatami. Karbaschi
ran Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   Karbaschi reminded the court of his work in improving Tehran,
where he has reduced pollution and built parks, roads, sports and
cultural centers.
	   ``The transformation of Tehran should be accepted as a miracle,
not by me, but by the Islamic Republic,'' Karbaschi said.
	   Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei replied that Karbaschi's
services would be taken into account in the verdict, which is
expected in about 10 days.
	   But, the judge said, ``if a manager breaks the law, his services
do not preclude him from prosecution.''
	   Karbaschi accused the judge, who is also the prosecutor, of
admitting evidence from city council officials who had given
statements under torture. He also criticized the court for failing
to call witnesses he had requested, and for the lengths it had gone
to investigate him.
	   ``No investigation or prosecution has ever been like this for
anyone, even for oppoisition groups. All the banks have been
ordered to check if they have ever received money in my name. They
have investigated my entire private life over the past 8 years,''
he said, referring to his term as mayor.
	   Karbaschi said the verdict made little difference to him, but
indicated he expected to be found guilty.
	   ``Mr. Mohseni, I think my verdict, according to the law could be
a ban from government office, prison, or a cash fine,'' he told the
judge.
	   ``If you fine me, I have no money. But I have a house that I
would gladly sell. However, I am sure that the people are so kind
to me that they will pay whatever fine I am ordered to pay.
	   ``Ban me from government service and you will have done me a
great service by removing this heavy responsibility from my
shoulders. For long I have wanted to give up public life, but the
officials of the Islamic Republic would never let me.
	   ``If you give me prison, well, that too is a house inside the
Islamic Republic where I can be with my countrymen and have my own
corner,'' he said.
	   Breaking down in the dock, Karbaschi held up two gold coins he
said a teenage girl had posted to him as a contribution to his
defense expenses. They were her life's savings, and she had not
provided her name and address.
	   ``I do not need them. Please send me your name so that I can
return them to you,'' he said, wiping away tears.

Schumacher, criticized for risky driving, heads safety program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Michael Schumacher, criticized by
others drivers for racing tactics they say put them at risk, is the
coverboy of a campaign promoting road safety.
	   The program, promoted by the FIA _ the world governing body of
motor sport _ was announced last year when the FIA slapped
Schumacher's wrist for intentionally crashing into Jacques
Villeneuve in the '97 season-ending race.
	   On the eve of Sunday's British Grand Prix, the German suggested
the FIA needed to enforce its rules more stringently. That drew a
snicker from former series champion Damon Hill.
	   ``I think it's laughable, most of it, utterly laughable,'' Hill
said. ``Since when has he been interested in the regulations? It's
a joke coming from him.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIKA LOOSENS UP: &LR;  Finland's Mika Hakkinen won his first Grand
Prix only last year, taking the season-ending race in Jerez, Spain.
Now he leads the series standings _ has the pole for Sunday's race
_ and is slowly losing his dour, aloof public image.
	   ``When you see me answering questions I look serious because I
am concentrating and thinking what I am saying in a foreign
language,'' he said. ``In private life I am relaxed. That is
different, and I can be different.''
	   Hakkinen, 29, has seen his lead slip from 22 to only six as
Schumacher has won the last two races. Schumacher's Ferrari
teammate Eddie Irvine claims Hakkinen has ``blown'' his chance for
the season tile but the Finn isn't biting.
	   ``It worked on Damon (Hill) a couple of times,'' he said,
referring to the psychological warfare. ``But I don't think I will
crack.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ADVANTAGE MICHAEL: &LR;  Rain is in the forecast for Sunday, which
even his opponents admit gives Schumacher the advantage.
	   ``We haven't beaten him yet in the wet and he's had some amazing
race,'' McLaren's David Coulthard said. ``I don't have a
psychological problem with him, but I do prefer it to be dry.''
	   Rain's a pain for Jacques Villeneuve. ``We haven't really worked
this car on the wet, and the way our rear end works I don't expect
it to be competitive in the wet,'' he said
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GOOD-BYE DAMON? &LR;  Damon Hill, the 1996 series champion, hasn't
won a race since then and after a poor season in '97 with Arrows
and an abysmal one this year with Jordan (he's yet to score a
point), the 37-year-old Briton is talking retirement.
	   ``I don't want to continue in Formula One if I can't have a
chance of running at the front _ and if I feel I am never going to
get the opportunity to do so again.''
	   ``If I can't see any future, with things to achieve, I might
consider quitting _ although it's a little to early in the season
to talk about that yet.''
	   Jordan is reported asking Hill to take a cut in his 4-million
pound (dlrs 6.6 million).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PIT STOPS: &LR;  This is the 50th anniversary of the first British
Grand Prix, which was run at Silverstone, the converted World War
II airfield about an hour northwest of London.
	   Speaking of Ferrari. It has been 40 years since Peter Collins
became the first and only British driver to win this grand prix
driving a Ferrari.
	   Despite denials from both sides of the Atlantic, IndyCar
champion Alex Zanardi is widely reported in Britain to be returning
to Formula One next season with Williams.
	   Heinz-Harald Frentzen apparently will be dropped by Williams and
may head to IndyCar.

Head of problem-plagued Hong Kong airport offers to step down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government saying there was no breach of aviation
security, graf 9
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new
airport offered Saturday to step down once his term ends after
revelations of a security breach added to concerns over cargo
delays so severe that they could reduce economic growth.
	   The dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport has provoked complaints
since it opened Monday about lengthy delays before passengers could
get off airplanes or collect luggage and confusing flight
information.
	   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Po-yan, said he took
responsibility for the problems and offered not to seek
reappointment when his term ends in November, government-run Radio
Hong Kong reported. There was no immediate word from Hong Kong's
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Wong was appointed by the Hong Kong government to a three-year
term as head of the airport authority in 1995.
	   The government said Friday it would appoint two outside experts
and an influential Hong Kong figure to investigate problems at the
airport. Legislators criticized the proposal, saying they want a
panel appointed by the Hong Kong legislature to ensure the
government doesn't try to conceal its own mistakes.
	   Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes
violated safety rules by taking off with the bags of two passengers
who weren't aboard. Airlines are required to remove the bags of
absent passengers to guard against explosives.
	   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage
numbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff
to check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said
Albert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.
	   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport
Authority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport
security.''
	   The Hong Kong government said it was investigating the misplaced
bags but added that there was no breach of aviation security
because all bags are screened before they are cleared for flight.
	   The company handling cargo at the airport imposed a moratorium
on new shipments this week in order to clear away a backlog.
	   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the
company managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of
freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217
million).
	   Delays in shipments have forced sellers of fresh seafood to
close.
	   The delays could reduce economic growth this year by 0.1
percentage points ``provided that the period of moratorium is
limited to what they say,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said
late Friday.
	   It was the first official estimate for losses caused by problems
at the airport.
	   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kilometers
(22 miles) west of the Hong Kong's city center in one of the
world's biggest construction projects.
	   Hong Kong leaders had hoped its opening would revive public
confidence in the midst of Asia's economic crisis. Instead, it has
created a public-relations disaster.
	   ``On the fundamental question on whether the airport has been
put in good hands, the answer is no,'' wrote commentator Chris
Yeung in the South China Morning Post.

Serb forces pound rebel stronghold near Kosovo's second-largest

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls
for a cease-fire, Serb forces pounded ethnic Albanian rebels
outside Kosovo's second-largest city Saturday, prompting hundreds
of terrified civilians to flee the fighting.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb troops
began shelling the town of Lodja, just outside the western city of
Pec, about dawn Friday. At the height of the barrage, shells were
falling at the rate of about one a minute.
	   An independent radio station in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade,
said the barrage ended at midday. Serb forces were trying to
retrieve the bodies of two Serb policemen killed in fighting there
three days ago, Radio B92 said.
	   There was no official government statement on the fighting. But
reporters at the scene confirmed the attack and said smoke could be
seen rising from Lodja, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
The KLA is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of
Yugoslavia.
	   Major world powers oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
ethnic Albanian communities.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo who had been attacking Serb
police and military facilities.
	   Journalists in Pec, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, said terrified Serb and Albanian
civilians were trying to flee, jamming bus stations and filling
their cars with gas.
	   Many of the ethnic Albanians were believed headed for
Montenegro, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) to the north, which has
a large ethnic Albanian population.
	   The League of Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main
party, urged international observers to rush to the area to witness
the fighting. The party, led by moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova,
called on foreign powers to intervene with the Yugoslav government
to stop the attack.
	   Most of Pec's 120,000 residents are ethnic Albanians. But the
population has swelled in recent months as villagers throughout the
region have sought shelter from the war. Ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Lodja is considered a center for arms smuggling from Albania,
about 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the south. The KLA reported heavy
losses when Serb forces shelled the village Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The Serb Media Center said two policemen were killed and several
wounded in the earlier fighting.
	   Fighting in Kosoc has raged despite a demand by the Contact
Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy _ for an immediate cease-fire followed by peace talks between
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and Milosevic.
	   Following the Contact Group meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany,
France and Britain said they would introduced a resolution in the
U.N. Security Council to threatened new measures against the
warring sides if they did not halt the fighting.
	   But diplomatic efforts have so far foundered because of
divisions within the ethnic Albanian community and the refusal of
the KLA to accept Rugova as their leader in future talks. Rugova
has disavowed violence.
	   On Saturday, an Albanian language newspaper quoted a self-styled
KLA spokesman as saying the rebels would keep fighting if they are
excluded from peace talks with the government. Russia and
Yugoslavia have ruled out including the KLA.
	   ``If anybody holds talks with Serbia without our consultation,
we shall continue fighting,'' Jakup Krasniqi told the daily
newspaper Koha Ditore. ``We are against any secret talks.''
	   In the interview, Krasniqi rejected Rugova as a leader who ``has
not fulfilled conditions to be president of Kosovo. ... We need to
free ourselves first and then form political pluralism and later
call for elections.''
	   Rugova also supports independence, and on Friday he called on
Washington and the Europeans to back that call. He is considered an
acceptable negotiating partner because of his non-violent stand.
	   In the latest attempt to move diplomacy forward, a senior
Austrian envoy, Albert Rohan, met Friday with Rugova and KLA
officials. But the Vienna newspaper Die Presse quoted Rohan as
saying that the Albanian leadership was ``totally fragmented'' on
how to proceed.
	   Die Presse also quoted him as saying he found no support among
KLA leaders for autonomy, as called for by the Americans and
Europeans, and instead demanded ``total independence.''

Report: Japanese boats detained in disputed Kuril islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards detained four Japanese
fishing vessels off the disputed Kuril islands and escorted them to
port for investigation, a news agency reported Saturday.
	   ITAR-Tass, citing the border service, said the first boat was
stopped on Friday, 1 kilometer from Tanfilyev Island, which lies a
scant 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of the northern Japanese
island of Hokkaido.
	   Later, authorities said, three other boats were detained near
Iturup Island with fish aboard. All four vessels were taken to the
Russian port of Yuzhno-Kurilsk for questioning.
	   Such incidents are common in the Kuril Islands, which Russia
claimed after World War II. Japan has demanded the islands back,
and they have become the chief irritant in relations between the
two countries.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan signed a global land mine treaty
Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact,
which prohibits the use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.
	   The announcement was made by Queen Noor, King Hussein's
American-born wife.
	   ``I would like to begin by announcing with great pride and hope
that, as of this morning, the Jordanian Cabinet approved the
signing of the Ottawa convention,'' Noor told more than 250 people
from more than 20 countries at a conference on land mines.
	   Delegates at the two-day meeting are discussing ways of
assisting mine victims in the Middle East. It is hosted by the
Landmine Survivors Network, a private organization based in
Washington, D.C.
	   The Ottawa convention, which was reached in Canada last
December, has been signed by 127 nations. Twenty-three nations have
so far ratified the treaty, which must be ratified by 40 states to
take effect. It prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and
transferring of anti-personnel land mines.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Thousands of survivors of
Europe's worst massacre since World War II gathered Saturday here
and in the northern city of Tuzla to demand the world step up
efforts to account for their missing relatives.
	   In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces overran the U.N.-protected
Muslim enclave of Srebrenica while U.N. peacekeepers watched
helplessly. Serb forces are believed to have executed thousands of
Muslim males and buried them in mass graves.
	   About 1,300 bodies have been recovered from mass graves but only
five have been identified. Former Bosnian Serb military chief Gen.
Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic
have been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for
genocide in the Srebrenica massacre. They remain at large.
	   Angered that the world has forgotten them, about 300 women and
children assembled in front of the office of the chief
international representative, Carlos Westendorp, and demanded the
world determine what happened to their husbands, fathers, brothers
and sons.
	   Some of the women complained that international officials _ who
are supposed to be assisting the country's recovery _ earn lavish
salaries while doing nothing to help account for thousands missing
in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war.
	   ``We are damned,'' sobbed Mina Nukic, 50, who lost four sons and
eight other relatives. ``Why are we damned? Nobody wants us.''
	   In Tuzla, more than 3,000 Srebrenica women gathered at the
city's sports center to commemorate the massacre.
	   Ibran Mustafic, president of the ``Mothers of Srebrenica''
association, blamed the country's Muslim president, Alija
Izetbegovic, for allegedly accepting the loss of the enclave.
	   During the ceremony in Sarajevo, protesters unfurled a 100-meter
(yard)-long list of the names of missing men from the eastern
Bosnian town. Mrs. Nukic broke into tears when she saw the names of
four of her sons.
	   ``I hope this will never happen to anybody ever again on this
planet,'' she said.
	   A group of children, who lost one or both parents in Srebrenica,
presented a letter to Westendorp's deputy, Hanns Schumacher.
	   ``We want to remind you that we were not brought by storks to
this world,'' the letter said. ``We had our parents and now we
don't have them any more, and we don't know where they are. How
could you allow 10,000 people to disappear between July 11 and 18,
1995? Why, if we trusted you when we, in God's name, became a
(U.N.) safe zone?''
	   On Friday, Izetbegovic said that Srebrenica and other U.N.
``safe zones'' turned ``out to be the unsafest zones in the
world.''
	   Izetbegovic praised the British U.N. commander at the time, Gen.
Rupert Smith, as a ``fair soldier and a honest man'' for wanting to
help stop the Bosnian Serb attack.
	   But he denounced Smith's superiors _ French Gen. Bernard Janvier
and the senior U.N. official in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi
Akashi of Japan _ for failing to halt the attack.
	   ``Janvier or Akashi, most likely one of them, stopped NATO's
military action against the Serbs,'' Izetbegovic said.

Tehran mayor finishes his defense expecting to be convicted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran denied all charges of
graft against him in his final address to the court Saturday, but
spoke as if he expected to be convicted.
	   ``As mayor of Tehran, I earned 10 trillion rials (dlrs 3.3
billion) for the Islamic Republic and spent 10 trillion rials for
it. I think that with such great sums some mistakes have to be
accepted. But I never stole anything,'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi
said.
	   Karbaschi was accused of embezzling millions of dollars in
public funds, in part to finance last year's election campaign by
President Mohammad Khatami.
	   The trial, which has gripped Iran since it opened a month ago,
is widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in the ruling hierarchy
to topple key officials allied with the moderate Khatami. Karbaschi
ran Khatami's campaign.
	   Karbaschi reminded the court of his work in improving Tehran,
where he has reduced pollution and built parks, roads, sports and
cultural centers.
	   ``The transformation of Tehran should be accepted as a miracle,
not by me, but by the Islamic Republic,'' Karbaschi said.
	   Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei replied that Karbaschi's
services would be taken into account in the verdict, which was
expected in about 10 days.
	   But, the judge said, ``If a manager breaks the law, his services
do not preclude him from prosecution.''
	   Karbaschi accused the judge, who is also the prosecutor, of
admitting evidence from city council officials who gave statements
under torture. He also criticized the court for failing to call
witnesses he had requested, and for the lengths it had gone to
investigate him.
	   ``No investigation or prosecution has ever been like this for
anyone, even for oppoisition groups. All the banks have been
ordered to check if they have ever received money in my name. They
have investigated my entire private life over the past eight
years,'' he said, referring to his term as mayor.
	   ``Mr. Mohseni, I think my verdict, according to the law, could
be a ban from government office, prison, or a cash fine,'' he told
the judge.
	   ``If you fine me, I have no money. But I have a house that I
would gladly sell. However, I am sure that the people are so kind
to me that they will pay whatever fine I am ordered to pay.
	   ``Ban me from government service and you will have done me a
great service by removing this heavy responsibility from my
shoulders. For I have long wanted to give up public life, but the
officials of the Islamic Republic would never let me.
	   ``If you give me prison, well, that too is a house inside the
Islamic Republic where I can be with my countrymen and have my own
corner,'' he said.
	   Breaking down in the dock, Karbaschi held up two gold coins he
said a teenage girl had posted to him as a contribution to his
defense expenses. They were her life's savings, and she had not
provided her name and address.
	   ``I do not need them. Please send me your name so that I can
return them to you,'' he said, wiping away tears.

Basque militants had plans to kidnap a year after official's

killing &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Ermua ceremony set for 17OO GMT, vigil set for 2200 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish Interior Ministry said Saturday
that the Basque separatist group had plans to kidnap someone to
coincide with the first anniversary of the kidnapping and murder of
a young ruling party politician that stunned Spain.
	   An official who declined to be identified said that sleeping
pills found in a bag intercepted by French police on its way to
suspected ETA members July 6 led police to believe that the armed
group was preparing a kidnapping.
	   Meanwhile, people across Spain commemorated the killing of
Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel Blanco, 29, by the separatist
group ETA with demonstrations.
	   A ceremony was to be held later in the afternoon in Ermua,
Blanco's hometown in the northern Basque region, and at midnight
the citizens of Ermua were to gather in memory of the vigil they
held a year ago seeking the young politician's release.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, kidnapped Blanco on July 10, 1997. They shot him in the
head and left him by a roadside two days later, despite the
unprecedented display of outrage at the abduction that led millions
of Spaniards to take to the streets.
	   Since the group started its campaign for the independence of
northern Spain's three Basque provinces in 1968, it has killed
nearly 800 people. The organization has killed eight people,
including five councilors, since the Blanco murder.

Mika Hakkinen takes sixth pole of season in British BP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in last graf Ralf Schumacher to start from back of grid
as qualifying times disallowed &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of McLaren won the
pole for Sunday's British Grand Prix _ his sixth of the season _
with the No. 2 starting spot going to Ferrari's Michael Schumacher.
	   Hakkinen, the series leader with 50 points, followed by
Schumacher (44) and McLaren's David Coulthard (30), clocked a time
Saturday of 1 minute 23.271 seconds, almost a half second ahead of
Schumacher's 1:23.720.
	   Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams _ the defending series champion
and winner of the last two British GPs _ was third in 1:24.102. It
was his best qualifying effort in a season that's yet to yield a
top-three finish.
	   David Coulthard, who has won the other three poles this season,
was fourth for McLaren in 1:24.310 followed by Eddie Irvine of
Ferrari and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.
	   Damon Hill, the 1996 series champion, took seventh in a Jordan
for Sunday's 60-lap race on the Silverstone circuit.
	   Hakkinen, the serious-minded Finn always rated as one of F1's
quickest drivers, has emerged as the man to beat in his McLaren _
the quickest car all season.
	   Hakkinen, 29, has taken four of the eight F1s so far but hasn't
won since the Monaco Grand Prix in late May as his lead has slipped
from 22 to six points.
	   The team has also had various mechanical problems in the last
few races _ specifically fuel problems for Coulthard in the French
Grand Prix two weeks ago.
	   ``I guess it (mechanical problems) are a worry for every team,''
Hakkinen said. ``It's impossible to start thinking about the
problems that could happen.
	   ``We have worked very hard since the last race to understand the
problem and improve the car. I would be surprised if we experienced
problems again.''
	   Rain is forecast for Sunday, suggesting Schumacher could have an
advantage because of his strong wet-weather record, a notion he
dismissed.
	   ``We have been good so far in mixed circumstances, taking a
decision on which way to go,'' Schumacher said. ``We've been lucky,
you can go the right or wrong way.''
	   ``If it's clear what the circumstances are, all of us can drive
well in the rain.''
	   ``The point is how good the Bridgestone or Goodyears (tires)
are, that's something we haven't seen so far in real wet
circumstances.''
	   For Villeneuve, it was just good to be back in the top three _
even if it was just qualifying.
	   ``I didn't remember my way back here, the first time this
year,'' the Canadian said. ``It's good to finally get back for
something.''
	   ``The car the whole weekend has been stronger. It's been
stronger in Magny Cours (French Grand Prix) but here it's stronger
again.''
	   ``We could have put our nose closer to Michael with a perfect
lap,'' he added. ``That's the first time this season we've had a
package strong enough to fight like that.''
	   Ralf Schumacher of Jordan will start at the back of the grid
Sunday after his qualifying times were disallowed for failing to
comply with technical regulations. He qualified 10th.

lucky kiss &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ If they can handle Ronaldo and Co.
at the World Cup final, Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf shouldn't
have any trouble with Manchester United and Arsenal next season.
	   Because of Laurent Blanc's semifinal expulsion, Lebeouf will
partner Desailly at the heart the French defense in Sunday's final
at the Stade de France and next season they will team up for
Chelsea in the Premier League.
	   Desailly has moved from AC Milan after several impressive
seasons in Italy's Serie A to a club which won the European Cup
Winners Cup last season and is bidding to join the Gunners and the
Reds as league title contenders.
	   ``He will do well, there is no doubt about that,'' Desailly said
about Lebeouf's elevation to the French national team.
	   ``We will play well together for Chelsea too _ I am looking
forward to a new experience after two difficult seasons with
Milan.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ European Parliament member Glyn Ford Saturday said
the soccer World Cup had produced a ``sports apartheid'' by
catering for the affluent market over average fans.
	   Ford, a former Labor Party leader in Europe, said the interests
of ``ordinary supporters'', who supported the game every week,
should be secondary to the sophisticated, fashion-conscious ticket
buyer.
	   Writing in the left-wing Tribune newspaper, Ford said that
paying the equivalent to four to six months of a pensioner's income
was considered a deal for the those whose World Cup ``was spent on
the top deck.''
	   He also said the ticket distribution was little short of
criminal, adding that generally the French had about as much
tradition of attending soccer matches as ``the Saudis have of
organizing beer festivals''.
	   ``Selling 60 percent of tickets to French residents was to turn
thousands of French men and women - mainly men - into temporary
ticket touts (scalpers),'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ France still faces one huge
problem ahead of Sunday evening's final. Who will perform the
ritual kiss on Fabien Barthez's bald head just ahead of the
kickoff.
	   Up to now Laurent Blanc got hold of the ears of the goalie,
turned his head forward and pressed his lips on Barthez's shiny
dome.
	   Blanc however, is suspended for the final, and it is tough to
change a winning combination. But Blanc will be on the sidelines,
rooting on his team at the 80,000 Stade de France.
	   Barthez is sure the tradition will continue.
	   ``Laurent will find a way, don't worry,'' he said.

Berlin rocks to techno music in 10th annual Love Parade

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The heart of Berlin rocked Saturday to thumping
electronic music pumped from megaspeakers on 50 floats decked with
huge multicolor balloons for the city's annual ``Love Parade.''
	   Young people, coiffed and dressed colorfully _ and in some
cases, barely dressed _ danced through city streets in the 10th
edition of what has become the world's biggest party for fans of
techno music.
	   Parade organizers estimated the crowd at about 500,000 in the
mid-afternoon despite an hour-long downpour of rain, and expected
to match last year's tally of one million people before day's end.
	   Since the first Love Parade a decade ago when about 50 people
danced behind a Volkswagen van, the psychedelic parade has
blossomed into an event drawing tourists from around the world and
local politicians, including Berlin city-state Interior Minister
Joerg Schoenbohm.
	   ``It's so full that if you're sandwiched among a group of people
who are dancing rhythmically, you simply have to join in,''
Schoenbohm said.
	   The parade has its critics: Environmentalists say trees and soil
are trashed and some city officials complain about post-parade
cleanup and repairs.
	   This year, the Berlin administrative court ordered the parade
organizer _ the multimedia firm Planetcom _ to place dozens of
trash cans along the parade route through the Tiergarten park.
	   The parade spokesman, who goes by the name Disko, said
organizers had complied with the order but that he didn't think it
to help much. He said he expected three times more garbage than
last year.
	   Though the event is registered as a political demonstration and
not a commercial event, hotels, restaurants, bars and dance clubs
rejoice at the extra business, estimated at dlrs 100 million in
1997.
	   After closing ceremonies, the party was expected to continue as
usual through the night at Berlin's numerous techno clubs.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Thousands of survivors of
Europe's worst massacre since World War II gathered in Sarajevo and

Italian director honored in Israel for Holocaust film

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A darkly comic film set in a Nazi concentration
camp might be expected to touch a raw nerve in Israel.
	   But Italian director-actor Roberto Benigni is being praised and
feted as his award-winning film ``Life is Beautiful'' has its
premiere in Jerusalem.
	   Prior to the sold-out screening Saturday at the Jerusalem Film
Festival, Benigni was to receive commendations from Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert and the festival organizers.
	   ``Life is Beautiful,'' directed by and starring Benigni, is
about a father who uses a desperate and sometimes wildly funny ruse
to try to shield his young son from the horrors of a Nazi death
camp: He tells the boy it is all an elaborate game.
	   The film was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival, winning an
emotional ovation and taking home the runner-up prize. ``Life is
Beautiful'' has also enjoyed huge commercial and critical success
in Italy.
	   Benigni's warm reception is noteworthy in Israel, where
sensitivities over the Holocaust often set off controversies in the
arts and elsewhere.
	   Last month, parliament held a public forum on whether to end the
country's 50-year de facto ban on the music of Richard Wagner, a
virulent anti-Semite who was Adolf Hitler's favorite composer.
	   At that hearing, some weeping Holocaust survivors pleaded for a
continuation of the informal ban, saying works of Wagner _ which
were blared over loudspeakers in death camps _ brought back too
many horrific memories.
	   The film's distributors say that while the notion of using humor
in connection with the Holocaust is potentially explosive, the
film's compassion and sensitivity make it a unique vehicle for
exploring the darkness of the Nazi past.
	   ``He uses comedic material, yes, but it is intertwined
throughout the movie with a great sadness,'' said Aryeh Barak of
Forum Films, the distributor. ``People can laugh, but they're not
laughing at the Holocaust.''
	   Before deciding to show the film in Israel, distributors and
festival organizers screened it privately for Israeli critics and
representatives of Holocaust-survivors support groups. Barak said
the response was uniformly positive.
	   Benigni is revered in Italy for a highly physical comic style
that critics liken to that of Charlie Chaplin. Abroad, he is best
known for hilarious, manic performances in Jim Jarmusch's ``Down By
Law'' and ``Night on Earth.''

Kuwait says it has right to sell Iraqi oil tankers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has the right to sell five Iraqi oil
tankers it has held since the 1991 Gulf War, Foreign Minister Sheik
Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said Saturday.
	   Iraq has asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to intervene to
stop Kuwait selling the vessels to scrap-metal merchants.
	   The minister told reporters Kuwait was ``allowed by the United
Nations to sell these tankers,'' and intended to do so, although no
deals have been concluded yet.
	   Sheik Sabah, who spoke as he was leaving parliament, did not say
how Kuwait took possession of the vessels. But the local newspaper
Al-Rai Al-Amm has quoted a unidentified Kuwaiti oil ministry
official as saying the United Nations awarded the vessels to Kuwait
as ``war spoils.''
	   Iraq loaded the tankers with oil and prepared to set them on
fire to prevent the U.S.-led coalition forces from carrying out an
amphibious landing on Kuwait's beaches during the war, the
newspaper reported.
	   Crude has been leaking from the ships and the environmental
costs of keeping them were ``very high,'' the daily said.
	   In a letter to Annan this week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Said al-Sahhaf said Baghdad wanted the tankers back and was
prepared to take legal action against the buyers.
	   Al-Sahhaf said four of the tankers - the Al-Muthanna,
Al-Qadisiyah, Hittin and Tariq ibn Ziyad - were in good condition,
while the Al-Faw was damaged.
	   Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and occupied it until the
coalition liberated the oil-rich emirate seven months later.

Mika Hakkinen takes sixth pole of season in British BP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last two grafs that Olivier Panis to start in last
position on grid and Ralf Schumacher to start second-last; both
have qualifying times disallowed &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of McLaren won the
pole for Sunday's British Grand Prix _ his sixth of the season _
with the No. 2 starting spot going to Ferrari's Michael Schumacher.
	   Hakkinen, the series leader with 50 points, followed by
Schumacher (44) and McLaren's David Coulthard (30), clocked a time
Saturday of 1 minute 23.271 seconds, almost a half second ahead of
Schumacher's 1:23.720.
	   Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams _ the defending series champion
and winner of the last two British GPs _ was third in 1:24.102. It
was his best qualifying effort in a season that's yet to yield a
top-three finish.
	   David Coulthard, who has won the other three poles this season,
was fourth for McLaren in 1:24.310 followed by Eddie Irvine of
Ferrari and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.
	   Damon Hill, the 1996 series champion, took seventh in a Jordan
for Sunday's 60-lap race on the Silverstone circuit.
	   Hakkinen, the serious-minded Finn always rated as one of F1's
quickest drivers, has emerged as the man to beat in his McLaren _
the quickest car all season.
	   Hakkinen, 29, has taken four of the eight F1s so far but hasn't
won since the Monaco Grand Prix in late May as his lead has slipped
from 22 to six points.
	   The team has also had various mechanical problems in the last
few races _ specifically fuel problems for Coulthard in the French
Grand Prix two weeks ago.
	   ``I guess it (mechanical problems) are a worry for every team,''
Hakkinen said. ``It's impossible to start thinking about the
problems that could happen.
	   ``We have worked very hard since the last race to understand the
problem and improve the car. I would be surprised if we experienced
problems again.''
	   Rain is forecast for Sunday, suggesting Schumacher could have an
advantage because of his strong wet-weather record, a notion he
dismissed.
	   ``We have been good so far in mixed circumstances, taking a
decision on which way to go,'' Schumacher said. ``We've been lucky,
you can go the right or wrong way.''
	   ``If it's clear what the circumstances are, all of us can drive
well in the rain.''
	   ``The point is how good the Bridgestone or Goodyears (tires)
are, that's something we haven't seen so far in real wet
circumstances.''
	   For Villeneuve, it was just good to be back in the top three _
even if it was just qualifying.
	   ``I didn't remember my way back here, the first time this
year,'' the Canadian said. ``It's good to finally get back for
something.''
	   ``The car the whole weekend has been stronger. It's been
stronger in Magny Cours (French Grand Prix) but here it's stronger
again.''
	   ``We could have put our nose closer to Michael with a perfect
lap,'' he added. ``That's the first time this season we've had a
package strong enough to fight like that.''
	   Olivier Panis of Prost will start from the final spot on the
grid and Ralf Schumacher of Jordan will start from the second-last
spot after their qualifying times Saturday were disallowed.
	   Both cars failed to meet clearance standards required in the
cockpit in case of emergency exits.

India's Hindu nationalist-led coalition faces new pinpricks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Leaders of the Hindu nationalist party
heading India's ruling coalition Saturday toured a rich
agricultural district in the Himalayan foothills which is caught in
an unseemly tug-of-war between government allies, officials said.
	   Ramesh Pokharial, a provincial minister from Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, spoke to angry farmers in
the Udhamsingh Nagar district of populous Uttar Pradesh state,
which the party wants to include in a new province to be carved
from the state's lower Himalayan stretch.
	   A powerful lobby of rich Sikh landlords in the district spanning
3,400 square kilometers (1,400 square miles) opposes the move. They
have the backing of the Akali Dal, a moderate Sikh ally of the BJP
which has threatened to split from the coalition on the issue. The
Sikh party shares a government with the BJP in the state of Punjab.
	   The Akali Dal holds only eight seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha
or lower house of parliament, but its displeasure is likely to
upset the political balance of the ruling coalition, which has a
slim parliamentary majority.
	   The BJP is already facing an angry ally in the state of Tamil
Nadu, where the powerful AIADMK party wants Vajpayee to dismiss its
rival party's state government under a special constitutional
provision. Vajpayee's refusal nearly brought down the government
last month.
	   Subject to parliament approval, the federal government plans to
carve out three new states out of Uttar Pradesh, neighboring Bihar
province and a poor tribal region of the state of Madhya Pradesh
state in an attempt to ensure better governance.
	   India now has 26 states.
	   The reorganization ran into trouble when Akali Dal leaders met
with Vajpayee and insisted that Udhamsingh Nagar remain in Uttar
Pradesh because its farmers were ``emotionally attached'' to the
province.
	   Of the district's approximately 1 million residents, 200,000 are
Sikhs who own wheat and paddy farms ranging from 18 acres (7
hectares) to several hundred acres (hectares), officials say.
	   But a senior BJP leader said the opposition to the party's plan
was coming under pressure from the landlords who had for years
gotten around a ceiling on land ownership by buying huge farms
under false names.
	   ``The rich farmers have circumvented the law and they fear that
under the new, tribespeople-dominated state, their large land
holdings held under fake names will be taken over,'' said Kalraj
Mishra, minister for tourism in Uttar Pradesh.
	   Over the last 15 years, these farmers have grabbed almost 1,000
acres (400 hectares) of rich agricultural land and 12,000 acres
(4,850 hectares) of forest, Mishra said quoting government
estimates. At least 200 land-grabbing cases are pending in courts,
he added.

Colombian soldiers held in paramilitary massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By Jennifer Abrahamson &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two Colombian army officers are under
military arrest on suspicion of aiding a right-wing paramilitary
group that massacred dozens of civilians in a war-torn southern
state a year ago, prosecutors said.
	   ``There is an evident relationship between paramilitary groups
and the military,'' Hector Pinzon of the public prosecutor's office
told The Associated Press.
	   Sergeants Juan Carlos Gamarra and Jose Miller Urena are the
first to face criminal charges in the case, which exposed alleged
army links to the feared militias who battle guerrillas by
threatening and killing civilians who they suspect of supporting
the rebels.
	   The men arrested Friday must appear before prosecutors charging
them with homicide and ties to the paramilitary group which carried
out the July 1997 massacre in Mapiripan township, about 180 miles
(290 kilometers) southeast of Bogota. They could face trial in
civilian court.
	   Prosecutors did not give details on their alleged involvement in
the five-day assault, which left some 30 townspeople dead, their
bodies hacked up and thrown in a river, witnesses said.
	   The killers reached Mapiripan after flying into a nearby
army-controlled airport, and town officials said local army
commanders ignored repeated calls for help during the attack.
	   An investigation forced two generals into desk jobs and four
intelligence officers out of the army.
	   Alleged army ties to the paramilitary groups has affected U.S.
military aid to Colombia, which is restricted to army units cleared
of involvement in human rights abuses.
	   Despite army and government pledges to reign in the militias,
paramilitary groups have grown, carrying out several new massacres
this year.

Chechens believe British captives in Ingushetia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with reax from relative of
hostage. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen authorities believe that two Britons
kidnapped a more than a year ago are probably being held in
neighboring Ingushetia, a news agency said Saturday.
	   A relative of one of the hostages expressed skepticism about the
report.
	   Magomed Magomadov, the Chechen deputy prosecutor general, told
the ITAR-Tass news agency that the latest tips indicated that the
abductors of charity workers Camilla Carr and Jon James had moved
them to Ingushetia.
	   The British couple, seized on July 4, 1997, were on a charitable
mission in Chechnya with a Quaker affiliate, the Center for
Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   Carr's sister, Alexandra Little, told Britain's Press
Association: ``It is good to hear that they may be somewhere which
is safer than Chechnya but we cannot be certain of the truth of
what is being said.
	   ``After a full year of ups and downs we don't allow ourselves to
get our hopes up until we can get absolute proof. Everything has to
be considered in the context of how the Chechen authorities want to
be perceived.''
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has offered a dlrs 100,000
reward for information leading to the release of the two hostages.
	   Magomadov said he believed that the two Britons were taken to
Ingushetia along with two abducted Hungarians, Istvan Olah and
Gabor Dunaiski.
	   Since its 1994-96 war to secede from Russia, Chechnya has been
plagued by soaring crime, including a wave of kidnapping of
Russians and foreigners motivated by ransom.
	   About 60 abduction victims are in captivity, including the main
Russian envoy to the region.

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ If they can handle Ronaldo and Co.
at the World Cup final, Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf shouldn't
have any trouble with Manchester United and Arsenal next season.
	   Because of Laurent Blanc's semifinal expulsion, Lebeouf will
partner Desailly at the heart the French defense in Sunday's final
at the Stade de France and next season they will team up for
Chelsea in the Premier League.
	   Desailly has moved from AC Milan after several impressive
seasons in Italy's Serie A to a club which won the European Cup
Winners Cup last season and is bidding to join the Gunners and the
Reds as league title contenders.
	   ``He will do well, there is no doubt about that,'' Desailly said
about Lebeouf's elevation to the French national team.
	   ``We will play well together for Chelsea too _ I am looking
forward to a new experience after two difficult seasons with
Milan.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ European Parliament member Glyn Ford Saturday said
the soccer World Cup had produced a ``sports apartheid'' by
catering for the affluent market over average fans.
	   Ford, a former Labor Party leader in Europe, said the interests
of ``ordinary supporters'', who supported the game every week,
should not be secondary to the sophisticated, fashion-conscious
ticket buyer.
	   Writing in the left-wing Tribune newspaper, Ford said that
paying the equivalent to four to six months of a pensioner's income
was considered a deal for the those whose World Cup ``was spent on
the top deck.''
	   He also said the ticket distribution was little short of
criminal, adding that generally the French had about as much
tradition of attending soccer matches as ``the Saudis have of
organizing beer festivals''.
	   ``Selling 60 percent of tickets to French residents was to turn
thousands of French men and women - mainly men - into temporary
ticket touts (scalpers),'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ France still faces one huge
problem ahead of Sunday evening's final. Who will perform the
ritual kiss on Fabien Barthez's bald head just ahead of the
kickoff.
	   Up to now Laurent Blanc got hold of the ears of the goalie,
turned his head forward and pressed his lips on Barthez's shiny
dome.
	   Blanc however, is suspended for the final, and it is tough to
change a winning combination. But Blanc will be on the sidelines,
rooting on his team at the 80,000 Stade de France.
	   Barthez is sure the tradition will continue.
	   ``Laurent will find a way, don't worry,'' he said.

by voters who see him as the best chance to end Ecuador's political
chaos and rampant corruption.
	   Polls show centrist Jamil Mahuad with a wide lead over populist
banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa, but the gap has narrowed recently and
few write Noboa off, given Ecuador's volatile politics.
	   ``At the start of the second electoral round, the difference
between Mahuad and Noboa was about 25 points, but now it's closer
to 10 points,'' said Polibio Cordoba, director of the private
polling company Cedatos.
	   Organizers fear a low turnout as soccer-mad residents of the
Andean nation of 12 million on South America's northwest shoulder
watch the World Cup final Sunday instead of voting.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote-getters in the
first round of voting on May 31. The winner of the runoff will
replace interim President Fabian Alarcon on Aug. 10 and govern
until January 2003.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, earned a reputation as an effective, honest
administrator during his six-year stint as Quito's mayor.
	   He has the support of Ecuador's main political parties and much
of its business community, who see him as most likely to
consolidate its shaky democracy and restore its international image
after recent political fiascoes.
	   Noboa, Ecuador's richest man and a political newcomer, has run a
populist campaign promising to create jobs, build homes for the
poor and dish out the ``beating of the century'' to Ecuador's
political elite.
	   But his campaign has been haunted by claims that he is the
puppet of eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram, who was
removed from power by Congress in February 1997 for ``mental
incapacity'' amid massive street protests, strikes and corruption
allegations.
	   Fears of a military coup abounded during the last days of
Bucaram's government and foreign investors fled, fearing political
instability. Congress named Alarcon as Bucaram's interim
replacement.
	   Bucaram fled to exile in Panama, where he has loudly voiced his
support for Noboa, his friend and political ally.
	   Sunday's election will be the sixth time Ecuadoreans have voted
in the past two years and they are tired of the political carousel,
analysts say. They voted in the first and second rounds of
presidential elections in 1996, two national referendums and the
first round of these elections.
	   ``There is a lot of apathy, weariness and disillusionment among
the population because there have been so many elections and
nothing has changed,'' said political analyst Julio Cesar Trujillo.
	   The campaign has been marred by mudslinging. Mahuad was forced
to admit he had a 10-year-old son from an extramarital affair.
Noboa also claimed that drug money entered Mahuad's campaign
through his brother Eduardo, his campaign treasurer.
	   Mahuad angrily denied the drug money claim, and U.S. Ambassador
Leslie Alexander said there was no evidence of drug money in his
campaign.
	   The winner of the election will inherit an economy devastated by
El Nino-powered floods, high inflation, and the falling price of
its main export, oil.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ They crowded the streets in front of his
house, more than 20,000 of them. Braving gray and drizzly skys,
despite the fear of violent unrest, thousands and thousands of
Nigerians said goodbye Saturday to their fallen hero.
	   Moshood Abiola, Nigiera's leading political prisoner, was buried
during a quiet ceremony in a garden compound at his Lagos
residence.
	   Only a few close friends and colleagues attended the ceremony
with his family, but thousands of mourners waiting near the
compound's entrance gate. Some wept, others prayed, but virtually
everyone in the massive crowd fell silent for the service.
	   ``It's so sad, it's such a sad day for Nigeria,'' said one
mourner who would not give his name. ``How are we going to fill the
void Abiola has left.''
	   The death Tuesday of the popular opposition leader triggered
rioting and violence in Lagos and elsewhere in southern Nigeria,
where at least 55 people have been killed and more than 400
arrested.
	   The apparent winner of annulled presidential elections in 1993,
Abiola was jailed in 1994 after he was accused of treason by the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in early June. Nigeria's
new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, was preparing to
release Abiola when he fell ill and died during a meeting with a
U.S. delegation in the capital of Abuja.
	   An army of riot police and soldiers who had surrounded Abiola's
residence before the funeral pulled back to more than a kilometer
(mile) away, in a rare act of subservience to the demands of the
crowd.
	   Nigerians woke up Saturday to relative calm after three days of
destructive and deadly rioting.
	   A team of foreign pathologists have completed an autopsy on
Abiola, which will help determine the cause of death. Nigeria's
ruling military junta says he died of a heart attack, but the
opposition leader's family suspects foul play.
	   The results of the autopsy _ as well as an earlier examination
performed by the government _ were to be made public after Abiola's
body is buried.
	   Outrage at Abiola's death has begun to fracture the country
along ethnic lines. Abiola, an immensely popular southern
businessman from the Yoruba clan, posed a serious threat to the
ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper
echelons of power are controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas were discovered earlier in the week in
a predominantly Yoruba neighborhood. Fearing more of the same with
the country still raw over Abiola's death, riot police continued to
watch over the city's mosques Saturday.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from their
Hausa and Fulani compatriots, have long resented what they consider
the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other minerals _ by
northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since Abacha's death on June 8, the new military junta has been
scrambling to gain public trust. Abubakar has released a group of
political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also has
vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return the country to civilian rule.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Nigeria's military leaders want to
transfer power to a civilian government and are contemplating the
composition of a government of national unity, Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki said Saturday after returning from Nigeria.
	   Mbeki met with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar during his two-day trip
and, in a briefing with reporters, was upbeat about the intentions
of Nigeria's military ruler and other commanders.
	   ``We are fully convinced that a very important window of
opportunity exists in Nigeria to move the democratization process
forward,'' Mbeki said.
	   Nigeria's military recognizes that civilians should control the
government and that a civilian administration should review the
constitution and handle other important issues, Mbeki said.
	   ``Our sense was that they were very sensitive to the fact that
such a government would have to be broadly based and broadly
acceptable to the Nigerian public,'' Mbeki told a press conference.
	   Mbeki also met with opposition groups and said both they and the
government were concerned about the possibility ethnic violence,
which has erupted since the death of jailed opposition leader
Moshood Abiola last Tuesday, would increase and lead to ``the
break-up of the country.''
	   To further the talks, retired Nigerian Gen. Olesegun Obasanjo,
who ruled Nigeria in the late 1970s and tried to steer Nigeria
toward a democratic path, will visit South Africa next Friday,
Mbeki said.
	   The deputy president's high-profile trip was important in
establishing the diplomatic credentials of the man who is expected
to become South Africa's next president in the 1999 elections.
Mbeki has already taken over most day-to-day management of the
government from President Nelson Mandela, who turns 80 this month
and will retire.
	   Mandela said Wednesday that South Africa is willing to help
resolve the crisis in Nigeria, but that any solution would have to
come from Nigerian leaders themselves.

Singapore says Japanese elections will have major regional impact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As Asia flounders through its worst economic
crisis in decades, the outcome of Sunday's elections in Japan will
have a major impact on the volatile region, a Singapore cabinet
minister said Saturday.
	   The question is whether Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will be
able to win a significant majority in the elections, state-run
television news reported Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu as
saying.
	   Sunday's upper house elections appear to be a survival test for
Hashimoto, who has been blamed by a increasing number of Japanese
for contributing to the country's economic woes.
	   Speaking to reporters at a community event, Hu warned that if
Hashimoto is forced to resign, Singapore will face significant
problems.
	   He said that as Asia's largest economy, Japan's political future
would directly influence the fate of its neighbors, including
Singapore.
	   Leaders across the region and around the world have repeatedly
highlighted the pressing need for economic reform and stimulus of
Japan's ailing economy.
	   Its improvement and return to growth is seen as crucial for
lifting Asian nations out of their economic mire, and preventing
its spread across the globe.

Turin mayor appeals for calm after latest suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Turin's mayor called for calm Saturday after
the latest death of an anarchist, three months after another
apparent suicide prompted thousands of youths to march through the
streets.
	   Prosecutors were investigating the death of Maria Soledad Rosas,
who was reportedly found dead in a shower stall with a bedsheet
around her neck, Italian state TV and Italian news agencies
reported.
	   The 22-year-old woman, described as the daughter of a wealthy
Argentine family, was under house arrest after being indicted a few
days earlier in connection with theft and fire at a small town city
hall in an Alpine Valley where a high-speed train project is being
studied.
	   In April, after the death in jail of another Turin anarchist who
was close to Soledad Rosas, several thousand youths marched through
downtown Turin. Described in the Italian media as ``squatters,''
the protesters smashed windows, set off firecrackers and threw
paint at police cars.
	   After news of Soledad Rosas' death, Turin Mayor Valentino
Castellani issued an appeal calling on all to refrain from
instrumentalizing the death. ``I hope that common sense prevails,''
he added.
	   The youths are against the rich, the government, private
property and the high-speed rail project.
	   The jailed anarchist, Edoardo Massaro, was accused of
involvement in several explosions linked to opposition to the
project. Several journalists were severely beaten by youths at
Massaro's funeral in late March.

 &UR; Border guards fire on Albanian weapons smugglers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Border guards fired on about 30 arms
smugglers who tried to cross into the country from Albania, the
defense ministry said Saturday. There were no casualties and the
smugglers escaped back into Albania.
	   The incident occurred Friday about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
southwest of the Macedonian capital Skopje. It underscores concern
that the conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in nearby
Kosovo could spill over into neighboring countries.
	   Macedonia, formerly part of Yugoslavia, has a substantial and
restive ethnic Albanian community but is trying to stay out of the
conflict in Kosovo.
	   The ministry said the smugglers fired at border guards when
ordered to stop and fled after an exchange of gunfire. The
statement did not say whether weapons were seized or whether they
were destined for Macedonia or Kosovo.
	   Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic that seceded
without a war. About 750 U.N. peacekeepers, half of them Americans,
are deployed along the borders with Serbia and Albania. No U.N.
troops were involved.
	   In an interview Saturday, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
repeated his stand that NATO cannot use his country as base for
possible armed intervention in Kosovo if that would mean attacking
government targets in Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which
in turn is part of Yugoslavia.
	   ``It is one thing that NATO comes to Macedonia to supervise and
prevent arms smuggling of the so-called (Albanian) Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' Gligorov told the daily Dnevnik. ``Macedonia
welcomes that. But if NATO would come here to bring weapons and
carry out invasion of Kosovo, then it's another thing.''

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Prime ministers of Bulgaria, Romania and
Turkey moved Saturday to boost trade among their countries and with
Europe to forestall economic isolation of the region which could
result from possible trade sanctions on Yugoslavia.
	   Bulgaria and Turkey signed a free trade accord under which by
the end of 2001, trade in industrial goods will be fully
liberalized and reduced tariff quotas will be set for agricultural
products.
	   At the first stage of the accord, tariffs will be removed from
60 percent of the bilateral trade, beginning Jan. 1999. Bulgaria
will protect, with slow liberalization, some 3,500 products, which
account for 35 percent of its exports to Turkey.
	   Turkey will apply slow liberalization to 350 products, or 10 per
cent of its exports to Bulgaria.
	   Turkey's prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz, said he expected annual
trade turnover with Bulgaria to grow to dlrs 1 billion a year from
the current 500 million dollars as a result from the accord.
	   A similar accord between Romania and Turkey has helped their
annual trade grow to dlrs 1 billion from dlrs 200 million,
Romania's premier, Radu Vasile, told his Bulgarian counterpart,
Ivan Kostov.
	   Kostov said he hoped Bulgarian-Turkish trade to grow to 2.5
billion dollars a year.
	   At a joint news conference after trilateral talks, Kostov,
Vasile and Yilmaz said their next meeting set for Sept. 12 in
Istanbul will be on measures against organized and transborder
crime, illegal traffic and terrorism.
	   Bulgaria insisted that the three Balkan countries join efforts
to build a second bridge over the Danube river, which forms the
border between Bulgaria and Romania.
	   Both countries are still at odds over where to build the bridge.
The only bridge that now links Bulgaria's Danube port of Ruse with
Romania's Giurgiu has been insufficient to convey sufficient
traffic during previous economic sanctions on Yugoslavia.
	   Bulgaria says it has incurred more than dlrs 3 billion in trade
losses because of them.
	   State radio quoted President Petar Stoyanov as saying a new
bridge ``would prevent Bulgaria from becoming an economic hostage''
should the west impose economic sanctions on Yugoslavia because of
its crackdown on independence seeking Albanians in its southern
province of Kosovo.
	   At separate meetings, officials of the three countries discussed
plans to establish an international Balkan peacekeeping force and
increase the amount of Bulgarian electricity exports to Turkey.
	   Later in the day, the three premiers attended the inauguration
ceremony of a branch of Turkey's Ziraat bank in Sofia. Kostov and
Yilmaz were the first to open accounts in the branch.

Bernhard Haering, Roman Catholic scholar, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Rev. Bernhard Haering, a Roman Catholic scholar
who favored ethics that stress responsibilities rather than blanket
bans, has died at age 85.
	   Haering died July 3 in Germany, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported. ANSA gave no details on where he died, funeral services
or survivors.
	   Haering's opinions, especially in the 1970s, did not always find
favor with the Roman Catholic Church. He denounced the
``discomfort'' in the relationship between Rome-based church
authorities and everyday people and their worries and joys.
	   Haering maintained that the church should progress from what he
called an ``ethics of bans and moralism'' to a ``lay ethics, or one
of responsibility,'' ANSA said.
	   Born in Boettingen, Germany, on Nov. 10, 1912, Haering wrote
many books but also edited columns for weekly magazines.
	   Rev. Raphael Gallagher, who directs a magazine at Rome's Higher
Institute of Moral Theology and who was a student of Haering's,
told Vatican Radio that Haering was a ``simple man, a man of
prayer.''
	   ``For me, Father Haering's novelty is that he had a simple but
very deep intuition,'' Gallagher said.

India steps up diplomatic damage control after nuke tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A top envoy will explain India's
rationale for its nuclear tests to South African President Nelson
Mandela as part of New Delhi's diplomatic damage-control mission,
officials said Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's principal secretary,
Brajesh Mishra, was to leave for Johannesburg on Sunday for
wide-ranging discussions with South African leaders, Foreign Office
spokesman K.C. Singh said.
	   ``The nuclear issue and India's viewpoint on it will definitely
be on the agenda,'' Singh told The Associated Press.
	   He said the visit was part of a series of trips by top Indian
officials to several countries which began after the May 11-13
nuclear tests in an attempt to offset the international outrage
that followed the explosions.
	   Mishra's agenda will also include issues likely to come up
during the 12th summit of the non-aligned movement, which is
scheduled for Durban from August 29 to Sept. 3, officials at
India's ministry of external affairs said.
	   The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan are likely to figure at
the summit, which brings together top leaders from the 113 member
countries.
	   Continuing his high-level discussions on security and
disarmament with United States officials, Vajpayee envoy Jaswant
Singh was to meet his U.S. counterpart, Deputy U.S. Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott, in New Delhi on July 20-21.
	   They met July 9-10 in Frankfurt, Germany, for the second round
of talks on differences between India and the U.S. on the nuclear
issue.
	   Indian Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath will then take the baton
from Mishra and Jaswant Singh, traveling next week to Bonn to meet
German leaders to explain the Indian position on issues including
disarmament, the United News of India news agency said Saturday.
	   Germany, one of India's largest trading partners, suspended aid
and took tough economic measures against New Delhi along with the
United States, Britain and Japan and other industrialized nations
after the nuclear tests. Pakistan followed with rival tests.
	   India has declared a moratorium on further testing and Vajpayee
announced on Friday that New Delhi was ready to discuss the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which it has for years described as
discriminatory and favoring the declared nuclear powers.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls
for a cease-fire, Serb forces pounded ethnic Albanian rebels
outside Kosovo's second-largest city Saturday, prompting hundreds
of terrified civilians to flee the fighting.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb troops
began shelling the town of Lodja, just outside the western city of
Pec, about dawn Saturday. At the height of the barrage, shells were
falling at the rate of about one a minute.
	   An independent radio station in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade,
said the barrage ended at midday. Serb forces were trying to
retrieve the bodies of two Serb policemen killed in fighting there
three days ago, Radio B92 said.
	   There was no official government statement on the fighting. But
reporters at the scene confirmed the attack and said smoke could be
seen rising from Lodja, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
The KLA is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of
Yugoslavia.
	   Major world powers oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
ethnic Albanian communities.
	   On Saturday, the Macedonian defense said guards fired on arms
smugglers Friday trying to cross into the country from Albania.
There were no casualties and the smugglers fled back into Albania.
	   Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, also has a large and
restive Albanian community but has tried to stay out of the Kosovo
conflict.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo who had been attacking Serb
police and military facilities.
	   Journalists in Pec, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, said terrified Serb and Albanian
civilians were trying to flee, jamming bus stations and filling
their cars with gas.
	   Many of the ethnic Albanians were believed headed for
Montenegro, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) to the north, which has
a large ethnic Albanian population.
	   The League of Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main
party, urged international observers to rush to the area to witness
the fighting. The party, led by moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova,
called on foreign powers to intervene with the Yugoslav government
to stop the attack.
	   Most of Pec's 120,000 residents are ethnic Albanians. But the
population has swelled in recent months as villagers throughout the
region have sought shelter from the war. Ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Lodja is considered a center for arms smuggling from Albania,
about 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the south. The KLA reported heavy
losses when Serb forces shelled the village Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The Serb Media Center said two policemen were killed and several
wounded in the earlier fighting.
	   Fighting in Kosoc has raged despite a demand by the Contact
Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy _ for an immediate cease-fire followed by peace talks between
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and Milosevic.
	   Following the Contact Group meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany,
France and Britain said they would introduced a resolution in the
U.N. Security Council to threatened new measures against the
warring sides if they did not halt the fighting.
	   But diplomatic efforts have so far foundered because of
divisions within the ethnic Albanian community and the refusal of
the KLA to accept Rugova as their leader in future talks. Rugova
has disavowed violence.
	   On Saturday, an Albanian language newspaper quoted a self-styled
KLA spokesman as saying the rebels would keep fighting if they are
excluded from peace talks with the government. Russia and
Yugoslavia have ruled out including the KLA.
	   ``If anybody holds talks with Serbia without our consultation,
we shall continue fighting,'' Jakup Krasniqi told the daily
newspaper Koha Ditore. ``We are against any secret talks.''
	   In the interview, Krasniqi rejected Rugova as a leader who ``has
not fulfilled conditions to be president of Kosovo. ... We need to
free ourselves first and then form political pluralism and later
call for elections.''
	   Rugova also supports independence, and on Friday he called on
Washington and the Europeans to back that call. He is considered an
acceptable negotiating partner because of his non-violent stand.
	   In the latest attempt to move diplomacy forward, a senior
Austrian envoy, Albert Rohan, met Friday with Rugova and KLA
officials. But the Vienna newspaper Die Presse quoted Rohan as
saying that the Albanian leadership was ``totally fragmented'' on
how to proceed.
	   Die Presse also quoted him as saying he found no support among
KLA leaders for autonomy, as called for by the Americans and
Europeans, and instead demanded ``total independence.''

Novotna beats Nagyova in the semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Home-crowd favorite Jana Novotna
rallied to beat Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova in three sets Saturday,
earning a place in Sunday's finals of the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech
Open women's tennis tournament.
	   Nagyova, 23rd on the WTA Tour, started with an offensive and
broke the unsteady Wimbledon champion in the fifth game to lead
3-2. Novotna mounted unforced errors and failed to find her rhythm,
losing the first set 2-6.
	   Capitalizing on her perfect movement on the windy, rain-soaked
court, Nagyova broke the Czech's serve again to lead 1-0 in the
second set. But Novotna fought back, improved her serve and started
to make use of her main threat, the chopped backhand, to take the
set 6-2.
	   Nagyova improved her play considerably in the final set, taking
a quick 4-0 lead. But the Czech regained her composure and won six
games in a row, clinching the set 6-4.
	   The other semifinals between Natasha Zvereva of Belarus and
France's Sandrine Testud was delayed due to heavy rain.
	   Testud won the first set 6-3 before losing the second one 4-6.
	   Before the match, Novotna was invited to the Prague Castle to
meet with President Vaclav Vavel, who congratulated her on her
performance at the Wimbledon.
	   ``I was so excited,'' Novotna said. ``After all, not everyone
gets the chance to meet the President.''

Police investigate alleged doping link to Festina team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REWRITES, UPDATES with new info on investigation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ As the 85th Tour de France got underway
Saturday in Dublin, a police investigation opened in France into
whether drugs found in the possession of a health specialist for
the Festina team were destined for the French team's cyclists.
	   Customs officials at the French-Belgian border discovered
steroids and other drugs in a car painted with Festina colors and
driven by a man said to be a team health specialist, police sources
said.
	   Police have not identified the man, jailed since Thursday in
this northern French city.
	   According to the police sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, steroids and the equivalent of 250 doses of a hormone
known as Epo which helps in the transport of oxygen through the
blood, were found in the car.
	   The man has maintained that the drugs were for his personal use,
categorically denying they were destined for the team in the
grueling three-week race.
	   Festina's manager, speaking on France 2 television, said the
team has not been officially notified of the arrest or
investigation.
	   ``All my information today comes from the press ...,'' said
Bruno Roussel, speaking from Dublin, Ireland, where the race begins
this year. ``If on my arrival in France, I'm summoned ... I'll
answer any questions in all honesty with nothing to hide.''
	   Police sources in the southeastern city of Lyon said the team
headquarters there was searched. Information on the search was not
immediately available.
	   The preliminary investigation shows that the health specialist,
starting in Lyon, traveled to Switzerland and Germany, where the
drugs were apparently purchased, then passed through Belgium on his
way to the French port of Calais.
	   Jean-Claude Killy, the skiing champion who is president of the
Societe de Tour de France,'' said he is ``following the affair by
the millimeter.''
	   Festina, one of 21 teams riding in this year's Tour de France,
is among the favorites.

Armenian communists say no to new presidential council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The Armenian Communist Party announced
Saturday that it was refusing to participate in a newly created
presidential council that will advise President Robert Kocharian.
	   Kocharian, a nationalist leader who was elected president in
March, announced the creation of the advisory body last week and
invited the Communists to participate.
	   But in a statement issued Saturday, the party said it regarded
the council as a parallel structure designed to siphon off
influence from parliament.
	   Anyway, said party leader Sergei Badalyan, ``The Communist Party
is not going to share responsibility for the condition of the state
with the parties that supported Robert Kocharian in the election.''

Villeneuve qualifies third; Hakkinen takes pole again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional; RECASTS with fresh quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ It was merely third place, and only
Saturday qualifying at that. But Jacques Villeneuve's smile matched
his glowing, freshly-dyed purple hair.
	   It's been that kind of year for the defending Formula One
champion _ a scruffy, straight-talking Canadian who is more likely
to wear a tie than defend his title this season.
	   Mika Hakkinen won Sunday's pole for the British Grand Prix, the
sixth of nine this season for the series leader. And Michael
Schumacher _ six points behind the Finn in the series standings _
will start alongside on the grid.
	   That was expected and they'll joust until fall for the
championship _ Hakkinen's first and Schumacher's third.
	   Villeneuve in a Williams-Mecachrome was the surprise. By his
standards, it's been a terrible season: his best finish is fourth
and last month at home in the Canadian Grand Prix he was an
embarrassing 10th.
	   ``I didn't remember my way back here, the first time this
year,'' the Canadian told waiting reporters. ``It's good to finally
get back in the top three of something.''
	   ``The car the whole weekend has been stronger. It's been
stronger in Magny Cours (two weeks ago in the French Grand Prix)
but here it's stronger again,'' he added, crediting a re-worked
engine, aerodynamic tuning and improved tires from Goodyear in its
head-to-head with Bridgestone.
	   ``We could have put our nose closer to Michael (Schumacher) with
a perfect lap,'' he added. ``That's the first time this season
we've had a package strong enough to fight like that.''
	   Hakkinen, the series leader with 50 points followed by
Schumacher (44), clocked 1 minute 23.271 at 222.214 kph (138.083
mph) in his McLaren-Mercedes, almost a half second ahead of
Schumacher's Ferrari.
	   David Coulthard, who has won the other three poles and trails
Hakkinen by 20 points in the season standings, qualified a
disappointing fourth for McLaren followed by Eddie Irvine of
Ferrari and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.
	   Hakkinen, the serious-minded Finn, has taken four of the eight
F1s but hasn't won since the Monaco Grand Prix in late May as his
lead has slipped from 22 to six points. Mechanical problems have
cropped up and the ruthless Schumacher has closed with back-to-back
wins.
	   ``I don't feel any stress. I know this track extremely well and
have done more testing here than anybody,'' Hakkinen said.
	   ``I guess it (mechanical problems) are a worry for every team,''
he added. ``I would be surprised if we experienced problems
again.''
	   Rain and wind are forecast for Sunday, suggesting Schumacher
could have an advantage because of his wet-weather record, a notion
he dismissed.
	   ``We have been good so far in mixed circumstances, taking a
decision on which way to go,'' Schumacher said. ``We've been lucky,
you can go the right or wrong way.''
	   ``If it's clear what the circumstances are, all of us can drive
well in the rain.''
	   Coulthard, who has scored only one point in the last three
races, qualified fourth and knows if he keeps stumbling McLaren
will focus its energy on Hakkinen.
	   ``It is the most disappointing moment I can ever remember,'' he
said. ``It's even more disappointing than times when I have been in
a good position in races and had to give them up.
	   ``Qualifying is so important, and being fourth is not very good
_ it could be very damaging for the race and the championship.''
	   Olivier Panis of Prost will start from the final spot on the
grid and Ralf Schumacher of Jordan will start from the second-last
spot after their qualifying times Saturday were disallowed.
	   Schumacher qualified 10th and Panis 16th.
	   Both cars failed to meet clearance standards required in the
cockpit to allow for emergency exits.

Rwanda rebels release Canadian, Rwandan nuns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan rebels on Saturday released
unharmed a Canadian and two Rwandan nuns they had abducted earlier
in the week, a Canadian diplomat said.
	   Sister Gisele Allard, 59, who is from the Quebec area, and her
two Rwandan colleagues were freed on the Rwandan-Ugandan border,
David Foxall, Canadian chief of mission said.
	   ``They appeared out of the bush this morning. They were not
maltreated other than pushed to walk long distance,'' he said.
	   The nuns were abducted on Tuesday after rebels robbed a bank and
a health centre at Bungwe, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Kigali, where the nuns often worked with patients.
	   However, they were not taken away to treat the wounded rebels,
as suspected earlier. Diplomats in Kigali, who spoke on condition
of anonimity, said the rebels told the nuns they were free to go as
soon as they heard news on the radio of their abduction.
	   The nuns have arrived in Kigali, but were not immediately
available for comment.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels
since 1996. The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen
responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killing ended in July 1994 when the Tutsi-led rebels won
power.

Italian director honored in Israel for Holocaust film

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In Holocaust-shadowed Israel, a darkly comic
film set in a Nazi concentration camp might be expected to touch a
raw nerve.
	   Instead, Italian director-actor Roberto Benigni is being praised
and feted as his award-winning film ``Life is Beautiful'' has its
premiere in Israel.
	   Prior to the film's sold-out screening Saturday at the Jerusalem
Film Festival, Benigni was presented with special commendations
from Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and the festival organizers.
	   ``Your movie is made with great sensitivity, with pain, and with
love,'' said Olmert, presenting Benigni with the Medal of
Jerusalem, the city's highest honor.
	   ``Life is Beautiful,'' directed by and starring Benigni, is
about a father who uses a desperate and sometimes wildly funny ruse
to try to shield his young son from the horrors of a Nazi death
camp: telling the boy it is all an elaborate game.
	   The film was a hit at the Cannes festival, winning an emotional
ovation and taking home the runner-up Grand Prize. ``Life is
Beautiful'' has also enjoyed huge commercial and critical success
in Italy.
	   ``It's a tragedy but a Comedian can talk about tragedy when you
do it in a poetic way,'' Benigni said, after accepting the awards.
	   Benigni's warm reception is noteworthy in Israel, where
sensitivities over the Holocaust often set off controversies in the
arts and elsewhere.
	   Last month, parliament held a public forum on whether to end the
country's 50-year de facto ban on the music of Richard Wagner, a
virulent anti-Semite who was Adolf Hitler's favorite composer.
	   At that hearing, some weeping Holocaust survivors pleaded for a
continuation of the informal ban, saying works of Wagner _ which
were blared over loudspeakers in death camps _ brought back too
many horrific memories.
	   The film's distributors say that while the notion of using humor
in connection with the Holocaust is potentially explosive, the
film's compassion and sensitivity make it a unique vehicle for
exploring the darkness of the Nazi past.
	   ``He uses comedic material, yes, but it is intertwined
throughout the movie with a great sadness,'' said Aryeh Barak of
Forum Films, the distributor. ``People can laugh, but they're not
laughing at the Holocaust.''
	   Before deciding to show the film in Israel, distributors and
festival organizers screened it privately for Israeli critics and
representatives of Holocaust-survivors support groups. Barak said
the response was uniformly positive.
	   Benigni is revered in Italy for a highly physical comic style
that critics liken to that of Charlie Chaplin. Abroad, he is best
known for hilarious, manic performances in Jim Jarmusch's ``Down By
Law'' and ``Night on Earth.''

Four rockets hit Kabul airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Four rockets slammed into the airport
in Afghanistan's capital on Saturday, just one day after the United
Nations announced it was suspending its flights into Kabul.
	   Opposition soldiers led by ousted military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood fired the rockets. Invading Taliban troops drove Massood
from Kabul in 1996.
	   Opposition fighters vowed to continue their rocket assaults in
an attempt to prevent Taliban jet fighters from using the runway.
	   Authorities reported no deaths or injuries.
	   The United Nations stopped all its flights into Kabul after
rockets landed at the airport twice while a U.N. aircraft was
parked on the tarmac. The rocketing has occurred almost daily for
the last two weeks.
	   Several of the rockets have gone astray and landed in nearby
residential areas, killing at least three people and wounding
several others.
	   The Taliban army controls about 85 percent of Afghanistan,
including Kabul, while its opponents rule about 15 percent of the
country, mostly in the north. The opposition is a collection of
small groups that mostly represent Afghanistan's ethnic minorities.
	   The warring groups are fighting on at least three separate
battlefields, all north of Kabul.
	   The Taliban religious army says it made strategic gains in
Afghanistan's northwestern province of Faryab, where it captured
the key district of Qaysar from opposition leader Rashid Dostum.
	   Taliban officials in Kabul said it captured about 100 enemy
soldiers in the offensive, which began earlier Saturday.
	   If the Taliban claims are correct this will be the first major
gain for the religious army in northern Afghanistan in more than a
year.
	   Dostum is considered one of the strongest partners in the
anti-Taliban alliance. The former communist general controls the
area around the northern opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The Taliban religious army has imposed a harsh form of Islamic
law in the areas it controls. The Taliban forbids women to work and
girls to go to school, while it requires men to pray in mosques and
publicly beats any who shave their beards.

North Korea demands Washington to lift economic sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.S. State department &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea demanded Saturday that
Washington end economic sanctions against the famine-stricken
communist state to open the way for bigger and swifter supplies of
food and medicine.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency carried the
demand and reported that the country's food stock has run out and
many people were living on ``substitute food,'' meaning grass, bark
and roots.
	   Quoting the U.N. World Food Program and other relief agencies,
North Korea said the outside world needs to ``pay deep concern''
for North Korea, where farm crops were damaged again this year by
bad wether.
	   ``The United States should, in response to their humanitarian
appeal, lift the unreasonable ban on the Democratic People's
Republic of (North) Korea as early as possible for wide-ranging
assistance,'' KCNA said.
	   The U.S. State Department had no comment on North Korea's
demands, but said it stands by its current sanctions, spokeswoman
Carolyn Fleming said.
	   Floods, drought and other bad weather have devastated North
Korea's farm industry since 1995, worsening its chronic food
shortages caused by inefficient collective-farming techniques.
	   On Thursday, North Korea said its potato, barley and wheat crops
were again destroyed this year by drought, tidal waves and cold
weather.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program says North Korea will need
another 500,000 tons of food aid this year in addition to the
800,000 tons already pledged by donor nations.
	   Under the Trading With The Enemy Act, U.S. companies are
prohibited from doing business with North Korea.
	   Washington promised to ease its trade embargoes under a 1994
deal in which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear facilities,
suspected of bomb development. Since then, the United States has
allowed emergency food aid.
	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung is among those who advises
the United States to lift punitive sanctions against North Korea
and use greater political and economic engagement as a means to
moderate the behavior of the world's last Stalinist state.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls
for a cease-fire, Serb forces pounded ethnic Albanian rebels
outside Kosovo's second-largest city Saturday, prompting hundreds
of terrified civilians to flee the fighting.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb troops
began shelling the town of Lodja, just outside the western city of
Pec, about dawn Saturday. At the height of the barrage, shells were
falling at the rate of about one a minute.
	   An independent radio station in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade,
said the barrage ended at midday. Serb forces were trying to
retrieve the bodies of two Serb policemen killed in fighting there
three days ago, Radio B92 said.
	   There was no official government statement on the fighting. But
reporters at the scene confirmed the attack and said smoke could be
seen rising from Lodja, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
The KLA is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of
Yugoslavia.
	   Major world powers oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
ethnic Albanian communities.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo who had been attacking Serb
police and military facilities.
	   The Macedonian defense ministry said Saturday that guards fired
on arms smugglers trying to cross into its territory from Albania
on Friday. There were no casualties and the smugglers fled back
into Albania. Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, has a large
and restive ethnic Albanian community but has tried to stay out of
the Kosovo conflict.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Preliminary findings by a team of visiting
pathologists indicate Nigeria's jailed opposition leader, Moshood

	   Body tissue samples from Abiola were to be flown to Britain and

	   Abiola died Tuesday while meeting with a group of visiting U.S.

had languished in prison for four years, although he was due to be
released right around the time he died.
	   Shortly after his death, Abiola's family said they suspected
foul play. The timing of his death, almost one month to the day
after his arch foe Gen. Sani Abacha's demise, raised a number
eyebrows and hatched a litany of conspiracy theories.

Report: Talks conclude between Russia and IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with talks with IMF reported ending,
Yeltsin talking to Hashimoto. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government ended its talks with a top
official of the International Monetary Fund on Saturday, a news
agency reported, but there was no immediate announcement of an
agreement.
	   Russian negotiator Anatoly Chubais had been meeting with John
Odling-Smee of the IMF in an effort to work out a financial bailout
plan. Russia has been seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
from Western lenders.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, citing unidentified government
sources, said the talks ended late Saturday. The agency also
reported that Chubais had worked out a draft agreement with the
World Bank for unspecified financial assistance to Russia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had met earlier in the day with Chubais
and other top advisers _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadarnov and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin
_ to discuss the progress of the talks with the Western lending
agencies.
	   He also spoke by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, the Kremlin said. There have been reports that Japan is
considering financial assistance to Russia, and Kiriyenko plans to
visit Tokyo on Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Hashimoto expressed support for Russia's
efforts to stabilize its economy and said he was confident the
Russian economy would improve.
	   For the past couple of days, Yeltsin has been reaching out to
international leaders in an apparent effort to bolster his
government's appeal to the West for help.
	   On Friday, the Russian president spoke to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French President Jacques Chirac.
	   He also appealed directly to IMF head Michel Camdessus by
telephone, and pledged to put Russia's fiscal house in order if the
fund comes through with the loan.
	   The Kremlin and the IMF reached agreement on the majority of key
issues during talks between Chubais and Odling-Smee that began
Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning, according to
Andrei Trapeznikov, an aide to Chubais.
	   The talks later Saturday apparently centered on the text on an
agreement on additional financial assistance from the IMF.
	   ``There is every reason to believe the final text of this
document will be coordinated within a few days,'' Trapeznikov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Assuming an agreement is announced, it presumably would be
contingent on passage of the government's economic plan in
parliament, where it could face a difficult fight.
	   The Russian economy was beginning to show signs of growth when
it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, and a drop in
world oil prices.

	   The autopsy findings could help ease tensions in Nigeria,
although Falomo warned they were based on initial evaluations only.
A full autopsy report will be issued after the team conducts
additional forensic tests on the tissue samples.
	   The Nigerian government had already concluded its autopsy on
Abiola and had several of its own doctors attend Saturday's
procedures, Falomo said.
	   The independent autopsy was delayed until the weekend after
Falomo said he would not be able to participate until later in the
week. He did not explain the delay, although it is suspected he
wanted to wait until several foreign experts arrived from overseas
to conduct the study.

Fugitive crime boss arrested in Naples
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW throughout with details of arrest; children in hand, house
like bunker &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Hacking through a concrete wall with an
electric saw, police Saturday broke into the bunker-villa of one of
Italy's top fugitives and captured a reputed crime clan boss as he
hid in an underground tunnel with his two young daughters.
	   ``Don't move, the little girls are here. I surrender, but be
careful about the kids,'' police quoted Francesco Schiavone as
shouting when they cornered him in the hideout.
	   The children, ages three and one, were reportedly fathered by
Schiavone with his wife while he was supposedly on the run and she
was living in the family's heavily fortified villa.
	   Schiavone, 44, the reputed head of the Casalesi crime family, a
leading band in the city's Camorra crime syndicate, had been a
fugitive for more than two years.
	   Investigators say he led one of the bloodiest clan wars that
left dozens dead in the Caserta area over the last few years,
Italian news reports said.
	   Schiavone, dubbed because of his thick, dark beard after
``Sandokan,'' the legendary brigand, had his beard neatly trimmed
when captured and was wearing one of the three dozen pair of
glasses he reportedly kept in the villa, apparently to help avoid
identification.
	   Also in the villa, the Italian news agency ANSA said, were
weapons and ammunition, two refrigerators stocked with enough food
for six people for two weeks, videocassettes that teach how to
paint and several paintings by Schiavone and other crime bosses.
	   Police counted 11 tunnels, stocked with camping equipment and
connected to the house, which could be used to try to hide if
unwanted visitors entered the compound.
	   Schiavone was arrested in 1990 in the villa of a local
commissioner in Casal di Principe. But he went into hiding a few
months later when he was released in jail.
	   Recaptured some time later, he again disappeared while free on
technicalities.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ They crowded the streets in front of his
house, more than 20,000 of them. Braving gray and drizzly skys,
despite the fear of violent unrest, thousands and thousands of
Nigerians said goodbye Saturday to their fallen hero.
	   Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's leading political prisoner, was buried
during a quiet ceremony in a garden compound at his Lagos
residence.
	   Preliminary findings by a team of visiting pathologists indicate
Nigeria's jailed opposition leader, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart
attack, his doctor said Saturday.
	   Dr. Ore Falomo, who attended autopsy procedures carried out
between 2 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. local time Saturday morning, told The
Associated Press that the findings were only preliminary.
	   A team of visiting pathologists was scheduled to hold a press
conference Saturday evening to explain their findings.
	   Body tissue samples from Abiola were to be flown to Britain and
Canada for further testing, said Falomo, Abiola's personal
physician.
	   Only a few close friends and colleagues attended the ceremony
with his family, but thousands of mourners waited near the
compound's entrance gate. Some wept, others prayed, but virtually
everyone in the massive crowd fell silent for the service.
	   ``It's so sad, it's such a sad day for Nigeria,'' said one
mourner who would not give his name. ``How are we going to fill the
void Abiola has left.''
	   The death of Abiola, a champion of democratic freedoms in a
country ruled by brute military force, triggered riots and rampant
destruction. At least 55 people have been killed and more than 400
arrested.

Novotna beats Nagyova in the semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with the other semifinals being finished Sunday

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Home-crowd favorite Jana Novotna
rallied to beat Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova in three sets Saturday,
earning a place in Sunday's finals of the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech
Open women's tennis tournament.
	   But the other semifinals between Natasha Zvereva of Belarus and
France's Sandrine Testud was interrupted due to heavy rain and will
be finished Sunday. Testud won the first set 6-3 before losing the
second one 4-6.
	   Nagyova, 23rd on the WTA Tour, started with an offensive and
broke the unsteady Wimbledon champion in the fifth game to lead
3-2. Novotna mounted unforced errors and failed to find her rhythm,
losing the first set 2-6.
	   Capitalizing on her perfect movement on the windy, rain-soaked
court, Nagyova broke the Czech's serve again to lead 1-0 in the
second set. But Novotna fought back, improved her serve and started
to make use of her main threat, the chopped backhand, to take the
set 6-3.
	   Nagyova improved her play considerably in the final set, taking
a quick 4-0 lead. But the Czech regained her composure and won six
games in a row, clinching the set 7-5.
	   Before the match, Novotna was invited to the Prague Castle to
meet with President Vaclav Vavel, who congratulated her on her
performance at the Wimbledon.
	   ``I was so excited,'' Novotna said. ``After all, not everyone
gets the chance to meet the President.''

Villeneuve qualifies third; Hakkinen takes pole again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in 5th graf Villeneuve has won last two British GPs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ It was merely third place, and only
Saturday qualifying at that. But Jacques Villeneuve's smile matched
his glowing, freshly-dyed purple hair.
	   It's been that kind of year for the defending Formula One
champion _ a scruffy, straight-talking Canadian who is more likely
to wear a tie than defend his title this season.
	   Mika Hakkinen won Sunday's pole for the British Grand Prix, the
sixth of nine this season for the series leader. And Michael
Schumacher _ six points behind the Finn in the series standings _
will start alongside on the grid.
	   That was expected and they'll joust until fall for the
championship _ Hakkinen's first and Schumacher's third.
	   Villeneuve in a Williams-Mecachrome was the surprise. He's won
the last two British GPs and, by his standards, it's been a
terrible season: his best finish is fourth and last month at home
in the Canadian Grand Prix he was an embarrassing 10th.
	   ``I didn't remember my way back here, the first time this
year,'' the Canadian told waiting reporters. ``It's good to finally
get back in the top three of something.''
	   ``The car the whole weekend has been stronger. It's been
stronger in Magny Cours (two weeks ago in the French Grand Prix)
but here it's stronger again,'' he added, crediting a re-worked
engine, aerodynamic tuning and improved tires from Goodyear in its
head-to-head with Bridgestone.
	   ``We could have put our nose closer to Michael (Schumacher) with
a perfect lap,'' he added. ``That's the first time this season
we've had a package strong enough to fight like that.''
	   Hakkinen, the series leader with 50 points followed by
Schumacher (44), clocked 1 minute 23.271 at 222.214 kph (138.083
mph) in his McLaren-Mercedes, almost a half second ahead of
Schumacher's Ferrari.
	   David Coulthard, who has won the other three poles and trails
Hakkinen by 20 points in the season standings, qualified a
disappointing fourth for McLaren followed by Eddie Irvine of
Ferrari and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.
	   Hakkinen, the serious-minded Finn, has taken four of the eight
F1s but hasn't won since the Monaco Grand Prix in late May as his
lead has slipped from 22 to six points. Mechanical problems have
cropped up and the ruthless Schumacher has closed with back-to-back
wins.
	   ``I don't feel any stress. I know this track extremely well and
have done more testing here than anybody,'' Hakkinen said.
	   ``I guess it (mechanical problems) are a worry for every team,''
he added. ``I would be surprised if we experienced problems
again.''
	   Rain and wind are forecast for Sunday, suggesting Schumacher
could have an advantage because of his wet-weather record, a notion
he dismissed.
	   ``We have been good so far in mixed circumstances, taking a
decision on which way to go,'' Schumacher said. ``We've been lucky,
you can go the right or wrong way.''
	   ``If it's clear what the circumstances are, all of us can drive
well in the rain.''
	   Coulthard, who has scored only one point in the last three
races, qualified fourth and knows if he keeps stumbling McLaren
will focus its energy on Hakkinen.
	   ``It is the most disappointing moment I can ever remember,'' he
said. ``It's even more disappointing than times when I have been in
a good position in races and had to give them up.
	   ``Qualifying is so important, and being fourth is not very good
_ it could be very damaging for the race and the championship.''
	   Olivier Panis of Prost will start from the final spot on the
grid and Ralf Schumacher of Jordan will start from the second-last
spot after their qualifying times Saturday were disallowed.
	   Schumacher qualified 10th and Panis 16th.
	   Both cars failed to meet clearance standards required in the
cockpit to allow for emergency exits.

Mueller, Ali knock Koven from finals; Australia tops day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Xeno Mueller of Switzerland and Ali
Ibrahim Ali of Egypt knocked world champion Jamie Koven of the
United States out of the single scull semifinals of the World Cup
international team competition Saturday.
	   Overall Australia came out on top on the day's racing with 11
boats qualified for Sunday's finals. Defending champions Germany
getting 10 boats through and Britain seven.
	   Canada's Derek Porter, 1996 Olympic silver medallist, shot off
the start into an early lead of the race with Mueller and Ali. By
500 meters (yards) Porter, rowing in his first international
regatta this season, was nearly a second up on Ali with Mueller
just behind.
	   But by half way Mueller, the winner in Brussels three weeks ago,
powered through to take the lead and Porter dropped back to third
behind Ali.
	   Koven, recovering from a poor start, was still last at 500
meters. He pushed hard over the final 1,000 meters to pass the
tiring Porter, but just could not catch Mueller and Ali, current
World Cup leader.
	   ``There are a lot of good guys this year and it was a tough
group. I'll go home and train harder,'' said Koven.
	   Joining Mueller and Ali in finals will be the top two of the
other two single scull races Saturday _ Rob Waddell of New Zealand
and Fredrik Bekken of Norway from No. 2 and Iztok Cop of Slovenia,
the defending World Cup champion, and Vaclav Chalupa of the Czech
Republic from No. 3.
	   Waddell and Bekken kept out world silver and bronze medallists
Andre Willms of Germany and Greg Searle of Britain.
	   Searle was rowing with a broken toe following an attempt to
score a penalty on a football machine game at Heathrow airport on
the way out to Lucerne.
	   In the coxless fours the British world champion quartet with
multi Olympic gold medallists Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent
aboard won their semifinal comfortably in 6 minutes 31.97 seconds.
	   They will meet for the first time Australia's new version of the
Oarsome Foursome, unbeaten this season, who looked ominously strong
as they won their tougher semifinal in a much faster time of
6:22.03, easily beating Munich winners Romania.
	   Germany's world double sculls champions and 1997 World Cup
champions Stephan Volkert and Andreas Hajek also fell short,
finishing a distant fourth in their semi-final. Teammates Michelle
Darvill and Angelika Brand, the women's lightweight double scull
world and World Cup champions, suffered the same fate in their
race.
	   Germany tops the overall rankings after two regattas with 87
points, just ahead of Britain on 82. Australia missed the first
regatta of the series and currently lie sixth overall on 43 points.

Westwood wins Loch Lomond
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Lee Westwood won the Loch Lomond golf
tournament by four strokes Saturday to reclaim the European No.1
spot and set himself up for a dlrs 1 million bonus at next week's
British Open.
	   Westwood finished with the 8-under total 276 after a 1-under
closing round of 70, well clear of a group of five players who
shared second place on the 4-under-par total 280.
	   The 25-year-old Englishman was the only player to break par in
all four rounds of the 850,000-pound (dlrs 1.41 million)
tournament.
	   The 141,660-pound (dlrs 235,155) winner's check was enough for
him to replace Colin Montgomerie on top of the European tour money
list.
	   Loch Lomond was his third win in four tournaments on the
European tour and his seventh title this year, taking his winnings
past 1.5 million-pounds (dlrs 2.49 million).
	   The tournament's sponsor put up a dlrs 1 million bonus as an
incentive for any player who could win the Loch Lomond and the
British Open at Royal Birkdale next week.
	   Westwood said the bonus would be good but winning the British
Open was worth more than money.
	   ``If I was to win the Open, the million dollars extra would be
fantastic. But actually winning the Open means more to me,'' he
said.
	   ``I'm playing well at the moment. Every day I'm playing better
and better, getting my iron shots close as well. Hopefully I can
keep it going for next week.''
	   Joint runners-up were Ian Woosnam, who scored a fourth
round-best 66, David Howell (71), Argentina's Eduardo Romero (68),
Australian Robert Allenby (68) and Sweden's Dennis Edlund (74).
	   Edlund, who shared or threatened Westwood's lead until the last
four holes, missed a long-range putt on the last which could have
given him outright second place.
	   Colin Montgomerie shot 70 to finish in joint seventh place with
Gary Orr at the 3-under total 281.
	   Defending champion Tom Lehman shot a 72 to finish a stroke
further back at 282.
	   Americans Stewart Cink and Craig Hainline finished even-par 284.
	   There was little joy for tournament halfway mark leader Ross
Drummond, who was in contention to win back his European tour card
until a final-round 80 left in him 36th place.

Gay group says Warsaw authorities barred their street demo

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Organizers of Poland's first gay festival
said the city refused to let them hold a street demonstration
Saturday, and they demanded an end to discrimination against gays.
	   ``Not only homosexuals but all other minorities encounter acts
of more or less direct discrimination every day,'' Warsaw's Gay
Pride festival said in a statement.
	   The group said it applied for permission to hold a street
demonstration in historic Castle Square, in what would have been
the only outdoor event for the festival, which opened Thursday.
	   Warsaw officials did not explain why they declined to give their
permission, the group said. The city officials were not immediately
available for comment Saturday.
	   Three gay men with their faces masked and wearing sun glasses
demonstrated anyway in the square to protest the decision. They
declined to give their names, saying only that they were a
journalist, baker and manager.
	   Discrimination against homosexuals in overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Poland is widespread and accepted. The Solidarity-led
government has strong links to the Catholic Church, which
traditionally opposes homosexuality.
	   The minister in charge of family policy, Kazimierz Kapera,
publicly denounced homosexuals as deviants in 1990 during his term
as deputy health minister.
	   The Gay Pride festival, organized by Poland's gay monthly
magazine New Man and the Rainbow counseling center, features gay
films, cabaret and a photo exhibition.
	   Organizers also gathered signatures for an appeal to Poland's
president to promote greater tolerance.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls
for a cease-fire, Serb forces pounded ethnic Albanian rebels
outside Kosovo's second-largest city Saturday, prompting hundreds
of terrified civilians to flee the fighting.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb troops
began shelling the town of Lodja, just outside the western city of
Pec, about dawn Saturday. At the height of the barrage, shells were
falling at the rate of about one a minute.
	   An independent radio station in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade,
said the barrage ended at midday. Serb forces were trying to
retrieve the bodies of two Serb policemen killed in fighting there
three days ago, Radio B92 said.
	   In confirming the fighting, the Serb Media Center, quoting
government sources, said police regained control of the road
linking Pec with Gorazdevac, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the
southeast, during an ``action'' Saturday to locate two missing
policemen.
	   According to the center, police were fired at as soon as they
approached Lodja and ``after two hours of battle, armed Albanians
ran away.'' The two policemen were not found, but no police were
wounded in Saturday's battle despite ``dead and wounded'' among the
Albanians, the Serb report said.
	   Albanian sources said a 78-year-old Albanian man was killed and
three others were wounded in Lodja. But the Albanians claimed
police failed to capture the village despite ``one of the biggest
attacks'' by Serb forces.
	   In addition, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting Saturday
in the Decani area, east of Pec, and near the border town of
Djakovica.
	   There was no independent confirmation of casualty claims. But
reporters at the scene said smoke could be seen rising from Lodja,
a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is fighting for
independence from Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Major world powers oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
ethnic Albanian communities.
	   On Saturday, the Macedonian defense ministry said guards fired
on arms smugglers Friday trying to cross into the country from
Albania. There were no casualties and the smugglers fled back into
Albania.

Colombian ship owner wins lawsuit over search for drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ A Curacao court awarded a Colombian
ship owner and his crew dlrs 4,800, saying the vessel was unjustly
detained for five days while U.S. and local drug agents looked for
cocaine.
	   The Netherlands Antilles coast guard stopped the cargo ship
Eugenio on June 25 about 18 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast of
Curacao. The vessel was transporting a new speedboat to Trinidad
from the Colombian port of Cartagena.
	   Informants told the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency that the ship
was carrying 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) to 1,000 kilograms (2,200
pounds) of cocaine.
	   U.S. and local coast guard officials boarded the ship, took it
to Willemstad, jailed the crew and emptied the vessel's water and
fuel tanks to look for drugs. None were found.
	   The ship's owner, Elias Iguaran-Iguaran, demanded dlrs 110,000
for the delay. The court ordered the Netherlands Antilles
government to pay him dlrs 1,100 and give dlrs 340 to each of the
11 crew members.

Report: No agreement yet between Russia and IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with talks to resume Sunday. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Talks between Russia and the International
Monetary Fund apparently hit a snag Saturday, when the government
had hoped to announce an agreement on a financial bailout.
	   Russian negotiator Anatoly Chubais met with John Odling-Smee of
the IMF in an effort to work out a loan, but their talks ended
inconclusively late in the day, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Talks between the two sides were to continue Sunday. Russia has
been seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion from Western
lenders.
	   Earlier, ITAR-Tass reported that Chubais had worked out a draft
agreement with the World Bank for unspecified financial assistance
to Russia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had met earlier in the day with Chubais
and other top advisers _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadarnov and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin
_ to urge them to finish up their talks with the Western lending
agencies.
	   However, according to ITAR-Tass, Chubais aide Andrei Trapeznikov
said the IMF had insisted that some issues still needed to be
worked out, and they apparently were still unresolved by the end of
the day.
	   Yeltsin also spoke by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Kremlin said. There have been reports that
Japan is considering financial assistance to Russia, and Kiriyenko
plans to visit Tokyo on Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Hashimoto expressed support for Russia's
efforts to stabilize its economy and said he was confident the
Russian economy would improve.
	   For the past couple of days, Yeltsin has been reaching out to
international leaders in an apparent effort to bolster his
government's appeal to the West for help.
	   On Friday, the Russian president spoke to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French President Jacques Chirac.
	   He also appealed directly to IMF head Michel Camdessus by
telephone, and pledged to put Russia's fiscal house in order if the
fund comes through with the loan.
	   The Kremlin and the IMF reached agreement on the majority of key
issues during talks between Chubais and Odling-Smee that began
Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning, according to
Trapeznikov.
	   The talks later Saturday apparently centered on the text on an
agreement on additional financial assistance from the IMF.
	   ``There is every reason to believe the final text of this
document will be coordinated within a few days,'' Trapeznikov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Assuming an agreement is announced, it presumably would be
contingent on passage of the government's economic plan in
parliament, where it could face a difficult fight.
	   The Russian economy was beginning to show signs of growth when
it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, and a drop in
world oil prices.

British praise slick police operation credited with foiling

	   LONDON (AP) _ It would have been the first terrorist strike on
the British mainland since Northern Ireland's peace agreement:
Irish republican dissidents with explosives were heading to targets
across London at the height of rush-hour. With just minutes to
spare, police say, they swooped in and foiled the plot.
	   Government leaders, ordinary Britons and the media praised
British and Irish security forces Saturday for a slick joint
operation credited with saving laves. ``Minutes From A Massacre,''
said the banner headline in The Sun, Britain's largest-circulation
tabloid. ``Police Foil Terrorist Bomb Plot in London,'' echoed The
Daily Telegraph, a conservative broadsheet.
	   The police action began Friday morning with a raid in the Irish
town of Dundalk that authorities said uncovered guns, ammunition,
bomb parts and important documents. By Friday evening, four people
were under arrest in the Irish Republic and six in London _ three
of them in possession of explosive devices.
	   The four men and two women arrested in London were questioned
Saturday and can be held without charge for up to seven days under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The four people arrested in the
Irish cities of Dublin, Dundalk and Wexford can be held for 48
hours without charge.
	   None has been identified.
	   Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, head
of the anti-terrorist branch, said the arrests were the result of
``prolonged investigation into dissident criminal Irish republican
terrorist groups'' _ but police were not saying which splinter
group or groups were involved or releasing any details of the
arrests.
	   Media speculation in Britain and on both sides of the Irish
border focused on the so-called Real IRA, whose leader is believed
to be the IRA's reputed former chief quartermaster. Michael
McKevitt defected from the Irish Republican Army leadership in
October after unsuccessfully challenging the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
Party's support for Northern Ireland's peace process.
	   IRA dissidents have said they will settle for nothing short of a
union between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. They have
attacked mainly in Northern Ireland, although Irish police in April
intercepted a car packed with explosives just before it was to
board a ferry to Britain and arrested several members of the Real
IRA.
	   The Guardian, a liberal broadsheet, said the arrests indicate
that the Real IRA ``appears to have been either deeply infiltrated
by the security forces or at least kept under very close
surveillance.''
	   Ever since the April peace agreement, which was approved by 71.1
percent of Northern Ireland's population, security services have
been concerned that dissident republican groups opposed to the
accord might resort to violence.
	   Friday's bombings would have taken place during the worst week
of violence in Northern Ireland since the peace agreement _ sparked
by a government commission's ban on Protestants marching through a
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast.
	   ``The critical timing of the (foiled) attack ... could only have
been designed to put further pressure on the peace process and
provoke reaction by hard-line loyalists already on edge over the
events in Portadown,'' The Independent, a liberal broadsheet, said
Saturday.
	   The attacks appeared timed to create maximum impact.
	   The evening rush-hour had started when police seized two men
near the South Bank University in south London and another near
University College in central London, all carrying explosive
devices.
	   ``We believe these terrorist devices were intended to be used in
London within minutes,'' assistant commissioner Grieve said.
	   Not long afterwards, a woman was arrested on Oxford Street,
London's main shopping thoroughfare. About 20 police then
surrounded a car near the new British Library and arrested a young
man and woman.
	   Many Londoners were grateful no bombs went off, but unhappy at
the prospect of more violence.
	   ``We thought all the problems with Ireland were coming to a
close, but it seems there are some people who don't want peace,''
office worker Tony Mulcahy was quoted as telling The Mirror.

Bahamian deputy prime minister still in hospital after collapse

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The deputy prime minister of the Bahamas
remained hospitalized Saturday, recovering from a collapse during
an Independence Week celebration.
	   Minister Frank Watson, 58, was in stable condition at Princess
Margaret Hospital in Nassau, and doctors were running tests to
determine why he fainted during the ceremony Thursday night.
	   ``What we can say is that the deputy prime minister does not
appear to have suffered a heart attack,'' said Ronnie Knowles, a
doctor and the country's minister of health.
	   Watson passed out while Governor General Sir Orville Turnquest
was reviewing police and military forces at Clifford Park in
Nassau.
	   Doctors in the crowd, including opposition parliament member
Bernard Nottage, rushed to help. After a few minutes, Watson
regained consciousness and was able to walk to a car.
	   The police and defense force bands continued to play, and most
of the estimated 30,000 to 40,000 people at the event were unaware
of Watson's collapse.
	   The Bahamas is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its
independence from Britain this week.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ They crowded the streets in front of his
house, more than 20,000 of them. Despite gray and drizzly skies,
despite fears of violence, thousands upon thousands of Nigerians
said goodbye Saturday to their fallen hero.
	   Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's leading political prisoner, was buried
in a quiet ceremony in a garden compound at his Lagos residence. He
died Tuesday while still in custody.
	   Preliminary findings by a team of visiting pathologists indicate
that Abiola died of a heart attack, his personal physician and the
team members said Saturday.
	   Dr. Ore Falomo, who attended an autopsy earlier Saturday, told
The Associated Press that the findings were preliminary. Tissue
samples were to be flown to Britain and Canada for further testing.
	   Nigeria's ruling military junta said Abiola died of a heart
attack, but the opposition leader's family suspected foul play and
brought in their own pathologists to perform an autopsy.
	   ``In our opinion the mechanism of death is due to a rapid
deterioration in a diseased heart,'' Canadian Dr. James Young told
reporters. ``At this time, our preliminary opinion is that death
was due to natural causes as a result of his long standing heart
disease.''
	   Young, the chief coroner in the Canadian province of Ontario,
was one of several forensic scientists flown to Nigeria to conduct
the independent autopsy.
	   Only a few close friends and colleagues attended the burial with
his family, but thousands of mourners waited near the gate. Some
wept, others prayed, but virtually everyone in the massive crowd
fell silent for the service.
	   ``It's so sad, it's such a sad day for Nigeria,'' said one
mourner who would not give his name. ``How are we going to fill the
void Abiola has left?''
	   The death of the popular opposition leader triggered rioting and
violence in Lagos and elsewhere in southern Nigeria, where at least
55 people have been killed and more than 400 arrested.
	   The apparent winner of annulled presidential elections in 1993,
Abiola was jailed in 1994 by Gen. Sani Abacha. Abacha died in June.
Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, was
preparing to release Abiola, 60, when he fell ill and died during a
meeting with a U.S. delegation in Abuja.
	   The riot police and soldiers who surrounded Abiola's residence
before the funeral pulled back more than a kilometer (mile) in a
rare act of submission to the will of the crowd.
	   Outrage at Abiola's death has begun to fracture the country
along ethnic lines. Abiola, an immensely popular southern
businessman from the Yoruba clan, posed a serious threat to the
ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper
echelons of power are controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas were discovered earlier in the week in
a predominantly Yoruba neighborhood. Fearing more of the same with
Nigerians still raw over Abiola's death, riot police continued to
watch over the city's mosques Saturday.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from their
Hausa and Fulani compatriots, have long resented what they consider
the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other minerals _ by
northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since Abacha's death on June 8, the new military junta has been
scrambling to gain public trust. Abubakar has released a group of
political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also has
vowed, albeit vaguely, to return the country to civilian rule.

Cuba suffering severe drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A severe drought in Cuba has forced many
people to leave their homes for other regions, while authorities in
parched eastern communities have been delivering water by truck and
animal, the Cuban government's news agency reported.
	   Rainfall in June was its lowest for the month in the last four
decades, Prensa Latina reported, without giving specific figures.
In the eastern province of Guantanamo, hundreds of acres of crops
have been lost. Coffee and honey production have suffered, as have
fishing and sugar cane harvesting.
	   Many people are temporarily relocating because of the drought,
Prensa Latina said, citing Pedro Miret, the vice president of the
Council of Ministers. In areas where natural wells have run dry,
water is being hauled in for thousands of people and livestock, the
National Information Agency said in the report, monitored in Mexico
City.

Mueller, Ali knock Koven from finals; Australia tops day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Xeno Mueller of Switzerland and Ali
Ibrahim Ali of Egypt knocked world champion Jamie Koven of the
United States out of the single scull semifinals of the World Cup
international team competition Saturday.
	   Overall Australia came out on top on the day's racing with 11
boats qualified for Sunday's finals. Defending champions Germany
getting 10 boats through and Britain seven.
	   Canada's Derek Porter, 1996 Olympic silver medallist, shot off
into an early lead in the race with Mueller and Ali. By 500 meters
(yards) Porter, rowing in his first international regatta this
season, was close to Ali with Mueller just behind.
	   But at about half way Mueller, the winner in Brussels three
weeks ago, powered through to take the lead and Porter dropped back
to third behind Ali.
	   Koven, recovering from a poor start, was last at 500 meters. He
pushed hard over the final 1,000 meters to pass the tiring Porter,
but just could not catch Mueller and Ali, current World Cup leader.
	   ``There are a lot of good guys this year and it was a tough
group. I'll go home and train harder,'' said Koven.
	   Joining Mueller and Ali in the finals will be the top two of the
other single scull races Saturday _ Rob Waddell of New Zealand and
Fredrik Bekken of Norway from No. 2 and Iztok Cop of Slovenia, the
defending World Cup champion, and Vaclav Chalupa of the Czech
Republic from No. 3.
	   Waddell and Bekken defeated world silver and bronze medallists
Andre Willms of Germany and Greg Searle of Britain. Searle broke
his toe while playing a football machine game at Heathrow airport
on the way out to Lucerne.
	   In the coxless fours the British world champion quartet with
multi Olympic gold medallists Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent
aboard won their semifinal comfortably in 6 minutes 31.97 seconds.
	   They will compete for the first time against Australia's new
version of the Oarsome Foursome, who looked ominously strong as
they won their tougher semifinal in a much faster time of 6:22.03,
easily beating Munich winners Romania.
	   Germany's world double sculls champions and 1997 World Cup
champions Stephan Volkert and Andreas Hajek also fell short,
finishing a distant fourth in their semi-final. Teammates Michelle
Darvill and Angelika Brand, the women's lightweight double scull
world and World Cup champions, suffered the same fate in their
race.
	   Germany tops the overall rankings after two regattas with 87
points, just ahead of Britain on 82. Australia missed the first
regatta of the series and currently lie sixth overall on 43 points.

Sweden's Gustafsson only one win away from writing clay classic
</HEADLINE>
history &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
overcame a tough challenge from compatriot Thomas Johansson
Saturday to move into the final and a chance to be the first player
to win an unprecedented fourth title in the Swedish Open ATP
claycourt classic.
	   In the final he will play Andrey Medvedev, whom he beat in the
1996 final.
	   The 31-year-old claycourt specialist beat Johansson 6-3, 4-6,
7-5. He broke Johansson, a 23-year-old currently ranked 41st, twice
in the first set to win 6-3. But the sixth seed bounced back in the
second set, winning it 6-4 after two breaks. In the third set
Gustafsson broke Johansson early to move into a 5-2 and he looked a
sure winner. But the younger Johansson surged back with two breaks
to make it 5-5. Gustafsson broke again and then held service to
take the set 7-5.
	   Should Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, go all
the way again, he will not only improve upon his current 26th
ranking but also top such greats as Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander,
the only others to win three titles in this seaside tourney.
	   In the other semifinal, unseeded Andrey Medvedev of Ukraine beat
seventh seed Dominic Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). The
25-year-old Medvedev broke the fast-rising 21-year-old from
Bratislava, currently 44th in the rankings, twice in the first set
for 6-3. In the second set Medvedev broke Hrbaty to move into a 3-0
lead but the Slovak came back to level the score to 3-3. Then they
held service ending the set in a tiebreaker.
	   Medvedev worked hard before advancing to the final, finishing
two matches Friday. First he completed a tough seesaw battle with
Australian Richard Fromberg, Swedish Open winner here in 1990, 7-6
(7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-2). Then the Ukrainian, who lost the final at
Bastad in 1966 to Gustafsson, straight-setted third-seeded Italian
Andrea Gaudenzi 6-3, 6-4 in the afternoon.
	   In the doubles final South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval
face Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson who advanced as
Italians Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso pulled out due to
illness in their semifinal.

Indian postal workers reject government offer on third day of
</HEADLINE>
strike &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Mountains of undelivered mail piled up
in Indian post offices Saturday as postal workers rejected a
government proposal to increase wages and vowed to carry on with
their nationwide strike.
	   ``We are not going to call off our strike till all demands are
met and we have decided to intensify our agitation from Monday,''
R.L. Bhattacharya, secretary-general of the National Federation of
Postal Employees, was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India
news agency.
	   An estimated 650,000 workers in India's postal department went
on strike Thursday for higher wages and bonuses.
	   Leaders of postal workers' unions said the government agreed
Saturday to most of their demands, including revised salaries for
permanent employees and employment benefits for about 300,000
temporary workers called Extra Departmental Agents who not get
perks like their colleagues.
	   But the government had refused to grant lifelong pensions to the
EDA workers, forcing the agitators to press on with their demands,
Bhattacharya said.
	   Post offices are being staffed by short-term workers, retired
postal department employees and home guards but the alternate
arrangements have not helped move the huge backlog of unsorted
mail, newspaper reports said.
	   The strikers had demanded that their wages be increased to 3,050
rupees (dlrs 72) a month from the 2,750 rupees (dlrs 65) that most
postal employees get. The average per capita income in India, one
of the world's poorest countries, is dlrs 450.
	   Opposition parties have supported the demands in parliament and
accused the government of not doing enough to resolve the problem.

Tunisia Saturday on his way to visit Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
Egypt's official news agency reported.
	   Arafat's intended visit to Gadhafi, who had surgery on a broken
hip on Monday, follows that of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
the presidents of Chad and Niger earlier in the week.
	   Arafat's adviser in Gaza, Marwan Kanafani, told The Associated
Press that the Palestinian leader aimed to ``to wish Gadhafi well
after his leg surgery.''
	   Kanafani said Arafat crossed from the Gaza Strip into Egypt.
	   He appeared to have taken a flight from an airport close to the
Egyptian border to Tunisia.
	   In a report from Tunis, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said
Arafat landed on the Tunisian island of Jerba, near the Libyan
border, and took a car to the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
	   Arafat's roundabout route showed he was respecting the U.N.
embargo which bans flights to and from Libya.
	   Mubarak flew direct to Libya on Thursday, but only after
receiving U.N. approval to override the embargo. It was the first
time the world body had authorized such a move for a world leader.
	   In announcing that it had authorized the Mubarak flight, U.N.
officials in New York said no such permission had been granted to
the presidents of Chad and Niger, who arrived days before Mubarak.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the embargo on Libya in 1992
in a bid to force Gadhafi to turn over two Libyans wanted for the
1988 bombing of an American airliner over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie in which 270 people were killed.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Speed specialist Chris Boardman of
Britain won Saturday's prologue of the 85th Tour de France, but the
Irish start to the world's greatest cycling race was overshadowed
by a drug scandal involving France's top-rated Festina team.
	   Boardman coasted to victory on the 3.5-mile (5.6 km) route
through central Dublin in a time of 6 minutes, 12.36 seconds, more
than four seconds better than the second-place finisher, Spain's
Abraham Olano.
	   France's Laurent Jalabert, the world time trial champion, was
third, five seconds behind Jalabert. Defending Tour champion Jan
Ullrich of Germany was sixth, also five seconds behind.
	   It was Boardman's third victory in five years in the Tour's
prologue.
	   `` I really didn't expect to win today,'' he said. ``I didn't
feel very good this morning, but it came right on the day. ... The
crowd really helped. The noise was incredible.''

U.S. transportation secretary meets Mugabe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe
discussed economic cooperation and trade relations with U.S.
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater for 90 minutes Saturday.
	   Slater said the ``Safe Skies'' initiative, which he came to
Harare to promote at the behest of U.S. President Bill Clinton, was
a major part of the American desire to ``really engage with
Africa,'' helping create a safe airline environment conducive to
the continent's integration with the global economy.
	   ``We are very serious about this,'' Slater said after his
meeting with Mugabe at the latter's official residence.
	   Slater said they exchanged ideas on increasing employment in
Zimbabwe, which has an estimated 2 million jobless among an urban
population of 5 million. Zimbabwe has seen food riots and serious
unrest this year, which government critics blame on lack of
effective democracy and chronic economic mismanagement.
	   Slater announced that eight major U.S. universities would send a
delegation in August to examine ways of making Zimbabwe a tourist
destination for their alumni.
	   At a one-day conference Friday, Slater fielded complaints that
U.S. aviation authorities give African airlines an unfairly low
safety category, thus barring their airliners from overflying and
landing rights.
	   The state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation reported that
Slater flew on to Angola late Saturday on the next leg of his
African tour, which was to take in Cameroon and Senegal as well.

	   The gentle rainfall so common to the Emerald Isle affected the
first half of the race, deterring some riders from aggressively
taking the two sharpest corners early on in the speed circuit.
	   But the course had completely dried out when Boardman _ who also
won the prologues of 1994 and 1997 _ rolled down the starting ramp.
He never hesitated from the start and sailed down the city's broad
O'Connell Street to the finish line beyond the city's landmark
General Post Office.
	   Festina put in the strongest team performance, with three riders
in the top 10, but found itself on the defensive over the arrest of
one of its support staff in France.
	   French media reported that Willy Voet, a Belgian masseur, was
arrested Thursday on the French-Belgian border in possession of
more than 400 vials of steroids and the performance-enhancing drug
EPO, which is considered the cycling world's favored drug. It
boosts the level of red-blood cells, enabling cyclists to absorb
oxygen more effectively.
	   One of Festina's unexpectedly strong performances came from
unheralded Christophe Moreau, who led for much of the competition
and finished fifth with a time of 6:17.32. He was competing while
petitioning his positive test for steroid use at another race in
June.
	   The Tour's director, Jean-Marie Leblanc, resisted calls for
Festina to be restricted from competing until the facts of the case
could be established.
	   ``This man may have been acting on his own without the knowledge
of the team, so there is no question of penalizing them,'' Leblanc
said.
	   Festina's director, Bruno Roussel, said he knew nothing about
the incident but would find out what happened when the Tour returns
to France on Monday night. He said if police summoned him he would
answer their questions ``in all honesty'' because he had ``nothing
to hide.''
	   More than 30,000 hard-core fans and curiosity-seekers, virtually
none of them aware of the Festina scandal, lined the route to see
the first Tour de France ever to touch down on Irish soil.
	   Fans of certain countries or particular riders staked their spot
along the barriers of O'Connell Street from early morning. Many
hung flags from the railings or painted their faces to register
their sympathies.
	   Shona McCormick and Laura Grehan, both 19 and from north Dublin,
displayed their hand-made Irish flag bearing a ``Good luck''
message in Danish for the unlikely object of their affection, 1996
Tour winner Bjarne Riis: ``HEID OB LYKKE, BJARNE.''
	   Both said they fell in love with the 34-year-old Riis, unusually
tall and balding for professional cyclists, while watching the 1996
Tour on cable television. ``We really got obsessed with him once we
knew he was coming here,'' McCormick said.
	   ``Bjarne is so powerful all round,'' said Grehan. ``But they're
all wonderful. You have to be exceptionally fit to do what they do,
more so than just about any other sport.''
	   At the starting gate on the other bank of the River Liffey,
several hundred Tour guests braved blaring Europop to sample some
of Ireland's finest cuisine _ rare venison, poached salmon, wheaten
bread, country cheeses and plump blackberries _ in the
cobble-stoned courtyard of Trinity College.
	   Copious volumes of stout, ales and lagers ensured an especially
convivial atmosphere as the cyclists rolled off the starting ramp,
in one-minute intervals, outside Ireland's oldest university.

Diana's stepmother: relationship with Dodi was no ''holiday
</HEADLINE>
romance''
 &UR; Eds: EDITS, ADDS background on Mohamed Al Fayed graf 9

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's relationship with Dodi Fayed was
``no holiday romance,'' her stepmother was quoted as saying in The
Mirror newspaper Saturday.
	   ``This was real love, the kind you can look for all your life
and never find,'' the tabloid quoted Countess Raine Spencer as
saying. ``I know because they both told me.''
	   Diana, 36, Dodi, 42, and chauffeur Henri Paul, 41, were killed
in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31.
	   ``People should know the truth about their relationship, rather
than what the rumor mongers with their own agendas would have us
believe,'' the newspaper quoted the countess as saying.
	   Newspaper in Britain have reported that Diana and her brother
Earl Spencer referred to their stepmother as ``acid Raine,'' and
that Spencer asked the countess to move out of the family's
ancestral Althorp Park home when he inherited it.
	   The Mirror reported that in the four years after Diana's
father's death in 1992, Diana and the countess ``turned from foes
to friends.''
	   ``I loved her, what more can I say? And I think by the end she
loved me too. I hope she did,'' the newspaper quoted Diana's
stepmother as saying.
	   The newspaper said that Countess Spencer, 68, who was put on the
board of Harrods International by Dodi's father, businessman
Mohamed Al Fayed, now had no contact with the Spencer family.
	   Mohamed Al Fayed has been criticized by some in Britain for
saying that he does not believe the crash which killed his son and
Diana was an accident.

Sweden's Gustafsson only one win away from writing clay classic
</HEADLINE>
history &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
overcame a tough challenge from Thomas Johansson Saturday to earn a
chance to be the first player to win a fourth title in the Swedish
Open ATP claycourt classic.
	   In the final he will play Andrey Medvedev, whom he beat in the
1996 final.
	   The 31-year-old claycourt specialist beat Johansson 6-3, 4-6,
7-5. He broke Johansson, a 23-year-old currently ranked 41st, twice
in the first set to win 6-3. But the sixth seed bounced back in the
second set, winning it 6-4 after two breaks. In the third set
Gustafsson broke Johansson early to move into a 5-2 and he looked a
sure winner. But the younger Johansson surged back with two breaks
to make it 5-5. Gustafsson broke again and then held service to
take the set 7-5.
	   Should Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, go all
the way again, he will not only improve upon his current 26th
ranking but also top such greats as Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander,
the only others to win three titles in this seaside tourney.
	   In the other semifinal, unseeded Andrey Medvedev of Ukraine beat
seventh seed Dominic Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). The
25-year-old Medvedev broke the fast-rising 21-year-old from
Bratislava, currently 44th in the rankings, twice in the first set
for 6-3. In the second set Medvedev broke Hrbaty to move into a 3-0
lead but the Slovak came back to level the score to 3-3. Then they
held service ending the set in a tiebreaker.
	   Medvedev worked hard before advancing to the final, finishing
two matches Friday. First he completed a tough seesaw battle with
Australian Richard Fromberg, Swedish Open winner here in 1990, 7-6
(7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-2). Then the Ukrainian, who lost the final at
Bastad in 1996 to Gustafsson, straight-setted third-seeded Italian
Andrea Gaudenzi 6-3, 6-4 in the afternoon.
	   In the doubles final South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval
face Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson who advanced as
Italians Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso pulled out due to
illness in their semifinal.

Faldo confident of playing the British Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Nick Faldo says his elbow injury has
improved 75 percent and he is confident of playing the British Open
at Royal Birkdale next week.
	   The three-time British Open champion withdrew from the Loch
Lomond tournament on Wednesday after sustaining the injury to his
right elbow in warm-up.
	   The injury was diagnosed as ``golfer's elbow'' and threatened
his chances of playing the British Open _ an event he has not
missed since his debut in 1976 _ which starts Thursday.
	   However, he has been receiving extensive physiotherapy treatment
from the European tour's medical team and has recovered enough to
start practising again.
	   ``I feel 75 per cent better. The inflammation has gone down
considerably,'' he said Saturday.
	   ``I feel confident enough to try to hit some shots on the range.
I can get the club back normally, so I'll try a few wedges just to
see how it feels.''
	   Faldo said he intended driving to Birkdale Sunday and walking
the course but he would not play on Monday.
	   ``On Tuesday I will probably play the course off a tee peg _
there is no point in taking any unnecessary risks,'' he said.
	   ``Right now I'm confident I'll be fit to play on Thursday.''
	   Faldo has spent the last two days putting with one hand while
the other has been encased in a fibre-glass cast designed to speed
his recovery.
	   Faldo said he felt twinges in the elbow over the past month but
felt a ``boom'' when he was practising before the first round at
Loch Lomond.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ As new fighting flared in neighboring
Kosovo, the U.S. humanitarian organization AmeriCares flew a
planeload of medicine here Saturday for distribution to refugees
fleeing the conflict.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians from the Serb province have taken
shelter in northern Albania.
	   ``We want to help the victims of this terrible conflict,'' said
Stephen Skakel, a spokesman for the Connecticut-based organization.
``Albania needs medical supplies in the north, where other influxes
of refugees may cross the border.''
	   The shipment includes 15 tons of antibiotics, painkillers,
blankets and other supplies worth dlrs 1.5 million, Skakel said.
The supplies arrived by cargo plane at Rinas airport from
Amsterdam.
	   In the next few days, AmeriCares personnel will deliver the
supplies to refugees at camps near the mountainous border with
Kosovo.
	   The supplies arrived as Serb and Albanian sources in Kosovo
reported new fighting Saturday near Pec, the province's
second-largest city. That could increase the flow of refugees,
although many are now appeared headed for Montenegro because of
stepped-up security on the Yugoslav side of the border.
	   Serbia and Montenegro form Yugoslavia.
	   Since 1992, AmeriCares has provided almost dlrs 2 million in
relief supplies to Albania.

ancestral Althorp Park home when he inherited it.
	   The Mirror reported that in the four years after Diana's
father's death in 1992, Diana and the countess ``turned from foes
to friends.''
	   ``I loved her, what more can I say? And I think by the end she
loved me too. I hope she did,'' the newspaper quoted Diana's
stepmother as saying.
	   The newspaper said that Countess Spencer, 68, who was put on the
board of Harrods International by Dodi's father, businessman
Mohamed Al Fayed, now had no contact with the Spencer family.
	   Mohamed Al Fayed has been criticized by some in Britain for
saying that he does not believe the crash which killed his son and
Diana was an accident.

Dagestani police arrest leader of Chechen-Dagestani organization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in the Russian republic of Dagestan
arrested a leader of a joint Chechen-Dagestani organization on
Saturday, a news agency reported.
	   Police said they arrested Adalo Aliyev, deputy chairman of the
Congress of the Peoples of Chechnya and Dagestan, when he tried to
cross the border from Dagestan into Chechnya with a gun, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Aliyev was reportedly heading to a meeting of the congress'
leadership in Grozny, the Chechen capital.
	   The leader of the congress, former Chechen Prime Minister and
guerrilla leader Shamir Basayev, told ITAR-Tass that ``if they do
not release Adalo Aliyev within 48 hours, the Congress of Chechnya
and Dagestan will take all necessary measures to free him.''
	   Little is known about the congress or its goals. When it met in
Grozny in April, Dagestan described it as an ``unfriendly step with
regard to Dagestan.''
	   Both Dagestan and Chechnya are nominally Russian republics in
the Caucasus region, although Chechnya describes itself as an
independent state. Both have been plagued by lawlessness and
violence in the years since Chechnya's 1994-96 war of secession
with Russia.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTING date in sixth graf

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
overcame a tough challenge from compatriot Thomas Johansson
Saturday to move into the final and a chance to be the first player
to win an unprecedented fourth title in the Swedish Open ATP
claycourt classic.
	   In the final he will play Andrey Medvedev, whom he beat in the
1996 final.
	   The 31-year-old claycourt specialist beat Johansson 6-3, 4-6,
7-5. He broke Johansson, a 23-year-old currently ranked 41st, twice
in the first set to win 6-3. But the sixth seed bounced back in the
second set, winning it 6-4 after two breaks. In the third set
Gustafsson broke Johansson early to move into a 5-2 and he looked a
sure winner. But the younger Johansson surged back with two breaks
to make it 5-5. Gustafsson broke again and then held service to
take the set 7-5.
	   Should Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, go all
the way again, he will not only improve upon his current 26th
ranking but also top such greats as Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander,
the only others to win three titles in this seaside tourney.
	   In the other semifinal, unseeded Andrey Medvedev of Ukraine beat
seventh seed Dominic Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). The
25-year-old Medvedev broke the fast-rising 21-year-old from
Bratislava, currently 44th in the rankings, twice in the first set
for 6-3. In the second set Medvedev broke Hrbaty to move into a 3-0
lead but the Slovak came back to level the score to 3-3. Then they
held service ending the set in a tiebreaker.
	   Medvedev worked hard before advancing to the final, finishing
two matches Friday. First he completed a tough seesaw battle with
Australian Richard Fromberg, Swedish Open winner here in 1990, 7-6
(7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-2). Then the Ukrainian, who lost the final at
Bastad in 1996 to Gustafsson, straight-setted third-seeded Italian
Andrea Gaudenzi 6-3, 6-4 in the afternoon.
	   In the doubles final South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval
face Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson who advanced as
Italians Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso pulled out due to
illness in their semifinal.

Cricket final postponed by rain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Essex set Leicestershire a target of 269 to win
the Benson and Hedges limited overs cricket final at Lord's
Saturday before the match was postponed due to rain.
	   Essex captain Paul Pritchard combined with test batsman Nasser
Hussain for a 134-run second wicket stand which set the platform
for a big total.
	   A 300-plus score was a possibility as Pritchard (92) and Hussain
(88) belted the Leicestershire bowlers for 134 off 152 balls but
Hussain's dismissal sparked a minor middle-order collapse.
	   No chasing side has ever reached a target in excess of 255,
which gives the Essex team the psychological advantage with played
scheduled to resume at 1000GMT Sunday.
	   The rain is expected to continue Sunday which could lead to a
``bowl-out'' _ similar in style to a penalty shoot-out in soccer _
to decide the winner.
	   Under the bowl-out rules, five players from each team would have
to bowl two balls each at a set of stumps in the Lord's indoor
school. The winner would be the team which hit the stumps on the
most occasions.
	   However, if the weather allows Leicestershire the chance to bat
at least 10 overs, the game would be decided on a run-rate
equation.

Report: No agreement yet between Russia and IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Kiriyenko to take part in
talks. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Talks between Russia and the International
Monetary Fund apparently hit a snag Saturday, when the government
had hoped to announce an agreement on a financial bailout.
	   Russian negotiator Anatoly Chubais met with John Odling-Smee of
the IMF in an effort to work out a loan, but their talks ended
inconclusively late in the day, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Talks between the two sides were to continue Sunday, with Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko taking part, ITAR-Tass said. Russia has
been seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion from Western
lenders.
	   Earlier, reports said Chubais had worked out a draft agreement
with the World Bank for unspecified financial assistance to Russia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had met earlier in the day with Chubais
and other top advisers _ Kiriyenko, Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadarnov and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin _ to urge them to
finish up their talks with the Western lending agencies.
	   However, according to ITAR-Tass, Chubais aide Andrei Trapeznikov
said the IMF had insisted that some issues still needed to be
worked out, and they apparently were still unresolved by the end of
the day.
	   Yeltsin also spoke by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Kremlin said. There have been reports that
Japan is considering financial assistance to Russia, and Kiriyenko
plans to visit Tokyo on Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Hashimoto expressed support for Russia's
efforts to stabilize its economy and said he was confident the
Russian economy would improve.
	   For the past couple of days, Yeltsin has been reaching out to
international leaders in an apparent effort to bolster his
government's appeal to the West for help.
	   On Friday, the Russian president spoke to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French President Jacques Chirac.
	   He also appealed directly to IMF head Michel Camdessus by
telephone, and pledged to put Russia's fiscal house in order if the
fund comes through with the loan.
	   The Kremlin and the IMF reached agreement on the majority of key
issues during talks between Chubais and Odling-Smee that began
Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning, according to
Trapeznikov.
	   The talks later Saturday apparently centered on the text on an
agreement on additional financial assistance from the IMF.
	   ``There is every reason to believe the final text of this
document will be coordinated within a few days,'' Trapeznikov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Assuming an agreement is announced, it presumably would be
contingent on passage of the government's economic plan in
parliament, where it could face a difficult fight.
	   The Russian economy was beginning to show signs of growth when
it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, and a drop in
world oil prices.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ As the 85th Tour de France got underway
Saturday in Dublin, a police investigation opened in France into
whether drugs found in the car of a health specialist for the
Festina team were destined for the French team's cyclists.
	   Customs officials at the French-Belgian border town of
Neuville-en-Ferrain discovered anabolic steroids and the
performance enhancing drug known as EPO in a car painted with
Festina colors. It was driven by a man identified as a team health
specialist, police sources said.
	   Officials have not made public the identity of the man, arrested
Thursday. France Info radio identified him as Willy Voet.
	   According to the police sources in the northern city of Lille,
speaking on condition of anonymity, steroids and the equivalent of
250 doses of Erythropoietina -- known as EPO -- were found in the
car.
	   EPO, difficult to detect in doping tests, increases the capacity
of red blood cells to retain oxygen. It has been used in endurance
sports like cycling, triathlon, marathon running and cross-country
skiing.
	   The suspect has maintained that the drugs were for his personal
use, categorically denying they were destined for the team in the
grueling three-week race.
	   Festina's manager, speaking on France 2 television, said the
team has not been officially notified of the arrest or
investigation.
	   ``All my information today comes from the press ...,'' said
Bruno Roussel, speaking from Dublin, Ireland, where the race begins
this year. ``If on my arrival in France, I'm summoned ... I'll
answer any questions in all honesty with nothing to hide.''
	   Police sources in the southeastern city of Lyon said the team
headquarters there was searched. Information on the search was not
immediately available.
	   The preliminary investigation shows that the health specialist,
starting in Lyon, traveled to Switzerland and Germany, where the
drugs were apparently purchased, then passed through Belgium on his
way to the French port of Calais.
	   Jean-Claude Killy, the skiing champion who is president of the
Societe de Tour de France,'' said he is ``following the affair by
the millimeter.''
	   Festina, one of 21 teams riding in this year's Tour de France,
is among the favorites, with leading cyclists like Frenchman
Richard Virenque and Alex Zulle of Switzerland.

Scandal hero, now politician, attacked by own coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Sen. Antonio Di Pietro, the ex-prosecutor who became
a national hero for his Clean Hands corruption probes, drew
stinging condemnation Saturday from his political allies for an
unusually sharp attack on Italy's president.
	   Buoyed by his popularity in bringing down an entire ruling class
this decade, Di Pietro himself turned to politics, winning a Senate
seat last fall for Premier Romano Prodi's center-left Olive Tree
coalition.
	   But Di Pietro's blast at President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro --
stopping short of calling the head of state a liar -- prompted his
allies to take their distance from the former Milan prosecutor.
	   The nastiness was the latest cause of tension for Prodi's
coalition, which faces confidence votes in Parliament later this
month.
	   The mudslinging grew out of a Milan's court conviction a few
days earlier of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi on bribery charges
stemming from a investigation by Di Pietro and his colleagues.
	   Scalfaro on Thursday criticized the Milan probe team for
deciding, in 1994, to serve then-Premier Berlusconi, formal notice
he was under investigation while Berlusconi was hosting a U.N.
anti-crime conference in Naples. Scalfaro described the move as
ill-timed.
	   Di Pietro lashed out at Scalfaro Saturday, contradicting the
head of state. In an interview on RAI state TV, Di Pietro contended
that Scalfaro was informed Berlusconi was about to be notified
during the conference and added that Scalfaro wished the
prosecutors well in their work.
	   Massimo D'Alema, who as head of the former Communists is a key
leader of the Prodi coalition, quickly told Di Pietro to cool down
his ``incomprehensibly bitter'' tone against Scalfaro.
	   The jabbing comes at a delicate moment for the government. After
one of its allies, the hardline Communists, refused recently to
back Prodi on NATO's eastward expansion in a parliamentary vote,
the premier decided to review the strength of his coalition.
	   Confidence votes on Prodi's government are scheduled for July 20
and July 22 in the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies. If the
premier loses, he would be forced to resign.
	   But the hardline Communists have indicated they would back the
government in confidence votes but have been pushing for stronger
action against unemployment as their price.
	   Berlusconi is now head of the center-right opposition.

Progress, but no agreement reported between Russia and IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with aide saying agreements
reached; talks Sunday to be final. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Talks between Russia and the International
Monetary Fund inched forward Saturday, but no agreement was reached
on a financial bailout, the government said.
	   Russian negotiator Anatoly Chubais met with John Odling-Smee of
the IMF in an effort to work out a loan, but their talks ended
inconclusively late in the day, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Nevertheless, an aide to Chubais said the two sides ``reached a
number of new concrete agreements.'' Andrei Trapeznikov did not
elaborate.
	   Odling-Smee was to meet with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko for
a final round of talks on Sunday, ITAR-Tass said. Russia has been
seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion from Western lenders.
	   Earlier, reports said Chubais had worked out a draft agreement
with the World Bank for unspecified financial assistance to Russia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had met earlier in the day with Chubais
and other top advisers _ Kiriyenko, Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadarnov and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin _ to urge them to
finish up their talks with the Western lending agencies.
	   However, according to ITAR-Tass, Trapeznikov said the IMF had
insisted that some issues still needed to be worked out, and they
apparently were still unresolved by the end of the day.
	   Yeltsin also spoke by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Kremlin said. There have been reports that
Japan is considering financial assistance to Russia, and Kiriyenko
plans to visit Tokyo on Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Hashimoto expressed support for Russia's
efforts to stabilize its economy and said he was confident the
Russian economy would improve.
	   For the past couple of days, Yeltsin has been reaching out to
international leaders in an apparent effort to bolster his
government's appeal to the West for help.
	   On Friday, the Russian president spoke to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French President Jacques Chirac.
	   He also appealed directly to IMF head Michel Camdessus by
telephone, and pledged to put Russia's fiscal house in order if the
fund comes through with the loan.
	   The Kremlin and the IMF reached agreement on the majority of key
issues during talks between Chubais and Odling-Smee that began
Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning, according to
Trapeznikov.
	   The talks later Saturday apparently centered on the text on an
agreement on additional financial assistance from the IMF.
	   ``There is every reason to believe the final text of this
document will be coordinated within a few days,'' Trapeznikov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Assuming an agreement is announced, it presumably would be
contingent on passage of the government's economic plan in
parliament, where it could face a difficult fight.
	   The Russian economy was beginning to show signs of growth when
it sharply retrenched this year in response to a variety of
pressures, including the Asian financial crisis, and a drop in
world oil prices.

Wright set to join West Ham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ West Ham manager Harry Redknapp is confident he
can lure former England striker Ian Wright from Arsenal.
	   Wright has played with Arsenal _ Premier League and FA Cup
double titlists last season _ for seven years but faces the
prospect of becoming a second choice striker.
	   Redknapp said Saturday he had spoken to Wright about a deal.
	   ``Ian would like to join us and obviously we would love to have
him. We want to sign him on a two-year contract and there will
probably be a small fee involved,'' he said.
	   ``I would say he is the most enthusiastic footballer I have ever
come across.''
	   The 34-year-old striker, who was ruled out of the England World
Cup team through injury, was likely to become a substitute at
Arsenal behind Dennis Bergkamp and Nicolas Anelka .
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said last week that he wanted
Wright to stay at the club but is unlikely to stand in the player's
way.

World Cup: Counters by Prosinecki, Suker give Croatia 2-1 lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Robert Prosinecki and Davor Suker both scored
against the run of play Saturday night, giving Croatia a 2-1
halftime lead over the Netherlands in the World Cup match for third
place.
	   Prosinecki's goal in the 13th minute and Suker's in the 36th
both came on counter-attacks and on two of Croatia mere three shots
on net.
	   Suker was involved in the first goal as well. His ball sprung
Robert Jarni down the left side and an ensuing low cross was a half
step behind Prosinecki. The Croatia Zagreb midfielder slowed and
pivoted 270 degrees to his left to elude Frank de Boer, Arthur
Numan and Phillip Cocu before beating goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar
from 8 meters.
	   The goal came amidst constant Dutch possesssion and pressure,
which finally paid off in the 21st minute.
	   Boudewijn Zenden's 23-meter, left-footed rocket off a sprinting
run from the touchline to the arc started right and curled left,
leaving keeper Drazen Ladic contorting to get an outstretch hand to
the ball.
	   But Suker regained the lead for Croatia on a counter that
started quickly and appeared to be fading. Zvonimir Soldo broke
free on the right, but was slowed, sent the ball to the outside the
top of the penalty area to Zvonimir Boban, who continued it on to
Suker.
	   With Dutch defender Jaap Stam about 4 meters away, Suker wound
up from 20 meters and shot between Stam's legs just inside the
right post.
	   The game, attended by Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, began under
a light drizzle, which ended by the 30th minute.
	   Despite some predictions, both sides played with full-strength
teams, including Croatia, which started midfield playmaker Zvonimir
Boban, who played in the semifinals despite a leg injury.
	   The game was not played without Sunday's final between France
and Brazil on the minds of many in sold-out Parc des Princes.
During the announcement of the starting lineups, the mention of
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic's name was loudly jeered.
	   Every touch by Bilic was accompanied by a thunderous wave of
whistles.
	   Bilic's theatrics after being fouled that earned French defender
Laurent Blanc a red card in Wednesday's semifinal and thus making
him ineligible for Sunday's championship match.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar; Jaap Stam, Frank de Boer, Arthur
Numan; Wim Jonk, Clarence Seedorf, Phillip Cocu, Edgar Davids;

Abiola died of heart attack, buried in garden compound at home

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ They crowded the streets in front of his
house, more than 20,000 of them. Despite gray and drizzly skies,
despite fears of violence, thousands upon thousands of Nigerians
said goodbye Saturday to their fallen hero.
	   Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's leading political prisoner, was buried
in a quiet ceremony in a garden compound at his Lagos residence. He
died Tuesday while still in custody.
	   Preliminary findings by a team of visiting pathologists indicate
that Abiola died of a heart attack, his personal physician and the
team members said Saturday.
	   Dr. Ore Falomo, who attended an autopsy earlier Saturday, told
The Associated Press that the findings were preliminary. Tissue
samples were to be flown to Britain and Canada for further testing.
	   Nigeria's ruling military junta said Abiola died of a heart
attack, but the opposition leader's family suspected foul play and
brought in their own pathologists to perform an autopsy.
	   ``In our opinion the mechanism of death is due to a rapid
deterioration in a diseased heart,'' Canadian Dr. James Young told
reporters. ``At this time, our preliminary opinion is that death
was due to natural causes as a result of his long standing heart
disease.''
	   Young, the chief coroner in the Canadian province of Ontario,
was one of several forensic scientists flown to Nigeria to conduct
the independent autopsy.
	   Abiola's family offered no immediate reaction to the results of
the autopsy, but one of his daughters, Wura, appealed for calm.
	   ``We are in pain,'' she told a crowd of supporters gathered at
their house. ``You are in pain, everybody is in pain, but I am
pleading that as a peace-loving person, our father would not like
to see violence at this occasion.''
	   The death of the popular opposition leader triggered days of
rioting and violence in Lagos and elsewhere in southern Nigeria,
where at least 55 people have been killed and more than 400
arrested.
	   Authorities were hoping the autopsy results and the Abiola's
burial would help restore order to a city wracked by unrest.
	   Only a few close friends and colleagues attended the burial with
Abiola's family, but thousands of mourners waited near the gate.
Some wept, others prayed, but virtually everyone in the massive
crowd fell silent for the service.
	   ``It's so sad, it's such a sad day for Nigeria,'' said one
mourner who would not give his name. ``How are we going to fill the
void Abiola has left?''
	   The apparent winner of annulled presidential elections in 1993,
Abiola was jailed in 1994 by Gen. Sani Abacha. Abacha died in June.
Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, was
preparing to release Abiola, 60, when he fell ill and died during a
meeting with a U.S. delegation in Abuja.
	   The riot police and soldiers who surrounded Abiola's residence
before the funeral pulled back more than a kilometer (mile) in a
rare act of submission to the will of the crowd.
	   Outrage at Abiola's death has begun to fracture the country
along ethnic lines. Abiola, an immensely popular southern
businessman from the Yoruba clan, posed a serious threat to the
ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper
echelons of power are controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas were discovered earlier in the week in
a predominantly Yoruba neighborhood. Fearing more of the same with
Nigerians still raw over Abiola's death, riot police continued to
watch over the city's mosques Saturday.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from their
Hausa and Fulani compatriots, have long resented what they consider
the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other minerals _ by
northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since Abacha's death on June 8, the new military junta has been
scrambling to gain public trust. Abubakar has released a group of
political prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also has
vowed, albeit vaguely, to return the country to civilian rule.

France and Brazil compete for glory and the stuff of legends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: A version also is moving on sports lines. &QL; 
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ If France conquers Brazil in its
moment of truth Sunday night, one poll shows, nearly half of all
Frenchmen will pop open the champagne. But Pascal Junon did not
wait.
	   On a bench by the Seine, bellowing out La Marseillaise, he waved
his nearly empty bottle and sang even louder at the phrase of the
French anthem, ``the day of glory has arrived.''
	   Brazilians, meanwhile, worked themselves to a fever pitch in the
heart of Paris, from Napoleon's Tomb to the Arc de Triomphe,
chanting repeatedly, ``Five times!''
	   The fuss was over a soccer game, the final match in the
monthlong World Cup, but nobody thought it was only about that.
	   ``It's no secret, France will win,'' said Junon, a 25-year-old
radio announcer. ``We have to. We're ready. We're the best. It's
our time.''
	   Junon, who is black, announced with pride: ``I'm from Thuram,''
renaming the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe _ home of Lilian
Thuram, who scored both goals in the semifinal win over Croatia.
	   Since that game Wednesday night, this racially sensitive nation
has gone colorblind, recognizing only blue, white and red. Half of
France's team, Les Bleus, is a darker shade than pale.
	   The Blues' ethnic roots run to Algeria, black Africa, the South
Pacific and South America.
	   ``People are realizing that France can't win anything big
without blacks,'' Junon said. ``Mixed blood is our future.''
	   Millions of others were looking no further ahead than 9 p.m.
(2000 GMT) Sunday, when they would crowd bars, cafes and parlors to
watch the game. Street people have staked out their favorite
appliance store windows.
	   This was national and personal all at once. When the Spanish
referee ejected Laurent Blanc on Wednesday for what looked like a
minor transgression, the country reacted in unison as if invaded.
	   For those who follow soccer, the century-ending game could
hardly hold more promise.
	   Brazil is the defending champion, having won its fourth World
Cup in 1994, and the team is full of stars. Everywhere but in
America, the young striker Ronaldo is as famous as National
Basketball star Michael Jordan.
	   The Brazilians attack like guerrilla fighters, moving the ball
with dazzling control until it is suddenly in the net and thousands
of yellow-shirted fans are doing backflips in the stands.
	   France, the host, has surprised everyone with elegant teamwork
around its own hero, Zinedine Zidane, a balding French-Algerian
from the tough northern suburbs of Marseille.
	   The French mount a heavily fortified line of defense. In
regular-play competition so far, only two balls have gotten past
Fabien Barthez, the bald-headed mountain in black who guards the
goal.
	   Although odds are on Brazil, it is clear that anything could
happen. The French are behind their team with a fervor not seen in
this country since the jubilation following World War II.
	   ``I know Brazil is better, but France will win because of the
adrenalin rush,'' said Hazel Young, a London-born barge hostess.
``It's like how a mother miraculously lifts a car to save her
child.''
	   If France does win, according to a poll by IPSOS and the daily
France Soir, 72 percent of the population will pour into the
streets.
	   Clusters of riot troops are camped discreetly off the Champs
Elysees and at strategic points around the capital. Similar
measures have been taken in provincial cities.
	   After the semifinal with Croatia, 350,000 people mobbed the
Champs Elysees. They drove down boulevards and back streets blaring
their horns. Canned air horns were sold by the case.
	   ``I don't know what police will do,'' Young said, on her boat
just off the Place de la Concorde. ``The other night the noise kept
me up until 6 in the morning, and that will be nothing compared to
this.''
	   If the Brazilians win, it should be a different party. Frenchmen
will likely samba in the streets, joining infectious gaiety. For
many, just giving Brazil a run for their money would be glory
enough.
	   ``But France has to win,'' Young said, agreeing with Pascal
Junon and just about every Frenchman. ``It is too important for
them.''
	   For years, she said, the nation has been crippled by recession
and unemployment, internal strife, racial divides and a loss of
self-image in a changing world.
	   ``Now there's something different in the air,'' Young concluded.
``I never cared about soccer in my life, but now I couldn't
possibly miss a game. Symbolically and spiritually, it's just too
important.''

	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat journeyed
to Libya Saturday to visit ailing Col. Moammar Gadhafi, traveling
by land via Tunisia because of the U.N. air embargo on Libya,
according to Palestinian sources.
	   Arafat's visit to Gadhafi, who had surgery on a broken hip on
Monday, follows that of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the
presidents of Chad and Niger earlier in the week.
	   Arafat's adviser in Gaza, Marwan Kanafani, told The Associated
Press that the Palestinian leader aimed to ``to wish Gadhafi well
after his leg surgery.''
	   But the Palestinian leader was forced to take a roundabout route
because of the air embargo imposed on Libya in 1992 -- unlike
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak who flew to Tripoli after getting
special authorization from the United Nations.
	   Palestinian sources in the Tunisian capital said Arafat traveled
by land Saturday afternoon to Libya from the island of Djerba, 500
kilometers (about 300 miles) southeast of Tunis. Djerba, a vacation
resort, has a land link from Tunisia to Libya.
	   Mubarak flew direct to Libya on Thursday, but only after
receiving U.N. approval to override the embargo. It was the first
time the world body had authorized such a move for a world leader.
	   In announcing that it had authorized the Mubarak flight, U.N.
officials in New York said no such permission had been granted to
the presidents of Chad and Niger, who arrived days before Mubarak.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the embargo on Libya in a bid
to force Gadhafi to turn over two Libyans wanted for the 1988
bombing of an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie
in which 270 people were killed.

France and Brazil compete for glory and the stuff of legends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ If France conquers Brazil in its
moment of truth Sunday night, one poll shows, nearly half of all
Frenchmen will pop open the champagne. But Pascal Junon did not
wait.
	   On a bench by the Seine, bellowing out La Marseillaise, he waved
his nearly empty bottle and sang even louder at the phrase of the
French anthem, ``the day of glory has arrived.''
	   Brazilians, meanwhile, worked themselves to a fever pitch in the
heart of Paris, from Napoleon's Tomb to the Arc de Triomphe,
chanting repeatedly, ``Five times!''
	   The fuss was over a soccer game, the final match in the
monthlong World Cup, but nobody thought it was only about that.
	   ``It's no secret, France will win,'' said Junon, a 25-year-old
radio announcer. ``We have to. We're ready. We're the best. It's
our time.''
	   Junon, who is black, announced with pride: ``I'm from Thuram,''
renaming the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe _ home of Lilian
Thuram, who scored both goals in the semifinal win over Croatia.
	   Since that game Wednesday night, this racially sensitive nation
has gone colorblind, recognizing only blue, white and red. Half of
France's team, Les Bleus, is a darker shade than pale.
	   The Blues' ethnic roots run to Algeria, black Africa, the South
Pacific and South America.
	   ``People are realizing that France can't win anything big
without blacks,'' Junon said. ``Mixed blood is our future.''
	   Millions of others were looking no further ahead than 9 p.m.
(1900 GMT) Sunday, when they would crowd bars, cafes and parlors to
watch the game. Street people have staked out their favorite
appliance store windows.
	   This was national and personal all at once. When the Spanish
referee ejected Laurent Blanc on Wednesday for what looked like a
minor transgression, the country reacted in unison as if invaded.
	   For those who follow soccer, the century-ending game could
hardly hold more promise.
	   Brazil is the defending champion, having won its fourth World
Cup in 1994, and the team is full of stars. Everywhere but in
America, the young striker Ronaldo is as famous as National
Basketball star Michael Jordan.
	   The Brazilians attack like guerrilla fighters, moving the ball
with dazzling control until it is suddenly in the net and thousands
of yellow-shirted fans are doing backflips in the stands.
	   France, the host, has surprised everyone with elegant teamwork
around its own hero, Zinedine Zidane, a balding French-Algerian
from the tough northern suburbs of Marseille.
	   The French mount a heavily fortified line of defense. In
regular-play competition so far, only two balls have gotten past
Fabien Barthez, the bald-headed mountain in black who guards the
goal.
	   Although odds are on Brazil, it is clear that anything could
happen. The French are behind their team with a fervor not seen in
this country since the jubilation following World War II.
	   ``I know Brazil is better, but France will win because of the
adrenalin rush,'' said Hazel Young, a London-born barge hostess.
``It's like how a mother miraculously lifts a car to save her
child.''
	   If France does win, according to a poll by IPSOS and the daily
France Soir, 72 percent of the population will pour into the
streets.
	   Clusters of riot troops are camped discreetly off the Champs
Elysees and at strategic points around the capital. Similar
measures have been taken in provincial cities.
	   After the semifinal with Croatia, 350,000 people mobbed the
Champs Elysees. They drove down boulevards and back streets blaring
their horns. Canned air horns were sold by the case.
	   ``I don't know what police will do,'' Young said, on her boat
just off the Place de la Concorde. ``The other night the noise kept
me up until 6 in the morning, and that will be nothing compared to
this.''
	   If the Brazilians win, it should be a different party. Frenchmen
will likely samba in the streets, joining infectious gaiety. For
many, just giving Brazil a run for their money would be glory
enough.
	   ``But France has to win,'' Young said, agreeing with Pascal
Junon and just about every Frenchman. ``It is too important for
them.''
	   For years, she said, the nation has been crippled by recession
and unemployment, internal strife, racial divides and a loss of
self-image in a changing world.
	   ``Now there's something different in the air,'' Young concluded.
``I never cared about soccer in my life, but now I couldn't
possibly miss a game. Symbolically and spiritually, it's just too
important.''

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A quick look at Saturday's prologue of
the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: A prologue of 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) around central
Dublin.
	   WINNER: Chris Boardman, 29, of Britain, the 1992 Olympics
pursuit gold medalist.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Boardman, who also won the prologues of the 1994
and 1997 Tours. But he did not beat the Tour's prologue speed
record _ 34.194 mph (55.152 kph) _ which he set on his 1994 debut.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: Spain's Abraham Olano, hoping finally to
live up to his billing as the next Miguel Indurain, finished 4.6
seconds behind; French champion Laurent Jalabert came in third at
4.69; and the United States' Bobby Julich managed 4.77 behind for
fourth.
	   Last year's Tour winner, Jan Ullrich, finished 5.6 seconds
behind Boardman in sixth place while his Deutsche Telekom teammate,
1996 Tour winner Bjarne Riis, managed just 23rd after crossing the
line 14 seconds off the mark.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: Watching among 30,000 fans were Ireland's two star
cyclists of the 1980s: Stephen Roche, who won the Tour in 1987, and
Sean Kelly, four times holder of the green jersey for most
consistent Tour rider.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``People expected me to win. I didn't. I've
had a terrible season and I've been pretty depressed frankly. What
a relief!'' said Boardman after his victory.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: Stage one of 111.9 miles (180.5 kms) runs from
Dublin south along a mostly flat coast, inland through the Wicklow
Mountains to its 540-meter summit, then downhill back north to a
finishing circuit round Dublin's vast Phoenix Park.

 &UR; Serb forces pound rebel stronghold near Kosovo's second-largest
city

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls for a
cease-fire, Serb forces pounded Albanian rebels Saturday outside
Kosovo's second-largest city. Hundreds of terrified civilians fled
over twisting mountain roads to escape the fighting.
	   Serb troops began shelling the town of Lodja, just outside this
western Kosovo city, about dawn Saturday, and the attacks continued
until midday.
	   The ethnic ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at the
height of the barrage, shells were falling at the rate of about one
a minute but the village remained in the hands of the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Lodja is a stronghold of the KLA, which is battling for
independence for Kosovo from Serbia _ a part of Yugoslavia. The
village, scene of fighting earlier this week, is also reputedly a
center for arms smuggling from Albania, about 25 kilometers (15
miles) to the south.
	   The shelling raised alarm among Pec's 120,000 people _ most of
them ethnic Albanians. Dozens of cars packed with families and
their belongings were seen heading north over a winding mountain
road toward nearby Montenegro.
	   An independent radio station in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade
said Serb forces launched the attack to try to retrieve the bodies
of two Serb policemen killed in fighting around Lodja three days
ago.
	   In its account of the battle, the Serb Media Center, quoting
government sources, said police regained control of the road
linking Pec with Gorazdevac, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the
southeast, during an ``action'' to locate two missing policemen.
	   According to the center, police came under fire as soon as they
approached Lodja and, ``after two hours of battle, armed Albanians
ran away,'' but the two policemen killed three days ago were not
found.
	   The Serb report said no police were wounded in Saturday's
battle, but said there were dead and wounded among the Albanians.
But the Serbs made no claim to have captured the village.
	   Albanian sources said a 78-year-old Albanian man was killed and
three others were wounded in Lodja. But the Albanians claimed KLA
fighters beat back ``one of the biggest attacks'' by Serb forces
since the crisis escalated in February.
	   Throughout the area, the tension was palpable. The Serb police
presence in Pec had increased sharply over the past week. Military
jeeps patrolled the streets regularly. A small Albanian settlement
between Pec and Lodja appeared virtually abandoned. Serb civilians
blocked the road leading to Lodja.
	   In addition to the action in Lodja, Albanian sources reported
fresh fighting Saturday in the Decani area, east of Pec, and near
the border town of Djakovica.
	   The League of Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main
party, urged international observers to rush to the area to witness
the fighting. The party, led by moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova,
called on foreign powers to intervene to stop the attack.
	   Also Saturday, the Macedonian defense ministry said guards fired
on arms smugglers Friday trying to cross into the country from
Albania. There were no casualties and the smugglers fled back to
Albania.
	   Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, also has a large and
restive Albanian community but has tried to stay out of the Kosovo
conflict.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   The fighting raged despite a demand by the United States,
Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy for an immediate
cease-fire followed by peace talks. France and Britain also have
said they would introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security Council
threatening new measures against the warring sides if they do not
halt the fighting.
	   Diplomatic efforts so far have foundered because of divisions
within the Albanian community and the refusal of the KLA to accept
Rugova as their leader in future talks. Rugova has disavowed
violence.
	   On Saturday, an Albanian-language newspaper quoted a self-styled
KLA spokesman as saying the rebels would keep fighting if they are
excluded from peace talks with the government. Russia and
Yugoslavia have ruled out including the KLA.
	   ``We are against any secret talks,'' Jakup Krasniqi told the
daily newspaper Koha Ditore.
	   In the interview, Krasniqi rejected Rugova as a leader who ``has
not fulfilled conditions to be president of Kosovo.''
	   Major world powers oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
Albanian communities.

Puerto Rican unions considering second general strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROSARIO GIRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Labor unions are considering a
sequel to a two-day general strike that snarled traffic, slowed
commerce and shut down government offices across Puerto Rico
earlier this week.
	   The Greater Committee of Labor Organizations, which represents
about 60 unions, said Saturday that it might call another work
stoppage within weeks to protest privatization of the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. About 6,400 telephone workers have been on strike
since June 18.
	   Unions will also begin pickets at hotels, factories and shopping
centers, and will send a caravan of cars to protest in cities
across the island, said Jose Juan Hernandez, president of the
Independent Union of Telephone Employees.
	   He announced the plans as labor leaders chanted ``Strike!
Strike!'' during a meeting at a union office in San Juan.
	   ``The state in which the people are in will get worse and the
unfortunate and dismal consequences for the people of Puerto Rico
will escalate,'' Hernandez said.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello signed a law last month selling the
telephone utility to GTE Corp., banks and other investors for dlrs
1.9 billion. Workers fear massive layoffs.
	   The unions are demanding a referendum on the company's sale.
	   News of the deal touched off weeks of bombings, sabotage of
telephone lines, fights with police on picket lines and attacks on
branches of Banco Popular, a local bank involved in the sale.
	   Protesters called a two-day general strike on Tuesday and
Wednesday. During its first hours, they blocked a major highway
into San Juan, forcing commuters to turn back and freezing traffic
into the island's largest airport.
	   Shopping malls and most stores closed. Protesters slashed fiber
optic telephone cables, leaving a quarter-million customers
temporarily without long-distance service.

	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat journeyed
to Libya Saturday to visit ailing Col. Moammar Gadhafi, traveling
by land via Tunisia because of the U.N. air embargo on Libya,
according to Palestinian sources.
	   Arafat's visit to Gadhafi, who had surgery on a broken hip on

kms (865 miles) east of the capital, an editor at the official
Libyan news agency JANA in Tripoli told The Associated Press. The
JANA employee, reached by telephone from Cairo, said he did not
know whether Arafat was flying to al-Bayda.

Protestant marchers, Catholic residents try road to compromise

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks adjourned until unspecified date, Orange
Order making second application for Garvaghy Road march,

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers and their
Catholic opponents began indirect talks Saturday in hopes of
defusing a standoff that has spilled over into gun and bomb attacks
increasingly focusing on Northern Ireland's police.
	   After six bruising nights of Protestant violence, members of the
Orange Order _ blocked since Sunday from parading down Portadown's
Garvaghy Road from rural Drumcree church _ started negotiating
through intermediaries with the road's resolute Catholic residents.
	   But after the talks adjourned Saturday night with no agreement,
the Orangemen announced they had upped the ante by making a second
application to march down the road _ starting at 12:30 p.m. (1130
GMT) Sunday.
	   Normally, applications must be made to the government-appointed
Northern Ireland Parades Commission at least seven days in advance.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the Parades
Commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' Orange Order spokesman David Jones said.
	   The parades commission said it would call an emergency meeting
to consider the application.
	   The indirect talks, which went six hours Saturday, adjourned
until an unspecified time sometime after Sunday.
	   No details of the discussions were announced, leaving police to
fear tensions would peak this weekend with the 12th of July
holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the defeat of
Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.
	   The streets of normally bustling Belfast began emptying early
Saturday afternoon in anticipation of more trouble, and thousands
of Orangemen swelled the increasingly impatient ranks behind the
steel and barbed-wire barricades at Portadown.
	   The situation outside the Orangemen's rural Anglican church was
steadily deteriorating, with protesters using children to cut the
wire to get closer to security forces, Assistant Chief Constable
Tom Craig said Saturday.
	   ``They're trying to get within range where they can kill police
officers,'' he said.
	   Breandan MacCionnaith, the spokesman for the Garvaghy Road
residents, said eventual face-to-face discussions with the
Orangemen would be an ``essential element'' to a lasting solution
to the problems in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of
Belfast.
	   But he sounded anything but conciliatory before the indirect
talks began.
	   ``If the Orange Order thinks this community can be broken
through intimidation and terror, they will have to think again,''
he said.
	   The Orangemen had rebuffed numerous offers from MacCionnaith to
talk, objecting to his status as a former IRA prisoner and
insisting they had a historic right to march on any public highway.
	   But they finally acquiesced to indirect negotiations Friday at
the urging of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who warned them that
authorities would continue to enforce a government-appointed
commission's ruling blocking the marchers from proceeding down
Garvaghy Road.
	   The only way that part of the march could proceed, Blair said,
is through an agreement between marchers and residents.
	   In 1996, police and soldiers initially stopped the march but
backed down after four nights of Protestant violence across the
province. Last year, police clubbed protesters off the road to let
the Orangemen through.
	   According to police figures, as of 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) Saturday, a
total of 64 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary had been
injured in 569 separate attacks since Sunday.
	   Security forces at Portadown came under sustained attack Friday
night, loosing 475 plastic bullets in return that injured 20
protesters, including a a 26-year-old man who remained hospitalized
in critical condition and a 21-year-old girl who lost an eye.
	   David Jones, the Orange Order spokesman, criticized the police
response, complaining of a ``constant hail'' of plastic bullets.
	   But Assistant Chief Constable Chris Albiston said protesters
were responsible for ``a continual barrage of thunderflash devices
and large fireworks fired horizontally at police.''
	   ``Ball bearings were fired from catapults and a number of petrol
bombs and blast bombs were thrown,'' Albiston said, adding that no
security force members were hurt.
	   David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, the province's
largest Protestant Party, said the trick for negotiators trying to
iron out a solution to the Garvaghy Road stalemate would be letting
both sides walk away with a sense of victory.
	   ``The important thing is that we get the matter resolved in a
way that enables both sides to feel that their rights have been
vindicated,'' said Trimble, newly elected first minister of the
Belfast Assembly, a linchpin of the April 10 Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
	   While the agreement is a mammoth achievement, the pact is still
fragile. On Friday, police in London and Ireland arrested 10 people
linked to Irish Republican Army dissidents unhappy with the accord
who allegedly were preparing to plant bombs in the city.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Chris Boardman of Britain won Saturday's
prologue of the Tour de France, but a drug scandal involving
France's top-rated Festina team marred the Irish start to the
world's premier cycling race.
	   Boardman raced to victory on the 3.5-mile (5.6-kilometer) route
through central Dublin in 6 minutes, 12.36 seconds _ a full 4.6
seconds better than runner-up Abraham Olano of Spain.
	   France's Laurent Jalabert, the world time trial champion, was
third, 4.69 seconds behind Boardman. America's Bobby Julich, who
races for the French Cofidis team, powered his way to fourth at
4.77 off the mark.
	   Defending Tour champion Jan Ullrich of Germany finished sixth,
5.6 seconds behind, while his Deutsche Telekom teammate and 1996
Tour champion, Bjarne Riis of Denmark, finished a disappointing
23rd.
	   It was the third victory for Boardman, 29, in five years in the
Tour's prologue.
	   ``People expected me to win. I didn't. I've had a terrible
season and I've been pretty depressed frankly. What a relief!'' he
said after his win.
	   ``The crowd helped. The noise was incredible,'' said Boardman,
who was the closest thing that the Irish fans had to a local player
to root for.
	   The gentle rain so common to the Emerald Isle affected the first
half of the race, deterring some riders from aggressively taking
the two sharpest corners early on in the speed circuit.
	   But the course had dried when Boardman _ who also won the
prologues of 1994 and 1997 _ rolled down the starting ramp. He
never hesitated and sped down the city's broad O'Connell Street to
the finish line beyond the city's landmark General Post Office.
	   Festina put in the strongest team performance, with three riders
in the top 10, but the arrest of one of its support staff in France
clouded its showing.
	   Willy Voet, a Belgian masseur, was arrested Thursday on the
French-Belgian border in possession of more than 400 vials of
steroids and the performance-enhancing drug EPO, considered the
cycling world's favored drug. It boosts the level of red-blood
cells, enabling cyclists to absorb oxygen more effectively.
	   One of Festina's unexpectedly strong performances came from
unheralded Christophe Moreau, who led for much of the race and
finished fifth in 6:17.32. He was competing while petitioning his
positive test for steroid use at a race in June.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc resisted calls for Festina to
be restricted from competing until the facts of the case could be
established.
	   ``This man may have been acting on his own without the knowledge
of the team, so there is no question of penalizing them,'' Leblanc
said.
	   Festina's director, Bruno Roussel, said he knew nothing about
the problem but would find out when the Tour goes to France Monday
night.
	   Athletes with American connections featured strongly at the
finishing line, too.
	   Besides Julich, a 26-year-old from Colorado who placed 17th in
the 1997 Tour, the lone American-sponsored team, U.S Postal
Service, had riders finish in 10th and 11th place in a field of
189.
	   ``I'm determined this year to win a stage, to compete for the
yellow jersey,'' said Julich of the uniform denoting the Tour's
leader and eventual winner after 22 days' competition. ``I don't
want to be the best American in the Tour. I want to be the best
rider, period.''
	   More than 30,000 spectators lined the route to see the first
Tour de France in Ireland. Sunday's stage one race of 111.9 miles
(180.5 kms) runs south from Dublin to the Wicklow Mountains and
back again.

Radical Islamic Jihad holds militant rally, reopens newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hundreds of followers of the
militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, chanted ``Death to Israel
and America,'' and burned both nations' flags at a rally in the
Gaza Strip Saturday.
	   Leaders of the group, which opposes peace with Israel and has
claimed responsibility deadly attacks against the Jewish state,
made fiery speeches, threatening renewed violence and holy war.
	   ``(Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu understands the language
of pain. Who can inflict pain on him more than the sons of Islamic
Jihad and Hamas,'' Abdullah Shami, head of the Islamic movement in
Gaza, told the crowds.
	   Twenty masked men dressed in all-white marched with Islamic
flags and pictures of dead leaders. They burned two Israeli flags
and one American flag, while members of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
police force guarded the area.
	   Arafat cracked down on the Islamic movement in March 1996 after
a series of terror attacks claimed by both Islamic Jihad and the
larger militant Hamas group killed dozens of people in Israel.
	   But both groups, who serve as Arafat's main opposition in
Palestinian politics, have gradually been allowed to return to
activities.
	   After a hiatus of more than two years, the weekly newspaper of
the Islamic Jihad party was back on the streets Saturday across
Palestinian territories.
	   The movement's newspapers Al-Istiqlal, or Independence, launched
in October 1994, was ordered closed as part of the crackdown two
years ago.
	   The Palestinian Authority gave the newspaper permission to
reopen in January, but it took a while to find new offices,
equipment and funding, according to its editors.
	   ``The newspaper will be the same as it was before: the
mouthpiece of the nation,'' said editor Ibrahim Najjar.
	   In the first edition since its shutdown, the paper seemed to
have toned down attacks on the Palestinian Authority, but still
took a critical tone.
	   The front-page headline, referring to Arafat's promises of
change in his government, read: ``The Cabinet reshuffle will be
superficial.''
	   Al-Istiqlal distributes about 7,000 copies a week in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, sending vendors to the mosques after Friday
prayers.
	   No newspapers were allowed to publish in the Gaza Strip during
the 27 years of Israeli occupation. Israel is widely believed to
have assassinated the first editor of Al-Istiqlal, Islamic Jihad
official Hani Abed, with a car bomb in November 1994.

 &UR; Serb forces pound rebel stronghold near Kosovo's second-largest
city

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls for a
cease-fire, Serb forces pounded Albanian rebels Saturday outside
Kosovo's second-largest city. Hundreds of terrified civilians fled
over twisting mountain roads to escape the fighting.
	   Serb troops began shelling the town of Lodja, just outside this
western Kosovo city, about dawn Saturday. The attacks continued
until midday.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at the height
of the barrage, shells were falling at the rate of about one a
minute, but the village remained in the hands of the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Lodja is a stronghold of the KLA, which is battling for
independence for Kosovo from Serbia. The village, scene of fighting
earlier this week, is also reputedly a center for arms smuggling
from Albania, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the south.
	   The shelling raised alarm among Pec's 120,000 people _ mostly
ethnic Albanians. Dozens of cars packed with families and
belongings headed north over a winding mountain road toward nearby
Montenegro, which together with Serbia make up Yugoslavia.
	   An independent radio station in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade
said Serb forces launched the attack to try to retrieve the bodies
of two Serb policemen killed in fighting around Lodja three days
ago.
	   The Serb Media Center, quoting government sources, said police
regained control of the road linking Pec with Gorazdevac, about 5
kilometers (3 miles) to the southeast, during an ``action'' to
locate two missing policemen.
	   According to the center, police came under fire as soon as they
approached Lodja and, ``after two hours of battle, armed Albanians
ran away,'' but the two policemen killed three days ago were not
found.
	   The Serb report said no police were wounded in Saturday's
battle, but there were dead and wounded among the Albanians. The
Serbs made no claim to have captured the village.
	   Albanian sources said a 78-year-old Albanian man was killed and
three others were wounded in Lodja. But the Albanians claimed KLA
fighters beat back ``one of the biggest attacks'' by Serb forces
since the crisis escalated in February.
	   Throughout the area, the tension was palpable. Serb police
presence in Pec increased sharply over the past week. Military
jeeps patrolled the streets regularly. A small Albanian settlement
between Pec and Lodja appeared virtually abandoned. Serb civilians
blocked the road leading to Lodja.
	   Also Saturday, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in the
Decani area, east of Pec, and near the border town of Djakovica.
	   The League of Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main
party, urged international observers to rush to the area to witness
the fighting. The party, led by moderate politician Ibrahim Rugova,
called on foreign powers to intervene.
	   Meantime, the Macedonian defense ministry said guards fired on
arms smugglers Friday trying to cross into the country from
Albania. There were no casualties and the smugglers fled back to
Albania.
	   Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, also has a large and
restive Albanian community but has tried to stay out of the
conflict.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   The fighting raged despite a demand by the United States,
Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy for an immediate
cease-fire followed by peace talks. France and Britain also have
said they would introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security Council
threatening new measures against the warring sides if they do not
halt the fighting.
	   Diplomatic efforts so far have foundered because of divisions
within the Albanian community and the refusal of the KLA to accept
Rugova as their leader in future talks. Rugova has disavowed
violence.
	   On Saturday, an Albanian-language newspaper quoted a self-styled
KLA spokesman as saying the rebels would keep fighting if they are
excluded from peace talks with the government. Russia and
Yugoslavia have ruled out including the KLA.
	   ``We are against any secret talks,'' Jakup Krasniqi told the
daily newspaper Koha Ditore.
	   In the interview, Krasniqi rejected Rugova as a leader who ``has
not fulfilled conditions to be president of Kosovo.''
	   Major world powers oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could trigger rebellions in other Balkan countries with substantial
Albanian communities.

Langdon, Cleaves make first cut for world championship team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ For three days, Rudy Tomjanovich watched hours of
practice and dozens of players, trying to separate equally talented
men and come up with a U.S. world championship team.
	   Now comes the hard part.
	   With his roster whittled to 16 finalists Saturday, Tomjanovich's
next task is figuring out how to meld his ragtag group of college
and Canadian Basketball Association players into a team that can
compete for a medal.
	   ``Now our focus is how we're going to become a real team. Not an
all-star team, not a group of guys from a whole bunch of different
parts of the country,'' Tomjanovich said Saturday. ``We've got to
become a family.''
	   Duke standout Trajan Langdon and Big Ten player of the year
Mateen Cleaves are the biggest names on the list of 16 finalists.
Earl Boykins, who, at 5-foot-5 is known as much for his diminutive
stature as he is for his ball-handling skills, also made the cut.
So did Jimmy King, who was part of Michigan's famed Fab Five and
now plays in the CBA.
	   The other finalists are: Brad Miller; Kiwane Garris; Michael
Hawkins; Jimmy Oliver; Wendell Alexis; Tim Breaux; Bill Edwards;
Jason Sasser; David Wood; Ashraf Amaya; Warren Kidd; and Gerard
King.
	   Tomjanovich is expected to make one more cut before training
camp ends Tuesday, and announce his official 12-man roster after
the team's camp in Monte Carlo. The 1998 FIBA World Championships
begin July 29 in Athens, Greece.
	   USA Basketball initially selected 12 NBA players for the world
championship team, including Grant Hill, Gary Payton and Tim
Duncan. But with a lockout looming July 1, the all-stars threatened
a boycott.
	   USA Basketball moved first, announcing June 16 it was dropping
the NBA stars and replacing them with current college players, CBA
players and Americans playing overseas.
	   ``We're going to do our best to work hard and not have any
letdowns of the expectations that we're set with the first team,''
Jimmy King said. ``We want to pick them up like they were never
lost.''
	   But that won't be easy.
	   Most international teams have played together for months, if not
years, and some will still have NBA players. The U.S. team will
have been together three weeks when it takes the floor for the
first game.
	   ``You need months to get ready and you're not playing your best
basketball until the end of the season,'' Langdon said. ``But we
don't have that long, so the group we have has to come together
quickly.''
	   The bonding has already started. There was plenty of trash
talking during Saturday's drills. Broken up into three separate
teams, players were slapping hands and hollering whenever someone
in their group made a basket.
	   And when practice finished, Cleaves and Miller, who just
finished his eligibility at Purdue, resumed what's become an
ongoing debate on who has the best team in the Big Ten.
	   But the key for this team is the lack of egos. There is a wide
range in the age and experience of the finalists _ from the
33-year-old Alexis, who played in Germany last year, to Cleaves,
won't be 21 for two more months.
	   ``Nobody is in it to be the lead scorer or rebounder,'' Cleaves
said. ``People are starting to play their roles, and if we do that,
we're going to win. We've got everything we need _ the big fellas,
the wings, the guards.
	   ``If everybody plays their roles, we're going to be a tough team
to handle.''

Bailey and Hemmings win easily in Nuremberg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Olympic champions Donovan Bailey of
Canada and Deon Hemmings of Jamaica coasted to victory Saturday at
the Nuremberg track meet.
	   Bailey captured the 100 meters in 10.07 seconds at the event
plagued by rain and unseasonal cold, well ahead of Nigeria's Osmond
Enzinwa at 10.20.
	   Hemmings swept the women's 400 hurdles in a time of 54.10, while
Ireland's Susan Smith was a distant second in 56.32.
	   A pair of German stars on the comeback trail also posted
victories at the event.
	   Heike Drechsler leaped 6.85 meters in the long jump to edge
Atlanta silver medalist Fiona May of Italy at 6.79. Germany's Susan
Tiedtke was third at 6.66, just ahead of Shana Williams of the
United States at 6.65.
	   Lars Riedel, the Olympic champion who has been fighting illness,
tossed a 65.59 in the shotput on his fourth throw to beat Adam
Setliff. The American's best was 65.42.
	   Britain's Colin Jackson also ran away from the field in the 110
hurdles with a time of 13.07, as Germans Falk Balzer chased him at
13.18 and Florian Schwarthoff at 13.29.
	   Luke Kipkosgei slipped past Paul Tergat, the former 10,000-meter
recordholder, to win the 5,000. Both men clocked 13:01.31, while
Paul Koech completed a sweep for Kenyan runners in 13:06.43.
	   In the women's high jump, Tisha Waller of the United States
cleared 1.93 meters, leaving behind Germans Daniela Rath, Alina
Astafei and Moldavia's Olga Boshova.
	   All three lept 1.86, then missed their tries at 1.90.
	   Jamaica's Merlene Ottey also won the women's 100 in 11.02,
Germany's Tim Lobinger grabbed the pole vault in 5.92 and Derrick
Brew of the United States won the 400 in 45.34.

World Cup: Croatia claims third with 2-1 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Robert Prosinecki and Davor Suker both scored
first-half counter-attack goals and Croatia claimed third place at
its first World Cup with a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands
Saturday night.
	   The tiny Balkan nation of 5 million, which only came into
existence as a country in 1991, was dominated throughout the match
by the Dutch. But it converted two of its handful of chances to
earn some consolation after being beaten by the host French in the
semifinals.
	   For the Dutch, who had Prime Minister Wim Kok in attendance, it
was more dissapointment, having lost the 1974 and 1978 finals and
being eliminated by defending champion Brazil in the semifinals
this time.
	   Prosinecki's goal in the 13th minute and Suker's in the 36th
both came against the run of play as the Dutch dominated possession
and allowed Croatia only three shots on net in the first 45
minutes.
	   Croatian keeper Drazen Ladic came up big at least four times,
twice in each half, to deny what appeared to be sure Dutch goals.
	   Ladic robbed Patrick Kluivert twice in the first half with his
feet, then parried away shots by Marc Overmars and Clarence Seedorf
in the final 15 minutes.
	   With the Dutch swarming around the net, Suker gave Croatia the
lead.
	   His ball sprung Robert Jarni down the left side and an ensuing
low cross was a half step behind Prosinecki. The Croatia Zagreb
midfielder slowed and pivoted 270 degrees to his left to elude
Frank de Boer, Arthur Numan and Phillip Cocu before beating
goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from 8 meters.
	   The Dutch renewed their pressure, which finally paid off in the
21st minute.
	   Boudewijn Zenden's 23-meter, left-footed rocket off a sprinting
run from the touchline to the arc started right and curled left,
leaving keeper Drazen Ladic contorting to get an outstretch hand to
the ball.
	   But Suker regained the lead for Croatia on a counter that
started quickly and appeared to be fading. Zvonimir Soldo broke
free on the right, and after pulling up, sent the ball outside the
top of the penalty area to Zvonimir Boban, who continued it on to
Suker.
	   With Dutch defender Jaap Stam about 4 meters away, Suker wound
up from 20 meters and shot between Stam's legs and just inside the
right post.
	   Despite some predictions, both sides played with near
full-strength teams, including Croatia, which started midfield
playmaker Boban, who played in the semifinals despite a leg injury.
	   The game was not played without Sunday's final between France
and Brazil on the minds of many in sold-out Parc des Princes.
During the announcement of the starting lineups, the mention of
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic's name was loudly jeered.
	   Every touch by Bilic throughout the 90 minutes was accompanied
by a thunderous wave of whistles.
	   Bilic's theatrics after being fouled that earned French defender
Laurent Blanc a red card in Wednesday's semifinal and thus making
him ineligible for Sunday's championship match.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar; Jaap Stam, Frank de Boer, Arthur
Numan; Wim Jonk, Clarence Seedorf, Phillip Cocu (Marc Overmars,

58th), Patrick Kluivert, Boudewijn Zenden.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ French police were investigating whether
hundreds of doses of performance-enhancing drugs found in the car
of an employee of the Festina cycling team were destined for riders
who kicked off the 85th Tour de France Saturday in Dublin, Ireland.
	   Customs officials at the French-Belgian border town of
Neuville-en-Ferrain discovered anabolic steroids and the
performance enhancing drug known as EPO in a car painted with
Festina colors, according to police sources in Lille.
	   The driver of the car, identified as a health specialist with
the Festina team, was jailed in this northern French city, police
sources said. Officials have not made public the identity of the
man, reportedly arrested Thursday.
	   France Info radio identified him as Willy Voet. It said he was
placed under formal investigation -- a step short of being charged
-- for infraction of drug laws. That information could not
immediately be confirmed.
	   According to the police sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, steroids and the equivalent of 250 doses of
Erythropoietina -- known as EPO -- were found in the car.
	   EPO, difficult to detect in doping tests, increases the capacity
of red blood cells to retain oxygen. It has been used in endurance
sports like cycling, triathlon, marathon running and cross-country
skiing.
	   The suspect has maintained that the drugs were for his personal
use, categorically denying they were destined for the team in the
grueling three-week race.

Eritrean leader says Ethiopia hasn't learnt from history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ethiopia's talk of a long war shows it has
not learnt the lesson of its 30-year war against Eritrean
secessionist rebels, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki said
Saturday.
	   ``Talking about a long war proves that the brothers in Ethiopia
did learn from history,'' Afwerki said in a live interview with
Qatar's al-Jazeera television channel.
	   War flared up between Eritrea and Ethiopia on May 6 when the two
states began fighting over where the colonial power, Italy, drew
their border. The front has been quiet for several weeks, but
attempts to start negotiations have so far failed.
	   Afwerki accused the Ethiopians of refusing to negotiate a
settlement. Ethiopia has said it will not begin peace talks until
Eritrean forces withdraw from its territory.
	   Asked if he would appear in a live debate with Ethiopia's Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi on al-Jazeera on July 21, Afwerki said he
would.
	   ``We (Eritreans) know what results from the use of force,''
Afwerki said, speaking in fluent Arabic in the Eritrean capital of
Asmara.
	   ``There are several ways to solve (the conflict),'' he said
without elaboration.
	   Afwerki and Meles were allies when they fought as leaders of
rebel groups against Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, whom they
overthrew in July 1991.
	   Asked why did not exploit his long-standing relations with Meles
to find a solution, Afwerki said: ``The personal relationship
cannot be at the expense of the national interests ... The crisis
could have gone beyond this relationship.''
	   After the overthrow of Mengistu, Eritrea negotiated a peaceful
secession from Ethiopia and became independent in 1993.

Radical Islamic Jihad holds militant rally, reopens newspaper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hundreds of followers of the
militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, chanted ``Death to Israel
and America,'' and burned both nations' flags at a rally Saturday
in the Gaza Strip.
	   Also Saturday, the weekly newspaper of the Islamic Jihad party
was back on the streets across Palestinian territories after a
hiatus of more than two years.
	   Leaders of the Islamic Jihad, which opposes peace with Israel
and has claimed responsibility deadly attacks against the Jewish
state, made fiery speeches, threatening renewed violence and holy
war.
	   ``(Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu understands the language
of pain. Who can inflict pain on him more than the sons of Islamic
Jihad and Hamas,'' Abdullah Shami, head of the Islamic movement in
Gaza, told the crowds.
	   Twenty masked men dressed in all-white marched with Islamic
flags and pictures of dead leaders. They burned two Israeli flags
and one American flag, while members of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
police force guarded the area.
	   Arafat cracked down on the Islamic movement in March 1996 after
a series of terror attacks claimed by both Islamic Jihad and the
larger militant Hamas group killed dozens of people in Israel. Both
groups, who serve as Arafat's main opposition in Palestinian
politics, have gradually been allowed to return to activities.
	   The Islamic Jihad's newspapers Al-Istiqlal, or Independence,
launched in October 1994, was ordered closed as part of the
crackdown. The Palestinian Authority gave the newspaper permission
to reopen in January, but it took a while to find new offices,
equipment and funding, according to its editors.
	   ``The newspaper will be the same as it was before: the
mouthpiece of the nation,'' said editor Ibrahim Najjar.
	   The newspaper seemed to have toned down attacks on the
Palestinian Authority, but still took a critical tone. The
front-page headline, referring to Arafat's promises of change in
his government, read: ``The Cabinet reshuffle will be
superficial.''
	   Al-Istiqlal distributes about 7,000 copies a week in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, sending vendors to the mosques after Friday
prayers.
	   No newspapers was allowed to publish in the Gaza Strip during
the 27 years of Israeli occupation. Israel is widely believed to
have assassinated the first editor of Al-Istiqlal, Islamic Jihad
official Hani Abed, with a car bomb in November 1994.

Holocaust film with comic moments stirs painful memories in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with mainly positive reception but
some filmgoers upset by movie
 &UR; AP Photo JRL102
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An award-winning film set in a Nazi
concentration camp and featuring some tenderly comic scenes won a
respectful reception Saturday at its Israel premiere. But the
combination of humor and the Holocaust proved too painful for some.
	   The movie's Italian star and director, Roberto Benigni _ who is
renowned for a tragicomic style reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin _
offered an emotional apology to any offended by his movie, ``Life
is Beautiful,'' but defended it as a sincere and heartfelt work.
	   The film is about a father who uses a desperate and sometimes
wildly funny ruse to try to shield his little son from Nazi
horrors. He tells the boy their imprisonment is all an elaborate
game, with a wonderful prize awaiting the winner.
	   ``Life is Beautiful'' _ an unqualified hit at this year's Cannes
film festival, where it won the runner-up prize _ received warm but
somewhat subdued applause from the audience at the Jerusalem Film
Festival, and no ovation or bravos.
	   At a question-and-answer session immediately after the
screening, the first speaker suggested Benigni was revising
history, telling him: ``It's dangerous to laugh at the Holocaust.''
	   ``It's not a documentary. It's a fable, but invented from
truth,'' replied Benigni, who was honored earlier in the evening
with awards from the city of Jerusalem and the festival, Israel's
leading film event.
	   Nearly weeping, he added: ``It's my best cry and scream about
the Holocaust.''
	   Despite the criticism, most questioners _ and other filmgoers
interviewed afterward _ praised the film as sensitive and
compassionate.
	   ``It does not trivialize the Holocaust in any way,'' said
Mordechai Bar-On, a retired Israeli army officer who lost relatives
to the death camps. ``It does use humor, but it plays against the
awareness of enormous tragedy...I think most Israelis seeing this
film would be moved by it.''
	   Even so, the film clearly touched a raw nerve. In Israel, home
to hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors, sensitivities
surrounding Nazi atrocities often cause controversy in the arts.
	   Last month, parliament held a public forum on whether to end the
country's 50-year de facto ban on the music of Richard Wagner, a
virulent anti-Semite who was Adolf Hitler's favorite composer.
	   At that hearing, some weeping Holocaust survivors pleaded for a
continuation of the informal ban, saying works of Wagner _ which
were blared over loudspeakers in death camps _ brought back too
many horrific memories.
	   The film's distributors said that while the notion of using
humor in connection with the Holocaust is potentially explosive,
they believed its tone was overridingly serious.
	   ``He uses comedic material, yes, but it is intertwined
throughout the movie with a great sadness,'' said Aryeh Barak of
Forum Films, the distributor. ``People can laugh, but they're not
laughing at the Holocaust.''
	   Before deciding to show the film in Israel, distributors and
festival organizers screened it privately for Israeli critics and
representatives of Holocaust-survivors support groups. Barak said
the response was uniformly positive.
	   Benigni _ best known outside Italy for his hilarious, manic
performances in Jim Jarmusch's ``Down By Law'' and ``Night on
Earth'' _ was exuberant and almost giddy as he introduced the film.
	   ``I kiss you on the mouth, everybody!'' he said wildly, to
laughter and applause. He called the awards from the city and the
film festival ``my personal Oscar _ the best prize I have received
in my life.''
	   Afterward, though, the sense of lightness had entirely vanished.
	   ``I felt in my mind I was sincere _ I am a man, and I know what
is sorrow,'' Benigni passionately told the audience. ``This was the
best I could do with my soul, my mind and my body.''

	   Asked if he would appear in a live debate with Ethiopia's Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi on al-Jazeera on July 21, Afwerki said he
would.
	   ``We (Eritreans) know what results from the use of force,''
Afwerki said in fluent Arabic in the Eritrean capital of Asmara.
	   ``There are several ways to solve (the conflict),'' he said
without elaboration.
	   Afwerki and Meles were allies when they fought as leaders of
rebel groups against Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, whom they
overthrew in July 1991.
	   Asked why did not exploit his longstanding relations with Meles
to find a solution, Afwerki said: ``The personal relationship
cannot be at the expense of the national interests ... The crisis
could have gone beyond this relationship.''
	   After the overthrow of Mengistu, Eritrea negotiated a peaceful
secession from Ethiopia and became independent in 1993.

Mueller, Ali knock Koven from finals; Australia tops day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT slug line &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Xeno Mueller of Switzerland and Ali
Ibrahim Ali of Egypt knocked world champion Jamie Koven of the
United States out of the single scull semifinals of the World Cup
international team competition Saturday.
	   Overall Australia came out on top on the day's racing with 11
boats qualified for Sunday's finals. Defending champions Germany
getting 10 boats through and Britain seven.
	   Canada's Derek Porter, 1996 Olympic silver medallist, shot off
into an early lead in the race with Mueller and Ali. By 500 meters
(yards) Porter, rowing in his first international regatta this
season, was close to Ali with Mueller just behind.
	   But at about half way Mueller, the winner in Brussels three
weeks ago, powered through to take the lead and Porter dropped back
to third behind Ali.
	   Koven, recovering from a poor start, was last at 500 meters. He
pushed hard over the final 1,000 meters to pass the tiring Porter,
but just could not catch Mueller and Ali, current World Cup leader.
	   ``There are a lot of good guys this year and it was a tough
group. I'll go home and train harder,'' said Koven.
	   Joining Mueller and Ali in the finals will be the top two of the
other single scull races Saturday _ Rob Waddell of New Zealand and
Fredrik Bekken of Norway from No. 2 and Iztok Cop of Slovenia, the
defending World Cup champion, and Vaclav Chalupa of the Czech
Republic from No. 3.
	   Waddell and Bekken defeated world silver and bronze medallists
Andre Willms of Germany and Greg Searle of Britain. Searle broke
his toe while playing a football machine game at Heathrow airport
on the way out to Lucerne.
	   In the coxless fours the British world champion quartet with
multi Olympic gold medallists Steve Redgrave and Matt Pinsent
aboard won their semifinal comfortably in 6 minutes 31.97 seconds.
	   They will compete for the first time against Australia's new
version of the Oarsome Foursome, who looked ominously strong as
they won their tougher semifinal in a much faster time of 6:22.03,
easily beating Munich winners Romania.
	   Germany's world double sculls champions and 1997 World Cup
champions Stephan Volkert and Andreas Hajek also fell short,
finishing a distant fourth in their semi-final. Teammates Michelle
Darvill and Angelika Brand, the women's lightweight double scull
world and World Cup champions, suffered the same fate in their
race.
	   Germany tops the overall rankings after two regattas with 87
points, just ahead of Britain on 82. Australia missed the first
regatta of the series and currently lie sixth overall on 43 points.

Soccer star joins Red Cross effort against land mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French soccer star David Ginola on Saturday
launched his anti-land mines campaign on behalf of the
International Committee for the Red Cross which has taken him on as
a sort of poster boy for the cause.
	   Ginola, who plays for England's Tottenham Hotspur team and is a
part-time model, said he was honored to head the public face of the
campaign against land mines -- estimated to kill or maim one person
every 20 minutes somewhere in the world.
	   Ginola did not forget the woman whose personal crusade against
land mines gave new visibility to the issue -- Britain's Princess
Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris nearly a year ago, Aug. 31.
	   Speaking at a news conference at the French office of the Red
Cross, Ginola said he would ``try to resemble'' the princess in her
dedication.
	   Ginola said he hoped to visit Angola, as Princess Diana did, or
Cambodia. Both countries are thought to have among the highest rate
of land mines. As many as 10 million land mines are scattered
throughout the Cambodian countryside.
	   Ginola said he hoped to ``open the borders and the eyes'' to the
tragedy that land mines represent. ``It is a cause worth fighting
for,'' he said.
	   Ginola, 31, who has two children, said that being the father of
a family was an inspiration for his campaign. It makes him
sensitive to the pain of children and makes him want to ``bring a
message of hope.''
	   Some 60 million land mines are estimated to be scattered around
the globe in 70 countries,
	   During the past 55 years, antipersonnel mines have caused more
deaths and injuries than nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
combined.
	   Among other things, the Red Cross helps in the rehabilitation
effort of land mine victims, many of whom lose arms or legs.

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Olympic champions Donovan Bailey of
Canada and Deon Hemmings of Jamaica coasted to victory Saturday at
the Nuremberg track meet.
	   Bailey captured the 100 meters in 10.07 seconds at the event
plagued by rain and unseasonal cold, well ahead of Nigeria's Osmond
Enzinwa at 10.20.
	   Hemmings swept the women's 400 hurdles in a time of 54.10, while
Ireland's Susan Smith was a distant second in 56.32.
	   A pair of German stars on the comeback trail also posted
victories at the event.
	   Heike Drechsler leaped 6.85 meters in the long jump to edge
Atlanta silver medalist Fiona May of Italy at 6.79. Germany's Susan
Tiedtke was third at 6.66, just ahead of Shana Williams of the
United States at 6.65.
	   Lars Riedel, the Olympic champion who has been fighting illness,
tossed a 65.59 in the discus on his fourth throw to beat Adam
Setliff. The American's best was 65.42.
	   Britain's Colin Jackson also ran away from the field in the 110
hurdles with a time of 13.07, as Germans Falk Balzer chased him at
13.18 and Florian Schwarthoff at 13.29.
	   Luke Kipkosgei slipped past Paul Tergat, the former 10,000-meter
recordholder, to win the 5,000. Both men clocked 13:01.31, while
Paul Koech completed a sweep for Kenyan runners in 13:06.43.
	   In the women's high jump, Tisha Waller of the United States
cleared 1.93 meters, leaving behind Germans Daniela Rath, Alina
Astafei and Moldavia's Olga Boshova.
	   All three lept 1.86, then missed their tries at 1.90.
	   Jamaica's Merlene Ottey also won the women's 100 in 11.02,
Germany's Tim Lobinger grabbed the pole vault in 5.92 and Derrick
Brew of the United States won the 400 in 45.34.

Holocaust film with comic moments stirs painful memories in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mainly positive reception, but some filmgoers
upset by movie &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo JRL102
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An award-winning film set in a Nazi
concentration camp that featured some tenderly comic scenes won a
respectful reception Saturday at its Israel premiere. But the
combination of humor and the Holocaust proved too painful for some.
	   The movie's Italian star and director, Roberto Benigni _
renowned for a tragicomic style reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin _
offered an emotional apology to any offended by his movie, ``Life
is Beautiful,'' but defended it as a sincere and heartfelt work.
	   The film is about a father who uses a desperate and sometimes
wildly funny ruse to try to shield his little son from Nazi
horrors. He tells the boy their imprisonment is all an elaborate
game, with a wonderful prize awaiting the winner.
	   ``Life is Beautiful'' _ an unqualified hit at this year's Cannes
film festival, where it won the runner-up prize _ received warm but
somewhat subdued applause at the Jerusalem Film Festival, and no
ovation or bravos.
	   At a question-and-answer session immediately after the
screening, the first speaker suggested Benigni was revising
history, telling him: ``It's dangerous to laugh at the Holocaust.''
	   ``It's not a documentary. It's a fable, but invented from
truth,'' replied Benigni, who was honored earlier in the evening
with awards from the city of Jerusalem and the festival, Israel's
leading film event.
	   Nearly weeping, he added: ``It's my best cry and scream about
the Holocaust.''
	   Despite the criticism, most questioners _ and other filmgoers
interviewed afterward _ praised the film as sensitive and
compassionate.
	   ``It does not trivialize the Holocaust in any way,'' said
Mordechai Bar-On, a retired Israeli army officer who lost relatives
to the death camps. ``It does use humor, but it plays against the
awareness of enormous tragedy ... I think most Israelis seeing this
film would be moved by it.''
	   Even so, the film clearly touched a raw nerve. In Israel, home
to hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors, sensitivities
surrounding Nazi atrocities often cause controversy in the arts.
	   Last month, parliament held a public forum on whether to end the
country's 50-year de facto ban on the music of Richard Wagner, a
virulent anti-Semite who was Adolf Hitler's favorite composer.
	   At that hearing, some weeping Holocaust survivors pleaded for a
continuation of the informal ban, saying works of Wagner _ which
were blared over loudspeakers in death camps _ brought back too
many horrific memories.
	   The film's distributors said that while the notion of using
humor in connection with the Holocaust is potentially explosive,
they believed its tone was overridingly serious.
	   ``He uses comedic material, yes, but it is intertwined
throughout the movie with a great sadness,'' said Aryeh Barak of
Forum Films, the distributor. ``People can laugh, but they're not
laughing at the Holocaust.''
	   Before deciding to show the film in Israel, distributors and
festival organizers screened it privately for Israeli critics and
representatives of Holocaust-survivors support groups. Barak said
the response was uniformly positive.
	   Benigni _ best known outside Italy for his hilarious, manic
performances in Jim Jarmusch's ``Down By Law'' and ``Night on
Earth'' _ was exuberant and almost giddy as he introduced the film.
	   ``I kiss you on the mouth, everybody!'' he said wildly, to
laughter and applause. He called the awards from the city and the
film festival ``my personal Oscar _ the best prize I have received
in my life.''
	   Afterward, though, the sense of lightness entirely vanished.
	   ``I felt in my mind I was sincere _ I am a man, and I know what
is sorrow,'' Benigni passionately told the audience. ``This was the
best I could do with my soul, my mind and my body.''

Rwanda rebels release Canadian, Rwandan nuns; lose 50 fighters

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with army spokesman says 50 rebels killed in fighting
in northwestern Rwanda; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan rebels on Saturday released
unharmed a Canadian and two Rwandan nuns they abducted earlier in
the week, a Canadian diplomat said.
	   Meanwhile, army spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said government
troops killed more than 50 Hutu rebels and lost one soldier in two
days of fighting in northwestern Rwanda, where the nuns had been
released.
	   Ndahiro said the soldiers engaged the rebels on the border with
Congo from where the rebels have been crossing in and out of the
country.
	   It was unclear if the same group was responsible for the
abductions.
	   He said one government soldier was killed and three wounded.
	   Sister Gisele Allard, 59, who is from the Quebec area, and her
two Rwandan colleagues were freed on the Rwandan-Ugandan border,
David Foxall, Canadian chief of mission said.
	   ``They appeared out of the bush this morning. They were not
maltreated other than pushed to walk long distance,'' he said.
	   The nuns were abducted Tuesday after rebels robbed a bank and a
health center at Bungwe, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Kigali,
where the nuns often worked with patients.
	   However, they were not taken away to treat the wounded rebels,
as suspected earlier. Diplomats in Kigali, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the rebels told the nuns they were free to go as
soon as they heard news on the radio of their abduction.
	   The nuns have arrived in Kigali, but were not immediately
available for comment.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels
since 1996. The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen
responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killing ended in July 1994 when the Tutsi-led rebels won
power.

Protestant marchers, Catholic residents try road to compromise

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers and their
Catholic opponents began indirect talks Saturday in hopes of
defusing a standoff that has spilled over into gun and bomb attacks
increasingly focusing on Northern Ireland's police.
	   After six bruising nights of Protestant violence, members of the
Orange Order _ blocked since Sunday from parading down Portadown's
Garvaghy Road from rural Drumcree church _ started negotiating
through intermediaries with the road's resolute Catholic residents.
	   But after the talks adjourned Saturday night with no agreement,
the Orangemen announced they had upped the ante by making a second
application to march down the road _ starting at 12:30 p.m. (1130
GMT) Sunday.
	   Normally, applications must be made to the government-appointed
Northern Ireland Parades Commission at least seven days in advance.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the Parades
Commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' Orange Order spokesman David Jones said.
	   The commission said it would call an emergency meeting to
consider the application overnight, but was not expected to
announce its decision until Sunday morning.

Australian wins around-Manhattan swim for fifth time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NYR103-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD PYLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was an ideal day for a cool dip, and it
suited Shelly Taylor-Smith best of all as she outswam 21
competitors from around the world to win Saturday's 17th annual
Manhattan Island Swim Marathon.
	   The victory was nothing new for Taylor-Smith, a 36-year-old
Australian who is ranked No. 1 among women swimmers in the world
and won this 28.5-mile (46-kilometer) race four times previously
between 1985 and 1989.
	   She finished Saturday in 7 hours, 18 minutes, 7 seconds, well
off her own 1995 record of 5:45.25 for a swim around Manhattan, but
1 1/2 minutes ahead of Jay Benner, a 33-year-old swimming coach
from Tacoma, Washington, whose second-place time was 7:19.40.
	   ``I can't believe it. I'm overwhelmed. I wanted to do it one
last time before I retire,'' said Taylor-Smith, a motivational
speaker in Sydney, who holds 15 world swimming titles.
	   After Benner came Chris Derks, 28, of Miami, Florida, in 7:24.02
and Sarah Rice of Miami Beach _ at 17 the youngest of the 52
competitors in this year's Manhattan swim _ in 7:38.40.
	   The Badger Swim Club of New York and Westchester, winning in
7:17.51, beat out four other six-member relay teams.
	   Manhattan Island Foundation, a coalition of organizations,
sponsored the event to raise money for New York City's neighborhood
Learn to Swim program and, this year, to showcase recent progress
in cleaning up the long-polluted Hudson River.
	   Swimmers ranging in age from 17 to 63 set off from Battery Park
on the morning tide, taking a counterclockwise route up the East
River, through the tricky currents of Hell Gate into the Harlem
River and back down Manhattan's west side to the starting point.
	   Except for a wind sometimes gusting to 20 mph (32 kph), the
weather was picture perfect, with the air temperature in the low
80s and the water around 70.
	   Taylor-Smith said her victory was even more satisfying because
she had recently recovered from a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome,
caused by polluted water in Argentina.
	   ``I was amazed at how clean the water is here,'' she said.
``It's wonderful _ no garbage, no floating debris _ just one
plastic bag the whole trip.''
	   She said she encountered jellyfish and was stung a few times,
but ``that's OK. The jellyfish being there means the water's
clean.''
	   Her water-quality report should please environmental experts who
say the Hudson River is making a comeback along its 315-mile
(507-kilometer) length after decades of pollution that earned it a
rating as the nation's second-most endangered waterway.
	   The round-Manhattan swim has been a regular event since 1982
when 12 people entered. Organizers said it is a longer ``sister''
event to distance swims in the English Channel and the Catalina
Channel, both 21 miles (34 kilometers).
	   This year's entries included 16 men and six women as individual
entries and five six-member relay teams. Of the single entries, 16
were from the United States, two from Mexico and one each from
Canada, Ireland, Japan and Australia. The relay teams were all from
the New York-New Jersey area.
	   The field included two champions _ Taylor-Smith and Kris
Rutford, 38, a certified public accountant from Lincoln, Nebraska,
who set the men's record of 5 hours, 53 minutes and 57 seconds, in
the 1992 race.
	   Last year's race was won by Tammy Van Wisse, a 28-year-old
Australian making her first attempt. She was not entered this year.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire snapped a homerless drought that
had reached 21 at-bats with a two-run, 11th-inning shot into the
upper deck as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Houston Astros 4-3
Saturday.
	   McGwire's 38th homer came on an 0-2 pitch from Billy Wagner
(2-3) and went an estimated 485 feet. McGwire had been 0-for-3 with
a walk before hitting his first homer since June 30.
	   Jeff Bagwell hit his 20th homer for Houston, who took the lead
on pinch-hitter Bill Spiers' bases-loaded sacrifice fly off Lance
Painter (3-0) in the 11th.
	   The Cardinals won for the fourth time in 15 games and are 11 1-2
games behind the NL Central-leading Astros.
 &UR; Cubs 11, Brewers 8 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Henry Rodriguez hit two home runs, Jose Hernandez
hit a two-run shot and Mark Grace added a solo homer for Chicago.
	   Sammy Sosa was not part of the Cubs' four-homer attack, going
1-for-5 with an RBI single. Sosa, who homered in the first two
games after the All-Star break, has 35 on the season.
	   Cubs starter Steve Trachsel (8-5) allowed four runs and four
hits in seven-plus innings, including a two-run homer to Jeff
Cirillo and a solo shot to Jose Valentin. Rod Beck pitched the
ninth for his 24th save.
	   The Cubs snapped a two-game losing streak and won their first
since the All-Star break with six runs in the third against Cal
Eldred (4-7).

World Cup: Croatia claims third with 2-1 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Optional; adds quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ No more shadows for Croatia. It's clearly in the
sunshine all by itself.
	   The tiny Balkan nation of a scant more than 5 million people
scored its biggest victory in its short seven-year history Saturday
night, getting first-half counter-attack goals from Robert
Prosinecki and Davor Suker to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and claim
third place at the World Cup.
	   It was an amazing achievement for a country which only came into
being in 1991 and became the first debutante nation since Portugal
in 1966 to finish third at a World Cup.
	   ``I think what we demonstrated is that we're a small and perhaps
little known country, but we were able to show with great elegance
what it is capable of,'' Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic said.
	   Croatia was dominated throughout the match by the Dutch. But it
converted two of its handful of chances to earn some consolation
after being beaten by the host French in the semifinals.
	   ``I don't have any regrets,'' said Prosinecki, who played for
Yugoslavia in the 1990 World Cup. ``We're a small country in its
first World Cup and we came in third.''
	   For the Dutch, who had Prime Minister Wim Kok in attendance, it
was more dissapointment, having lost the 1974 and 1978 finals and
being eliminated by defending champion Brazil in the semifinals
this time.
	   ``I think they wanted to be third more than we did,'' Dutch
midfielder Phillip Cocu said. ``The big disappointment was (the
semifinal loss) against Brazil. If you have a chance at third or
fourth, you have to try for third. But our goal was the final.''
	   Prosinecki's goal in the 13th minute and Suker's in the 36th
both came against the run of play as the Dutch dominated possession
and allowed Croatia only three shots on net in the first 45
minutes.
	   Croatian keeper Drazen Ladic came up big at least four times,
twice in each half, to deny what appeared to be sure Dutch goals.
	   Ladic robbed Patrick Kluivert twice in the first half with his
feet, then parried away shots by Marc Overmars and Clarence Seedorf
in the final 15 minutes.
	   ``If he's not the best goalkeeper, he's one of the top three,''
Croatian midfielder-captain Zvonimir Boban said. ``When he puts his
mind to it, he is the best. He made some great saves on the Dutch
team.''
	   The Croatian strategy clearly was to counter-attack.
	   The Dutch swarmed around the net only to let Suker spring Robert
Jarni free down the left side in the 13th minute. Jarni sent in a
low cross that Prosinecki had to slow to settle, then pivoted 270
degrees to the left to elude three defenders, and beat Dutch keeper
Edwin van der Sar from eight meters.
	   The Dutch tied it in the 21st, finally cashing in on some
outright dominance.
	   Boudewijn Zenden won a ball at the right touchline, and raced to
the arc before unleashing a 23-meter, left-footed rocket that
curled left and away from Ladic.
	   But the Croats worked their counter strategy to perfection and
in the 36th retook the lead for good.
	   Zvonimir Soldo broke free on the right, and after pulling up,
sent the ball outside the top of the penalty area to Boban, who
continued it on to Suker.
	   With Dutch defender Jaap Stam about four meters away, Suker
wound up from 20 meters and shot between Stam's legs and just
inside the right post.
	   It was Suker's sixth goal and gave him the tournament lead with
only Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with four goals, capable of
catching him.
	   The game was not played without Sunday's final between France
and Brazil on the minds of many in sold-out Parc des Princes.
During the announcement of the starting lineups, the mention of
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic's name was loudly jeered.
	   Every touch by Bilic throughout the 90 minutes was accompanied
by a thunderous wave of whistles.
	   It was Bilic's theatrics after being fouled that earned French
defender Laurent Blanc a red card in Wednesday's semifinal and thus
making him ineligible for Sunday's championship match.

Pak again scorches course, field in Farr
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ Se Ri Pak picked up where she left off
after an LPGA-record 61 in the second round, birdieing seven of the
final nine holes on the way to an 8-under 63 and a nine-shot lead
through Saturday's third round of the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   ``Everything feels great now,'' said the 20-year-old Korean
rookie, who won the U.S. Women's Open on Monday in a 20-hole
playoff with amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn.
	   On the heels of her 10-under 61, the lowest score ever posted in
an LPGA event, Pak completed the lowest consecutive rounds ever on
the tour. The 63 was the second-lowest score ever shot at
6,319-yard (5776-meter) Highland Meadows Golf Club, behind only her
61 of Friday.
	   After shooting an even-par 71 in the opening round, she now
stands at 18-under 195. Karrie Webb shot a 67, the next-best round
of the day, and was alone in second at 9-under.
	   Pak declined to say she already has captured the dlrs 120,000
first prize.
	   ``You don't know. I don't know,'' she said. ``I shot 10-under.
Maybe someone else can shoot 10-under, too.''
	   But her distant pursuers weren't talking as if that was a strong
possibility.
	   ``She's different,'' Webb said. ``To win two majors your rookie
year is really something. That is very difficult, considering the
two courses she won on, especially last week on a course where you
have to be patient. Obviously, she's got a lot of patience.''
	   Betsy King, who started the day tied for second, two shots
behind Pak, played in the same group and watched huge galleries
cheer Pak's every move. A Hall of Famer, King shot a 72 and was 11
shots back.
	   ``She missed one putt inside 15 feet and that was on the first
hole when she had a bogey,'' King said. ``But she made about eight
putts outside of 15 feet. You have weeks like that. She's just on a
roll.''
	   Asked if the tournament was over, King said, ``Yeah, I think so.
Se Ri would have to shoot about a 74 to allow anybody back in the
tournament. You never know. I've seen stranger things happen. But
as well as she's playing now, it would be tough to catch her.''
	   Only two players have ever won their next tournament after
capturing the Open, Louise Suggs in 1952 and Jane Geddes in 1986.
	   It was the second day in a row Pak piled up 10 birdies in her
round. In the second round, which erased the LPGA mark of 62
accomplished by seven golfers, she had 10 without a bogey. This
time she bogeyed two of the first five holes and made the turn in
1-under.
	   But on the back nine, she caught fire again.
	   She birdied the final two holes Friday and the last four
Saturday.
	   At No. 15, she almost holed her A-wedge approach and tapped in.
At 16, she hit a 9-iron to 15 feet (5-meters) and made the putt. At
the par-5 17th, she was just short of the green in two, hit a sand
wedge 10 feet (3-meters) short of the hole and knocked it in.
	   With a huge crowd ringing the 18th, she was just short of the
green in two and hit a sand wedge to 2 feet (a meter). There was
never any doubt that she'd make the birdie putt.
	   She set out to go under the 61.
	   ``I just try because I want to make new record,'' she said.
``Golf is not easy. Maybe I make three birdies, five birdies, but I
try. I try my best, I play my game. I just want a good score. I
didn't want to push myself.''
	   If she tries as hard in the final round, she has several records
in sight. The 72-hole LPGA record is 23-under par, set by Wendy
Ward in 1997 and matched earlier this year by Lisa Walters in the
Oldsmobile Classic.
	   The largest margin is 14 shots, set by Suggs in 1949 and matched
by Cindy Mackey in 1986.
	   The tournament scoring record is 19-under, set by Kelly Robbins
last year. Pak has already set Farr records for best round (61) and
best third-round score (63) and is on pace to exceed Robbins'
eight-shot margin.
	   Asked how she will approach the final round, Pak said, ``The
same. Nothing changes. ... I will play my best. After that, I just
want to rest.''

Rwanda rebels release Canadian, Rwandan nuns; lose 50 fighters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Allard interview by CBC's French-language
network. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan rebels on Saturday released
unharmed a Canadian and two Rwandan nuns they abducted earlier in
the week, a Canadian diplomat said.
	   Meanwhile, army spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said government
troops killed more than 50 Hutu rebels and lost one soldier in two
days of fighting in northwestern Rwanda, where the nuns had been
released.
	   Ndahiro said the soldiers engaged the rebels on the border with
Congo from where the rebels have been crossing in and out of the
country. It was unclear if the same group was responsible for the
abductions.
	   He said one government soldier was killed and three wounded.
	   Sister Gisele Allard, 59, who is from the Quebec area, and her
two Rwandan colleagues were freed on the Rwandan-Ugandan border,
David Foxall, Canadian chief of mission said.
	   ``They appeared out of the bush this morning. They were not
maltreated other than pushed to walk long distance,'' he said.
	   Allard, in an interview with the CBC's French-language network
on Saturday, says her four days in captivity were ``a positive
experience.''
	   ``It was like I woke up from a dream,'' said Allard, who is with
the Sisters of Ste-Chretien, in the Quebec City suburb of Beauport.
``I don't regret (the experience) at all. It was really a positive
experience for me because I met people I have wanted to know for a
long time.
	   ``I was able to contact them, speak to them, have an audience
with them. I appreciated it. I saw them as living people,'' she
said.
	   The nuns were abducted Tuesday after rebels robbed a bank and a
health center at Bungwe, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Kigali,
where the nuns often worked with patients.
	   However, they were not taken away to treat the wounded rebels,
as suspected earlier. Diplomats in Kigali, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the rebels told the nuns they were free to go as
soon as they heard news on the radio of their abduction.
	   The nuns arrived Saturday in Kigali.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels
since 1996. The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen
responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The killing ended in July 1994 when the Tutsi-led rebels won
power.

Morgan, Irwin set stage for final showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ A crucial mistake on the 17th hole was
all that separated Gil Morgan and Hale Irwin after the third round
of the Senior Players Championship on Saturday.
	   Morgan played it safe and walked off with a one-stroke lead over
Irwin, who bogeyed after hitting his approach on the next-to-last
hole in the water. Morgan shot a 4-under-par 68 for a 201 total
while Irwin had a third-round 67.
	   Bob Murphy, seeking his first victory of the season, charged
from far back in the pack with a superb putting display to shoot a
64 and was at 203.
	   Isao Aoki and Jim Colbert each shot 66s and were five shots off
the lead at 206. Jack Nicklaus, the sentimental favorite, had to
settle for a 72 and was well off the pace at 209.
	   Murphy, who earlier in the week complained about side effects
from his arthritis medicine, appeared to have fallen out of
contention after a second-round 72 left him at 139, six strokes off
the lead. But he quickly began making up ground under almost
perfect conditions.
	   Murphy, winner of 11 tournaments since joining the senior
circuit in 1993, played error-free golf with five birdies on the
front side to turn at 10 under, four shots out of the lead. He got
to 12 under with birdies at Nos. 12 and 13.
	   The string ended at No. 14 with his first bogey. But birdies at
No. 16 and 17 put him back in the chase.
	   Morgan and Irwin, meanwhile, were waging their own private
battle. Paired with Morgan and Jim Albus in the final threesome,
Irwin needed only four holes to make up a two-stroke deficit,
catching Morgan at 12 under with his second birdie.
	   From that point on, it was almost like match play as the two
went birdie for birdie, remaining even through the next 11 holes.
Each birdied Nos. 7, 9 and 13 to reach 15 under and both bogeyed
No. 16.
	   Then came the crucial 17th, a 521-yard (476-meter) par-5 with a
long pond fronting the green. Irwin hit a long drive, but pulled a
4-wood into the pond in his attempt to reach the green in two.
Morgan played it safe, laying up on both of his first two shots.
	   His routine par put Morgan one stroke in front of Irwin, who
scrambled to a bogey. They both birdied the home hole.
	   Morgan and Irwin are easily the two hottest players on the
Senior PGA Tour. They have each won three times this season and
rank first and second on the money list. Irwin, who finished second
at the State Farm Senior Classic last week, has earned dlrs 1.3
million, about dlrs 300,000 more than Morgan.
	   Nicklaus, whose streak of 154 majors will end when he skips the
British Open next week, was tied with Albus at seven under when the
round started at the TPC of Michigan, a course he designed. But he
opened with a bogey and struggled through the first nine holes,
turning in 35.
	   Nicklaus, winner of 18 majors plus two U.S. Amateur titles,
looked a little like the Golden Bear of old at the start of the
back side, reeling off birdies on three of the first four holes to
reach 11 under.
	   But it all fell apart when Nicklaus, who is considering surgery
for his ailing left hip, triple-bogeyed No. 14, the signature hole
which is bordered by wetlands from tee to green, and also bogeyed
16.
	   Colbert, who won the tournament sponsored by Ford Motor Co. in
1993, also made a nice charge. Colbert, looking for his first
victory since recovering from prostate cancer surgery last year,
made six birdies without a bogey. Aoki, tied with Colbert at four
under at the start of the round, had a roller-coaster round that
included two eagles and a double-bogey.

	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Scott Erickson allowed four hits in 8 2-3
innings and Joe Carter homered as the Baltimore Orioles won their
third straight over Boston, 2-1 Saturday.
	   The Orioles, who still trail Boston by 12{ games in the
wild-card race, are on their first three-game winning streak since
June 1-3
	   Erickson (9-7) struck out eight and walked one. He retired the
first 13 batters before Troy O'Leary hit a soft liner to right
field that dropped well in front of Carter. The only run he allowed
came when John Valentin led off the eighth with his 12th homer.
Jess Orosco got the final out for his sixth save.
	   Tim Wakefield (10-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Mariners 2, Angels 0 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Randy Johnson, pitching a day after being involved
in a clubhouse fight with teammate David Segui, struck out 15 in
his first shutout of the season for Seattle.
	   Anaheim's seventh loss in eight games knocked the Angels out of
first place in the AL West. They fell a half-game behind Texas.
	   Johnson (8-8) allowed five hits and two walks in his first
shutout since last Aug. 8, when he beat the Chicago White Sox 5-0.
	   Johnson knocked Segui _ the Mariners' leading hitter with a .329
batting average _ out of the game with a sprained right wrist.
Johnson went after Segui after Segui made a remark about him to
teammate Jay Buhner.
	   Edgar Martinez's two-run single off Steve Sparks (3-1) in the
sixth inning accounted for all the scoring.
 &UR; Indians 12, Twins 2 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Brian Giles was 4-for-5 with four RBIs and his
first homer in nearly two months, and Dwight Gooden outpitched
All-Star Brad Radke.
	   Travis Fryman hit his 16th homer and second in two days as AL
Central-leading Cleveland extended its lead over second-place
Minnesota to 11 1/2 games.
	   Radke (9-7), the Twins' only All-Star representative, gave up
eight runs and 11 hits in five-plus innings, falling to 4-8 with a
6.69 ERA in his career against Cleveland.
	   Gooden (3-3) pitched seven innings, allowing one run and four
hits, including a homer to David Ortiz.
 &UR; Rangers 4, Athletics 2 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Luis Alicea had a three-run double with
two outs in the ninth inning as Texas beat Oakland to take the AL
West lead.
	   The Rangers loaded the bases against Mike Fetters (1-3) on a
one-out single, a walk and an error by first baseman Brian Lesher.
	   Fetters got Kevin Elster to line to short for the second out,
but Alicea lined a 3-2 pitch off the top of the wall in right
center.
	   The victory moved the Rangers back into first place, a half-game
in front of Anaheim. Texas has won five straight.
	   Xavier Hernandez (4-1) got one out in the eighth for the
victory. John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 25th save.
	   Juan Gonzalez, who had 101 RBIs at the All-Star break, went
1-for-3 and is 2-for-11 in three games since the break with no
RBIs.

Protestant marchers, Catholic residents try road to compromise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new graf 12 reporting protesters hurling stones,
fireworks; police firing plastic bullets
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers and their
Catholic opponents began indirect talks Saturday in hopes of
defusing a standoff that has spilled over into gun and bomb attacks
increasingly focusing on Northern Ireland's police.
	   After six bruising nights of Protestant violence, members of the
Orange Order _ blocked since Sunday from parading down Portadown's
Garvaghy Road from rural Drumcree church _ started negotiating
through intermediaries with the road's resolute Catholic residents.
	   But after the talks adjourned Saturday night with no agreement,
the Orangemen announced they had upped the ante by making a second
application to march down the road _ starting at 12:30 p.m. (1130
GMT) Sunday.
	   Normally, applications must be made to the government-appointed
Northern Ireland Parades Commission at least seven days in advance.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the Parades
Commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' Orange Order spokesman David Jones said.
	   The commission said it would call an emergency meeting to
consider the application overnight, but was not expected to
announce its decision until Sunday morning.
	   The indirect talks, which went six hours Saturday, adjourned
until an unspecified time sometime after Sunday.
	   No details of the discussions were announced, leaving police to
fear tensions would peak this weekend with the 12th of July
holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the defeat of
Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.
	   The streets of normally bustling Belfast began emptying early
Saturday afternoon in anticipation of more trouble, and thousands
of Orangemen swelled the increasingly impatient ranks behind the
steel and barbed-wire barricades at Portadown.
	   The situation outside the Orangemen's rural Anglican church was
steadily deteriorating, with protesters using children to cut the
wire to get closer to security forces, Assistant Chief Constable
Tom Craig said Saturday.
	   ``They're trying to get within range where they can kill police
officers,'' he said.
	   Late Saturday, violence flared around Drumcree as police came
under attack from protesters hurling stones, bricks and fireworks.
Police fired plastic bullets in return. Witnesses reported police
in hand-to-hand scuffles with protesters to prevent them climbing
over the barricades.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers and their
Catholic opponents began indirect talks in hopes of defusing a
standoff that has spilled over into gun and bomb attacks that
increasingly have focused on police. After six bruising nights of
Protestant violence, members of the Orange Order _ blocked since
last Sunday from parading down Garvaghy Road in Portadown _ started
negotiating Saturday through intermediaries with the road's
resolute Catholic residents. But authorities held out little hope
for a quick solution and feared tensions would peak this weekend
with the 12th of July holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of
the defeat of Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at
the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Preliminary findings of an independent
autopsy indicated Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner died
naturally of a heart attack. The findings were released Saturday
just after Moshood Abiola was buried in a garden ceremony at his
Lagos home. ``In our opinion the mechanism of death is due to a
rapid deterioration in a diseased heart,'' Canadian Dr. James Young
said. ``At this time, our preliminary opinion is that death was due
to natural causes as a result of his long-standing heart disease.''
Young, a Canadian coroner, was one of several forensic scientists
flown to Nigeria to conduct the autopsy. The team's findings could
help ease tensions in Nigeria, although Dr. Ore Falomo, Abiola's
personal physician, said that a full autopsy report would be issued
only after additional forensic tests on body tissue samples that
were to be flown to Britain and Canada. (NIGERIA)
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces pounded Albanian rebels
outside Kosovo's second-largest city, brushing aside international
calls for a cease-fire. Hundreds of terrified civilians fled over
twisting mountain roads to escape the fighting. Serb troops began
shelling the town of Lodja, just outside this western Kosovo city,
about dawn Saturday. The attacks continued until midday. The ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Information Center said at the height of the
barrage, shells were falling at the rate of about one a minute but
the village remained in the hands of the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Lodja is a stronghold of the KLA, which is
battling for independence for Kosovo from Serbia _ a part of
Yugoslavia. The village also is reputedly a center for arms
smuggling from Albania, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the
south. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Rebuffing an appeal from the United
States, Palestinians said they will negotiate face-to-face with
Israel only if it accepts U.S. proposals for a West Bank pullback.
``Resuming direct talks with Israel depends on its declaration of
commitment to the U.S. initiative,'' Palestinian negotiator Hasan
Asfour said Saturday. On Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Israel and the Palestinians had to
negotiate in order to settle their differences on the American
pullback plan, which has been widely reported but never formally
unveiled. The United States has been trying to win an Israeli
agreement to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank. Palestinians now fully or partly control 27 percent of it.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Voters hoping for an end to Ecuador's
political chaos and rampant corruption decide between the
Harvard-trained mayor of Quito and a populist banana tycoon in
Sunday's presidential runoff. Polls show centrist Mayor Jamil
Mahuad with a wide lead over political newcomer Alvaro Noboa, but
the gap has narrowed recently and few write Noboa off, given
Ecuador's volatile politics. The two were the top vote-getters in
the first electoral round on May 31. Mahuad led by about 25 points
at the beginning of the second round, but the difference is now
closer to 10 points, said Polibio Cordoba, director of the private
polling company Cedatos. The winner of Sunday's runoff will replace
interim President Fabian Alarcon, inheriting an economy devastated
by El Nino-powered floods, high inflation, and the falling price of
the nation's main export, oil. (ECUADOR-ELECTIONS)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Princess Diana's stepmother, Sheena Easton,
Antonio Banderas and George Harrison. Some items may also have
moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's relationship with Dodi Fayed was
``no holiday romance,'' her stepmother was quoted as saying in The
Mirror newspaper Saturday.
	   ``This was real love, the kind you can look for all your life
and never find,'' the tabloid quoted Countess Raine Spencer, 68, as
saying. ``I know because they both told me.''
	   Diana, 36, Dodi, 42, and chauffeur Henri Paul, 41, were killed
in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31.
	   ``People should know the truth about their relationship, rather
than what the rumor mongers with their own agendas would have us
believe,'' the newspaper quoted the countess as saying.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sheena Easton is divorcing her third husband
after less than a year of marriage.
	   The Scottish-born singer-actress eloped with documentary film
director Timothy Delarm last July to Las Vegas. It was the first
marriage for Delarm. Now a naturalized U.S. citizen, Easton filed
for divorce Friday, according to court documents.
	   The 39-year-old won her first of two Grammys in 1981 as best new
artist. She is known for such 1980s hits as ``Morning Train'' and
the James Bond film theme song, ``For Your Eyes Only.'' In 1987,
she performed a duet with Prince, ``U Got The Look.''
	   As an actress, her credits include playing Don Johnson's rock
star wife on ``Miami Vice'' and Broadway appearances in ``Grease''
and ``Man of La Mancha.''
	   Divorce papers cited irreconcilable differences and ask the
court to deny Delarm spousal support.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Antonio Banderas' sword fighting scenes in
``The Mask of Zorro'' were often painfully real.
	   ``If you are fighting with real swords for one hour in the
morning, you're feeling great and focused,'' he said. ``After 14
hours working, you start being a little less focused. I think I was
bleeding practically every day we did sword fights.''
	   The Spanish-born Banderas thinks it's about time that a Spaniard
played the hero who fights oppression in Spanish-ruled Old
California.
	   The role ``has never been acted or performed by a Spanish guy,''
he told the Los Angeles Times in a story published Saturday.
	   The role could cement Banderas' image as a movie heartthrob but
the 37-year-old takes his sex symbol status lightly.
	   ``I don't care,'' he said. ``It doesn't bother me and it doesn't
make me feel like a superhero.
	   ``It's just a question of time, anyway. There's going to be a
moment when I start losing my hair, when I start getting a little
fatter.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ George Harrison's dispute with two Maui
neighbors all those years ago isn't worthy of a defamation lawsuit
against the former Beatle, the state Supreme Court decided.
	   The high court has upheld the dismissal of a defamation lawsuit
against Harrison, who was sued over alleged remarks he made during
a 1993 land dispute. It centered on neighbors' demand to be allowed
to use an old path to a beach near Harrison's home on Maui.
	   Steven Gold and Scott Whitney alleged that Harrison said during
the dispute, ``I'm being raped by all these people. ... My privacy
is being violated.''
	   The high court upheld a 1996 court ruling that dismissed the
lawsuit on grounds the remark clearly was ``rhetorical hyperbole''
and was not defamatory. The Supreme Court agreed, adding that such
speech is protected by law.
	   The court also ordered the plaintiffs' lawyer to pay dlrs 12,500
for Harrison's legal fees and the plaintiffs to pay costs of the
appeal.

Drivers lining up for Rahal's ride
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The line is forming for the ride that Bobby
Rahal will vacate following the 1998 season.
	   Rahal, who owns his own team in the CART FedEx Championship
Series, is retiring from driving at the end of the year. As the
season reaches its halfway mark with Sunday's Medic Drug Grand Prix
of Cleveland, the list of possible replacements continues to grow.
	   One driver who has talked to Rahal about the ride is 1996 PPG
Cup champion Jimmy Vasser. He could be the frontrunner for the job
_ if he isn't convinced to stay with Target-Chip Ganassi Racing.
	   Other drivers reportedly under consideration include CART
drivers Gil de Ferran and Robby Gordon, Indy Racing League entry
Greg Ray and Formula One drivers Damon Hill and Heinz-Harald
Frentzen.
	   ``There is nothing settled at this point, but we're hoping to
have the situation wrapped up within a month,'' Rahal said.
	   Although Rahal has final say in choosing the new driver,
principal sponsor Miller Brewing Company will be consulted before a
final decision is made.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAR GAZING: Saturday was a big day in downtown Cleveland.
Besides final qualifying for the race, the Indians played the Twins
at Jacobs Field, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had a free concert
by John Fogerty, lead singer of Creedance Clearwater Revival, and
Janet Jackson performed at Gund Arena.
	   Al Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti, two of CART's biggest stars,
took advantage of the situation, with Unser meeting Fogerty and
receiving a signed Stratocaster guitar for his personal collection
and Andretti meeting Jackson, one of his favorite performers,
before her show.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CORNERED: Race drivers will find a way to take advantage of
nearly any change.
	   CART officials have removed a concrete barrier that ran along
the chicane between turns nine and 10 _ the last two corners on the
2.106-mile (3.3-kilometer) road course.
	   Now, by changing their entry to turn nine, the drivers are able
to get through both the last turns without downshifting.
	   ``It's practically a straightaway now,'' Gil de Ferran said. ``I
love that area now, because you can get some speed through there.''
	   The downside is that cars can now go through turns nine and 10
side-by-side, but they can't come back out onto the final
straightaway that way.
	   ``I don't think it's going to be a problem in the race,'' Wally
Dallenbach, CART's chief steward, said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WINE TASTY: Mario Andretti has retired as a driver, but the
longtime open-wheel racing star is still keeping busy.
	   Among his projects are the Andretti Winery in Napa, California,
100 kilometers (60 miles) from San Francisco, which opened to the
public this summer.
	   The winery, which has been renovated to look like a Tuscan
Village, already has produced a 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon that
recently won a silver medal at the prestigious Orange County Wine
Tasting Fair.
	   ``And our '95 is going to be even better,'' Andretti said
Saturday while watching son Michael during practice for Sunday's
race.
	   The elder Andretti was born in Italy, where his father owned
several farms that produced wine grapes.
	   ``He never made wine for sale, but he always made some wine for
our family and friends,'' Andretti said.

Celebrity chef cooks up an empire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY342 &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDA DEUTSCH &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ It is a sun-dappled afternoon
in this mecca of the overprivileged. Those who care about where and
what they eat are lunching on the tree-shaded patio of Spago
Beverly Hills.
	   This is a relatively new addition to the culinary empire of
Wolfgang Puck, and one enters its rarefied atmosphere certain that
the millionaire king of California cuisine will be nowhere in
sight.
	   But who's that over there? The round-faced fellow with the big
smile in the spotless white jacket, apron and striped pants. Well,
of course, it's Puck himself, flushed from the kitchen heat and
stopping to chat with some of his well-known clientele.
	   Sen. Barbara Boxer of California is at one table while
deal-maker Mike Ovitz negotiates at another. It is the height of
lunch hour and Puck is doing what he has always done _ cooking.
	   Does the celebrity chef really have time to stir the soup?
	   ``I work for a living,'' he laughed. ``This is what I do. I
don't know anything else.''
	   As he finally sits down to talk about the food revolution he
inspired, a tornado blows in the door _ his dynamo of a wife,
Barbara Lazaroff, who bills herself as the brains of the Spago
business empire. Without her, she hints, Puck would be just another
guy who cooked some interesting food.
	   ``I have a much busier day than Mr. Puck,'' she said, expressing
impatience at an interview heavy on Puck's food philosophy. ``I
have many business engagements and documents to go over. I have an
Architectural Digest photo shoot. I sit on the board of directors
of food companies ... I'm not the design chick.''
	   For years Ms. Lazaroff was known as the innovative force behind
the design of Puck's restaurants. The wildly colored tiles that
decorate the Wolfgang Puck Cafes are her trademark, along with
expensive art, fountains, chandeliers and exotic foliage.
	   ``Wolf loves to cook. He loves to present food,'' she said.
``He's like a mother. I don't get that gratification. I'm fighting
with contractors and subcontractors, trying to get everyone to be
harmonious.''
	   Together for 19 years, they have built an empire with sales
hovering above dlrs 126 million a year. Most famous are the fine
dining restaurants _ Spago locations in West Hollywood, Beverly
Hills and Las Vegas; Chinois in Santa Monica, California, and Las
Vegas; Postrio in San Francisco; Granita in Malibu, California; and
ObaChine in Beverly Hills, Seattle and Phoenix.
	   The Spago name and concept are licensed to restaurants in Tokyo
and Mexico City, and one is set to open in Kuwait.
	   ``When I was l6 or 17 years old, I dreamed of opening a
restaurant,'' Puck recalled of his Austrian boyhood. ``I thought
what I'd really like to do was have two restaurants.''
	   Now, it's hard to count them all. The Wolfgang Puck Cafes, a
casual, moderately priced take on the pizza-and-pasta formula, are
proliferating across the nation. The latest of a dozen cafes is an
18,000-square-foot (1,670-square-meter) extravaganza at Disney
World in Orlando, Florida.
	   Wolfgang Puck Express is an even more scaled down fast-food
variation on the concept and is designed for travelers. There are
two at Los Angeles International Airport and about a dozen
elsewhere.
	   Then there's the frozen food business, reaching into American
homes with pizza, lasagna and ravioli. And don't forget the
Wolfgang Puck cookbooks, videos and signature cookware.
	   For Puck and Ms. Lazaroff, the byproduct of all this is an
incredibly stressful life. They have two small sons, Cameron, 8,
and Byron, 3, and a large menagerie of animals. But they admit they
are rarely at home and rarely socialize.
	   ``Our job is to work while other people are partying,'' said Ms.
Lazaroff.
	   Their travel schedule is dizzying as they jet among the various
restaurant locations and take part in an extraordinary number of
charitable events, from Meals on Wheels to AIDS to March of Dimes.
	   Puck insists on keeping his hand in all the restaurants, cooking
on-site and holding training sessions for the staff. He realizes
that his philosophy of food is the heart of the entire enterprise.
	   He never forgets his start at Ma Maison, a tony West Hollywood
restaurant where he first made his name as a chef for owner Patrick
Terrail.
	   ``We were part of a beginning which made a difference in how
Americans ate,'' he said. ``There was a time when everything
imported was the thing to do. When we started at Spago and Ma
Maison we said, 'Let's use what's around us and look at the
cultures around us.' Cooking is a reflection of the place where you
live.''
	   Thus was born California cuisine, a blending of Asian, American
and European influences with an emphasis on fresh produce and meat.
Santa Barbara shrimp and free-range chicken were staples of the
menu. There were wood-burning ovens for designer pizzas and an open
kitchen where diners could watch chefs preparing their dinner. Puck
turned out to be a master showman in the kitchen.
	   The look of the original Spago was light and airy, the
antithesis of what Puck calls ``the stuffy environment'' of most
gourmet restaurants.
	   It was a total concept, Puck said, and ``It was important that
it all fit together. You don't want a black suit with brown shoes.
It has to be a complete statement.''
	   Ultimately, Puck concedes it was more than cooking that made
Spago a hot restaurant.
	   ``It became famous for not only how I cooked but the clientele.
One night, Billy Wilder, who is Austrian, brought in a table of
movie stars and then a journalist wrote that Spago was the place to
go,'' Puck said.
	   ``There was a certain magic here in the '70s and '80s,'' he said
nostalgically. ``There were less restaurants where people wanted to
go. ... Hollywood has changed.''
	   Now, his clientele isn't as star-studded but is heavy with movie
moguls and high-powered executives.
	   ``You can have a few stars and starlets, but they leave to make
a movie and don't come in for six months,'' he said. ``You have to
be here to serve everybody as if they were big stars.''
	   The future for Ms. Lazaroff and Puck appears to be more of the
same. She's keeping her eye on the bottom line, developing a
marketing Web site, planning for a time when the company goes
public.
	   Puck, at 49, has finally become a U.S. citizen and said he
dreams of less travel and more time with his kids. His goals for
the future are simple: ``stay in business, stay healthy and make a
good living.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Crosby has a new band and a ``new'' son,
35-year-old James Raymond, at the keyboard.
	   The former member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young fathered a child when he was 21. The boy's mother gave him up
for adoption and moved to Australia.
	   The child grew up knowing he was adopted and that his birth
father had been in music. Jackson Browne, perhaps, he would
fantasize.
	   ``Ouch,'' Crosby, 56, squealed when his son revealed his fantasy
during a recent joint interview. ``You never told me that.''
	   Raymond decided to trace his birth parents when he got engaged
five years ago. At the same time, his mother was trying to trace
him. They found each other and she attended his wedding.
	   He waited another year before getting in touch with Crosby. Part
of it, he says, was that as a musician, he didn't want to seem to
be asking Crosby for help. ``I wanted to get a message to him that
I was out there and see if he was receptive. I was slow in
executing it. I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was his
public persona.''
	   Raymond was always attracted to keyboards. His parents, a
Rialto, California, couple named Raymond, told him that when he was
3, he'd go to a piano or organ and bang out something. ``They got
me a little organ when I was 6. I knew I would play music from the
age of reason.''
	   Crosby says he often wondered where his son was and if he was
all right. ``I regretted losing him many times. I was too immature
to parent anybody, and too irresponsible. It was a tremendous load
off my mind to meet him and find out he was OK. Better than OK,
actually.''
	   When Raymond read in 1995 that Crosby had to cancel a tour
because he was sick, he thought at first that Crosby needed a
kidney transplant and that he might be a donor. ``You never told me
that,'' Crosby says, sounding touched.
	   In fact, hepatitis preceded by years of drugs and drinking had
left Crosby in need of a liver transplant. While hospitalized, he
heard from Raymond's parents.
	   ``I got a letter from these incredibly sweet, good, human beings
saying, `We raised your son, James.' Then somebody came in and
said, `Lie down and breathe this,' and they operated,'' he
recalled.
	   ``I'd been in the hospital quite a while. They couldn't keep me
alive anymore outside. The doctors said I was no more than a couple
of weeks from dying when they finally had a match. A kid who was in
a wreck saved four lives that night. He'd listed himself as an
organ donor.''
	   Crosby and Raymond met in the hospital cafeteria after Crosby
was released and returned for tests. Both were nervous. Crosby was
afraid his son would blame him for his abandonment.
	   ``He walked in the door looking better than Tom Cruise,'' Crosby
said. ``I had trouble believing anybody that good looking was
related to me.''
	   ``He did a wonderful thing. He knew I was choked up and trying
to figure some way to say I was sorry. He told me he'd had a good
life and when he wanted to be a musician his parents had nurtured
that and loved him a lot. He'd never been hurt. He knew I was in
pain over all of it. He showed a lot of compassion.''
	   Raymond says the two connected immediately. ``We were talking
about music in 10 minutes. ... He got this puppy dog look and said,
`Do you like my music?' '' Raymond, who had been listening to
Crosby's music during the past year, was able to say, ``Yes.''
	   The day after the two met, Raymond's wife Stacia gave birth to a
daughter, Grace. Four months later, Crosby's wife Jan, after 21
years together, gave birth to Django, who is Grace's uncle. He is
named for the famed Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. Crosby
proudly shows pictures of both children, now 3, from his wallet.
The lyrics of a famous song from his previous life leap to mind:
``Teach your children well, Their father's hell did slowly go by
... .''
	   Crosby's musical career has been reincarnated in a CD _ and a
group _ called CPR, the initials of Crosby, Raymond and guitarist
Jeff Pevar. The group is playing Switzerland, Italy, France,
Holland, Germany and Moscow this month.
	   They started writing songs together soon after Crosby and
Raymond met. Crosby says he has never been happier.
	   ``It's all new music, which is wonderful at my time of life,''
he says.
	   Of Raymond, he says, ``The thing I can see most clearly is how
much he loves the music. He wants to understand more, be better,
constantly. He's more organized than I am, smarter than I am. In
the long run, he'll cover more ground than I have.''
	   He feels he has been given another chance.
	   In the mid-1980s he spent a year in the Texas State Penitentiary
for drug possession after he ran away from a court-ordered
treatment program.
	   Jail ``was a good wake-up call and I don't regret it a bit.
Being a junkie is a worse prison than being in prison. I'd been a
junkie, speed freak, free baser, chemical dump site, for 20 years.
Now I'm 12 years clean and sober.''
	   This fall, Crosby and Nash plan to make a benefit album for the
Children's Defense Fund. Crosby, Nash and Stephen Stills also have
recorded half a dozen songs for a new album. And CPR has worked on
seven songs so far for a second album.
	   ``CPR is where most of my energy has gone and will go,'' Crosby
says. ``This is new music. At this point in my life, forward motion
gets real important.''

Pretenders open another season of rock on TV
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY379 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There is rock 'n' roll and there is rock 'n'
roll on television. Chrissie Hynde learned the difference when a
makeup artist, powder puff in hand, scampered across the stage
toward her during a break between songs.
	   ``We've got to stop the show because I've got some shine,'' the
Pretenders' lead singer said, looking slightly mortified.
	   She waved off the woman, preferring a towel to wipe away sweat
that reflected light into a camera. Drummer Martin Chambers
wondered aloud if his bald spot was causing similar problems.
	   Both shrugged off the annoyance to finish a sharp, 90-minute set
earlier this week. Producers hurriedly distilled it into an
hour-long ``Hard Rock Live'' installment in time for the season
premiere this Friday on VH1.
	   In Hynde, they had a reluctant TV star.
	   ``I don't like being on television particularly, because I don't
think music comes off very well,'' she said a few hours before her
performance. ``But it's more the name of the game these days. This
is America, and if Americans see you on television, then you
exist.''
	   While nothing replaces the experience of music in a club or
arena, the electronic concert halls of television are becoming
increasingly important to a music career.
	   For one thing, cable gives music many more television outlets.
``Hard Rock Live'' and ``Storytellers,'' where musicians
intersperse songs with stories, are regular series on VH1. Sister
station MTV has a weekly live music series and still makes
installments of its ``Unplugged'' series. PBS's ``Sessions at West
57th'' is another respected music series. Black Entertainment
Television will introduces an hour-long concert series that will
run five nights a week in the fall.
	   U.S. Talk show hosts like Jay Leno, David Letterman, Oprah
Winfrey, Rosie O'Donnell and Conan O'Brien also offer regular slots
to musical acts.
	   All are a long way from the grainy footage of concert specials
of the 1970s, often shown post-midnight, if at all. And with radio
station playlists tightening considerably in the 1990s, more often
television is the place for artists to expose their new work.
	   Hynde is old enough to be mom to sarcastic teen-agers who wonder
whether there was television when she grew up. Television, yes, but
her music career began in another era that seems prehistoric to
young people: before MTV.
	   In their early years, the Pretenders and other British-based
bands made rock videos that were aired on children's shows in
England. When MTV started in 1981, its playlist was filled with
this material.
	   ``It looked like there was this English invasion in music when
actually there wasn't,'' she said. ``We just happened to have a few
videos knocking about.''
	   Hynde winces when she sees ``rockumentaries'' that glamorize the
mundane lives of musicians. Television's unforgiving nature is also
somewhat intimidating for her: It's tougher to play past a bad
night and hope no one notices.
	   ``You can't rely on any other party tricks you may have up your
sleeves,'' she said.
	   When the Pretenders were asked to be on ``Hard Rock Live,'' she
wanted to see some past shows and producers sent tapes of
performances by the Indigo Girls, Lou Reed, Rusted Root and Paula
Cole.
	   She liked that they simply got on stage and played.
	   ``If you like that act and they sounded pretty good that night,
you'll like the show,'' she said. ``It wasn't like there were these
incredible camera angles or something. It was the
straightforwardness that appealed to me.''
	   So the Pretenders, standing on a New York soundstage designed to
look like the ruins of ancient Greece, simply played. There were
two new songs, but mostly they roared through hits like ``Back on
the Chain Gang,'' ``Precious'' and ``Middle of the Road.''
	   Television cameras couldn't quite tame Hynde's rebellious
spirit. She seemed annoyed that organizers didn't want to hear
``Precious,'' presumably because of its obscenities. She also
didn't ingratiate herself to sponsors.
	   ``I know this won't make the final cut,'' she confided to the
studio audience, ``but we by no means endorse the Hard Rock Cafe in
any way.''
	   Further evidence that rock 'n' roll isn't always polite. Even
television can't change that.
	   The second season of ``Hard Rock Live'' stretches into October,
with acts like Third Eye Blind, Boyz II Men, Ani DiFranco, Trisha
Yearwood and the Allman Brothers Band. Each week's show is repeated
three times: Saturdays, Thursdays and Mondays.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``The magic numbers,'' Milton Berle confided,
``are 50-85-90. Get it?''
	   Sure, Uncle Miltie. We get it:
	   It was 50 years ago _ June 8, 1948, to be exact _ that Berle
debuted on ``Texaco Star Theater,'' the show that catapulted
network television into the big time and reportedly sold more TV
sets than any ad campaign.
	   In 1913, when he was 5, Berle appeared in the first full-length
movie comedy, ``Tillie's Punctured Romance,'' starring Marie
Dressler and Charlie Chaplin. Thus, he can boast 85 years as a
performer.
	   As for the number 90, he was born Milton Berlinger in New York
City's Harlem on July 12, 1908. His 90th birthday was to be
celebrated tonight with a star-filled charity dinner at the Beverly
Hills Hotel.
	   The other afternoon, Berle could be found at his usual haunt,
the dining room of the Friars Club, the showbiz fraternity of which
he is Abbot Emeritus. He was in the midst of tossing friendly
insults to a circle of cronies, who disappeared when a reporter
arrived.
	   Berle was wearing a tweed suit, purple shirt, yellow tie and
trench coat, even though the California sun was beaming outside. He
retains most of his graying hair, and his face has few wrinkles.
The eyes twinkle like a mischievous boy's when a joke is
forthcoming.
	   Like this one: ``I talked to Bob Hope not long ago. Of course,
he talks about property. I talk about Viagra.''
	   Berle spent five minutes berating the maitre d' (who laughed
delightedly) as he ordered a Spartan lunch: slice of iceberg
lettuce topped with Roquefort dressing (big lumps) and white bread,
buttered, no crust. Then he settled down to talk about his triple
celebration.
	   About his television debut:
	   ``I was doing the radio show for Texaco in 1947, and the Texas
Company said they wanted me to go on television. Did I have any
ideas? I said, 'The only idea I had was what I've been doing all
these years: vaudeville.' I'd do stand up, then I'd introduce
jugglers and singers and dancers. And I'd get into the act. I knew
the format would work, because I had been doing it since I was 16
years old.
	   ``We tried it. We had two previews. They had no studio, only
radio studios. We converted 6B into a television studio in Radio
City.
	   ``No one knew how much the show was going to cost. At that time
I was playing Vegas at all the casinos, including the Flamingo,
where the boss was Ben Siegel _ you'd better not call him Bugsy to
his face. I was one of the first to get dlrs 20,000-25,000 a week.
	   ``I took a tenfold cut to do the Texaco show. I got dlrs 2,500.
The entire cost in the first year for actors, costumes, scenery,
guest stars, cameras, lights: dlrs 19,000 a show!''
	   A little known fact: Although Berle starred in the first
``Texaco Star Theater,'' he was followed in the summer of 1948 by
Henny Youngman, Jack Carter, Morey Amsterdam and other comics. But
when the fall season opened, Milton was Texaco's man and became
America's Mr. Television.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   About his beginnings as a performer:
	   ``In 1913, they had contests for Charlie Chaplin look-alikes. I
wore my father's pants, with a rope around them so they wouldn't
fall, my father's derby, which I filled with papers so it would
fit. My mother burned a cork to make a mustache. I used a stick for
Chaplin's cane.
	   ``On Halloween day, I went walking on Kelly Street in the Bronx,
where we lived. I had a crowd following me, including a man named
Eldridge. He asked me where I lived, and he followed me to my house
and asked my mother for permission to enter me in a Chaplin
contest.
	   ``I won the contest and got a 90 cent gold cup. My mother, who
was my guardian, my angel, became a show business mother. She made
Gypsy Rose Lee's mother look like Mother Cabrini.''
	   With more than a little push from his mother, young Milton began
working in the New Jersey movie studios. His films included Pearl
White serials and one- and two-reel comedies. He also became the
model for Buster Brown shoes.
	   His biggest break came in Mack Sennett's ``Tillie's Punctured
Romance'' with Chaplin and Dressler.
	   ``I played a newsboy in a scene where Chaplin was flirting with
Mabel Normand on a park bench,'' Berle recalled. ``I kept pestering
him to buy a paper. Finally, he grabbed the papers, slapped me and
knocked me on my ... derriere.''
	   ``Chaplin was a perfectionist. He did the scene six or seven
more times, slapping me, slapping me. My mother tried to interfere,
but he told her, 'Just stand over there.'''
	   Later Berle would prosper with his own brand of slapstick.

	   ___ &QC; 
	   About being 90:
	   He couldn't resist a gag: ``I'm 90, but I feel like a
20-year-old. But there's never one around.''
	   But seriously, folks. His legendary energy appears undiminished,
and his memory remains sharp. Names and song lyrics came to him
immediately; he recited the entire verse of his favorite song,
``All the Things You Are.'' His seven-year marriage to his third
wife, Lorna, has made him a happy man, he says.
	   As for any longevity hints, Berle cited a lifelong avoidance of
dissipation. ``I don't know what beer tastes like. I tried it at 16
and didn't like it. I never smoked a cigarette in my life. No
liquor.
	   ``Exercise? Not enough. I did get enough in my working days,
acrobatics and all that. Now I have an Exercycle, a therapist to
give me rubdowns. I walk around the block a couple of times, which
is good.
	   ``I've been a vegetarian for 45 years; Lorna is a vegetarian,
too. Oh, once in a while I cheat.''
	   There seems to be one anomaly in his health regimen. He was
holding a two-thirds smoked cigar.
	   ``I've been smoking cigars since I was 12 years old,'' he
confessed. ``If you don't inhale, it's OK.
	   ``An example: How old was George Burns when he died? Did you
know he smoked 20 cigars a day? That's because he knew how to smoke
a cigar.''
	   With that, Berle lifted his cigar and it landed on his nose. He
stuck it in his mouth and he said, ``Pardon me, I thought I was
taller.''
	   Ever the comedian.
	   Happy birthday, Uncle Miltie.

Leading U.S. archival institutions explore music museum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JANELLE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Imagine a museum that combines centuries of
musical collections, ranging from Thomas Jefferson's favorite books
to Frank Sinatra's archives to the flashy yellow guitar used by the
Artist formerly known as Prince.
	   That's what's envisioned by two of the United States' leading
archival institutions, which are looking at the possibility of
developing a National Music Museum and Center.
	   The Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution and the
Federal City Council _ a coalition of city leaders led by former
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole _ signed an agreement
Wednesday to do a one-year feasibility study of the project, which
originated from Sinatra's wishes to make his archives available to
the public.
	   The Federal City Council will provide funding for the study and
will lead a fund-raising effort.
	   ``I hope the (museum) brings together under one roof three
American treasures _ the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of
Congress and Frank Sinatra,'' said Nancy Sinatra, the singer's
daughter.
	   Ms. Sinatra, who has been pursuing the idea of a museum for
about six years, said she and her father spoke often of the project
before his death in May at the age of 82.
	   She said her father was once asked whether there was one thing
he still wanted to do. ``My dad replied, 'I'd like to pass on what
I know,' '' Ms. Sinatra said. ``I think after listening to the
dreams of the Federal City Council, I know my dad's wish can come
true.''
	   Ms. Sinatra said her father's collection includes items that
spanned his entire career, including tapes of radio shows, videos
and his sailor's suit from the movie ``On the Town.''
	   The museum, which would be located in downtown Washington, would
be a plus for music lovers and for the nation's capital, said first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
	   It would ``make a music center that would draw people off the
Mall into the downtown of Washington,'' she said. ``This is part of
a larger effort ... to really transform our city.''
	   Officials also envision an ``interactive'' museum that could be
used for musical performances that would be transmitted worldwide.
	   ``This will not be just a dusty musty collection,'' said Austin
Kiplinger, chairman of the Federal City Council. ``This will be a
national museum but at the same time it will be an international
sort of world center.''
	   Officials said the museum could maintain the archives of Sinatra
and other artists, as well as take advantage of the vast holdings
of the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress which include
memorabilia and works from John Philip Sousa and Prince, as well as
some of Jefferson's books on music.

	   Entertainment highlights during the week of July 12-18:
	   50 years ago: Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson and Lauren
Bacall starred in John Huston's ``Key Largo.''
	   45 years ago: ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' starred Jane Russell
and Marilyn Monroe. The film was directed by Howard Hawks.
	   And Elvis Presley recorded ``My Happiness'' as a gift for his
mother. It was his first recording.
	   30 years ago: The animated Beatles' film ``Yellow Submarine''
premiered at the London Pavilion. The Beatles made a cameo
appearance at the film's end but did not supply their own voices
for the characters.
	   25 years ago: The Everly Brothers broke up after Phil smashed
his guitar and walked off the stage during a performance in
Hollywood, California. Don did the rest of the show as a solo act
and announced their breakup to the audience. They reunited 11 years
later.
	   15 years ago: Comedian Eddie Murphy signed a new contract with
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' that paid him a reported dlrs 30,000
per show.
	   And ``Zelig'' starred Woody Allen and Mia Farrow.
	   10 years ago: Pop star Michael Jackson launched his first
British tour at London's Wembley Stadium. He rode over the crowd in
a cradle suspended from a crane. During the performance, the
29-year-old star repeatedly disappeared in puffs of smoke and
behind silver curtains, only to reappear seconds later hundreds of
feet away.
	   And Bruce Willis starred in the action film, ``Die Hard.''
	   Five years ago: The artist formerly known as Prince and his
soon-to-be ex-band, the New Power Generation, treated about 400
fans to 1 1-2 hours of new material and old hits such as ``Let's Go
Crazy'' and ``Raspberry Beret'' at a benefit performance in
Chanhassen, Minnesota. Dressed in a red-and-yellow striped
pantsuit, the former Prince tossed off blistering solos from his
purple guitar.
	   NBC's ``Today'' show won the network morning shows' ratings
crown for the first time in 35 weeks, beating ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' by three-tenths of a ratings point.
	   And ``Free Willy,'' starring Jason James Richter in a movie
about a boy and a killer whale, became a surprise hit.
	   One year ago: John Fogerty could still draw a crowd, despite an
11-year gap since the release of his last album. Fans lined the
street in Mount Pleasant, Tenn., to glimpse Fogerty as he filmed a
music video at a train depot. The video for ``Southern Streamline''
was off ``Blue Moon Swamp,'' his first solo album since ``Eye of
the Zombie.''
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``I love you.'' _ Pop star Michael Jackson, blowing kisses to
his adoring fans at London's Wembley Stadium.
	    &UR; Spoken five years ago:
	   ``Of course, I'm annoying to older people. But what's better, to
please little kids or older people? Little kids are the ones who
are our future. If I can make them laugh because I'm a goofy, funny
character, that's cool. Look at Mickey Mouse.'' _ Comedian Pauly
Shore.
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``I ain't got a mad bone in my body for Puffy. It was just a
conflict of interest as far as the direction we wanted to go. He
wanted to be down with the stuff that he was involved with, and I
didn't want to be with it.'' _ Rapper Craig Mack, explaining his
split from producer Sean ``Puffy'' Combs.
	   ``We may yet prove to be a lot of things, but I can promise you
this: We're not going to be bottom feeders.'' _ Bryant Gumbel,
explaining why his new CBS show, ``Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel,''
wouldn't compete for jurors from sensational trials or focus on
celebrities' sex lives.

At the Movies: 'Lethal Weapon 4'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ At the beginning of ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' Mel
Gibson and Danny Glover encounter a maniac in a bulletproof space
suit who is destroying a city block with a flamethrower and a
steel-piercing weapon.
	   Gibson devises a crazy scheme to distract the marauder, who is
dispatched to a fiery death. In the melee, a huge gasoline truck is
blown 50 feet (15 meters) into the air.
	   Gibson and Glover go fishing with Joe Pesci on Glover's boat,
which is rammed by a large freighter carrying smuggled Chinese
immigrants. A firefight breaks out, causing an explosion on the
ship's bow. Glover's boat sinks, and the swimmers are threatened by
a shark. The ship runs aground.
	   All this in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
	   Bigger, bigger, bigger. That's the formula for producer Joel
Silver and producer-director Richard Donner in the fourth adventure
of the two disparate L.A. cops, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh.
	   Gibson, the wild man willing to try any scheme, and Glover, the
cautious older partner, make the ideal team, despite their
sometimes tedious bickering. They interact smoothly, their male
bond having been established three movies ago.
	   Curiously, the formula works. Most sequels bring diminishing
returns, like ``Batman'' and the final ``Godfather.'' With ``Lethal
Weapon 4,'' you recognize the artifice, but can't help being swept
up by it. The stunts are staggering, the jokes funny, the human
stories plausible.
	   And this time the Chinese are the villains.
	   Chinese generals, in cahoots with the underworld, have been
smuggling their citizens into the United States at dlrs 35,000 a
head, packed into steerage holds. The enforcer is the deadly young
Wa Sing Ku (Chinese martial arts star Jet Li in a chilling
portrait). You can bet on a climactic battle between him and
Gibson.
	   A ``Lethal Weapon'' can't be all explosions and mayhem.
Screenwriter Channing Gibson (no relation) _ with story by Jonathan
Lemkin, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar _ has fashioned a busy
substory to interrupt the violence.
	   Gibson and Rene Russo are expecting a baby, but he balks at
marriage. Glover is upset because his daughter is pregnant, and he
doesn't know the father. Another detective, Chris Rock, is secretly
married to the daughter, but neither Glover nor Gibson like him.
Glover takes in an immigrant family, who are wanted by the Chinese
hoodlums.
	   Donner has a talent for conveying energy through his actors.
Even in the fourth round, Gibson and Glover manage to keep their
characters fresh. Despite her screen pregnancy, Russo takes part in
some of the action.
	   Pesci adds needed lightness as the would-be private eye. Rock is
a worthy addition to the stock company as the motor-mouth cop.
	   Note: The beach trailer where Gibson and Russo live evokes a
wave of nostalgia. It's the same stretch of Malibu shore where
James Garner operated in the popular TV series ``The Rockford
Files.''
	   The Warner Bros. release is rated R for much violence. Running
time: 2 hours.

	   ``Have a Nice Decade _ The '70s Pop Culture Box'' (Rhino) _
Various Artists
	   Smiley faces are back, along with kitschy carpet, Richard Nixon
and C.W. McCall. Rhino Records has packaged the 1970s in a dlrs
100, seven-CD set featuring 160 songs from the Me Decade, including
more than 50 former No. 1 hits.
	   The earth-tone carpet cover, wrapped in plastic, is a tip that
Rhino wanted this ambitious set to be fun. And look at what's
inside: a soundtrack of the '70s, which means music both good and
bad.
	   The set opens with Edison Lighthouse (``Love Grows Where My
Rosemary Goes'') and closes with McFadden and Whitehead (``Ain't No
Stopping Us Now''), meaning long-forgotten tunes from beginning to
end.
	   A few of the artists are still active, among them James Taylor,
Rod Stewart, Carly Simon and Stevie Wonder. But Rhino was unable to
obtain licensing permission for songs by many '70s heavyweights,
and those absent include the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Pink
Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, the Eagles and
Fleetwood Mac.
	   Performances range from awesome to awful as Rhino remembers the
Hues Corporation (``Rock the Boat''), Alicia Bridges (``I Love the
Nightlife''), Andrea True Connection (``More, More, More'') and
Gilbert O'Sullivan (``Alone Again Naturally'').
	   The liner notes include a song-by-song essay and a time line
with dates of major events in the decade. Completing the aural
flashback are occasional snippets from '70s newscasts. Rhino has
fun with the juxtaposition of songs and sound bites _ President
Richard Nixon, for example, segues into ``You're No Good'' by Linda
Ronstadt.
	   One major bummer: Rhino omitted punk and New Wave, the most
exciting music to emerge during the decade. There's no jazz and not
much country, either.
	   So wallow in nostalgia. Dig that digital version of ``Dueling
Banjos.'' Be proud to discover you remember all the words to
``Smokin' in the Boy's Room.''
	   Sorry, pet rock not included.
	   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Payton's Place'' (Verve) _ Nicholas Payton
	   Nicholas Payton's new CD strengthens his standing as one of the
most important young voices in jazz. ``Payton's Place'' is the
third solo album from the 24-year-old trumpeter, and each of the 12
tracks is special.
	   Guest artists include Wynton Marsalis, Roy Hargrove and Joshua
Redman, and the musicians seem to inspire the best in each other.
Tim Warfield (saxophone) and Anthony Wonsey (piano) also provide
fine support. The arrangements are inventive, the solos exciting
and the ensemble playing first-rate.
	   Highlights include ``Zigaboogaloo,'' which kicks off the record
with a solid New Orleans groove; ``Three Trumpeteers,'' with
Payton, Marsalis and Hargrove swapping solos, and ``People Make the
World Go Round,'' an affectionate cover of the 1970s song by the
Stylistics.
	   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Blues Come Home to Roost'' (Rooster Blues) _ Super Chikan
	   So someone tells you about a trucker who writes blues songs on
the road, records them into a cassette player, and then gets
discovered in his late 40s at a third-rate recording facility in
some Mississippi Delta town like, say, Clarksdale.
	   You say you have heard the tale before, the story of countless
Depression-era minstrels found to have rare ability. What makes the
Mississippi Delta a global treasure is not just the fact these
stories used to happen, but because they still are happening.
	   It happened on this disc, a deserved hit on blues radio. At
first listen, James ``Super Chikan'' Johnson sounds too simple, his
guitar too quiet. It takes some time for the sweetness, skill and
melodic beauty of the songs to infect. Chikan's sense of humor
speeds the process.
	   _ By Ralph Siegel, Associated Press Writer.

Europeans embracing the spirit of American gospel singing

	   LONDON (AP) _ By the end of the concert, Anna Ludvigsen had
worked up a good sweat, clapping to the rhythms and swaying
arm-in-arm with her neighbors to the beat.
	   It wasn't a rock concert this London student was attending.
	   She was among 1,000 people dancing in the aisles to the gospel
tunes of Queen Esther Marrow and the Harlem Gospel Singers.
	   ``It was very participatory,'' Ludvigsen, 24, said. ``It's very
entertaining as well as got a message across.''
	   Her words are music to the ears of Queen Esther, one of the many
singers finding the international scene a fertile ground for music
rooted in the Southern black communities of the United States. And
just as jazz and blues did generations ago, gospel is reaching
beyond its American roots of churches in big cities and the South.
	   Not that gospel is suffering at home. The entire gospel genre,
which includes Christian rock acts like Jars of Clay and Bob
Carlisle, is the sixth-biggest musical category, behind pop and
ahead of classical. The Recording Industry Association of America
said gospel accounted for 4.5 percent of all music sales in 1997.
	   Gospel music has become so mainstream that Queen Esther was
picked as the headline performer July 7 at the Montreal Jazz
Festival, where past acts like Pat Metheny have played before
150,000 people.
	   Queen Esther sings a traditional form of gospel music associated
with her idol, Mahalia Jackson. Newer stars opt for a more
contemporary take. One of its most successful stars, Kirk Franklin,
borrows from rhythm 'n' blues and hip hop to give his music a
younger edge. His protege, God's Property, went platinum with a
self-titled album that debuted No. 3 in Billboard a year ago.
	   Whatever the form, gospel groups are playing before sold-out
audiences in concerts from Barcelona to Berlin. Even Pope John Paul
II has tapped his toes to the soulful voice of Queen Esther, who
opened and closed a papal show last October before 300,000 people.
	   ``In America, gospel music among the African-Americans is part
of their life. It's like eating and sleeping,'' said Queen Esther,
which is her birth name. ``In Europe, it's a delicacy for those
that don't hear it all the time. They like the culture. They like
the music. So they appreciate it more.''
	   She has firsthand knowledge of just how much that appreciation
has grown.
	   She started annual European tours in 1992, sometimes playing
before only a few hundred people on small stages with a sheet as a
backdrop and 10 lights. The smallest venue on her latest
winter-spring tour was London's Hackney Empire, where actor Ralph
Fiennes had played Hamlet. Queen Esther offered a cross between a
rock concert and a Broadway play, complete with rich lighting, a
colorful backdrop and a choreographed choir.
	   ``This is a technical show. It's a level above gospel shows,''
she said. ``The feedback from older people, they probably would be
saying, `Well you're a sellout to the devil.'''
	   But it's not a churchgoing crowd going to this gospel.
	   ``I don't follow it religiously,'' said Zen Saipaia, a
32-year-old Polynesian man who lives in south London. ``But I think
it's very entertaining and very soulful.''
	   Bob Garland, a 45-year-old British percussionist, wanted to
sample what he called a therapeutic music style that had even
inspired a gospel singing group in his town of Hemel Hempstead.
	   ``It's another type of world music and, in a way, a bit closer
to home than a lot of those styles out there.''
	   Crowds certainly find a lot of familiar songs, from traditional
melodies like ``You Are My Inspiration'' to foot-stamping pieces
like ``Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat'' and ``Walkin' on
Sunshine.''
	   Queen Esther's roots are deep in traditional gospel. She was
discovered by Duke Ellington at the age of 22, and toured with
musical greats from B.B. King to Bob Dylan.
	   An involvement in the civil rights movement introduced Queen
Esther to Mahalia Jackson. The two later shared the stage and Queen
Esther even wrote and starred in a short-lived Broadway musical
about Jackson.
	   After the Montreal performance and another world tour starting
in September that will take her to Japan, Queen Esther may bring
her act back to Broadway.
	   ``I don't want to go back to the states until it is really
tiptop shape,'' she said. ``I don't find your mainstream Americans
going to gospel music. It's mostly African-Americans. I think if
what we're doing was presented to them, they would like it.''

	   In the spotlight: Ruben Blades, salsa king
	    &UR; Born: July 16, 1948, in Panama City, Panama
	    &UR; Personal stats: On his 12th birthday, Ruben Blades' mother, a
popular singer, gave him a plastic Elvis Presley guitar with a
hound dog decal. Years later, after putting himself through law
school and working as a banker, Blades, who has a master's degree
in international law from Harvard University, arrived in New York,
hoping to snare musical fame.
	   The pivotal moment in his career occurred in 1978, when his
second LP, ``Siembra,'' broke all sales records for salsa. Its
first single, ``Pedro Navaja,'' a sinister song about a Harlem hood
and a murder he commits, also hit the top of the charts.
	   Blades, the winner of two Grammy awards, has turned the salsa
world upside down with 16 albums, earning him the nickname, ``king
of salsa.'' But Blades is no puffball. His songs often deal with
underdeveloped countries, poor workers and the destruction of the
rain forest.
	    &UR; Another stage: In November 1993, Blades accepted the nomination
of the Papa Egoro party for the presidency of Panama. He finished
third, with about 20 percent of the vote. Blades has also
contributed his time and voice to anti-apartheid projects and
promoting AIDS awareness.
	   ``My politics start with rock 'n' roll,'' Blades says. ``It was
young people's music, it made you feel like doing the things that
kids want to do. It made you different from older people.''
	    &UR; Film credits: ``The Devil's Own'' with Harrison Ford (1997),
``Color of Night'' with Bruce Willis (1994), ``Predator 2'' (1990),
``Mo' Better Blues'' (1990) and ``The Milagro Beanfield War''
(1988).
	   Recently Blades starred in Paul Simon's Broadway play, ``The
Capeman,'' and is currently filming ``The Cradle Will Rock,''
directed by Tim Robbins.
	    &UR; Comments The Village Voice: ``Here is a truly mad creative
force, spurting with imagination.''

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Voters weary of political chaos and
corruption that have shaken Ecuador's fragile democracy decide
between the Harvard-trained mayor of Quito and a populist banana
tycoon in Sunday's presidential runoff.
	   A poll released Saturday showed centrist Mayor Jamil Mahuad with
an ample lead over political newcomer Alvaro Noboa. But the gap has
narrowed sharply as Noboa's regionalist message hits home.
	   Mahuad had 47 percent support compared with Noboa's 38.5
percent, according to a poll by the private company Market, which
surveyed 1,600 Ecuadoreans on June 4 and 5. The poll had a margin
for error of plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Shortly after the first round of voting on May 31, polls showed
Mahuad with a 28 point lead over Noboa, who is from the tropical
port of Guayaquil, Ecuador's economic powerhouse.
	   To gain ground, Noboa has played on Guayaquil's resentment of
the political dominance of the capital Quito, in its cool,
mountainous interior, analysts say.
	   ``Mahuad possibly hasn't gotten the best reaction to his
campaign, while Noboa has very intelligently concentrated on his
electoral bastions on the coast,'' said the director of Market,
Blasco Penaherrera.
	   Organizers fear a low turnout as soccer-mad residents of this
Andean nation of 12 million on South America's northwest shoulder
watch the World Cup final Sunday.
	   The winner of Sunday's runoff will replace interim President
Fabian Alarcon whom Congress appointed in February 1997 after it
removed eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram for ``mental
incapacity'' amid massive protests and corruption charges.
	   Besides closing what Ecuadoreans consider an embarrassing
chapter in their history, the winner also takes over an economy
battered by El Nino-driven floods, widespread poverty and
plummeting prices for its main export, oil.
	   His first task will be to rebuild roads, bridges and houses
along the Pacific coast, largely destroyed by El Nino's torrential
rains earlier this year.
	   ``We hope the new government will take firm action to unite
Ecuadoreans and bring economic growth and greater social
equality,'' Monsignor Antonio Arregui, spokesman for the powerful
Ecuadorean Bishops Conference, told a news conference Saturday.
	   Mahuad, 48, who has a master's degree in public administration
from Harvard University, earned a reputation as an effective,
honest administrator during his six-year stint as Quito's mayor. He
has the support of Ecuador's main political parties and much of its
business community, who see him as most likely to consolidate its
shaky democracy after recent political fiascoes.
	   Noboa, the nation's richest man, has run a populist campaign
promising to create one million jobs, build homes for the poor and
dish out the ``beating of the century'' to the Quito-based
political elite.
	   But fears that he is Bucaram's puppet have plagued his campaign.
He has fought hard to distance himself.
	   Bucaram fled to Panama, from where he has loudly voiced his
support for Noboa, his friend and political ally, and vowed to be
president once again.
	   Congress passed a law blocking Bucaram's electoral return,
fearing that the fiery-tongued demagogue known for his wild
campaign rallies featuring scantily clad dancing girls could once
again mesmerize voters.
	   Sunday's election will be the sixth time Ecuadoreans have voted
in the past two years and they are tired of the political carousel,
analysts say.
	   ``There is a lot of apathy, weariness and disillusionment among
the population because there have been so many elections and
nothing has changed,'' said political analyst Julio Cesar Trujillo.

Abiola buried in Nigeria; Autopsy findings point to heart attack

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Preliminary findings of an independent
autopsy have indicated that Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner died naturally of a heart attack.
	   The findings were released Saturday just after Moshood Abiola
was buried in a garden ceremony at his Lagos home.
	   ``In our opinion the mechanism of death is due to a rapid
deterioration in a diseased heart,'' Canadian Dr. James Young told
reporters. ``At this time, our preliminary opinion is that death
was due to natural causes as a result of his long-standing heart
disease.''
	   Young, the chief coroner in the Canadian province of Ontario,
was one of several forensic scientists flown to Nigeria to conduct
the autopsy.
	   The team's findings could help ease tensions in Nigeria,
although Dr. Ore Falomo, Abiola's personal physician, said that a
full autopsy report would be issued only after additional forensic
tests on body tissue samples that were to be flown to Britain and
Canada.
	   Abiola died Tuesday in custody while meeting with a group of
visiting U.S. officials. He had languished in prison for four
years, although his release had been expected soon.
	   Shortly after his death, Abiola's family said they suspected
foul play. The timing of his death _ a month after dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha's demise _ raised a number of eyebrows and spawned
conspiracy theories. Rioting and violence erupted in Lagos and
elsewhere in southern Nigeria, where at least 55 people have been
killed and more than 400 arrested.
	   The Nigerian government already had concluded its autopsy on
Abiola; several of its doctors attended Saturday's procedure,
Falomo said.
	   The independent autopsy had been delayed until the weekend at
Falomo's request. He did not explain the delay, although he may
have wanted to wait until several foreign experts arrived.
	   Abiola's family offered no immediate reaction to the results of
the autopsy, but one of his daughters, Wura, appealed for calm.
	   ``We are in pain,'' she told a crowd of supporters gathered at
their house. ``You are in pain, everybody is in pain, but I am
pleading that _ as a peace-loving person _ our father would not
like to see violence at this occasion.''
	   Outrage at Abiola's death has begun to fracture the country
along ethnic lines. Abiola, an immensely popular southern
businessman from the Yoruba clan, posed a serious threat to the
ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper
echelons of power are controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The bodies of nine Hausas were discovered earlier in the week in
a predominantly Yoruba neighborhood. Fearing more of the same, riot
police continued to watch over the city's mosques Saturday. The
streets were, however, relatively calm.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
	   Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from
their Hausa and Fulani compatriots, long have resented what they
consider the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other
minerals _ by northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since Abacha's death on June 8, the new military junta has been
scrambling to gain public trust. Nigeria's new military leader,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has released a group of political
prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also has vowed _ albeit
vaguely _ to return the country to civilian rule.

New clashes in Kosovo despite diplomatic efforts to end fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Albanian forces clashed
outside Kosovo's second-largest city and elsewhere in the province,
disregarding international calls for a cease-fire and talks to
resolve the crisis peacefully.
	   In Moscow on Saturday, the foreign ministers of Russia and
Germany discussed ``new, creative possibilities'' for resolving the
crisis in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
is fighting for independence from Serbia _ part of Yugoslavia.
	   Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Yevgeny Primakov of Russia refused
to elaborate on the new approaches except to say that they did not
include NATO military intervention, which Moscow strongly opposes.
	   But the diplomatic efforts showed little sign of making inroads.
Serb forces launched a strong attack Saturday on the village of
Lodja, on the outskirts of Kosovo's second-largest city Pec. The
attack ended at midday, independent sources reported. The
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serbs failed to dislodge
rebels from their positions.
	   However, the Serb Media Center, quoting government sources, said
police regained control of the road linking Pec with Gorazdevac,
about five kilometers (three miles) to the southeast, during an
``action'' to locate two missing policemen.
	   Police came under fire as soon as they approached Lodja and,
``after two hours of battle, armed Albanians ran away,'' but the
two policemen killed three days ago were not found, the Serb Media
Center said. No police were wounded but there were dead and wounded
among the Albanians, it said.
	   Albanian sources said a 78-year-old Albanian man was killed and
three others were wounded in Lodja. But the Albanians claimed
police failed to capture the village despite ``one of the biggest
attacks'' by Serb forces.
	   Also Saturday, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in the
Decani area, east of Pec, and near the border town of Djakovica.
	   The Serb statement made no claim to have captured Lodja, a KLA
stronghold and a reputed center for weapons smuggling from Albania.
There was no independent confirmation of casualty claims.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to stop the
fighting for fear it will spread to other Balkan countries with
large Albanian communities.
	   Underscoring those fears, the Macedonian defense ministry said
Saturday that guards fired on arms smugglers trying to cross into
the country from Albania.
	   There were no casualties in the Friday exchange and the
smugglers fled back to Albania. Macedonia, a former Yugoslav
republic, also has a large Albanian community but has tried to stay
out of the conflict.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   On Wednesday, the Contact Group _ the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ renewed demands for an
immediate cease-fire followed by peace talks.
	   France and Britain also have said they would introduce a
resolution in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures
against the warring sides if they do not halt the fighting.
	   Those calls have gone unheeded because of divisions within the
Albanian community and the refusal of the KLA to accept the Contact
Group's favorite, Ibrahim Rugova, as their leader in future talks.
Rugova has disavowed violence.
	   On Saturday, an Albanian-language newspaper quoted a self-styled
KLA spokesman as saying the rebels would keep fighting if they are
excluded from peace talks with the government. Russia and
Yugoslavia have ruled out including the KLA.
	   ``We are against any secret talks,'' Jakup Krasniqi told the
daily newspaper Koha Ditore. Krasniqi rejected Rugova as a leader
who ``has not fulfilled conditions to be president of Kosovo.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Decanting a bottle of red wine, Andrea Immer
swills, sniffs and sips from a glass. Then, she hocks it up into a
plastic cup.
	   ``Not awesome, but good,'' she says, saving ``awesome'' for a
superior bottle. She's been known to describe a bad wine as
``yucky'' or ``bogus.''
	   As the United States' champion sommelier, or wine expert, the
31-year-old Mrs. Immer sniffs out the world's best for some of New
York's landmark restaurants, such as Windows On The World and the
Rainbow Room.
	   She is part of a new group of industry experts pushing to make
wine popular among a generation more apt to pop a beer top than a
wine cork.
	   ``You should see how fast the eyes glaze over when you describe
wine as earthy, full bodied. Why would anybody want to drink
something described like that?'' she asked during a recent
interview.
	   One of 37 master sommeliers in the United States _ more than a
third of them under age 35 _ Mrs. Immer combines conservative
attire with a fringe Generation X upbringing. Last year, she was
named the U.S. champion by the Sommelier Society of America.
	   ``Typically when people think of a sommelier, they think of
someone who's a bit arrogant, maybe a little ... snobby,'' says
Sara Moore, spokeswoman for the International Court of Master
Sommeliers in Napa, California. ``Andrea has all the ... pedigrees
behind her to act that way, but she doesn't.''
	   The Wine Market Council, a trade group, says wine consumption is
down among people in their 20s and 30s _ a trend that groups such
as Wine Brats of Santa Rosa, California, are dedicated to
reversing.
	   Wine Brats, which has 11,000 members, targets the beer crowd,
and director Joel Quigley says wine is slowly making inroads there
_ in part because of people like Mrs. Immer.
	   She fits none of the stereotypes. She reads wine encyclopedias
while working out on a Stairmaster. She admits to buying and
drinking cheap wine.
	   ``Hardly anybody in the wine business is going to say a dlrs 7
bottle of wine is cool,'' she says. ``But in all the European
countries, wine is a peasant drink. It's part of everyday life.
Something you can drink with mac-and-cheese.''
	   Her husband, Bob, quit his job as a management consultant with
the New York Port Authority earlier this year to stay home with
their 4-year-old son in part so she could continue her wine
endeavors.
	   ``I wasn't a real big wine drinker when I met her. I liked
beer,'' he says. Now, they are working together on a book, a wine
guide.
	   Mrs. Immer started out as an investment banker six years ago,
having majored in finance in college. Then she took a wine
appreciation class.
	   ``When everybody was having keg parties. I was having dinners,
serving ... chicken and wine to my friends,'' she says.
	   After working on Wall Street for two years, she decided to
follow her nose. She worked as a wine server in restaurants, took
classes at cooking schools and worked in public relations for a
wine import company before landing an apprenticeship at the Windows
wine school in 1992.
	   Today, she defines her master status, which takes years of study
to attain, as a ``Ph.D. in wine.''
	   It's a degree that allows her to shop at rare wine auctions on a
dlrs 40,000 budget.
	   ``I get to taste great wine and get paid,'' she jokes.
	   Her nose for wine took her to the triennial Sommelier World
Championship in Vienna earlier this month. One of 30 competitors
from around the world in the blind taste-test, she had to identify
region, vintage, grower and grape. She finished among the top five
competitors.
	   Mrs. Immer's inclusive approach to wine reflects a change in the
industry, a willingness to expand the business beyond just the
well-to-do, says Samantha Shields, a consultant for the sommelier
society in St. Louis.
	   ``They are not as stuffy as they used to be,'' she says. ``There
have been changes ... (such as) Andrea's job at Windows. I don't
think that would have happened years ago.''

`Mulan' animated computer storybook mixes mythology with mirth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: StoryBook is CQ. &QL; 
 &UR; By RIC LEYVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Mulan'' isn't only in theaters _ and on
T-shirts, pajamas, Halloween costumes, beach towels, bedding, bean
bag collectibles, action toys, watches, commemorative coins,
souvenir snow globes, karate outfits, kiddie underwear and
toothpaste.
	   ``Mulan'' is high-tech, too.
	   The brave young Chinese woman who poses as a man to become a
soldier and saves her country from Hun invaders on the big screen
keeps the story going on the computer screen in ``Disney's Mulan
Animated StoryBook,'' an interactive cyberadventure for children 5
to 9.
	   Nonviolent entertainment with educational overtones, the package
includes a point-and-click ``Mulan'' storyteller with built-in
games, puzzles, vocabulary building lessons and a sing-along.
	   All the original stars who did the cartoon voices in the movie
musical hung around for the computerized version: Eddie Murphy as
the bumbling, smart-mouthed dragon Mushu, Ming-Na Wen of ``The Joy
Luck Club'' as Fa Mulan and ``Karate Kid'' star Pat Morita as the
Emperor.
	   George Takei _ Lt. Sulu of ``Star Trek'' fame _ is back as First
Ancestor; gravel-voiced Harvey Fierstein plays Yao; ``Aladdin''
veteran Lea Salonga sings Mulan and Donny Osmond does the singing
for General Chang.
	   ``Disney's Mulan Animated Storybook'' (Windows-Macintosh hybrid
CD-ROM, dlrs 39.95) is a bug-proof choice for parents with children
who want to see the movie again and again.
	   The read-along storybook is a tale about lost scrolls. Kids
gather the scrolls as they proceed from klutzy Mulan's failure as a
prospective bride to her triumph standing in for her father as an
Imperial warrior, disguising her gender under a short haircut and
men's battle armor.
	   A narrator reads passages aloud from each newfound scroll for
younger children. Older kids can read for themselves, clicking on
highlighted words to learn their definitions and on special synonym
action boxes surrounding other selected words to build vocabulary
power.
	   The story starts out in Mulan's village, where she bathes and
chooses a dress to wear for a meeting with the local matchmaker.
Alas, she is late and spills hot tea on the woman, who brands her
as unfit for the responsibilities of marriage.
	   Mulan then learns her sick father has been drafted into the
army, and decides to hide her true identity and go in his place.
Kids must solve a puzzle to open a closet containing the battle
armor Mulan needs and repack her gear before her dog replaces
essentials with pooch favorites like a soup bone, a doggie dish and
heavily chewed slippers.
	   Before leaving home, Mulan must wake sleeping ancestor spirits
using a series of gongs in a logic puzzle that also teaches about
Chinese culture and religious customs.
	   At the army camp, she has to prove her strength and intelligence
before being accepted by the other soldiers. Then comes the problem
of trading with fellow warriors to reclaim missing items from her
footlocker.
	   In the Mahjong house, players learn elements of the ancient game
in a tile-matching challenge. Like other puzzles and games, it can
be played at four different difficulty levels.
	   En route to confront the enemy, the gang takes a break on a
mountain pass for a snowball fight game young children are bound to
love. Then comes a logic puzzle with Mushu the pint-size dragon
mountaineering down a snowy slope and triggering strategic
avalanches.
	   At the Imperial City, players help Mulan defeat the Huns by
bombarding the invading hordes with watermelons. After victory is
achieved, there is a citywide celebration with traditional lantern
lightings, drum playing and fireworks.
	   ``Mulan'' lets kids print out many things they come across in
the game to create their own Chinese culture cards, paper-doll
outfits and custom scrolls written and decorated according to the
whims of each junior storyteller.
	   There's also a sing-along section featuring three songs from the
movie. Kiddie crooners can belt out tunes with the film's singers,
or sing by themselves with background music and subtitled lyrics in
karaoke mode.
	   ``Disney's Mulan Animated StoryBook'' is a winner, boasting
quality programming in a tightly woven mix of storytelling,
learning and fun that introduces children to ancient Chinese
folklore without straining short attention spans.
	   It can't help but keep Mulan-hungry youngsters satisfied _ at
least until the movie comes out on video.

Matching the right actor with the right role

 &UR; AP Drama Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the black loose-leaf binders that fill the
bookcase behind his desk, Daniel Swee keeps track of the actors he
has placed on stage.
	   Writing in scribble worthy of a harried physician, Swee records
his comments about the hundreds of performers who have appeared
over the years in such acclaimed Lincoln Center Theater productions
as ``The Heiress,'' ``Carousel'' and ``Ah, Wilderness!''
	   Matching the right actor with the right role is not an easy
task, but as the theater's resident casting director, Swee helps
directors, playwrights and the center's producing duo of Andre
Bishop and Bernard Gersten make those difficult choices.
	   It was Swee who had a hand in picking what seems like a dream
cast for the theater's current production of ``Twelfth Night,''
playing through August at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.
	   The 22 actors in this revival of Shakespeare's most blissful
comedy range from Academy Award winner and TV star Helen Hunt to
stage veterans Philip Bosco, Brian Murray and Max Wright to
up-and-coming actors like Paul Rudd and Kyra Sedgwick.
	   ``There are no rules to casting and they change with every
show,'' Swee says. ``It's based on what the show is, where the show
is playing and, most importantly, who the director is and how he or
she sees the show.''
	   The first thing Swee did when he learned ``Twelfth Night'' was
set for production was reread the play. Then he sat down with
director Nicholas Hytner.
	   ``Casting directors advise, cajole and negotiate,'' he says.
``They help make the decision but the final say is about what the
director is looking for.''
	   ``Twelfth Night'' is the fourth project Swee has cast for
Hytner, so he is familiar with the way the British director works.
Their collaborations have included ``Carousel'' and the recent film
``The Object of My Affection.''
	   ``The best way to begin is to start tossing out casting ideas to
the director and having them respond _ whether it is 'yes' or 'no'
to a certain actor and why.
	   ``Sometimes it is practical to start with a wish list of actors
because you may get your wish list. Other times it serves as a
jumping-off point in a search for other actors.''
	   Was Helen Hunt, winner of an Academy Award for ``As Good as It
Gets'' on that list? ``Not a lot of other actresses were under
consideration,'' the casting director says vaguely.
	   Swee is a model of diplomatic discretion when asked about a
specific actor's audition or who auditioned for what role. For him,
the audition process takes on the characteristics of patient-doctor
or client-lawyer privilege.
	   For ``Twelfth Night,'' things came together quickly. Swee
started working on the play in February. Rehearsals began the first
week in May.
	   Hunt always wanted to play the role of Viola, Swee says, and her
agent contacted Lincoln Center when he learned they were planning a
production.
	   Swee sees a lot of shows; so does his assistant, Cindy Tolan.
They usually meet the following morning to discuss what they saw.
	   ``I have a good memory,'' he says. ``If someone is really good,
you remember them. The harder ones are people who seem talented but
are in a terrible production.''
	   Swee keeps lists of actors and programs of plays he and Tolan
have seen. They go each year to the presentations many graduating
classes at acting schools do. Plus he constantly consults dog-eared
copies of Theater World, an invaluable annual reference book of New
York, touring and regional productions.
	   For ``Twelfth Night,'' Swee's memory came in handy for several
of the lesser roles.
	   For example, he first noticed Rick Stear, who plays Sebastian,
four years ago at the North Carolina School of the Arts in
Winston-Salem where Swee gives workshops for the graduating classes
on how to audition.
	   Stear was brought in to read for three or four roles at Lincoln
Center h her again in a recent sitcom.
	   Swee describes himself as the go-between on a production _
dealing with directors and writers and producers. Under ideal
circumstances, they get along with each other and always
communicate well.
	   Casting director is a very nebulous job. Everybody has an
opinion about actors _ and the easiest criticism to make about
performers is to say they are miscast.
	   Swee has to have a good rapport with talent agents, and he is on
the phone with them all the time. Some are trying to get their
clients work; others are fending off offers.
	   ``For example, Kevin Kline's agent is not calling around to
theaters trying to get his client jobs,'' he says. ``That's very
different from a 24-year-old actor who graduated from NYU a year
ago and is looking to be noticed.''
	   Swee has to say ``no'' a lot. ``But when I get to say 'yes,'
it's really gratifying. And even if you are saying 'no,' you also
are seeing people for whom an audition means a lot,'' he adds.

	   UNIVERSAL CITY, California (AP) _ Depending on how you look at
it, ``Small Soldiers'' is either a movie that comes with a ton of
merchandise or a ton of merchandise that happens to come with a
movie.
	   Sound familiar?
	   Hollywood went through this drill a few weeks ago with
``Godzilla.'' The critics were merciless, blasting the film as
little more than an afterthought to an aggressive ``size does
matter'' promotional campaign that overran the stores with lizard
toys.
	   In this post-''Godzilla'' environment, DreamWorks launched its
first major movie and merchandise effort with Friday's nationwide
opening of ``Small Soldiers,'' a live-action/computer animation
film about toy action figures that come to life and do battle.
	   ``This is our coming-out party,'' said DreamWorks' consumer
products chief Brad Globe. Not to miss any opportunity for
cross-promotion, Globe was sitting at a table decorated with
``Small Soldiers'' birthday party supplies, right down to the
cupcake holders, in a company office crammed to the ceiling with
other movie merchandise.
	   Along with the action figures and birthday paraphernalia,
DreamWorks is rolling out ``Small Soldiers'' candy, T-shirts,
backpacks, Viewmasters, beach towels, sleeping bags, little
electric cars that kids can ride in, snowboards, video games, even
``Small Soldiers'' drapes.
	   It's a dizzying display that speaks to the importance this
studio, which has yet to produce a major hit in its four-year
history, is placing on the dlrs 60 million-plus ``Small Soldiers.''
Critics will be keeping a sharp eye on whether ``Small Soldiers,''
the movie, matches the merchandising.
	   It also underscores the potential windfall DreamWorks can enjoy
if the toys take off. A successful movie merchandising campaign can
bring a studio dlrs 50 million, and millions more when the video
comes out. If the toys become a franchise, like ``Star Wars'' or
TV's ``Power Rangers,'' there's no limit to the money that can be
made.
	   Yet DreamWorks' efforts come at a delicate time in the
merchandising business. ``Godzilla'' showed that the critical
reaction to a movie is linked as much to the merchandising as the
film itself. Disney saw back-to-back disappointments with ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and ``Hercules,'' and went slow on
promoting ``Mulan,'' with a less aggressive television campaign, to
keep expectations in check.
	   Indeed, caution is the buzzword. Globe says that despite the
large army of ``Small Soldiers'' merchandise, the game plan for
DreamWorks has been marked by moderation, particularly in dealing
with retailers.
	   ``Our job is to get good product out there and part of it is
managing the expectations and not letting the product lead the
way,'' says Globe. ``If you oversell something and it doesn't work
out, you could be in trouble.''
	   That's why, he says, DreamWorks has earmarked this one movie for
major merchandising. The studio's first animated feature, ``Prince
of Egypt,'' won't have such a push when it's released at Christmas.
DreamWorks executives felt it would be inappropriate to spin off
merchandise from the story of Moses.
	   Retailers, meantime, are bullish on ``Small Soldiers.''
	   ``DreamWorks has positioned it in a way that it's not really
going to have that much competition,'' said Michael Tabakin,
director of licensing and entertainment marketing for New
Jersey-based retail giant Toys R Us.
	   The film's computer-animated Gorgonites and Commandos are facing
only French schoolgirls from ``Madeline,'' with a limited line of
dolls and their accessories.
	   Even the ``Godzilla'' experience isn't scaring retailers.
Tabakin says that the little-discussed reality is that while the
``Godzilla'' backlash made for good reading and water-cooler gossip
in Hollywood, it actually didn't translate into dollars and cents.
	   The line of lizard figurines, key chains and sports bottles
continues to do steady, if unspectacular business, with the beast
easily avoiding that fate worse that bullets: the bargain table.
	   ``We have been extremely satisfied with product sales,'' he
said, though he stressed that there are no guarantees in movie
merchandising, in which important planning decisions are made long
before the movie comes out.
	   ``You have to take a leap of faith,'' he said. ``You have no
choice.''

Comeback queen Pam Grier in new sitcom among summer reruns

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ While TV networks in the United States bemoan
the record low ratings of a dreary summer season of reruns, at
least one cable channel is offering something new.
	   Showtime is giving its viewers 13 episodes of each of two summer
sitcoms, ``Rude Awakening'' and ``Linc's.'' Both premiere Saturday,
Aug. 1.
	   ``Rude Awakening'' focuses on Sherilyn Fenn, late of ``Twin
Peaks,'' as a onetime star of a nighttime soaper, now on the skids
and working in B-movies. There are lots of eccentrics in her
Alcoholics Anonymous group and in her own family. Lynn Redgrave and
Richard Lewis are in the mix.
	   ``Linc's'' is the name of a Washington, D.C., tavern. Pam Grier
appears as a children's rights advocate with a failing marriage.
Others in the cast: Georg Stanford Brown, Tisha Campbell and Steven
Williams.
	   The ultra-talented Debbie Allen directed the first episode. The
show is filmed at Tim Reid's New Millennium studios in Petersburg,
Virginia. Reid, of the acclaimed series ``Frank's Place,'' created
``Linc's'' and is its executive producer.
	   Along with Gloria Stuart, Burt Reynolds and Robert Forster, Pam
Grier had one of the more heartwarming comebacks of 1997. She first
achieved notoriety as the athletic star of 1970s blaxploitation
films with such titles as ``Foxy Brown,'' ``Sheba Baby'' and
``Scream Blacula Scream.''
	   She continued working during the 1980s and '90s, mostly in
low-budget movies, theater and television. Then a longtime fan,
Quentin Tarantino, cast her in ``Jackie Brown'' a flight attendant
caught in an underworld plot.
	   Critics rediscovered her as a dramatic actress.
	   Miss Grier recalled Tarantino telling her: ``I've enjoyed what
you've done, I like what you say, and one day I want to work with
you.''
	   Elmore Leonard's novel ``Rum Punch'' provided the opportunity to
cast Miss Grier. Tarantino named the film after her character,
Jackie Brown.
	   Miss Grier said her newfound success allows her to be selective
in projects, including ``Holy Smoke,'' a film by Jane Campion
(``The Piano'') in Australia, and ``Linc's,'' which has brought a
return to her Southern roots.
	   ``The show is going so very, very well that I lose sleep because
I'm so excited,'' she said in a recent interview from her car phone
in Virginia. ``The writing, the acting of an incredible ensemble of
people who are hysterical. Lord have mercy!
	   ``It's about real issues. It's about what people don't say and
wish they could. Some people might think it's too much. But that's
how real people think: `Oh, I just don't want anyone to hear my
innermost secrets.' We pull them out on the carpet. No one holds
back.''
	   Born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, MissGrier came to
Hollywood at a propitious time, and not only because the studios
recognized the vast black audience out there.
	   ``The action pictures I did exemplified the women's movement,''
she said. ``That was the time when women felt we could be equals.
We could protect ourselves, we could perform karate, we no longer
wanted to be victims.
	   ``That coincided with the movement in the African-American
community, the Black Panthers, black political agenda, everyone
trying to say, `We want respect, because we can do it.' ''
	   The films declined, she theorized, ``because they were
redundant.''
	   ``You can't bore your audience. We lost our core audience
because everybody was emulating each other ... . I chose not to be
redundant, I chose not to bore my audience. I wanted to grow.''
	   Miss Grier likens her career to a strong tree: ``It's going to
buckle the sidewalk, it's going to reach over the river, it's going
to reach for the sky, drop its leaves when fall comes and bloom
again in the spring.''

Chet Atkins looks to the future despite frail health

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ In a second-floor office in a
converted brown, two-story house on Music Row sits a thin, nattily
attired man, sleeping gently as he awaits a visitor.
	   Before brain surgery last year for a benign tumor, Chet Atkins
still looked and played guitar like a man 20 years his junior. Now
the 74-year-old country music star who helped usher in ``The
Nashville Sound'' is a little slower and tires easily.
	   An assistant awakens Atkins from his nap so the country legend
can reflect on his life and career in an interview.
	   He sometimes struggles to focus on the conversation, and he
refuses to linger long on questions about his health. But he looks
about the same as ever, except for his brown hair, which has not
grown all the way back since the brain surgery, and the limp left
over from a broken leg.
	   ``No, I'll never play like I once did,'' says Atkins, whose
finger-picking style has been an inspiration to generations of
guitar players. ``I can play with feeling. But technically, I can't
hook it like I used to.''
	   Never again will Atkins dazzle an audience with his technical
mastery of the guitar _ but he also isn't ready to stop performing.
Just last month he performed at a tribute show held for him in his
native East Tennessee.
	   Wife Leona keeps to the background, but Merle Atkins, his only
child, now accompanies her father to some public events to assist
him.
	   Atkins alternately tries to laugh off his health problems or
deny them.
	   ``I've only had cancer three times, that's not bad,'' he jokes.
Since the 1970s, he's had skin cancer removed from his face, and
lost his prostate and part of a lung to the disease.
	   ``I have trouble keeping my balance sometimes,'' Atkins says.
``They have me on blood-thinners and something to help with
balance.''
	   He sees doctors often but says he no longer asks for a
prognosis.
	   ``They never say anything and I never ask,'' Atkins says. ``I
don't want to know. Currently, I feel good. I'm all right.''
	   Country singer Steve Wariner, a friend, calls Atkins ``a young
soul trapped in an old body.''
	   Atkins' influence extends far beyond his legendary guitar
abilities. He has also carved out a reputation as a talent scout,
producer and record company executive. Among the artists he has
helped launch are Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, The
Everly Brothers, Charley Pride and Jerry Reed.
	   Scattered around his wood-paneled office are the memories of his
luminous career. There are a couple of guitars, books and CDs. On
his desk is a button with a photograph of Bettie Page, the pinup
queen of the 1950s.
	   ``I hear old records that I made and say, `Is that me? That's
good,''' Atkins says. ``I didn't know I was that good. Now that I
realize I can't do it anymore it gets even better.''
	   Chester Burton Atkins was born to a poor farming family near
Luttrell, Tennessee, in the Clinch Mountain foothills. He suffered
from asthma throughout his childhood, but found pleasure in the
guitar, which he picked up from his music-teacher father and older
half-brother Jimmy Atkins.
	   He rigged his first guitar at age 5 from a broken ukulele and
wires taken from a screen door.
	   While working for radio stations across the country, he
developed a distinctive guitar style influenced by Merle Travis and
Django Reinhardt.
	   Steve Sholes of RCA Records in Nashville took Atkins on as a
protege in the early 1950s, and Atkins took over the Nashville
office after Sholes, who signed up Elvis Presley, was promoted to
the New York office.
	   Atkins has played on thousands of records, including those of
Presley, Hank Williams Sr., and The Everly Brothers. He has sold
over 35 million of his instrumental albums. His collaborators
include Paul McCartney, Earl Klugh, George Benson and Mark
Knopfler.
	   Atkins and competitor Owen Bradley at the Decca record company
helped rescue the country music industry from the inroads of rock
'n' roll in the late 1950s. Their strategy was to appeal to older
listeners who didn't care for rock.
	   What emerged was ``The Nashville Sound,'' a combination of lush
string sections and vocal backings that forsook the twangy fiddles
and steel guitars of traditional country music. It was a success,
despite criticism from country music purists.
	   Despite his health setbacks, Atkins is determined to go forward.
Most recently, he has been promoting Chet Atkins' Musician Days, a
weeklong festival for musicians that completed a second year of
concerts and seminars last month.
	   At a tribute concert for Jennings and Johnny Cash _ the
highlight of this year's event _ singer Marty Stuart called the
festival ``Nashville's way of stopping the music business for a
minute and honoring its own.''
	   Atkins didn't perform this year, but his reputation is enough to
attract participants like Cash, Jennings and Knopfler.
	   ``Maybe it will last,'' Atkins says. ``I made a promise to take
my name off it in a couple years, because why should my name be on
it? I'm just helping to get it started.''

Building boom: Some museum expansions more artful than others
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY336 &QL; 
 &UR; By ULA ILNYTZKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Art museums are having a love affair with
expansion.
	   In the last three decades, 600 new art museums opened in the
United States, and major museums like the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Museum of
Fine Art in Houston added wings. In Europe, a similar phenomenon
has occurred.
	   But how artful is the new architecture?
	   In a new book, ``Towards a New Museum,'' architectural historian
Victoria Newhouse deems some new buildings a success _ The
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain _ and some a failure _ the
additions at the Met.
	   Too many top-rate museums, she says, ``treat their architecture
... as if you were cropping the 'Mona Lisa' painting or repainting
a Mondrian. They don't give the same importance to architecture. I
think they're inseparable.''
	   Newhouse takes particular issue with additions at three major
New York museums _ the Met, MoMA and the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum _ and at the Louvre in Paris, labeling them ``wings that
don't fly.''
	   ``Unfortunately, wings very often are added for political and
personal reasons,'' she said in a recent interview. ``They can be
very detrimental to the identity of a museum, which is very often
changed, and to this important relationship between art and
architecture.''
	   Directors at those museums would not comment.
	   But Peter C. Marzio, director of the Houston museum, said the
book ``will be enormously useful to the museum profession, to
boards of trustees, and probably even to city planners and people
who care about the urban environment.''
	   ``Her point,'' he said, ``is that there are some museums that
are really exciting to look at but you have to question how well
they work.''
	   Marzio's museum is cited by Newhouse as a success story. The
author suggests that successful expansion almost always involves
creation of a separate or quasi-separate structure. Museums
accomplishing that include the Houston museum, the Yale University
Art Gallery and the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany.
	   In each case, the new wing reads as a new museum, an innovative
statement that leaves the original building intact.
	   The impetus for the book was Newhouse's failed fight to stop a
wing at New York's Guggenheim from being built. Added in 1990, the
rectangular wing compromised Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral design
with ``this dinky space,'' she says.
	   ``The Guggenheim is a building that should never have been
altered. ... The new wing's west facade rudely interrupts the
spiral's swirl into space,'' she writes.
	   The Met, meanwhile, ``as the mother of all New York museums, has
set a poor example in dealing with its own architecture.'' The
museum's almost continuous expansion and remodeling _ seven new
wings since 1970 and a planned three-part expansion _ have
generally failed, she writes, because decisions have often been
made by board members who don't understand a museum's needs.
	   A museum's desire to attract an ever wider audience _ an
estimated 100 million people visited U.S. museums in 1996 _ often
blurs its original purpose, Newhouse says.
	   MoMA was cited by the author:
	   ``What began in the 1930s as a revolutionary institution _ with
its innovative presentation of unfamiliar painting and sculpture
and a new, interdisciplinary approach to art _ by the 1960s had
become primarily the repository and custodian of a permanent
collection of accepted masterpieces that were presented with
didactic authority.''
	   The museum is currently considering an expansion that would
increase its size by 50 percent.
	   Newhouse, the wife of newspaper and magazine publisher S.I.
Newhouse, sits on MoMA's architecture and design committee and
hopes the book will encourage a constructive dialogue.
	   Architect Philip Johnson, who has designed museum buildings for
his own art collection in New Canaan, Connecticut, and was behind
two wings at MoMA, said in an interview that Newhouse's work was
``the most important book _ the only book _ on the problem of the
new museum.''
	   Artist Frank Stella, who designed Israel's Desert Museum among
other buildings, agrees with much of Newhouse's critique and says
misguided museum architecture reflects confusion over art in
general.
	   ``If we were more committed, more definite about what the
artwork was that we wanted in museums, I think that buildings would
be better,'' he said.
	   Among other ``wings that don't fly,'' Newhouse includes the
famous 1989 glass-and-steel pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre
which serves as an underground entrance to the 16th-century
palace-turned-museum.
	   ``You don't enter a palace through its basement or via a
shopping mall,'' she writes.
	   New museums getting high marks from the author include the
Bilbao Guggenheim and The Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum in
Minneapolis, both by Frank O. Gehry. They represent ``the museum as
environmental art,'' Newhouse says.
	   The Bilbao Guggenheim with its saillike form and the Weisman
with its billowing, iceberg-type metallic facade blend with the
landscape, while complementing the art inside with skylights,
curving walls and vaulted rooms, she writes.
	   Newhouse is also the author of a book on U.N. architect Wallace
K. Harrison. And she founded the Architectural History Foundation,
a nonprofit publisher of scholarly books in architecture, which
operated from 1978 to 1994.
	   ``Towards a New Museum'' was published in June by Monacelli
Press.

Japan goes to polls in Parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS previous cycle and UPDATES with polls opening; polls
close at 1100 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters across Japan began casting their ballots
Sunday in elections seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's efforts to pull Japan out of its deepest recession
since World War II.
	   The elections for half of the 252 seats in Parliament's upper
house are the first in that chamber since Hashimoto came to power
in early 1996.
	   Polling opened at 7:00 a.m (2200 GMT) and was scheduled to
continue until 8:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) _ two hours longer than usual
due to concerns over falling voter turnout in recent elections.
	   As a member of the more powerful lower house, Hashimoto himself
does not stand for re-election. And his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is in no danger of losing its hold on power _ it has a strong
majority in the lower house.
	   But with unemployment at a post-war high and bankruptcies
increasing, Hashimoto's and his party are expected to face a rough
ride. And if the party does poorly at the polls, Hashimoto may have
to step down.
	   ``We did everything we could,'' Hashimoto was quoted as saying
Saturday night by Kyodo News as he wrapped up 17 days of
campaigning on behalf of his party. ``All we can do now is to wait
for the judgment.''
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass, a major factor in
the broader financial crisis throughout Asia, had sent Hashimoto's
support ratings to record lows over the past several weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed
to backtrack two days later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce
the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   He now says he supports cuts.
	   One factor expected to be in the ruling party's favor was voter
apathy _ turnout was expected to be among the lowest ever, despite
the longer polling hours, possibly falling below 50 percent of all
registered voters.
	   Many analysts said a low turnout was likely because of an
increasing number of voters who don't feel comfortable with any of
the parties' candidates.
	   A higher turnout, they said, would likely hurt the ruling party
because it would bring out more protest votes.
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would mean the ruling party would
again have to seek outside partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have deliberately
distanced themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to
survive.
	   Other opposition parties have also had trouble capitalizing on
the LDP's sagging support.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party is the second largest in Parliament, with
38 seats in the upper house. But Kan's personal popularity has been
clouded by the party's vague stance on major issues.
	   The only other party seen as being in a position to make
significant gains was the Communists, who currently have only 14
seats in the upper house.
	   They were not expected to win enough to become a serious
challenge to the LDP, however.

Macqueen cautious in victory

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian coach Rod Macqueen put a
halt to any premature celebrations after his rugby union side's
24-16 win Saturday over the New Zealand All Blacks in the Bledisloe
Cup.
	   ``We're just one up with two to go,'' Macqueen said, referring
to the best-of-three series.
	   Captain John Eales said the Australians could have a drink
Sunday and enjoy the moment but then had to prepare for next
Saturday's test against South Africa.
	   ``New Zealand has been a great team because they had one loss in
24 tests,'' said Eales.
	   ``We've started off well this year but we have to keep our heads
about us because we're coming up against South Africa and there's
no doubt it will be a tough match.''
	   Macqueen created a record when he selected the same Australian
team for the first four tests this season and he's sure to keep the
same side, barring injury, for the Springboks in Perth.
	   Australian fullback Matthew Burke led his team Saturday with a
record points haul, scoring all of the Wallabies points from two
tries, four penalties and a conversion.
	   The win ended Australia's run of seven straight losses against
the All Blacks since 1994. Burke's haul, in front of 75,000 fans at
the Melbourne Cricket Ground, broke his own record of 20 points for
an Australian against New Zealand.
	   ``The rest of the team really made it easy for me,'' said Burke.
``The forwards really laid the platform for our win.''
	   Burke has scored 319 points in test matches for Australia,
passing David Campese's total of 315 but still well short of
Michael Lynagh's 911.
	   Taine Randell, leading the All Blacks against their archrivals
for the first time, praised Australia.
	   ``They deserved to win,'' said Randell. ``We're gutted.'' (djp)

World Cup: Super Suker hits sixth goal at France 98
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the likes of Ronaldo, Gabriel Batistuta and
Alessandro Del Piero looking to fire on all cylinders at the World
Cup, few rated Davor Suker's chances of ending the tournament as
top scorer.
	   But with only one match to play, that's exactly what looks like
happening.
	   The Croat striker scored his sixth goal of the World Cup on
Saturday as Croatia beat the Netherlands 2-1 in the third place
playoff match.
	   Suker started out as a 33/1 shot to end the World Cup as top
scorer _ odds that didn't even put him in the top 10 favorites for
the honor.
	   But only Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who has scored four goals
going into Sunday's final against France, can now catch the Real
Madrid striker on six goals.
	   In Saturday's match, Suker again showed world class finishing as
Croatia counterattacked to win a game dominated by the Dutch.
	   Suker won the game for Croatia in the 35th minute.
	   Zvonimir Soldo broke free on the right, and after pulling up,
sent the ball outside the top of the penalty area to Zvonimir
Boban, who continued it on to Suker.
	   With Dutch defender Jaap Stam about 4 meters away, Suker wound
up from 20 meters and shot between Stam's legs and just inside the
right post.
	   ``Suker's goal was a masterpiece,'' said Croat captain Boban.
	   Patrick Kluivert was the most wasteful for the Netherlands.
	   As early as the eighth minute, he picked up a pass from Clarence
Seedorf and worked himself into a good shooting position only for
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic to save.
	   Late in the game, Kluivert had only Ladic to beat but blasted
wide from 13 meters.
	   In a game without the tension of many recent World Cup games,
both teams reverted to type.
	   The Netherlands snatched most of the possession, often failing
to covert it into decent scoring opportunies, while Croatia packed
its defense and broke swiftly on the counterattack.
	   Post-match statistics showed the Netherlands had nearly twice as
much possession as Croatia during match.
	   ``We played like we did the whole tournament, dominating
possession,'' said Dutch coach Guus Hiddink. ``Tonight, we were
classed out by the counterattack. It is always disappointing when
you don't win a game you dominate.''
	   ``Croatia had two or three good chances and they scored twice.
They looked sharp and fresh, but we had many chances so we are
disappointed,'' said Netherlands winger Marc Overmars.
	   All the goals Saturday came in the first half.
	   Robert Prosinecki scored first for Croatia in the 13th minute.
	   The Croatia Zagreb midfielder collected a Robert Jarni center
and pivoted 270 degrees to his left to elude Frank de Boer, Arthur
Numan and Phillip Cocu before beating goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar
from 8 meters.
	   The Dutch renewed their pressure, which finally paid off in the
21st minute.
	   Boudewijn Zenden's 23-meter, left-footed rocket off a sprinting
run from the touchline to the arc started right and curled left,
leaving keeper Drazen Ladic contorting to get an outstretch hand to
the ball.
	   But Suker had the last word.
	   The striker, who has played at Real Madrid for two years, has
now scored 35 goals in 41 games for Croatia.
	   ``It was a tough match against probably the best team in the
world at the moment. We played with great wisdom,'' said Croat
coach Miroslav Blazevic.
	   He agreed that his team played to defend and counterattack
rather than entertain.
	   ``That was the only strategy that would enable us to win,'' he
said.
	   The coach also praised his top scorer.
	   ``Suker has played superbly throughout the World Cup. I can not
see Ronaldo scoring three goals in the final,'' Blazevic said.
	   But Suker isn't counting on ending up top of the goalscoring
charts just yet.
	   ``I am very happy to end the competition with six goals. But as
for me being the top scorer, we can talk about that on Monday,'' he
said.

After 32 days waiting is over: bring on Brazil and France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ The waiting's over. At long last,
after 33 days of tension, thrills, drama and heartbreak, defending
champion Brazil was in Sunday's final against the host nation with
well over a billion people around the world glued to their TV sets.
	   It was the best team on the planet against a nation yearning for
its first World Cup triumph.
	   But it had one other thing to settle.
	   The outcome of the final at the 80,000-capacity Stade de France
would most likely decide which player would be the star of the last
World Cup of the century.
	   So many stars have sparkled over the past month with none
outshining the rest. Yet Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo is certain
who will become the ultimate star.
	   ``Ronaldo is rising in production every game,'' he said. ``I am
sure the final will be Ronaldo's.''
	   The Inter Milan striker, still only 21, has scored four goals
and created several more. But Zagallo knows he's still building to
his best. Ronaldo hasn't terrorized defenses in the way everyone
knows he can with his speed and unstoppable runs for goal.
	   Sunday's final was his last chance.
	   The game itself would basically come down to this: Ronaldo and
Co., the world greatest offensive line, had to get past Marcel
Desailly and Co., the World Cup's best defense.
	   ``France has a great defense but we know very well that our
attack is the best in the world,'' said Ronaldo.
	   If it wasn't, French mastermind Zinedine Zidane had the chance
to turn the World Cup his way with a couple of decisive passes.
	   The imaginative Juventus forward, who missed two games through
suspension after being expelled against the Saudis in his team's
second game, didn't produce his best form on the way to the final.
	   Ronaldo, who has seen him in action in Italy's Serie A, knew
that could happen against Brazil.
	   ``The whole French team plays around him, it's Zidane who makes
the team good or not,'' the Inter striker said. ``He determines
everything.''
	   The French show just as much reverence for the two-time FIFA
Player of the Year.
	   ``There is no way you can prepare for Ronaldo. You just have to
deny him space,'' said Desailly. The central defender denied
opponents room to operate in his first six games, and denying
Ronaldo would cap an excellent World Cup for him. The French called
him their ``anti-Ronaldo plan.''
	   Brazil had gotten into the final five times already, winning
four of them. For France, the final was virgin territory, after
losing three World Cup semifinals in the last four decades.
	   They've met in the World Cup before, with France winning the
last encounter in 1986 in a classic match that ended in a penalty
shootout. Last year, the teams played 1-1 in a World Cup
preparation match.
	   The French nation of 60 million was already thankful to the team
for having reached the final, anything on top was considered icing
on the cake.
	   ``We will have given it our all, so that we have no regrets,''
said French captain Didier Deschamps.
	   Laurent Blanc, a bulwark of the back line alongside Desailly,
was not there and he had big regrets after being sent off for
slapping an opponent in the face. Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf replaced
him.
	   Deschamps had Blanc in his thoughts.
	   ``We will play for him,'' he said.

World Cup: Brazilians prepare to party if team wins soccer title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ It will be like carnival in July
at the final whistle of the World Cup soccer final in France.
Brazilians are ready to launch wild celebrations for what they
expect to be their nation's fifth victory.
	   Brazil comes to a halt every time its national soccer team plays
as crazed fans dance, party, and sing in the streets after each
victory. But many expect the celebrations after the final game to
be more intense than ever.
	   Many streets near the beaches are to be blocked off to all cars
for five hours after the game on Sunday so that Rio residents can
celebrate late into the night.
	   More than 3,000 policemen, some of whom will be armed with video
cameras, will be on hand throughout the city to keep order among
crazed revelers.
	   Supermarkets announced closures two hours before the game
starts. Many movie houses won't bother opening Sunday.
	   Rio's public hospitals announced they will have extra staff on
hand to handle an expected increase in alcohol-related traffic
accidents after Sunday's final.
	   The celebrations are not expected to wrap up Sunday. The
national team is scheduled to travel Monday to Brasilia and then
Tuesday to Rio de Janeiro, where Rio Mayor Luiz Paulo Conde has
already planned a parade for the victors.
	   About 5,000 policemen will be on hand to keep order during the
parade, which will stretch from Rio's international airport on the
city's north side to the Intercontinental Hotel in the southern
part of the city.
	   If the team loses, the number of policemen escorting the team to
the Brazilian Soccer Confederation will be reduced.

Items on Barthez kissing ritual, Ronald de Boer transfer
</HEADLINE>
frustration, World Cup insurance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ So, who kisses the head of Fabien
Barthez before the World Cup final?
	   Defender Laurent Blanc has carried out the lucky charm ritual
before each game, but he's suspended for the final after his
semifinal expulsion.
	   So the French goalkeeper may go into Sunday's final against
Brazil without a team-mate taking hold of his head and planting a
kiss on his shiny dome.
	   Perhaps Blanc's replacement, Frank Lebeouf, might take over the
kissing duty too.
	   If he does, Barthez may return the compliment.
	   Lebeouf has no hair either.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Keen to move to English champion Arsenal, Dutch
midfielder Ronald de Boer reportedly is frustrated that Ajax won't
honor an agreement and let him leave.
	   According to the London-based Sunday People, De Boer has a
clause in his contract that, if big clubs make an offer, then Ajax
will allow him to talk to them.
	   ``I respect the fact Ajax do not want to let me go. It means
they think a lot of me as a player,'' said De Boer, whose penalty
miss in the World Cup semifinal against Brazil meant the Dutch were
eliminated.
	   ``But it's disappointing Ajax are not even prepared to discuss
business with the people of Arsenal, who have been very genuine and
very clear about their ambitions. I've discussed the whole thing
with my lawyer and with my agent.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Insuring the World Cup is big business,
and getting bigger: This year's soccer tournament was insured for
up to dlrs 355 million in damages and the 2002 games are to be
protected against a possible dlrs 1.4 billion in damages.
	   The international soccer organization FIFA paid the
Hamburg-based Albingia agency a dlrs 8.3 million premium to insure
against everything from parking lot accidents to satellite crashes,
the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Much of the premium is due to skyrocketing prices for television
rights: If a broadcast satellite fails, organizers must repay
millions of dollars to media outlets that purchased broadcast
rights.
	   The 2002 tournament to be hosted jointly by Japan and South
Korea is to be insured by Albingia against a potential dlrs 1.4
billion in damages, Welt am Sonntag said.
	   FIFA's premium for the 2002 games has not yet been decided, the
newspaper said.

A week later, Protestant marchers still insist on parade going
</HEADLINE>
through &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAP pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant protesters clashed
again overnight with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road, this time in hand-to-hand scuffles, as
the stalemate entered its second week Sunday.
	   Members of the Orange Order _ stymied since July 5 from parading
down Portadown's Garvaghy Road from their rural Drumcree church _
started negotiating through intermediaries Saturday with the road's
Catholic residents.
	   But when the talks adjourned for the day without results, the
Orangemen announced a second application was submitted to a
government-appointed parades commission requesting an identical
route down Garvaghy Road _ with a departure time of 12:30 p.m.
(1130 GMT) Sunday.
	   The commission was expected to rule Sunday morning on the
application, which normally must be submitted at least seven days
in advance.
	   Thousands of Orangemen have remained encamped outside the steel
and barbed-wire barricades in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms)
southwest of Belfast, staging increasingly bold attacks on police
once night falls.
	   Overnight Sunday, riot police fought hand-to-hand with hooded
demonstrators who ripped away parts of the barricade.
	   Protesters launched fireworks directly at the security forces
and threw bricks and stones. The police answered with plastic
bullets, and arrested at least two people.
	   Twenty protesters were injured by a barrage of plastic bullets
overnight Saturday, including a 26-year-old man who remained
hospitalized in critical condition and a 21-year-old female college
student who lost an eye.
	   Orange Order spokesman David Jones said late Saturday that any
further violence would not be his group's fault if they again were
blocked from marching down the Garvaghy Road on Sunday.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the parades
commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' he said.
	   It was unclear when the indirect talks between the Orangemen and
Catholic residents would resume, but authorities said it would be
after Sunday.
	   Police already feared tensions would peak this weekend with the
12th of July holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the
defeat of Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   The streets of normally bustling Belfast began emptying early
Saturday afternoon in anticipation of more trouble, and dozens of
holiday bonfires and fireworks lit the sky as night settled in.
	   On the streets of one Protestant enclave, children toasted
marshmallows over the flames; on the streets of another, they
watched gleefully as the flames from a hijacked car, torched by a
gasoline bomb, leaped higher and higher.
	   Violence broke out in Belfast and others areas of the province
after the Orangemen were first blocked from marching last Sunday.
But the situation in Portadown has grown in intensity and tension
each night.
	   Tom Craig, the assistant chief constable overseeing the
standoff, said Saturday that the violence was worsening as
Orangemen became more impatient _ and more resolute.
	   The Orangemen had started using children to cut the barbed-wire
so adults could creep closer to security forces, Craig said.
	   ``They're trying to get within range where they can kill police
officers,'' he said.

	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Scott Erickson allowed four hits in 8 2-3
innings and Joe Carter homered as the Baltimore Orioles won their
third straight over Boston, 2-1 Saturday.
	   The Orioles, who still trail Boston by 12{ games in the
wild-card race, are on their first three-game winning streak since
June 1-3
	   Erickson (9-7) struck out eight and walked one. He retired the
first 13 batters before Troy O'Leary hit a soft liner to right
field that dropped well in front of Carter. The only run he allowed
came when John Valentin led off the eighth with his 12th homer.
Jess Orosco got the final out for his sixth save.
	   Tim Wakefield (10-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Mariners 2, Angels 0 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Randy Johnson, pitching a day after being involved
in a clubhouse fight with teammate David Segui, struck out 15 in
his first shutout of the season for Seattle.
	   Anaheim's seventh loss in eight games knocked the Angels out of
first place in the AL West. They fell a half-game behind Texas.
	   Johnson (8-8) allowed five hits and two walks in his first
shutout since last Aug. 8, when he beat the Chicago White Sox 5-0.
	   Johnson knocked Segui _ the Mariners' leading hitter with a .329
batting average _ out of the game with a sprained right wrist.
Johnson went after Segui after Segui made a remark about him to
teammate Jay Buhner.
	   Edgar Martinez's two-run single off Steve Sparks (3-1) in the
sixth inning accounted for all the scoring.
 &UR; Indians 12, Twins 2 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Brian Giles was 4-for-5 with four RBIs and his
first homer in nearly two months, and Dwight Gooden outpitched
All-Star Brad Radke.
	   Travis Fryman hit his 16th homer and second in two days as AL
Central-leading Cleveland extended its lead over second-place
Minnesota to 11 1/2 games.
	   Radke (9-7), the Twins' only All-Star representative, gave up
eight runs and 11 hits in five-plus innings, falling to 4-8 with a
6.69 ERA in his career against Cleveland.
	   Gooden (3-3) pitched seven innings, allowing one run and four
hits, including a homer to David Ortiz.
 &UR; Rangers 4, Athletics 2 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Luis Alicea had a three-run double with
two outs in the ninth inning as Texas beat Oakland to take the AL
West lead.
	   The Rangers loaded the bases against Mike Fetters (1-3) on a
one-out single, a walk and an error by first baseman Brian Lesher.
	   Fetters got Kevin Elster to line to short for the second out,
but Alicea lined a 3-2 pitch off the top of the wall in right
center.
	   The victory moved the Rangers back into first place, a half-game
in front of Anaheim. Texas has won five straight.
	   Xavier Hernandez (4-1) got one out in the eighth for the
victory. John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 25th save.
	   Juan Gonzalez, who had 101 RBIs at the All-Star break, went
1-for-3 and is 2-for-11 in three games since the break with no
RBIs.
 &UR; Yankees 2, Devil Rays 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, New York won its ninth straight game
to match its longest winning streak of the season behind the strong
pitching of David Cone.
	   Cone (13-2) became the AL's first 13-game winner, limiting Tampa
Bay to three hits in eight innings. He struck out eight and walked
three. Mariano Rivera got his 24th save.
	   Paul O'Neill drove in one run off Rolando Arrojo (10-6) with a
first-inning double. Chuck Knoblauch made it 2-0 with a sacrifice
fly in the seventh inning as the Yankees improved baseball's best
start in 96 years to 64-20 by winning for the 13th time in their
last 14 games.
 &UR; Tigers 5, Blue Jays 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Brian Moehler, dominant at home all season, allowed
no hits through six innings and Bobby Higginson homered twice for
Detroit.
	   Moehler (8-6) gave up one run on three hits with five strikeouts
and two walks in 7 2-3 innings. He is 8-0 at Tiger Stadium this
year with a league-low 2.05 home ERA. Sean Runyan got the last four
outs for his first major league save.
	   Higginson drove in three runs with three hits and scored three
runs in his second multi-homer game of the season. Tony Clark and
Damion Easley had RBI doubles off Chris Carpenter (5-4) as the
Tigers took their third straight win over the Blue Jays and seventh
victory in nine games.
 &UR; White Sox 4, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle hit his fourth home run in three games
since the All-Star break as Chicago beat Kansas City.

season over the wall in the center, a three-run shot, to erase a
2-0 deficit in the fourth.
	   James Baldwin (4-3) allowed seven hits with no walks and three
strikeouts over seven innings. Matt Karchner pitched the ninth for
his 11th save.
	   Pat Rapp (8-8) suffered his first road loss of the season after
five straight wins away from home, despite giving up only five hits
in seven-plus innings, including Ray Durham's ninth home run
leading off the eighth.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Leading presidential candidate Hugo
Chavez said Saturday that if he is elected, he will declare a
moratorium on payments of Venezuela's foreign debt because of
plummeting oil prices.
	   ``It's essential that we readjust the handling of the foreign
debt ... and negotiate a moratorium of at least two years,'' he
told The Associated Press after a rally in which a minor political
party endorsed him.
	   Chavez said President Rafael Caldera should declare the
moratorium now, but doubts he will.
	   The lowest prices in 12 years for Venezuelan oil have forced the
government to slash (dlrs) 1.6 billion from this year's budget. Oil
accounts for three-fourths of the exports from Venezuela, the No.1
foreign supplier of oil to the United States.
	   Payments on Venezuela's foreign debt of (dlrs) 29 billion eat up
40 percent of the budget.
	   Chavez, who led a failed 1992 coup attempt, is leading former
Miss Universe and local Mayor Irene Saez in the opinion polls for
the Dec. 6 race.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Five people were executed in a Sao
Paulo slum early Saturday in a massacre police say could be related
to drugs, Jornal do Brasil reported.
	   O Globo reported three men, one woman and a 14-year-old girl
were executed with shots to the back of the head in what appears to
be a drug-related killings.
	   Police in Sao Paulo could not be reached for comment.
	   O Globo reported the victims were stacked on top of one another
in a home used to store and traffic illegal drugs.
	   Jornal do Brasil reported the incident was the 46th time this
year that police have discovered what they suspected were
drug-related deaths. A total of 162 people have been killed in such
incidents.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Police seized 815 pounds (370 kilos) of
cocaine and arrested 21 people, including three police officers,
during a raid of a clandestine drug laboratory, authorities said
Saturday.
	   Police raided the laboratory Thursday in the coastal town of
Huaral, 43 miles (70 kms) north of Lima, where they found the
cocaine, as well as the chemicals and equipment needed to make it,
a police communique said.
	   It was the largest seizure of cocaine in Peru so far this year.
	   Police did not release the names of those arrested or the
destination of the cocaine, but said the police officers involved
will be kicked off the force and tried for drug trafficking.
	   Peru is one of the world's largest producers of the coca leaf
used to make cocaine.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Police have seized more than 1 ton of
cocaine from a sunken speedboat off the San Blas coast in the
Caribbean sea, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   La Prensa said the smugglers scuttled the speedboat while being
chased by helicopters, and fled in another boat. No arrests were
reported.
	   U.S. Coast Guard and Panamanian Maritime Service units
cooperated in recovering the drug, which weighed 1,100 kilograms
(2,420 pounds) and was being smuggled through Panama into the
United States, the newspaper said.

Indonesian leader scores big victory in ruling party

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In a major political victory for
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, the ruling party has
overwhelmingly elected a new reformist chairman and has severed
ties with former autocrat Suharto in its search for more democracy.
	   Habibie, who replaced ex-President Suharto in May, has promised
to liberalize the tightly controlled political system and hold free
elections next year for the world's fourth most populous nation.
	   Akbar Tanjung, a member of Habibie's Cabinet and the president's
personal choice for the party chairmanship, won 17 out of the 27
votes cast by party delegates.
	   Saturday night's election of Akbar was held at the end of a
three-day special congress of Golkar members held less than two
months after violent protests forced Suharto to step down.
	   Within hours of Akbar's victory, party officials said Golkar had
formally dissolved its board of patrons, headed by Suharto who lost
his position as chief patron.
	   Until now the body had been instrumental in deciding party
policy.
	   The old president's key supporters were expected to be purged
from the ranks of the party, including two of his wealthy children,
who with their father are fighting off allegations of corruption.
	   The officials said Suharto's eldest daughter, Tutut, a former
Cabinet minister, would be replaced as a junior party chairwoman.
Second son Bambang would lose his job as party treasurer.
	   ``There is no place for the Suharto family in the new Golkar,''
said Sarwono Kusumaatmajda, a former environment minister.
	   During his three decades in power, Suharto blatantly used Golkar
to dominate a largely symbolic form of parliamentary democracy that
legitimized his authoritarian rule.
	   Some have speculated that he had wanted to maintain his
influence within Golkar to protect his family's huge business
interests in the face of an ongoing corruption investigation.
	   However, Saturday's ballot appears to have ended any chance of
that.
	   Although the party has millions of members and remains
organizationally and financially strong, there are doubts about its
future as new parties are founded ahead of promised free elections
next year.
	   Akbar made it clear that Golkar must reinvent itself to win
voter support.
	   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
	   Saturday's ballot was the first time Golkar delegates were asked
to vote for a new party chief since it was formed in 1964.
	   In the past, chairmen were chosen by Suharto and a small group
of advisers and then endorsed by the party machine.
	   Analysts said Suharto's followers, many of them retired
generals, had sought to slow down political reform to protect the
positions they had gained under Suharto.
	   Akbar's victory followed a strong call for reform made by
Habibie in a speech to the congress on Thursday.

Early voter turnout up as Japan goes to polls in Parliamentary

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with early voter turnout numbers; polls close at 1100
GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters turned out in unexpectedly high numbers
early Sunday for Parliamentary elections seen as a referendum on
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's efforts to pull Japan out of its
worst recession since World War II.
	   The bigger turnout could mean trouble for Hashimoto _ analysts
have predicted that more votes could mean more protest votes will
be cast against Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   At stake are half the 252 seats in the Parliament's upper house.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats are in no danger of losing their
hold on power because of their strong majority in the lower house
and Hashimoto himself was not up for re-election.
	   But the elections are an important test of whether voters hold
Hashimoto and his party responsible for the Japan's economic
malaise. If the ruling party does poorly, Hashimoto will be under
intense pressure to resign.
	   Three hours after polls opened Sunday, 10.99 percent of Japan's
99.4 million registered voters had cast ballots, up 0.44 percentage
point from the last election, according to the Home Affairs
Ministry.
	   Polling was scheduled to continue until 8:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) _
two hours longer than usual due to concerns over falling voter
turnout in recent elections. The results of about 90 percent of the
races were expected by 1 a.m. Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   The elections are the first in the upper house since Hashimoto
came to power in early 1996, and with unemployment at a postwar
high and bankruptcies increasing, his party had geared up for a
rough ride.
	   ``We did everything we could,'' Hashimoto was quoted as saying
Saturday night by Kyodo News as he wrapped up 17 days of
campaigning on behalf of his party. ``All we can do now is to wait
for the judgment.''
	   Opposition parties called on voters to send a message that they
are unhappy with the way Hashimoto and his party have handled the
economy.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed
to backtrack two days later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce
the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   He now says he supports cuts.
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would mean the ruling party would
again have to seek outside partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have distanced
themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   Other opposition parties have also had trouble capitalizing on
the LDP's sagging support.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party is the second largest in Parliament, with
38 seats in the upper house. But Kan's personal popularity has been
clouded by the party's vague stance on major issues.
