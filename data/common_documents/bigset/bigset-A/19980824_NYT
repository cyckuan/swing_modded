CSTOM-MADE CDS ON DEMAND AT KIOSKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:Calif., N.Y.)  (js)

<P>
   Yu like a Mariah Carey song, but only one. You have a favorite
Beatles tune, but don't really feel like buying an entire
collection.
</P>
<P>
   With that type of shopper in mind, CD World, a five-year-old
company based in New York City, has formed a joint venture with
Sprint, the communications company, to create interactive kiosks
that allow consumers to cherry-pick their way through a list of
songs and create their own custom-mixed compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks, called Music Point, will be set up in about 400
locations in New York and Los Angeles this winter, said Anthony
Smith, CD World's communications director. The kiosks are being
marketed especially toward music stores, which have been suffering
sluggish sales in recent years, but they will also appear in places
like airport lounges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Music Point will operate like a vending machine. Retailers can
buy the kiosks for $40,000 to $60,000, or lease them. Retailers
supply the blank CDs, and CD World provides the copious song list
(there will be 50,000 songs at first), paying royalties to the
record companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can choose 45 minutes of music for roughly $18 a CD.
The kiosk itself is a data terminal connected by Sprint's
high-speed fiber optic network to a central music data base in New
York. The blank CD is actually ``burned'' right there inside the
kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   Each kiosk is equipped with a video screen that can play music
promotions and ads as shoppers wait four minutes for their CDs to
pop out. Smith said retailers would have the chance to sell video
advertising to increase revenues from the kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   CD World's effort is by no means the first of its type. In 1988,
Personics Corp. set up computerized kiosks in Tower Records/Video
stores that let shoppers make customized audiocassette tapes. But
the systems failed to maintain popularity, in part because
Personics had trouble getting licensing rights from record
companies, and the company wound up in bankruptcy court in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, IBM and Blockbuster Entertainment announced with great
fanfare that they would create similar kiosks that could copy
entire movies or audio albums onto blank videocassettes or CDs. But
that joint venture met resistance from entertainment companies and
never saw the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a number of other companies are offering variations
of the same idea over the Internet. In some of these systems, the
music selections are made over the Net and the CD is mailed to the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more experimental approaches allow the music selections
to be downloaded to the customer's personal computer, where the
recipient can make a CD _ provided he or she has a CD recorder. But
unless the consumer has an ultra-high-speed connection, such
downloads can be glacially slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet doesn't offer instant gratification,'' Smith
said. ``With Music Point, the customer is satisfied in a matter of
minutes.''

 SMART CARD COMES WITH A BURGER BONUS  (lh) 
 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several years, Mastercard International's Mondex
unit has been trying to get Americans to use its smart card rather
than cash for small transactions. Now the same folks are offering
free food as the incentive.
</P>
<P>
   The company is conducting a test with Burger King that offers
bonus points, redeemable for Whoppers and the like, to customers
who use Mondex's card system at four Burger King restaurants on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Mondex card is embedded with a special chip that keeps track
of purchases. A $10 card buys $10 worth of food, but for every
dollar customers spend they receive one loyalty point. Ten points
can be redeemed for a breakfast meal and 15 for a Whopper sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   The Mondex trial, which began in June and runs through December,
is not the only high-technology promotion the fast-food chain is
offering. Last month, a Burger King restaurant in Manhattan started
offering free Internet access from 20 PC's. Customers receive 20
free minutes on line when they spend a minimum of $4.99.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are also installing card readers in drive-through
lanes, where Mondex thinks the cards will be particularly popular,
saving drivers from digging into their pockets for cash.

TIME'S SPEEDED-UP ISSUE MISSED SOME OF THE NEWS  
 IN LOS ANGELES, IT'S PAPER VS. PAPER  
 FATE OF JOURNAL REPORTER ADDS TO SOUL-SEARCHING  
 CRITIC SAYS TWO COLUMNISTS SHOULD `COME CLEAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:Calif., Mass., N.Y.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The calls went out to magazine printing presses
around the country last Monday morning. Time magazine's editors
wanted to print their Aug. 31 issue several days early. Otherwise,
the magazine's coverage of President Clinton's grand jury testimony
would not appear until Aug. 24, well after even the most devoted
scandal aficionados would have had more news than they could take.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Marsel, the manager of the Quad Graphics Inc. plant in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said that his shop was one of seven plants
_ owned by Quad Graphics, World Color Press, Quebecor Printing and
R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons _ that rejiggered their schedules after
Time's representatives asked to move the work ahead from the usual
weekend time slots. On Wednesday night, the plants began printing
more than 4 million copies of Time. Andrew Blau, Time's director of
operations, confirmed Marsel's account.
</P>
<P>
   A coup? Time's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, thought so. For
Time, changing the scheduled press run is a rare event, usually
pegged to national elections or superpower summit meetings. The
furor over Clinton's admissions met the test because, Isaacson
said, it ``is one of those stories where you want to give it to
people this week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be chewed over by Sunday newspapers and Sunday
talk shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, however, Blau was checking to see whether
there was any weekend press capacity left anywhere. U.S. cruise
missiles had struck targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. The next
scheduled issue for Time, which is owned by Time Warner Inc., was
11 days away.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Brunett, a spokesman for Newsweek, which is owned by
Washington Post Co., clearly relished the idea that Newsweek would
have this week to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the bombing story,'' he said. ``You have U.S. air
strikes. You have Monica's testimony. There's news developing.
Cooler heads prevailed here to maintain our regular press
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Newsweek thought about printing early? Marsel of Quad
Graphics said the magazine's representatives called 24 hours after
Time did but found that in Saratoga Springs, at least, there was no
midweek press time left. But Brunett said, ``We could have come up
with the press time.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Time? If Time had wanted to come back with another
edition Monday, it had ``various contingency options,'' Isaacson
said on Thursday. ``The weekend capacity is there,'' he added. A
day later, he said that the bombing story was ``receding,'' adding,
``We're absolutely happy with where we are.''

   In Los Angeles, It's Paper vs. Paper
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a battle of words reminiscent of a classic
newspaper war, The Los Angeles Daily News reported last Monday that
the publisher of the rival Los Angeles Times was a member of a
powerful business group, one which not only required a $40,000
contribution to join, but had recently taken a stance on a
much-disputed political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The report was published about a week after The Daily News
disclosed, after inquiries by The Los Angeles Times, that it had
contributed $60,000 to a group called Valley Voters Organized
Toward Empowerment. The group is circulating petitions for a first
step toward secession of the San Fernando Valley from the City of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Headlined ``L.A.'s Power Elite,'' the Daily News article said
Mark Willes, publisher of The Los Angeles Times and chief executive
of its parent company, Times Mirror Corp., was part of the
26-member Los Angeles Business Advisers. The group has said it
opposes efforts to win more power for newly created ``neighborhood
councils.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times first reported Willes' membership in the
group on May 31, though a company spokesman, Mike Lange,
acknowledged it did not report the Times Mirror payment of the
$40,000 membership fee until its Aug. 20 paper, in a response to
criticism from Valley VOTE.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said he did not think his membership in the group and
Times Mirror's $40,000 payment was fundamentally different from The
Daily News' contribution to Valley VOTE, though he said the
contribution was comparatively smaller than The Daily News'
donation, which made up a significant proportion of the money
raised by the Valley group.
</P>
<P>
   He said his participation in the business group fit with a
tradition of media chief executives and publishers being active in
their communities and was not in conflict with a company policy
barring donations to political campaigns or groups that advocate
ballot initiatives. As long as the corporate activities remain
separate from the newsroom, he said, there will not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In institutions like ours,'' Willes said, ``as we work very
hard to do, reporters and editors are very clear about their
journalistic responsibility and keep that very separate from the
corporate activities.''

   Fate of Journal Reporter Adds to Soul-Searching
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has journalistic rigor gone too far? Are news
executives going overboard? Those questions, first asked when The
Boston Globe cracked down on its columnist Mike Barnicle for
borrowing jokes without attribution, returned with renewed force
last week after James Hirsch lost his job as a Boston correspondent
for The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch and The Journal parted company Tuesday after he reported
erroneously that The New York Times Co. had ``declined to comment''
on The Globe's Aug. 11 decision to rescind its demand for
Barnicle's resignation. The Times Co. owns The Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, who said in an interview that in nine years The Journal
``has sent me all over the world and let me cover some of the most
important beats,'' acknowledged last week that he had not called
The Times that day. He said he had been on a tight deadline and had
believed, based on earlier interviews with The Times' spokeswoman
on issues related to The Globe, that her response would be, in
effect, a ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of Barnicle's reprieve, Nancy Nielsen, the
spokeswoman, gave reporters who inquired this prepared statement:
``The New York Times Co. has a policy that all of its media
properties have editorial independence and autonomy. In keeping
with our policy, we support The Globe's right to make its own
decisions, just as we would with any of our other media
properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nielsen confirmed last week that after she saw Hirsch's
article, she wrote to The Journal's managing editor, Paul Steiger.
On Tuesday, Steiger's deputy informed Hirsch that he had committed
``a fireable offense,'' Hirsch recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is proportionality: Is it fair or not fair?''
Hirsch asked. He continued: ``It was an error, and it shouldn't
have happened. But it had no bearing on the story. And it certainly
wasn't journalistic malice or deception.'' Asked if other issues
were involved, Hirsch said, ``This offense was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Miller Pensiero, a spokeswoman for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., The
Journal's parent, responded ``it is simply not true'' that no other
issues were involved. She did not elaborate on that point but did
add that the Globe incident alone would justify termination.
``There are few, if any, more serious violations of journalistic
norms than knowingly printing a falsehood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Martin, the grievance chairman of the union that represents
Journal reporters, the Independent Association of Publishers'
Employees, said last week that a grievance filed Tuesday contended
that Hirsch was ``terminated without just and sufficient cause.''

   Critic Says Two Columnists Should `Come Clean'
</P>
<P>
   One footnote to the resignation last week of the columnist Mike
Barnicle from The Boston Globe:
</P>
<P>
   The media critic for the online magazine Slate issued what he
called a ``challenge to America's press: come clean about the Mike
Barnicles in your midst before you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The critic, Scott Shugar, who writes Today's Papers, the daily
assessment of the front pages of several national newspapers, said
that he had ``the goods on'' two columnists whose editors were
aware that they were ``fiction artists and plagiarists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of exposing them,'' he said, adding that he had
issued his challenge ``to see what shakes out.''

MOON IMPRESSIVE AFTER PRESEASON WAKEUP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ He had called the plays, taken the snaps, made
the handoffs and thrown those laser-beam passes it seems only he
can throw.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one thing Warren Moon had not experienced since
ending his 25-day holdout and resuming control of the Seahawks'
offense: Contact.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, the second play of Saturday night's preseason
game against the Arizona Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium. After
dumping a pass to running back Ricky Watters, Moon was leveled by
the Cardinals' Simeon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was penalized 15 yards for roughing the passer, but Moon
felt like thanking the 260-pound defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got introduced to the preseason right away,'' Moon said.
``That's what you need to let you know the season is here. I got
knocked on the ground and that kind of wakes you up and says,
`Let's get going.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moon got off his rear and pushed the offense into high gear.
Before calling it a night, he completed 8 of 15 passes for 202
yards, including touchdown passes of 69 yards to Joey Galloway and
55 yards to James McKnight. All in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first game action since the team's season finale
against the San Francisco 49ers last Dec. 21. He made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's easy, but it's natural for me,'' Moon
said. ``I just look at it as being natural. Those practices this
week really helped me as far as getting my sharpness back and
seeing things that you need to see. When you recognize the things
you need to see, then your natural ability is going to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon was a few phases shy of perfect and was the first to admit
it. He had two passes go off the hands of Cardinals defenders and
another go off the chest of McKnight that was intercepted, and he
could have had two more TD passes by making the proper reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make those and that means there's some room for
improvement,'' Moon said. ``Overall, I thought my performance was
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering that he was playing after practicing just six
times last week, the effort against the Cardinals was a giant step
in the right direction for Moon and the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren executed extremely well,'' coach Dennis Erickson said
Sunday after reviewing video of the 31-24 victory. ``He made a
couple of mistakes. ... Other than that, he played pretty
flawlessly, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest completion to a wide receiver in the first three
games was a 25-yarder to Mike Pritchard, and the longest pass play
was a 30-yarder to Watters that was more run-after-the-catch than
pass. Saturday night, Moon went to Pritchard for 26 yards on his
first completion and then had the bombs to McKnight and Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Moon passed for 202 yards on just eight completions against a
Cardinals defense that, while not exactly the 49ers, had held its
first two opponents to an average of 163.5 yards passing for the
entire game while allowing only one TD pass. Moon completed five of
his first eight passes for 104 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what was going to happen,'' offensive
coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``To step right in and play after
a week of practice is not easy. There were some plays we ran that
Warren hadn't even practiced this week. To his credit, he just let
it rip.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's final tuneup for the Sept. 6 regular-season opener in
Philadelphia will come Friday night against the 49ers at the
Kingdome. How much Moon and the No. 1 offense will play has yet to
be determined, but it probably won't be more than three or four
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren and I will talk (today). We just need to get a feel for
what he thinks he needs,'' Erickson said. ``Obviously I wouldn't
play him unless the whole first unit was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon got plenty of help from his friends against the Cardinals.
The offensive linemen not only protected him well _ especially
tackles Walter Jones and Howard Ballard against the Cardinals' Rice
and Eric Swann _ they also got Watters untracked early to help set
up the deep throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last touchdown was a play-action pass, and the way we were
running the ball they had to respect the run,'' guard Pete Kendall
said. ``Those long touchdowns are nice. They count for seven on the
scoreboard, but it doesn't take as much out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's best throw was one even his teammates didn't think he
could make _ the 69-yard post pattern to Galloway, who beat
cornerback J.J. McCleskey and then used an explosive burst to blow
past free safety Kwamie Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Joey take off and I thought, `Oh, man. Joey's just
outrun another quarterback,''' Kendall said. ``There aren't many in
the league who can get him that ball, but Warren did. He hit Joey
in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   It just goes to show that Moon _ even at 41, especially at 41 _
is not just another quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pass was Exhibit 9,000, right there,'' Kendall said.

M'S WIN AGAIN; ONE-RUN SPREE AT THREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Every time Paul Spoljaric makes another start, he
makes it look like he belongs in the Mariners' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has found his niche,'' Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day Ken Griffey Jr. rediscovered his home run trot and
Shane Monahan homered for the second time this season, the Mariners
hopped aboard the pitching of Spoljaric and relievers Bobby Ayala
and Jose Paniagua to defeat the Chicago White Sox 3-2 Sunday before
35,159 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have won three straight, all by one run after starting
the series 4-20 in one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's 43rd homer of the season _ his second in August _ was
a two-run bullet into the second deck in right field that pulled
Seattle into a 2-2 standoff in the fourth inning. Monahan's blast
to right-center, also off losing pitcher John Snyder, came in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Monahan's homers have won games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking `three' (triple) when I hit it,'' the left
fielder said. ``I don't have the kind of power to know when a ball
is going out. I thought it would hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric said he ``hit the wall'' in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   A reliever most of his professional career, the left-hander
moved into the starting rotation on Aug. 2, three days after the
M's traded Randy Johnson to the Houston Astros. Spoljaric has been
building confidence and stamina ever since. The seven innings he
pitched Sunday in his fourth start represent a personal
long-distance record. He hadn't gone more than five innings in his
previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric said he was ``pretty much done'' after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams went the mound to check on his pitcher, the fans
noticed Ayala warming up in the bullpen. They wanted Spoljaric to
stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to give him a little break and ask how he
felt,'' Williams said. ``I could tell he was getting tired. His
breaking ball was rolling and there wasn't as much zip on his
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   But with two outs and two on, Spoljaric stayed in the game. He
fell behind in the count 2-and-0 to Chad Kreuter before retiring
the Sox catcher and ex-Mariner on a shallow fly ball to Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala pitched a spotless eighth inning, and Paniagua finished up
for his first career save, dodging a two-out walk and wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin, the usual closer, wasn't available because he had
pitched in three straight games, including a two-inning outing
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua's save secured Spoljaric's fourth win, his first as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is really settling down as a starter and throwing the ball
well,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``When we got him (from Toronto
last season), we thought he could be productive as a starter, but
we signed Bill Swift during spring training and we already had
three lefties in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's trade created an opening and Spoljaric moved right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seems more relaxed and has better tempo as a starter
and has been a blessing in disguise,'' Piniella said of Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the plan is to keep Spoljaric in the rotation,
even when Freddy Garcia and Brett Hinchliffe are promoted from
Class AAA Tacoma early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of our five (starters),'' Williams said of Spoljaric,
who says he prefers starting over relieving. ``Even after we make
the (roster additions), we'll basically stay with our regular
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The third game in the four-game series took only 2 hours and 3
minutes to play, the Mariners' fastest game of the season. Each
starter allowed only three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the six were home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero cracked a leadoff homer in the third inning as the
Sox took a 1-0 lead. Chicago then made it 2-0 on the first of two
errors by Mariner third baseman Russ Davis (extending his
club-record to 33), a stolen base, catcher Joe Oliver's throwing
error and a single by Mike Caruso that nearly beaned Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora, extending his hitting streak to nine games, became
the Mariners' first baserunner with a single to right. One out
later, Griffey ended a streak of 32 homerless at-bats with a
no-doubt-about-it blast to right.
</P>
<P>
   Although Griffey has been in a power drought, he still has more
home runs after 128 games this season than he did last season, when
he had 40 on this date en route to a career-high 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see him hit one out, and we need for him to get
hot _ and I don't mean hitting home runs,'' Piniella said. ``We
also need to get David (Segui) going again.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui, the Mariner first baseman, went 0-for-3 and is 8-for-50
since missing four games with an injured right knee.

RANGERS HOLD ON TO BEAT YANKEES, 12-10
</HEADLINE>

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ They're gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now another manager can compare them to the Big Red Machine and
other great teams of the past, and another city of baseball experts
can wax eloquent about their many virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are through in Texas, and the Rangers
watched them go with a glimmer of hope that the best team in the
American League is not totally invincible.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers haven't been able to out-pitch or out-field the
Yankees at all this year, but a 12-10 victory at The Ballpark in
Arlington last night reinforced the notion that on occasion they
can out-hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Barely.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers twice enjoyed six-run leads, and ended up needing
every run they could squeeze out of Yankees starter Orlando
Hernandez and four relievers to salvage one victory in five tries
against New York at home this year. The Yankees hit five home runs,
including two by catcher Jorge Posada, but the Rangers survived
because all five were hit with nobody on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last night (a 12-9 loss), it was very important we got a
win,'' first baseman Will Clark said. ``The reason being, it could
have been very easy for the team to say we've run into some tough
luck. Instead, we got six in the first and continued to put the
pressure on them the entire game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hammered Hernandez for six runs in the first inning
and added five more against relievers Mike Stanton and Ryan Bradley
in the sixth. The big blow was a three-run homer by Rusty Greer off
Bradley right when the Yankees appeared ready to finish off another
morale-crushing comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not invincible, but they are a very good team,''
second baseman Luis Alicea said. ``To beat them, you can't make
mistakes and you have to score a lot of runs because they keep
coming at you. They've got a lot of good hitters and if it's not
one guy, it's another. But tonight, it was a team effort for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely.
</P>
<P>
   The victory allowed the Rangers to remain within 21/2 games of
the Anaheim Angels in the American League West and they finished
7-10 in a 17-game stretch against the Yankees, Red Sox and Indians,
the top three teams in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   They also have hope things could change quickly because now it's
the Angels who must deal with the Yankees in a five-game series
that starts tonight in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in for a very tough drive, but it's still going to be
tough for us because we're a couple of games back,'' shortstop
Royce Clayton said. ``You prefer to be in front, but we've played
some tough teams lately and finished on a high note. We won a very
tough ballgame tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Rick Helling got the victory, his 16th of the
season. But it was never secure until John Wetteland took over in
the ninth and got Bernie Williams, representing the tying run, to
hit into a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we're supposed to do,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``We've had a lot of nip-and-tuck games with these guys
lately. Scoring six runs in the first inning made us feel better,
but you see they don't give up. In the end, they had the tying run
at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez held the Rangers scoreless on two hits through 81/3
innings on Aug. 13 in New York. The difference last night, Oates
said, was ``I thought his command wasn't as sharp as it was in
Yankee Stadium. It seems like in Yankee Stadium, he could throw
that big slow curveball over the plate any time he wanted. And
tonight, our right-handers didn't chase that sidearm slider off the
plate. That was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely.

MILE WINNER, WILD WONDER, MAKES DOUGH FOR OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Wash. _ I'd like to think I had a hand in the outcome of
Sunday's Longacres Mile.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a hand so much as two chubby cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   A horse belonging to the guy who invented the Winchell's Donuts
chain of cholesterol factories won the big race at Emerald Downs.
Given my decades-long investment in his business, the least Verne
Winchell could have done was offer me a small cut of his $110,000
in winnings.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Nothing. Not even a glazed chocolate with sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was good news Sunday, even if the local pony yard's
own hero and defending Mile champ, Kid Katabatic, looked as if he
loaded up a donut shop on his back in the stretch and faded out of
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was Verne Winchell is a vigorous 87 years old. A
near-lifetime of eating his own product hasn't harmed him a bit. On
top of that, he merged Winchell's with the Denny's restaurant chain
in 1967 and ran the company until he retired in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that nutritional neutron bomb, despite all those years
of looking at orange vinyl, he was around to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was the guy who actually did have a little more
influence in the outcome probably has seen the inside of a
Winchell's only in the pages of a National Geographic (Attack upon
American Arteries, July, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Delahoussaye hardly weighs more than a tray of custard
creams, but the weight of his history and experience was too much
for the field to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, we didn't know if we had the best horse in the
race,'' said trainer Greg Gilchrist of his steed, Wild Wonder.
``But I knew we had the best rider.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the longest and best known names in racing, Delahoussaye
is a little past his splendid prime, but the Hall of Fame jockey
can still spot a mark when he sees one. The Mile may be the
Northwest's most prestigious race, but it usually has been an easy
plum for California horses. The big studs ship up for the weekend
for a simple little Grade III action, clobber the locals and are
back home with the whiskey, women and loot before anyone here has
the wits to call for the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a light weekend in his duties at San Diego's Del Mar,
and getting a wink and nudge from Gilchrist and Winchell,
Delahoussaye broke away for what turned out to be a remarkably
simple heist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect trip,'' he said. ``It was fantastic. I don't
have too many more years of riding. I'm glad I have it under my
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   As the jock who won the Kentucky Derby in 1982 (Gato del Sol)
and 1983 (Sunny's Halo), plus two Belmont Stakes, five Breeders'
Cup races and more than $100 million in purses over 5,000 career
victories, the 46-year-old Cajun craftsman was being a bit generous
in glorifying the Mile. The race is not found on the big-time
national radar screen, and even its local luster has diminished in
the Emerald Downs digs, as attested by Sunday's crowd estimate of
11,500 _ almost 10,000 below the race's heyday at the defunct
Longacres.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the way of thoroughbred life almost everywhere. In
fact, the modest improvements this year in Emerald Downs' purses
and fields contrast with many downward arrows nationally. Before
the race, Delahoussaye lamented about his industry's decade-long
turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal tax law changes that discouraged small-time horse
owners as well as the competition with other forms of gambling, he
aired a litany familiar to any veteran of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like the direction it's going,'' he said. ``A lot
of the younger trainers are not really horsemen. They're learning
the business and are more like promoters. They might be car
salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put slot machines at a track and a large percentage (of
patrons) will just sit right there at the slots. What gets them
involved with horses? The slots help the purses but they don't help
fans and create new owners.''
</P>
<P>
   As a man from racing's prime time, Delahoussaye, who has never
broken a bone in racing and had only one injury, in 1982, that
required much recuperation, is discovering more dangerous times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've ridden horses I'd never thought I'd ride again,'' he
said. ``At my stage, I really don't need to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was not a day of risk. There was too much quality between
his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Wonder, who in his last start finished second to the highly
regarded Free House in the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park, was
the betting favorite. Delahoussaye kept him within a length of the
speed horse, Kid Katabatic, through all the turns before blasting
past in a pure flash of genetic superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we could catch that speed horse, nobody else (in
the field) would go up there,'' said Winchell. ``We felt all along
we had an edge in class.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost always in racing, class tells. Even when it's from a
donut peddler.

LATE RALLY NOT ENOUGH AS THE BULLPEN FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Having suffered through the New York Yankees'
game against Texas Sunday night, Manager Joe Torre might choose a
more stable profession. A Wall Street broker, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees plummeted and soared for nine innings until they
finally crashed, 12-10, despite hitting four home runs, including
two by Jorge Posada. The Yankees were unable to overcome the
deficit posted early by Orlando Hernandez (8-4).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took two of three games in this series, and their
overall record is 94-33. They Yankees remain on a pace to win 120
games as they return home to play Anaheim in a five-game series,
including two make-up games from April.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the Yankees fell behind by 6-0, got as close as
6-5, fell behind again by 12-6, and then made another late push.
Derek Jeter, who had 26 hits and 19 runs batted in in 11 games
against the Rangers this season, had a run-scoring double in the
seventh, and Paul O'Neill hit a two-run single, cutting the lead to
12-9.
</P>
<P>
   Posada mashed his second home run in the eighth, cutting the
Rangers lead to 12-10. After a pitching change, Chad Curtis came
within a foot or so of hitting a home run, settling for a double.
But the surge stopped there, and Hernandez was the losing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deficiency on the mound was one thing, but the way we kept
battling back made the whole experience worthwhile,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left Cuba on a makeshift, 17-foot leaking craft, and
he has come a long way since then. Killing time before his start
Sunday night, he flipped through the pages of a yacht catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He had been the Yankees' best pitcher this month, allowing just
14 hits and three runs in 33 innings coming into Sunday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   His aggressiveness and command have been exceptional. Hernandez
struck out 13 batters and gave up two hits against the Rangers Aug.
13. This time around, he pitched to the other extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez seemed to have no idea where he was throwing his
sidearm slider, a pitch that devastated the Rangers 10 days ago.
His fastball repeatedly drifted over the plate, into the hitters'
range. The Rangers' first five hitters to face Hernandez reached
base, only one fewer base runner than Hernandez allowed the Rangers
in his entire eight-and-one-third-inning gem on Aug. 13. He needed
41 pitches to get through the first inning Sunday night, and it was
not until his 35th pitch that a Ranger batter missed at one of his
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have good control of my pitches,'' Hernandez said.
``I believe that's what cost us the game, the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers piled up a 6-0 lead, and it goes without saying that
they were still in jeopardy, facing the majors' highest-scoring
team. Posada hit a home run in the second inning, O'Neill drove in
a couple of runs in the third, and Scott Brosius hit his 16th home
run in the fifth. Suddenly, and without any surprise whatsoever,
the Yankees trailed by a single run.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hernandez stabilized somewhat. Between innings,
he and Posada, his catcher, consulted in the dugout. They managed
to shut out the Rangers through the second, third and fourth
innings. But the toll of the first inning, exacerbated by the
91-degree heat, finished off Hernandez in the fifth inning, when
the Rangers plated their seventh run.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tino Martinez smashed the Yankees' third home run of the night
and his 22nd of the season in the top of the sixth. Torre
demonstrated his resolute belief that his team was going to win
this game by inserting Mike Stanton, his left-handed set-up man, to
relieve in the bottom of the sixth. Hold the Rangers another inning
or two, and the Yankees would be on their way.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanton, who blew a save chance Saturday, walked the leadoff
batter on four pitches and then gave up a single; for the second
consecutive game, Stanton, a veteran of nine seasons, was relieved
by Ryan Bradley, a big-leaguer for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton returned to the bench to watch the Rangers jump on
Bradley for four more hits, including Rusty Greer's three-run
homer. The Rangers' lead soared to six runs.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland, who blew a lead on Saturday, pitched the ninth
inning for Texas and ended the game by getting Bernie Williams to
hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   In five games between the Yankees and Rangers in Texas this
season, the teams combined for 83 runs.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees bolstered their stock of right-handed relievers,
swapping the disappointing former No. 1 draft pick Shea Morenz and
minor-league pitcher Ray Ricken to San Diego for minor-league
pitchers Jim Bruske and Brad Kaufman. Bruske, 33, was General
Manager Brian Cashman's primary objective in the deal. He spent
most of this season in the majors with the Los Angeles Dodgers,
before San Diego traded for him July 23 and optioned him to Class
AAA Las Vegas shortly thereafter. Bruske was 3-0 with a 3.48 earned
run average with the Dodgers and allowed three runs in seven
innings for the Padres. Because of injuries to Jeff Nelson and
Darren Holmes, and because right-handers Marty Janzen and Scott
Brow have pitched poorly for Class AAA Columbus, the Yankees are
somewhat short-handed in right-handed relief. Bruske probably won't
be part of the Yankees' post-season roster, but he'll likely be
recalled for the month of September and used in middle relief.
Others likely to be promoted from Columbus, along with Bruske,
after the rosters expand in September: Catcher Mike Figga,
infielder Mike Lowell, outfielders Shane Spencer and Ricky Ledee,
and pitchers Mike Jerzembeck and Mike Buddie.

BETTER PLAY A MUST, EVEN VS. WEAK FOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It had been a 17-game stretch against the
Godzillas, and when it was over last night, the survivors could be
remembered more by words than deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rusty Greer, who became an advocate for mental health. ``If
we dwell on it,'' he advised, ``we all go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates sounded like an Alka-Seltzer salesman before the
series and regular-season wrapup against the Yankees. ``I left the
park with heartburn (Saturday night), but I woke up feeling fine,''
noted the manager. This, of course, was before last night's acid
cocktail, which at times almost became impossible to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Luis Alicea, meanwhile, juggled mathematical formulas
until he found sunshine among the numbers. ``Considering
everything, the Angels should have been built a bigger (divisional)
lead on us, don't you think?'' wondered Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   Tell you what, Louie, those 2 1/2 games still look rather
sizable.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Rangers out-slugging New York, 12-10, to end the
17-game stretch, some damage control was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won five of seven, the Red Sox four of six and thank
goodness for the Indians, who lost three of four. This was three
weeks that were supposed to define the season for the Rangers. To
do so, however, first you'd have to define the Yankees, who have
played beyond description for an entire season. And certainly
continued to do so against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A media guy comes up to me the other day and wanted to know
how we compare against the 1906 Cubs,'' Don Zimmer, the Yankees'
bench coach, said last night. ``Hell, do I look that old?''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer has spent 50 season in professional baseball, including
39 as a major-league player, manager and coach. He was a rookie on
one of the best teams of all time, the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asked repeatedly about that comparison,'' said Zimmer,
``but the '55 Dodgers had five Hall of Famers. What's there to
compare? I don't know anything about comparisons. I just know this
has been, to date, one heckuva magical season.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone wants to say these Yankees have five future Hall of
Famers, or 25 for that matter, the Rangers won't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   And just because the Yankees left town last night, that doesn't
mean the Rangers are done with baseball's merchants of mass
destruction. Call it the best news of all.
</P>
<P>
   As of this morning, an Arlington chapter of the Bronx Fan Club
will convene at The Ballpark in Arlington. Now it's the Angels'
turn to test the Yankees, and beginning tonight Anaheim will have
to do so under some extreme conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the falling beams that shut down Yankee Stadium in
April? The makeup dates for the Angels start with a doubleheader to
kick off a five-game series in the Bronx. Then it's on to Boston
for three and Cleveland for two. Can Anaheim handle that heat any
better, or worse, than the Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   This is a case of sudden schedule switching _ the Rangers' next
19 games are against sub-.500 teams, starting tonight against
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much emphasis from the fans and the media on the
past 17 games,'' said Greer, whose nuclear home-run blast of 423
feet in the sixth inning last night plated three runs to eventually
break the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone, including the team, came away with
disappointment,'' continued Greer. ``What has to be realized,
however, is there's now another game, another series and another
stretch coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get down to it, this next stretch is much more
important to us than the last stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, the White Sox, the Twins, Kansas City, Tampa Bay _ it's
hardly the glamour of the Yankees, but the pressure is no
different. These are inferior teams, based on records, but it's
like Oates says, ``if you aren't playing well, you don't
consistently beat anyone you're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And above all else, at least be scoring runs. Which,
interestingly enough, the Rangers did well in the seven games
against the Yankees. The one huge advantage for New York is
pitching, but despite being shutout twice, the Rangers scored a
staggering 46 runs in the other five games.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers couldn't outscore was pitching and defensive
misery. If that continues, the next stretch of schedule won't be
any more successful than the last.

BACK-TO-SCHOOL PLANNING JUST GOT EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
With September looming, there are plenty of school-related
financial resources available. Consumer Reports online has a free
back-to-school buying guide at
www.consumerreports.org/news/backtoschool/. It has detailed
information on desktop computers, backpacks, phone cards and even
bed sheets for college dorm rooms.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One section shows how misleading marketing for student-targeted
credit cards can be. Students should avoid cards that encourage
them to maintain a balance in order to earn rebates on future
purchases, the guide says. &UR;  &LR; That's because the value of these
so-called rebates is far less than the finance charges connected
with maintaining an account.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Consumer Affairs has prepared some
tips for college students in a free fact sheet called Successful
Credit Management Takes Planning. The department also has
information on how to select a school, rent an apartment, and
protect your credit identity. All of this information is available
on its Web site at www.dca.ca.gov, or by calling (800) 952-5210 or
(916) 323-7239. The rental guide, called California Tenants, costs
$2.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN &AMP; INVESTING: The average salary of all female workers in
the &UR;  &LR; United States is about 20 percent less than that of men, and
75 percent of women have no idea how much money they'll need for
retirement, according to American Express. AmEx has launched a
program called ``Smart Choices'' that is designed to attract women
investors to its funds. Participation in the wide-ranging program,
which includes financial planning newsletters and a free investing
book, requires a $2,000 investment in one of the company's mutual
funds. But you can get one brochure _ 10 Questions Women Ask About
Investing _ for free by calling (888) 811-2558. You don't have to
be female to get the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVIER DEBT LOAD: On average, Americans have 2 percent less in
liquid assets than they would need to pay off all their debts,
according to the Federal Reserve Board. By comparison, the average
household in 1985 had 52 percent more than it needed to pay off
creditors. The Fed believes that's because the prolonged bull
market has made investing seem more attractive than paying off
credit cards, mortgages and other debts.

FOR BROADCAST.COM, IT'S TIME TO DELIVER TO SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Now comes the hard part for Broadcast.com chief executive Todd
Wagner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not that launching a successful Internet venture from his
business partner's home was a piece of cake, but it is time to
deliver on the lofty expectations of shareholders.  &LR;   &LR; 
Broadcast.com was one of the most successful initial offerings of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which broadcasts live audio and video over the
Internet, went public at $18 on July 17 and traded as high as $74
on its opening day. Friday's close was $55.50.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought the IPO was underpriced, Wagner was
predictably diplomatic. ``We knew there would be strong demand, but
we're happy that the institutions were able to make some money,''
says Wagner, who is a securities lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, did they ever. But Wagner isn't exactly flipping burgers
either. The 38-year-old executive's stock holdings, without
options, are worth more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Internet darlings, investors have rewarded
Dallas-based Broadcast.com for being a ``first-mover'' or category
leader in a particular Internet segment.
</P>
<P>
   The niche in this case was broadcasting live sporting events _
such as Super Bowls and college basketball's NCAA Final Four &UR;  &LR; _
over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for Wagner and his partner, President Mark
Cuban, was Hoosier basketball. The Indiana University graduates are
rabid hoops fans, and they turned to the Internet for play-by-play
radio accounts of Bobby Knight's squad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Wagner is now trying to expand the company's reputation
beyond sports. He wants it to be known as the principal Webcaster
of all types of audio and video programming.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wagner fancies Broadcast.com a ``next-wave
portal,'' making it different from Yahoo or America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a passing-though point (of entry), but a place
where people will stay for a while,'' Wagner explains.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Wagner thinks that Broadcast.com will become most
useful in the corporate world. Already, it's broadcasting speeches,
teleconferences and internal meetings over the Internet and company
intranets.
</P>
<P>
   His company is aggressively going after business-to-business
accounts because corporations are the ones with the hardware right
now that can best download video and audio over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the real meat and potatoes of this is,'' Wagner
says.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Mary Meeker, the doyenne of
Internet stock analysts, pointed out recently in a research note
that corporate-service events broadcast by Broadcast.com have risen
162 percent over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker states that she ``likes this company a lot'' and thinks
that the ``fundamental business outlook is great.'' But she
initiated coverage last week with a ``neutral'' rating based on the
stock's inflated market value of nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Naturally, Broadcast.com doesn't make any money. In its first
financial report since going public, the company posted a net loss
for its second quarter of $3.9 million, which was more than double
the red ink for the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   NAME-BRAND PARTNER
</P>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to Venture Strategy Partners, a fledgling
venture capital firm in San Francisco that specializes in building
brands. One of its partners founded the Republic of Tea and another
worked with Dannon yogurt for years.
</P>
<P>
   What's impressive is that they've brought in a name-brand
partner, Bill Hambrecht, and access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   How did they swing that?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Hambrecht's winery was a client of the firm's
consulting business, and they ``started to collaborate,'' says
Joanna Gallanter, founder and general partner of Venture Strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht, who retired from the investment banking firm that
bears his name earlier this year, helped pioneer the Bay Area's
worldwide reputation as a wellspring of VC dough. He has launched
his own boutique investment firm, W.R. Hambrecht + Co., which could
possibly underwrite and advise Venture Strategy's clients down the
line.

LOOKING FOR A JOB CAN BE A LONG, PAINFUL PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:   I recently applied for a civil service position and was
invited back for a fourth and final interview. The interview
occurred in the morning. The afternoon mail included a letter from
the agency's personnel department telling me that I finished second
in the selection process. This suggests two things to me. One,
there was a lack of communication within the agency. Two, the final
interview was a sham and the decision was made before I even got in
the door. Do I have any recourse?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We all know how traumatic it can be to lose a longtime job.
But _ as this letter to Workways and the next one show _ sometimes
applying for a job can be as confusing or painful as losing one.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably right in blaming this particular mess-up on a
lack of communication. The right hand that was interviewing you
didn't know about the doings of the left hand, which had already
rejected you.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have any grounds for a lawsuit, however.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that you haven't suffered any financial damage.
Another is that the agency never actually made you a job offer _ so
you can't try to claim that it breached a contract.
</P>
<P>
   You're certainly free to write a polite complaint letter to the
head of this agency. That might prod the agency into straightening
out its hiring process in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, maybe you should count your blessings that you didn't
end up working for such a disorganized organization. And keep in
mind that someday you'll find this whole episode funny when you're
safely and happily settled in a job somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I applied for work with a company and went through five
separate interviews, including two with vice presidents. I then
received a verbal job offer from the company, with the
understanding that an official written offer would follow. But
several days later, I got a call from my contact at the firm saying
the offer was rescinded. When I asked why, all I was told was ``an
upper-level manager didn't think your qualifications matched the
job.'' Don't they owe me more of an explanation? I find this
unprofessional and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  This company did treat you rudely and unprofessionally. In
the long run, that will hurt the firm more than it hurts you:
Employers can't afford to alienate good applicants in today's tight
job market.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, you're lucky that you didn't quit your current
job when you got that verbal offer. I've gotten letters from other
folks who received a job offer, quit their current job and then
found themselves without employment or income when the offer was
unexpectedly withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Stansbury, owner of Stansbury Staffing Consultants in
San Francisco, advises applicants never to quit their current job
until they have a written offer firmly in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with saying yes to a verbal offer, but
absolutely don't give notice until you receive that formal offer
letter,'' said Stansbury, president-elect of the Northern
California Human Resources Association.
</P>
<P>
   So how should a well-managed company notify applicants that
they've been accepted or rejected?
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury says that managers should avoid making job offers on
impulse during interviews. ``Go back, discuss it with all the
decisionmakers so you get buy-in, and then make an offer,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Verbal offers are fine, but they should be followed up promptly
by written letters that include the new employee's starting date
and monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to rejecting candidates, companies need to be
equally forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who went through six or seven interviews, and
then found the company simply stopped returning their calls,''
Stansbury said. ``That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to reject a candidate who's been through the
interview process is with a personal phone call, Stansbury said. If
company officials are too busy to phone, they should send a
personal letter that includes the reason for their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should give some reason, such as `The candidate we've
chosen had more qualifications in our industry,' '' she said.
``Candidates in today's market are very, very valuable, and should
be treated graciously and politely.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I have two teenage nephews in Ireland who are interested
in coming to America. Is there any good book I can recommend to
them about jobs and careers in this country?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There's a book called the ``Young Person's Occupational
Outlook Handbook,'' which gives brief descriptions of the 250 most
common jobs in America as well as their educational requirements.
It's based on the Occupational Outlook Handbook compiled every two
years by the U.S. Department of Labor, and is published by JIST
Works. Call (800) 648-5478 to order it, or visit JIST's web site at
www.jist.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially helpful book is ``Finding a Job in the
U.S.,'' by Joan Friedenberg and Curtis Bradley (NTC Publishing
Group).
</P>
<P>
   You might also send your nephews a good general book on choosing
a career. One new one that's lively enough to interest teens as
well as adults is ``Cool Careers for Dummies,'' written by Bay Area
career counselor Marty Nemko and Paul and Sarah Edwards. That's
available from IDG Books Worldwide, at (800) 762-2974 or
www.dummies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, your nephews should use the Internet to find out more
about any career ideas that grab their interest. There are plenty
of Web sites with information about particular jobs or professions
_ and they can be reached just as easily from Ireland as from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ MORE ON FIRING: Last week, I listed several guidebooks for
employers who need to terminate somebody. Here's another good one
that arrived too late for last week's deadline: ``Rightful
Termination: Defensive Strategies for Hiring and Firing in the
Lawsuit-Happy 90's'' by James Walsh. Long and thorough, this book
is available from Merritt Publishing at (800) 638-7597.
</P>
<P>
   Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways,
San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or
send e-mail to workways &LR; sfgate.com. Or call (415) 764-2815. We
can't respond to each query in person, but we will answer as many
in print as we can.

BETTER FEATURES, ACCESS HAS CUSTOMERS BANKING ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER SINTON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Online banking has a growing number of fans but it has yet to
become a favorite indoor pastime.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That could soon change as more financial institutions let
customers bank with ease over the Internet and work out ways for
customers to get their bills as well as pay them online.
</P>
<P>
   Just 3 percent of U.S. households now use their home computers
to transfer money between accounts and pay bills, according to
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. However, this is expected to
jump to 20 percent of households within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving this growth are falling computer prices, better
encryption systems to protect online privacy, more online banking
features and easier access.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, banks have been touting the virtues of
banking online _ checking balances, transferring funds between
accounts and paying bills without the bother of writing a check,
sticking a stamp on the envelope and trotting to the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Online banking was supposed to save both banks and their
customers untold millions of dollars and hours of time. But
economic benefits have been hard to measure.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, home banking was cumbersome. Customers had to
load their computers with special software and dial toll-free
numbers. Often, they were told the service was down.
</P>
<P>
   But things are getting better. About 80 percent of the top 100
banks now offer online banking over the Internet, making it much
easier for consumers to access their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest innovations are happening right here in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is the nation's best Internet bank and Wells
Fargo ranks No. 3, according to Gomez Advisors, which tracks online
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   BofA ranks best in two of five categories: customer confidence
and relationship services (which covers the number of products that
can be accessed online).
</P>
<P>
   In another ranking, &UR;  &LR; SmartMoney magazine in June declared
Citibank, BofA, BankBoston and Wells Fargo the top four cyberbanks.
</P>
<P>
   PC-savvy consumers are particularly keen on online banking. ``I
do pretty much everything online but get cash,'' said Niall McKay,
an Irish journalist who banks with Wells Fargo. ``It beats dealing
with a teller. Since decisions are made by computers anyway, it's
better to deal with the computer itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time consumers like McKay pay a bill online, they
usually have to type in the name, address and phone number of the
payee as well as their account number. The next time the same bill
comes, however, all they have to do is enter the amount and the
date they want the payment sent. If they want to pay the same
amount on the same date each month (for mortgage or cable TV
bills), they can schedule these payments for up to a year with just
one click.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only negative is that they should pay me for using the
service,'' said McKay. ``Like booking cinema tickets over the
phone, it saves time and is cheaper for everyone, so I don't see
why the bank should charge $5 a month (for bill payment services)
unless you have a $5,000 balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fees for those who don't meet minimum balance requirements or
have their paychecks deposited automatically have kept some
potential online customers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, though, not only provide online banking for free,
they offer incentives to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank, for example, is offering $25 cash to new customers who
use its Direct Access Internet banking service to pay at least two
bills by September 30. Citibank is targeting customers in
California because its research shows that 40 percent of the 26
million households that surf the Web live here.
</P>
<P>
   To lure customers, banks are offering more and more services
online, including stock trading and loan applications.
</P>
<P>
   But some researchers doubt that one-stop shopping is what
customers want.
</P>
<P>
   After surveying 126,000 consumers this year, Forrester Research
reports that online consumers have accounts with four different
financial institutions on average, and 84 percent of them are more
interested in going to multiple sites for ``best-of-breed''
services than getting everything with one click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that ``banks increasingly view online banking
as a delivery channel rather than a product that can be sold by
itself,'' said David Weisman, a Forrester Research director.
</P>
<P>
   At Wells Fargo, 470,000 customers _ about 10 percent of the
bank's total _ use online banking and the number is growing about
1,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America's online customer base doubled last year and is
expected to grow another 70 percent this year, according to
Executive Vice President Mike DeVico. The service costs $5.95 per
month for unlimited bill payment but this fee is waived for direct
deposit and many other customers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even more consumers will likely rush online when they are able
to get their bills as well as pay them online. ``The next killer
app will be bill presentment,'' said Wells Executive Vice President
Dudley Nigg.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is one of the banks testing electronic delivery of bills
using technology from Microsoft and First Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A competing joint venture involves Integrion, a collaboration of
banks, IBM and CheckFree that processes about 85 million online
bank payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   Individual companies, including AT&AMP;T, Con Edison and BellSouth,
are testing billing their own customers online. But most consumers
would prefer getting their bills from one Web site rather than
multiple sites.
</P>
<P>
   Complex technical issues have held up broad introduction of
online billing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nigg expects ``meaningful consumer trials'' early next year.
But Forrester's Weisman expects ``it will take until 2001 for bill
presentment to reach critical mass.''

Padres, home field Astros' next targets
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ First, there was a rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was a boom.
</P>
<P>
   A loud boom.
</P>
<P>
   A very loud boom.
</P>
<P>
   It rattled the rivets and shook the rafters. It was a Blue Angel
F-15, buzzing so low overhead at Wrigley Field that the afterburn
could have roasted peanuts. It was so low, you could see the
pilot's rank _ Captain, I think. Blond dude. Looked like Ice Man
from Top Gun.
</P>
<P>
   It was so low, well, we'll let catcher Brad Ausmus take over
from here, because Ausmus did a lot of taking over Sunday anyway:
``A good popup would have knocked that thing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogeys at Clark and Addison.
</P>
<P>
   The sonic boom made the hair on the back of 38,714 necks stand
on end. The same would have happened to Ausmus, who was standing in
the crosshairs at home plate, had he not been drenched in sweat
from playing one whale of a game (4-for-4, five RBIs and a
perfectly called contest against anyone not named Sammy).
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the hell out of me,'' said Ausmus, who ducked out of
the box when the plane screamed by. ``It came out of nowhere.
Luckily, the umpire jumped back, too, because the pitch was right
down the middle. It was loud.''
</P>
<P>
   And on this day, when another Cubs-Astros battle was supposed to
happen but instead the Gulf War broke out, it was so symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom of order top-notch
</P>
<P>
   Choose your favorite metaphor: Turning on the jets. Dropping a
bomb. Blue Chicago. Speeding to victory. F-15 vs. Piper Cubs. Angel
of Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you say it, it was Astros 13, the Republican Guard 3.
</P>
<P>
   Death to the tyrants from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This National League Central war the Astros have been fighting
is over. Switch back to regular programming. The Astros have a
9{-game lead on the Cubs with 31 games remaining. France has
surrendered its flag on less.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing you should count on between now and late
September, it's the Astros not surrendering their division flag for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable, but I don't feel overconfident,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said about the division race.
</P>
<P>
   He should feel gallant, maybe even noble.
</P>
<P>
   This was a three-game set the Cubs had hoped to use as a
springboard to get back into the division race. The Cubs were
hoping to somehow survive a thin pitching staff, a constant strong
wind blowing toward left field, and an Astros team that does
nothing if not cover its flanks.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sunday. The meat of the Astros lineup again only nibbled at
the scorecard, Derek Bell finishing 0-for-4 and Jeff Bagwell merely
tapping an infield hit on the way to a 1-for-5 day.
</P>
<P>
   But on the flanks _ Craig Biggio at the top of the card and the
six-through-nine guys at the bottom _ the Astros swarmed Chicago
into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio hit a pair of three-run homers, a feat that certainly
deserves more than one sentence. But today it's just not possible,
because look here:
</P>
<P>
   With Ausmus also hitting a three-run homer, the Nos. 6-9 guys
grunted their way to a marvelous day that included reaching base 12
times in 15 official at-bats, with nine runs, seven RBIs and
general havoc wreaked on every hurler the Cubs tried.
</P>
<P>
   Lima brave, victorious
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Astros pitcher Jose Lima, who in stifling heat
tossed a lot of great pitches over eight innings and, ever the
crowd-pleaser, managed two fat ones to Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who
stayed in the race to catch Roger Maris with his 50th and 51st
homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a chicken. I'm going to pitch to Sammy Sosa,'' Lima
said. ``If he hits a home run, so what? Big deal. We are here to
get the `W,' and we got it. I heard the Cubs couldn't wait for us
to come in here. But we are here, and now we've got two big wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the NL Central battle is over. It's time for the Astros to
shift their focus to the Western Front, specifically San Diego,
where the Padres suddenly are looking catchable in the race to a
home-field edge in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have earned the head-to-head tie-breaking edge on the
Padres this season. And when Dierker looked at the standings after
Sunday's effort, that was not a misprint he saw. The Astros are but
two games behind San Diego in the win column.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more game in this Chicago series today, but the
reason the Astros want to win it has changed. The next rumble you
hear could be the Padres going boom, much like the Cubs have.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we have to do to get where we want to go
this year is beat good teams on the road,'' Dierker said. ``This
will be a good series for us. We can begin to focus a little more
on (the Padres).''
</P>
<P>
   Cover your flanks, San Diego.

Drexler quickly puts stamp on program

Wave of interest engulfs UH basketball
</P>
<P>
   By JERRY WIZIG &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the question _ Can Clyde Drexler coach basketball?
_ must wait for at least several more months. But some things have
become obvious before Drexler assumes his new seat on the
University of Houston bench for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The man can sell tickets, spark enthusiasm for a program and
attract the interest of talented prospective recruits, all within
the space of about four months.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler will take his time filling the wall space in his new
office at UH's Athletics/Alumni Center. He also will fend off
remarks like the one voiced recently by one of his fellow UH
coaches in another sport, ``At least I'm not the best player on my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's response: ``That is not an option. I'm not putting on
a uniform again. My playing days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was any doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in this blissful honeymoon, UH athletic director Chet
Gladchuk places Drexler's economic impact at nearly $1.5 million at
the ticket window, based on the sale of nearly 5,000 season tickets
(at $150 each), more than 250 VIP floor seats ($1,000 a pop), and
20 luxury boxes ($15,000 per season for a three-year lease) being
built on the concourse level.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that,'' Gladchuk said smiling, ``is before Clyde has even
coached a game.''
</P>
<P>
   That will occur the night of Nov. 17, when the Cougars host
Texas and its new coach, Rick Barnes, in an opener to be televised
by ESPN2. Later, there are non-conference dates at Rice (Nov. 21)
and North Carolina State (Dec. 12), the team that stunned Drexler
and his Phi Slama Jama teammates at UH in the 1983 NCAA final. The
Cougars also return to the site of that disappointment, playing in
The Pit for the University of New Mexico's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Ten scholarship players return from last season's UH team, which
was the first in school history to lose 20 games and averaged about
2,800 in home attendance. The two incoming recruits are 6-5
freshman Moses Malone Jr., signed by previous coach Alvin Brooks,
and 6-2 George Gervin Jr. from San Jacinto College. A third
recruit, 6-7 Cedric Taylor of Waltrip, may qualify to enter school
in the spring semester of his sophomore year after playing at a
junior college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play up-tempo and trapping, pressing
basketball,'' Drexler said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is this team can only do that if a short lineup is
able to rebound. The tallest returnees are 6-9 Kenny Younger, 6-8
Early Smith and 6-8 William Stringfellow.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Drexler says there is more to his early days in office
than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between evaluating prospects (during the July recruiting
process) and putting in a game plan for the program, those are just
part of the job of coaching a Division I program and running a
staff,'' he said. ``There's the media, alumni and school functions;
the list goes on. But it's been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   On a shelf behind Drexler's desk is a thick NCAA manual of rules
and regulations. Next to that is a biography of Abraham Lincoln.
There also is a team picture of the Rockets, a framed photo of
Drexler and Guy V. Lewis, his coach at UH, and another of former
teammate Hakeem Olajuwon. On a table is a crystal plaque
commemorating Drexler's becoming the third player in NBA history
(with Oscar Robertson and John Havlicek) to compile 20,000 points,
6,000 rebounds and 6,000 assists. On his desk is a picture of his
wife, Gaynell, with their children, Erika, Austin, Adam and Elise.
</P>
<P>
   During the transition between Drexler's 15th and final NBA
season and his full-time arrival on campus, assistants Reid Gettys
and George Walker fielded the brunt of the phone calls and
paperwork. Later, Reid Martinka (from Vanderbilt) was hired as the
third assistant coach, and Byron Smith, a former Cougar player and
UH graduate, was named coordinator of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible,'' Gettys said of those weeks, which
included a large number of blinking lights from callers on hold,
office visitors and guests just wanting a word with the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those calls were inquiries from at least 10 players
interested in transferring from other Division I schools to play
for Drexler and UH. Four were from players (or their families) at
one Big 12 school.
</P>
<P>
   Gettys, who gave up his career as an attorney, and Walker, the
head coach and assistant athletic director at South Florida
Community College when hired by Drexler, also spent a lot of time
dealing with calls and visits from prospective walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds. Zillions,'' Gettys said.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's name recognition, what Gettys calls ``the C.D.
factor,'' afforded Drexler, and UH, easy access to prospects,
within NCAA guidelines, at summer camps and leagues. The most
notable result thus far is a verbal commitment from 6-5 point guard
Antonio Falu of Waltrip, a senior considered one of the nation's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Verbal commitments are non-binding until the NCAA's November
signing period. Meanwhile, Falu, who spent part of the summer
playing against former Rocket Sam Cassell and Denver's Anthony
Goldwire, will receive several hand-written letters a week from the
Cougars _ and probably dozens of other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Another early positive is the addition of guard Bernard Smith of
Conroe, a sophomore transfer from Texas who must sit out this year
and then retains three seasons of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Talents such as Malone, Gervin, Smith, Taylor and Falu, combined
with returnees Chad Hendrick, Trey Austin and Charles Fordjour,
figure to provide a solid foundation on which to rebuild a program
that reached lofty heights in Drexler's playing days.
</P>
<P>
   In his UH career, Drexler played on the first two of the
Cougars' three consecutive Final Four teams (1982-83-84), passing
up his senior season to start his NBA career. Near its end he was
selected as one of the top 50 players in NBA history. Now, he has a
five-year contract with an annual base salary of $150,000, with
incentives and outside income sources that could bring the amount
to $300,000 per year. He also has endorsement and
personal-appearance agreements with Denny's, Sprite, Enron and a
local car dealer.
</P>
<P>
   With all that to Drexler's credit, it might be well for
collegians or high school seniors to heed his advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would advise every high school senior to spend at least two
years in college,'' Drexler said. ``In high school, every hour of
your time is planned out for you. When you get to college, you have
to learn how to use your time between academics, basketball and
your social life, and that takes a lot of maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Drexler's first decisions as UH coach was to ask Lewis to
return on a volunteer basis. One day last week, Lewis, 76, was back
on the Hofheinz Pavilion floor with Drexler and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm and good feeling that Clyde has brought back to
the program is unbelievable,'' Lewis said. ``His personal
popularity says a lot about how people feel about him. I've been to
functions with him where they have stood in line for hours to get
his autograph. I tell Clyde that I'm for him 100 percent. Just
don't expect me to sit on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   As a volunteer, Lewis can't get on the floor at practice. But he
can watch and make suggestions to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be sitting right where I have since I retired _ on the
front row in the stands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Drexler's coaching ability, Lewis has no doubt it will
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde knows about running the floor, passing and rebounding,''
Lewis said. ``He's going to be a great communicator with his
players because they all will know the kind of player he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have players; we all know that. I have no
hesitation in saying that Clyde is going to make a great coach,
because he is going to recruit great players. I tell everybody that
is going to take time, but that doesn't mean this is going to be
just a throw-away year.''

<P>
   With contagious enthusiasm, new coach looks to get Arkansas on
winning track
</P>
<P>
   By BILL SULLIVAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   They suggested he go directly to the fans to try to drum up
support for the next day's game, which generally wasn't the talk of
the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them when to come,'' Houston Nutt said. ``Say, seven
o'clock?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, midnight actually would be more like it, he was told.
The crowd would be its largest by then, and if you were going for
numbers
</P>
<P>
   This explains why a young head coach found himself on the roof
of a fraternity house, touting Murray State football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one big party, and I had to make sure they were all
there,'' Nutt said with a smile. ``I didn't realize I'd have to
crawl out on the roof with a bullhorn, but it was the greatest
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, we had a record number students.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Nutt finds himself in a different sort of sales job.
Returning to his home state, where he remains one of the most
celebrated high school players in history, the 40-year-old Little
Rock native tries to breathe life into an Arkansas football program
reeling from consecutive 4-7 seasons under the gone-and-unlamented
Danny Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win everywhere you go,'' said Nutt, who spent five
years at Murray State and Boise State before getting the call from
Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles last December. ``But this
is a little more special because it's home.''
</P>
<P>
   And because it's home, Houston Nutt needs no introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Out of high school, he was one of the last players recruited by
Broyles before the coach resigned at the end of the 1976 season.
Nutt played two years in Fayetteville, but his skill as a drop-back
passer didn't fit with new coach Lou Holtz's preference for the
option and a mobile quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Nutt was part of the Orange Bowl team that shocked heavily
favored Oklahoma. He also played on the Razorbacks basketball team
with the fabled ``Triplets,'' Sidney Moncrief, Ron Brewer and
Marvin Delph.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough. Nutt wanted to play football and soon realized
he wouldn't be doing much of it for Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' he said. ``(Holtz) would get off the bus in
Little Rock, and the first thing he'd hear was, `Are you gonna play
Nutt today?'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard all around. We were running the veer that year,
and I was one of the slowest quarterbacks in America.''
</P>
<P>
   So Nutt left for Oklahoma State, where he played two years,
again doubling in basketball. After spending two more seasons as a
graduate assistant in Stillwater, he was invited to come back as a
graduate assistant under Holtz at Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always appreciated him doing that for me,'' Nutt said.
``When a guy leaves, sometimes there are hard feelings, and you
can't come back. Coach Holtz was great about all that.''
</P>
<P>
   After working assistant jobs at Arkansas State and Oklahoma
State, Nutt returned again to be part of Arkansas staffs from
1990-92. By then, at a career crossroads, he approached Broyles for
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Broyles told him to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   Any job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to either be a coordinator or a head coach,'' Nutt
said. ``One of the best decisions I made was to take the Murray
State job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about night and day. All those years being with Barry
Sanders and Thurman Thomas and all those good players couldn't add
up to one week where you're in charge of the budget, the coaches,
the family and their lives. Every single decision comes across your
desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank those two little bitty schools for giving a little
bitty assistant a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nutt gets the chance he really wanted at a school where the
only thing itty bitty lately has been the number under the ``W''
each fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '90s have been tough,'' he said. ``It hasn't been much
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   To help create interest, Nutt crisscrossed the state, doing as
many speaking engagements as possible. By late July, the number of
dates had approached 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were Razorback Clubs all over the state,'' he
said. ``But it seems like there's always one more.''
</P>
<P>
   The name _ and Nutt's enthusiasm _ struck a nerve. In July,
season-ticket sales had exceeded last year's total by more than
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically stolen the hearts of everyone in Arkansas,''
senior defensive tackle Ryan Hall said. ``I'm running into people
who are saying, `We've got our season tickets. We're ready to
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Players seem to have responded to the call, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' Nutt said. ``Every program I'd
taken over, it seemed like there were 14 or 15 guys who didn't want
to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutt set the tone early, holding ``Dirty Dozen'' workouts in
January, putting his team through 12 demanding conditioning
sessions that began at 6 a.m. This summer, 73 players stayed around
to get ready for the season, as opposed to 22 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everyone's excited about going to practice,'' flanker
Anthony Lucas said. ``It seemed like the love for the game had
dropped for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If the love affair continues, it might be something of a happy
accident. Mississippi coach Tommy Tuberville was the early
front-runner for the job, but Tuberville eventually pulled out of
the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Arkansas, I figured I'd be a fool if I didn't
listen,'' Tuberville said. ``But they hired an excellent guy in
Houston Nutt. It was fun talking to them, but we both ended up
where we needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nutt felt snubbed by the perception that he was a second
choice, he keeps it to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that I'm here today to represent the
University of Arkansas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nutt realizes he'll need results to keep the good vibes going.
Turnovers (32) were a problem in 1997, and the Razorbacks, who lost
six of their last seven games, averaged a dismal 56.5 yards per
game rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, the fires are still smoldering in the Ozarks,
even if they haven't been stoked for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a little boy growing up, you know the fans are special,''
Nutt said. ``But I never dreamed they'd be this special, where
they'd buy 6,000 more season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it a honeymoon, whatever. I feel an awesome
responsibility to the fans who are going out on a limb, not waiting
to see what this guy can do.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you might be on a different sort of limb, but at least
you don't have to crawl out on any rooftops to get attention.

MADDUX ON ROPES, BUT BRAVES SURVIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Greg Maddux, it was the worst game of his career.
For Carlos Perez, it was business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddux was the winning pitcher Sunday in the Atlanta Braves'
12-7 victory over the Dodgers despite getting shelled for
back-to-back homers and three overall. He had never done that
before.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's fifth start since joining the Dodgers after a July 31
trade from Montreal was another beating that is starting to worry
the club. He was brought in to stabilize a starting rotation that
has been rocked by injury and ineffectiveness but has been more of
a problem than the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he allow nine hits and eight earned runs in less
than four innings, he seemed bent on throwing fastballs to fastball
hitters instead of the well-placed changeups that made him so
attractive less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the control,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said
after Perez (7-13) walked four. ``And it's not just the walks, it's
the location of the pitches. They just haven't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Dodger he has 16 walks in 281/3 innings pitched with a 6.35
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman wouldn't speculate on what will happen when Ismael
Valdes returns to the starting rotation in a week or so. Valdes
injured his right index finger Saturday and during a rehab start in
Florida and won't be back Thursday as the club had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got time to think about that,'' Hoffman said. ``I still
have to think about this game. Once I get back to the hotel, I'll
think about tomorrow's game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to consider. On a night they could have picked up
a game in their fading wild-card hopes, the Dodgers hit three
homers and lost. Two were hit by Eric Karros, who also had a double
off Maddux. The 10 total bases by Karros is believed to be the most
by one player off Maddux in the career of the four-time Cy Young
Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   It also was just the second time Maddux had allowed seven earned
runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would rather have gone 0 for 4 and won,'' said Karros,
who entered the game 2 for 27 lifetime against Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers trail the Mets with just 32 games left and face
16-game winner Tom Glavine today in the season finale with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are still having this conversation in a week,'' everyone
will know our situation,'' Karros said. ``Every game makes it
tougher. It will be more improbable, but still not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who pitched seven scoreless innings against the Dodgers
in a May 6 victory here, clearly was the not the same pitcher who
has dominated the National League the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was spotted a 4-0 lead after one inning on a pair of two-run
homers by Andres Galarragea and Eddie Perez off Perez (7-13).
</P>
<P>
   But the first batter Maddux faced in the second inning, Gary
Sheffield, hit the first pitch into the left-field stands for his a
21st homer.
</P>
<P>
   Karros was next and hit a rare drive to right that landed
several rows back in the bleachers. It cut Maddux's lead to 4-3,
and though the Braves added a run in the second, it hardly was the
end of his trouble with Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi opened the third with a single to left and
Sheffield walked. It was Maddux's second of the game, which was a
tip things weren't right. He entered the game with 29 walks in 27
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Then Karros hit his 17th homer. His five RBI give him 71 for the
season and an outside chance to reach 100 for the fourth
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, the Braves had routed Perez, who was gone
after allowing three more runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Perez walked Maddux to open the inning. Or
that he was hurt when Mark Grudzielanek bobbled Gerald Williams
grounder for hit and Bobby Bonilla misplayed Chipper Jones grounder
for an error.
</P>
<P>
   But Galarraga did the real damage with RBI single that chased
Perez. His replacement rookie right-hander Sean Maloney immediately
gave up an RBI single to right, but struck out Perez and retired
Danny Bautista to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista got back at the Dodgers in the sixth when he doubled
home Chipper Jones against Antonio Osuna to give the Braves their
11th run. Jones singled home Williams, who opened the inning with a
triple to the gap in right-center.

M'S WIN AGAIN; ONE-RUN SPREE AT THREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Every time Paul Spoljaric makes another start, he
makes it look like he belongs in the Mariners' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has found his niche,'' Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day Ken Griffey Jr. rediscovered his home run trot and
Shane Monahan homered for the second time this season, the Mariners
hopped aboard the pitching of Spoljaric and relievers Bobby Ayala
and Jose Paniagua to defeat the Chicago White Sox 3-2 Sunday before
35,159 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have won three straight, all by one run after starting
the series 4-20 in one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's 43rd homer of the season _ his second in August _ was
a two-run bullet into the second deck in right field that pulled
Seattle into a 2-2 standoff in the fourth inning. Monahan's blast
to right-center, also off losing pitcher John Snyder, came in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Monahan's homers have won games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking `three' (triple) when I hit it,'' the left
fielder said. ``I don't have the kind of power to know when a ball
is going out. I thought it would hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric said he ``hit the wall'' in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   A reliever most of his professional career, the left-hander
moved into the starting rotation on Aug. 2, three days after the
M's traded Randy Johnson to the Houston Astros. Spoljaric has been
building confidence and stamina ever since. The seven innings he
pitched Sunday in his fourth start represent a personal
long-distance record. He hadn't gone more than five innings in his
previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric said he was ``pretty much done'' after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams went the mound to check on his pitcher, the fans
noticed Ayala warming up in the bullpen. They wanted Spoljaric to
stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to give him a little break and ask how he
felt,'' Williams said. ``I could tell he was getting tired. His
breaking ball was rolling and there wasn't as much zip on his
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   But with two outs and two on, Spoljaric stayed in the game. He
fell behind in the count 2-and-0 to Chad Kreuter before retiring
the Sox catcher and ex-Mariner on a shallow fly ball to Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala pitched a spotless eighth inning, and Paniagua finished up
for his first career save, dodging a two-out walk and wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin, the usual closer, wasn't available because he had
pitched in three straight games, including a two-inning outing
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua's save secured Spoljaric's fourth win, his first as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is really settling down as a starter and throwing the ball
well,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``When we got him (from Toronto
last season), we thought he could be productive as a starter, but
we signed Bill Swift during spring training and we already had
three lefties in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's trade created an opening and Spoljaric moved right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seems more relaxed and has better tempo as a starter
and has been a blessing in disguise,'' Piniella said of Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the plan is to keep Spoljaric in the rotation,
even when Freddy Garcia and Brett Hinchliffe are promoted from
Class AAA Tacoma early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of our five (starters),'' Williams said of Spoljaric,
who says he prefers starting over relieving. ``Even after we make
the (roster additions), we'll basically stay with our regular
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The third game in the four-game series took only 2 hours and 3
minutes to play, the Mariners' fastest game of the season. Each
starter allowed only three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the six were home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero cracked a leadoff homer in the third inning as the
Sox took a 1-0 lead. Chicago then made it 2-0 on the first of two
errors by Mariner third baseman Russ Davis (extending his
club-record to 33), a stolen base, catcher Joe Oliver's throwing
error and a single by Mike Caruso that nearly beaned Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora, extending his hitting streak to nine games, became
the Mariners' first baserunner with a single to right. One out
later, Griffey ended a streak of 32 homerless at-bats with a
no-doubt-about-it blast to right.
</P>
<P>
   Although Griffey has been in a power drought, he still has more
home runs after 128 games this season than he did last season, when
he had 40 on this date en route to a career-high 56.

MOON IMPRESSIVE AFTER PRESEASON WAKEUP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ He had called the plays, taken the snaps, made
the handoffs and thrown those laser-beam passes it seems only he
can throw.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one thing Warren Moon had not experienced since
ending his 25-day holdout and resuming control of the Seahawks'
offense: Contact.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, the second play of Saturday night's preseason
game against the Arizona Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium. After
dumping a pass to running back Ricky Watters, Moon was leveled by
the Cardinals' Simeon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was penalized 15 yards for roughing the passer, but Moon
felt like thanking the 260-pound defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got introduced to the preseason right away,'' Moon said.
``That's what you need to let you know the season is here. I got
knocked on the ground and that kind of wakes you up and says,
`Let's get going.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moon got off his rear and pushed the offense into high gear.
Before calling it a night, he completed 8 of 15 passes for 202
yards, including touchdown passes of 69 yards to Joey Galloway and
55 yards to James McKnight. All in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first game action since the team's season finale
against the San Francisco 49ers last Dec. 21. He made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's easy, but it's natural for me,'' Moon
said. ``I just look at it as being natural. Those practices this
week really helped me as far as getting my sharpness back and
seeing things that you need to see. When you recognize the things
you need to see, then your natural ability is going to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon was a few phases shy of perfect and was the first to admit
it. He had two passes go off the hands of Cardinals defenders and
another go off the chest of McKnight that was intercepted, and he
could have had two more TD passes by making the proper reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make those and that means there's some room for
improvement,'' Moon said. ``Overall, I thought my performance was
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering that he was playing after practicing just six
times last week, the effort against the Cardinals was a giant step
in the right direction for Moon and the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren executed extremely well,'' coach Dennis Erickson said
Sunday after reviewing video of the 31-24 victory. ``He made a
couple of mistakes. ... Other than that, he played pretty
flawlessly, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest completion to a wide receiver in the first three
games was a 25-yarder to Mike Pritchard, and the longest pass play
was a 30-yarder to Watters that was more run-after-the-catch than
pass. Saturday night, Moon went to Pritchard for 26 yards on his
first completion and then had the bombs to McKnight and Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Moon passed for 202 yards on just eight completions against a
Cardinals defense that, while not exactly the 49ers, had held its
first two opponents to an average of 163.5 yards passing for the
entire game while allowing only one TD pass. Moon completed five of
his first eight passes for 104 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what was going to happen,'' offensive
coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``To step right in and play after
a week of practice is not easy. There were some plays we ran that
Warren hadn't even practiced this week. To his credit, he just let
it rip.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's final tuneup for the Sept. 6 regular-season opener in
Philadelphia will come Friday night against the 49ers at the
Kingdome. How much Moon and the No. 1 offense will play has yet to
be determined, but it probably won't be more than three or four
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren and I will talk (today). We just need to get a feel for
what he thinks he needs,'' Erickson said. ``Obviously I wouldn't
play him unless the whole first unit was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon got plenty of help from his friends against the Cardinals.
The offensive linemen not only protected him well _ especially
tackles Walter Jones and Howard Ballard against the Cardinals' Rice
and Eric Swann _ they also got Watters untracked early to help set
up the deep throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last touchdown was a play-action pass, and the way we were
running the ball they had to respect the run,'' guard Pete Kendall
said. ``Those long touchdowns are nice. They count for seven on the
scoreboard, but it doesn't take as much out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's best throw was one even his teammates didn't think he
could make _ the 69-yard post pattern to Galloway, who beat
cornerback J.J. McCleskey and then used an explosive burst to blow
past free safety Kwamie Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Joey take off and I thought, `Oh, man. Joey's just
outrun another quarterback,''' Kendall said. ``There aren't many in
the league who can get him that ball, but Warren did. He hit Joey
in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   It just goes to show that Moon _ even at 41, especially at 41 _
is not just another quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pass was Exhibit 9,000, right there,'' Kendall said.

MILE WINNER, WILD WONDER, MAKES DOUGH FOR OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Wash. _ I'd like to think I had a hand in the outcome of
Sunday's Longacres Mile.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a hand so much as two chubby cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   A horse belonging to the guy who invented the Winchell's Donuts
chain of cholesterol factories won the big race at Emerald Downs.
Given my decades-long investment in his business, the least Verne
Winchell could have done was offer me a small cut of his $110,000
in winnings.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Nothing. Not even a glazed chocolate with sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was good news Sunday, even if the local pony yard's
own hero and defending Mile champ, Kid Katabatic, looked as if he
loaded up a donut shop on his back in the stretch and faded out of
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was Verne Winchell is a vigorous 87 years old. A
near-lifetime of eating his own product hasn't harmed him a bit. On
top of that, he merged Winchell's with the Denny's restaurant chain
in 1967 and ran the company until he retired in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that nutritional neutron bomb, despite all those years
of looking at orange vinyl, he was around to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was the guy who actually did have a little more
influence in the outcome probably has seen the inside of a
Winchell's only in the pages of a National Geographic (Attack upon
American Arteries, July, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Delahoussaye hardly weighs more than a tray of custard
creams, but the weight of his history and experience was too much
for the field to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, we didn't know if we had the best horse in the
race,'' said trainer Greg Gilchrist of his steed, Wild Wonder.
``But I knew we had the best rider.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the longest and best known names in racing, Delahoussaye
is a little past his splendid prime, but the Hall of Fame jockey
can still spot a mark when he sees one. The Mile may be the
Northwest's most prestigious race, but it usually has been an easy
plum for California horses. The big studs ship up for the weekend
for a simple little Grade III action, clobber the locals and are
back home with the whiskey, women and loot before anyone here has
the wits to call for the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a light weekend in his duties at San Diego's Del Mar,
and getting a wink and nudge from Gilchrist and Winchell,
Delahoussaye broke away for what turned out to be a remarkably
simple heist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect trip,'' he said. ``It was fantastic. I don't
have too many more years of riding. I'm glad I have it under my
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   As the jock who won the Kentucky Derby in 1982 (Gato del Sol)
and 1983 (Sunny's Halo), plus two Belmont Stakes, five Breeders'
Cup races and more than $100 million in purses over 5,000 career
victories, the 46-year-old Cajun craftsman was being a bit generous
in glorifying the Mile. The race is not found on the big-time
national radar screen, and even its local luster has diminished in
the Emerald Downs digs, as attested by Sunday's crowd estimate of
11,500 _ almost 10,000 below the race's heyday at the defunct
Longacres.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the way of thoroughbred life almost everywhere. In
fact, the modest improvements this year in Emerald Downs' purses
and fields contrast with many downward arrows nationally. Before
the race, Delahoussaye lamented about his industry's decade-long
turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal tax law changes that discouraged small-time horse
owners as well as the competition with other forms of gambling, he
aired a litany familiar to any veteran of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like the direction it's going,'' he said. ``A lot
of the younger trainers are not really horsemen. They're learning
the business and are more like promoters. They might be car
salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put slot machines at a track and a large percentage (of
patrons) will just sit right there at the slots. What gets them
involved with horses? The slots help the purses but they don't help
fans and create new owners.''
</P>
<P>
   As a man from racing's prime time, Delahoussaye, who has never
broken a bone in racing and had only one injury, in 1982, that
required much recuperation, is discovering more dangerous times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've ridden horses I'd never thought I'd ride again,'' he
said. ``At my stage, I really don't need to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was not a day of risk. There was too much quality between
his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Wonder, who in his last start finished second to the highly
regarded Free House in the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park, was
the betting favorite. Delahoussaye kept him within a length of the
speed horse, Kid Katabatic, through all the turns before blasting
past in a pure flash of genetic superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we could catch that speed horse, nobody else (in
the field) would go up there,'' said Winchell. ``We felt all along
we had an edge in class.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost always in racing, class tells. Even when it's from a
donut peddler.

ANESTHETIZED BY THE STEADY, THE SUAVE AND THE PERKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I firmly believe that the Internet expands our curiosities and
capacities for written language. That's the fun of it all: the
linguistic roles and disguises to be taken on, the words to be
coined, the strategies to be used according to site and
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   But pity the human voice, for its range diminishes every day.
And don't blame computers; this has been going on for decades. So
much of our media define authority as vocal conformity and ignore
shifts in the culture's needs; much of the media industry still
depends on vocal styles that have been stripped of emotional
content, and much of it presumes that the only way to reach the
widest audience is to give us vocal stereotypes that hit our brains
and feelings like stun guns.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to television broadcasters as they apply a
half-century-old bag of vocal tricks to international bombings,
sexual trysts and human interest stories. The men must have voices
that are stern and deep; no tenors here, everyone is or pretends to
be a take-it-on-the-chin baritone. And those voices must issue
forth from mouths that barely move: a firm jaw means a firm hold on
the facts, even when those facts are actually opinions or leading
questions. Sam Donaldson bites off his words to convey scrappy
tenacity. Dan Rather spaces his firmly and evenly: there is steel
beneath that steadiness. And Ted Koppel uses the most vibrato and
the most stately pacing of the three, a style meant to suggest that
he is the most statesmanlike of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to follow the same guidelines if they are local
reporters or national correspondents. But if they are stars like
Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer or Katie Couric, they occupy a
feminized space where the interviewer-commentator is also a
hostess, a gracious facilitator determined to make us comfortable
with everything from hard news to celebrity musings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's square our shoulders and toughen up, the male voices
signal, however minor the story. I know it's upsetting, but we'll
be all right, the women's voices signal, however major the story.
Ms. Walters pioneered this style with her suave, solicitous tones
and ``womanly'' vibrato (replaced by girlish hesitancy when she
asks an intimate or trivial question). Ms. Sawyer has perfected a
crafty mass-market version of that ancient court ideal, the voice
that is ``ever soft,/Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.''
And Ms. Couric is the perky cheerleader and Pep Club president who
many parents must still want their daughters to be.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream television entertainment rarely goes after dramatic,
comedic or vocal richness. Shows give us fixed settings, situations
and characters who are supposed to become as familiar to us as our
friends and families. Good television actors have (or use) just
enough range to produce a highly artificial version of naturalistic
speech. We grow attached to their unchanging conversational tics
and timbres. But what's most naturalistic is that they use more
craft to show no more range or depth than most of us have.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the best television dramas give actors more emotional
and vocal chances than they used to. Compare monotoned Ben Casey
and mellifluous Dr. Kildare with the doctors on ``ER.'' And the
best actors play much more interestingly. Listen to Andre Braugher
on reruns of ``Homicide,'' the texture of his voice and the diction
shifts. Listen to the cast of ``The Practice,'' with their clash of
pitches, accents and pacing. (Camryn Manheim, Steve Harris and
Dylan McDermott give me particular pleasure.)
</P>
<P>
   Television comedies just keep deteriorating. Except for
dizzyingly uneven late-night variety shows like ``Saturday Night
Live,'' most are vocally and to my mind comically stupefying. Tim
Allen and Kirstie Alley versus Drew Carey and Fran Drescher? What
are we talking about _ gamuts of A to B versus A to C?
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of justified talk about the cynically bad
level of black sitcoms. But compare them with the average white
ones, and the difference comes down to one of careless rather than
careful cynicism. The first kind is based on contempt; the second
on knowing smugness. Speechwise, it is the difference between
ebonic trash and standardized tripe.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment that was never intended to be good is infuriating.
But entertainment that once was and is no more is unspeakably
depressing, too. When I turn on the radio and listen to what passes
for soul music now, I'm astonished. Compared with its predecessors,
your average hit today sounds about as soulful as Pat Boone or Gogi
Grant sounded compared with Little Richard and LaVern Baker. Listen
to Sam Cooke or Marvin Gaye, then to Luther Vandross or Babyface.
Listen to the young Aretha Franklin versus Whitney Houston or
Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Where did this glut of melisma come from _ sometimes murky and
dank, sometimes high-pitched and preening? What do these bogus
little moans and cries signify in terms of feeling? Diana Ross had
a limited voice, but it had its own sassy little sound, and she
could phrase with charm. Janet Jackson's voice is a tiny cipher
that could be filled with Monica's voice or Brandy's voice, or that
of many other one-name, one-note singers. (The note? High, breathy
and coy.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They say people get the rulers they deserve, and we could say
the same for journalists and entertainers. But how dreary to have
our sense of reality and possibility, not to mention pleasure, so
censored and constricted. I have been reading a wonderful book
called ``Freeing Shakespeare's Voice,'' by the voice teacher, actor
and director Kristin Linklater. It is meant to help guide actors
through the linguistic and emotional extremities of Shakespeare,
but it can be read by anyone who loves and therefore admits no
impediment to the marriage of voice, speech and song.
</P>
<P>
   How did speech begin, Ms. Linklater asks? Might it have been as
open-throated grunts and groans that dealt with life and death? She
writes: ``The quantum leap (or crawl) in the evolution of speech,
if speech began thus, was articulation, and the agents that
articulated, interrupted and shaped the flow of roaring sound were
parts of the mouth which had hitherto been used for
appetite-related functions: chewing, biting, licking, sucking.
Appetite and communication presumably occupied the same brain cells
until the tongue, the teeth and the lips were fully adapted to new
demands. Taste, smell and texture _ pleasure, desire and
satisfaction _ must have permeated the process of speech for
thousands of years. Speaking would have been on a par with sex and
eating _ an extreme experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, we're not likely to get these extremes every day, even
in private, nor do we need them. But we need so much more than
we're being given. We have never had more access to cultural
information and material of every kind. And our speech connects
less and less to it. Vocal malnourishment hurts body, brain and
soul. We are starving in the midst of plenty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, straight after his testimony to the grand jury in
the matter of Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton took a gamble. It may
turn out to be the biggest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled that being found to have told lies about a sexual
fling does not merit a real apology.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that Americans believe his private behavior is his
own business and nobody else's. And he presumed that the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has nothing more substantial to
pin on him.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for watching, and good night.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of this gamble may not be clear even to the president
himself. It was presumably based, like everything else in this
media-struck presidency, on a close study of the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that most Americans have long considered him an
undeserving victim of Starr's investigation, Clinton spoke against
a backdrop that was understated, even funereal, and without any of
the flags and drapes that usually proclaim the authority of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   This was a man who is put-upon, not powerful. And since most
Americans have also said that the president's affair with Lewinsky
is a private matter, Clinton spent his fiercest moments defending
his right to a private life and lambasting Starr for his ``prying''
and ``personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no Richard Nixon, hunched and grey, trying to hold back
the almost palpable hatred of the public; it was a vigorous and
defiant performance. But what Clinton said was not good enough, and
it will not be the end of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   As the president well knows, sex was not the issue. Starr is
looking into obstruction of justice and suborning to perjury, and
here the polls have always shown considerable public unease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may well have perjured himself by denying the affair in
his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones case; and perjury is
perjury, even in a civil suit, and even in a case that has since
been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   His ``legally accurate'' denials, and his hairline distinctions
about perjury, made in his broadcast, did him no favors; they
suggest a man who will not hesitate to wriggle out of charges on
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now exposed the president's habit of lying. Clinton
had denied his affair on television: emphatically, pointing his
finger, and looking his countrymen in the eye. Having done that, he
allowed _ nay, encouraged _ his wife, his aides and even his
cabinet to repeat the lie.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, he assured Americans categorically that ``at no
time did I ask anyone to lie.'' That too may be ``legally
accurate.'' Politically, it could prove a ticking time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his ``false impression.'' he explained on Monday, to
shield himself from embarrassment and to protect his family. The
implication is that any ordinary American male would have done the
same. It is his private business.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. Presidents deserve their privacy, but this
does not mean, as it used to, that reckless immorality should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Modern presidents know full well that the popular trust depends
on their private, as well as their public, behavior. Clinton should
know it better than most; he salvaged his own presidential campaign
in 1992 by confessing to troubles in his marriage and suggesting
that he would amend them.
</P>
<P>
   And is presidential lying, which stalls not only a judicial
inquiry but also the day-to-day running of the country and even its
effectiveness abroad, really a private matter?
</P>
<P>
   The impulses behind it may be human and ordinary, but the
effects are not. It was the lying that needed _ and did not get _ a
proper, heartfelt apology from Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that other presidents have been caught out in bigger
lies, and have been forgiven. Eisenhower refused to acknowledge _
until Khrushchev rubbed his nose in it _ that American spy planes
were flying over Russia; Ronald Reagan denied, against all the
evidence, that arms had been traded for hostages in Iran. Both
men's popularity barely suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with job-approval ratings as high as Reagan's and an
economy as buoyant as Eisenhower's, may well feel he has an equal
chance of absolution. Yet his pattern of philandering and lying
means that his stock of trust and respect is already dangerously
low.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that almost no one wants to impeach him. But nor can
they believe in his moral authority. Without that, it is hard to
see how a president can function. Without that, as this paper has
said before, it would be better if he would go, to make way for
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that is not Clinton's plan. His best hope must now be
that nothing more emerges.
</P>
<P>
   This gamble is not entirely foolish. Starr has been slow in
gathering his evidence, to the point where it will have to be
startling indeed to make Americans care, or to stimulate Congress
into launching impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But he may yet turn out to have much more than Clinton supposes.
The president's admission of his affair showed that Starr, contrary
to expectations, had quite enough evidence to prove the Lewinsky
relationship beyond a shadow of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If the same thoroughness colors his broader inquiry, into
patterns of corruption and obstruction of justice, Clinton will be
in much deeper trouble. As indeed he will be if he is shown to have
told further lies during his four-minute TV address or his
four-hour grand-jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The burden is squarely on Starr. Until Monday night's broadcast,
the tedious prolongation of the inquiry could be blamed on
Clinton's stonewalling. Now that blockage is removed, the
independent counsel must quickly produce what he has, or shut up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defiance should be a goad to him: there are now
new-minted denials to refute. The president himself has raised the
stakes, and has gambled on keeping public opinion behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are that he may indeed have retained it, but
that it is brittle and distrustful. The image that may well linger
in the public mind is not of contrition, but of braggadocio in the
face of a net that is inexorably closing in. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The impulses behind it may be human and ordinary, but the
effects are not. It was the lying that needed _ and did not get _ a
proper, heartfelt apology from Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that other presidents have been caught out in bigger
lies, and have been forgiven. Eisenhower refused to acknowledge _
until Khrushchev rubbed his nose in it _ that American spy planes
were flying over Russia; Ronald Reagan denied, against all the
evidence, that arms had been traded for hostages in Iran. Both
men's popularity barely suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with job-approval ratings as high as Reagan's and an
economy as buoyant as Eisenhower's, may well feel he has an equal
chance of absolution. Yet his pattern of philandering and lying
means that his stock of trust and respect is already dangerously
low.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that almost no one wants to impeach him. But nor can
they believe in his moral authority. Without that, it is hard to
see how a president can function. Without that, as this paper has
said before, it would be better if he would go, to make way for
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that is not Clinton's plan. His best hope must now be
that nothing more emerges.
</P>
<P>
   This gamble is not entirely foolish. Starr has been slow in
gathering his evidence, to the point where it will have to be
startling indeed to make Americans care, or to stimulate Congress
into launching impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But he may yet turn out to have much more than Clinton supposes.
The president's admission of his affair showed that Starr, contrary
to expectations, had quite enough evidence to prove the Lewinsky
relationship beyond a shadow of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If the same thoroughness colors his broader inquiry, into
patterns of corruption and obstruction of justice, Clinton will be
in much deeper trouble. As indeed he will be if he is shown to have
told further lies during his four-minute TV address or his
four-hour grand-jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The burden is squarely on Starr. Until Monday night's broadcast,
the tedious prolongation of the inquiry could be blamed on
Clinton's stonewalling. Now that blockage is removed, the
independent counsel must quickly produce what he has, or shut up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defiance should be a goad to him: there are now
new-minted denials to refute. The president himself has raised the
stakes, and has gambled on keeping public opinion behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are that he may indeed have retained it, but
that it is brittle and distrustful. The image that may well linger
in the public mind is not of contrition, but of braggadocio in the
face of a net that is inexorably closing in. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days of fever in Washington, it can be salutary to
travel into the middle of the other, quieter America: say, to
Hastings, Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In 1879 two new railways intersected on the prairie, and around
this random ``X'' the town of Hastings was born. Within a dozen
years, 32 passenger and 75 freight trains chugged into its stations
daily, and Hastings became quite a place.
</P>
<P>
   The flat ocean of land that stretches for miles in all
directions brought forth corn and wheat aplenty; prosperous
enterprises lined the streets with fine architecture; the town
fathers built a handsome liberal-arts college.
</P>
<P>
   And here, in 1927, a prairieman invented a bright drink called
Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor made his fortune. Now the people of modern Hastings
hope his story will restore their fortunes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, like all Nebraska, has an enviable problem.
Unemployment is so low that employers cannot find workers.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate, like that of Hastings, is a mere 1.7
percent of the work force, compared with 4.5 percent in the rest of
America; in Hastings, it has been 2 percent or less for over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   And so Nebraskans are trying to persuade other Americans to join
them on the prairies, despite the steamy summers and freezing
winters, despite the absence of dramatic mountains or coastlines,
and despite the disconcerting habit of serving coffee that tastes
like dishwater before the inevitable steak.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Nebraska will air television advertisements
featuring homely Midwestern images designed to warm the hearts of
potential migrants: ``Genuine. Nebraska,'' the slogan goes.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, for its part, performed its own ceremony of boosterism
by celebrating Kool-Aid Day on Aug. 15. Children dressed up in
Kool-Aid costumes and visited the world's largest Kool-Aid stand.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody dressed as the Kool-Aid Man, the rotund cartoon figure
from the drink's TV ads, presented a proclamation to the city of
Hastings from Nebraska's governor, Ben Nelson, making Kool-Aid
Nebraska's official soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Nebraska's slogan, Hastings hopes its
association with Kool-Aid will make it sound ``genuine'': a simple
place, familiar and uncomplicated, like the America of aproned
housewives and black-and-white TV.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Kool-Aid's creation is most definitely genuine. A
boy working in his father's grocery store sends off for a manual on
how to become a manufacturer, then goes on to invent a cheap
product that mothers adore.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in a house made of prairie mud bricks,
unprotected from dust and grasshopper invasions, the inventor dies
a millionaire. But he gives much of his fortune back to the
prairies, through a variety of philanthropic gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, today's Hastings feels as genuine as this story.
One of the inventor's nephews has an office in the town center
where you can still find typewriters and manual ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   The proudest Hastings company, Dutton-Lainson, is still owned
and run by one family. Its vest-wearing patriarch, Hal Lainson,
presides at the age of 85 from behind his splendid antique desk.
His employees work hard, but go home for lunch with their families.
</P>
<P>
   He exudes Main Street contempt for the Wall Streeters who
constantly offer to arrange the purchase of his company, and boasts
of his indifference to the stock market's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps Kool-Aid is an apter symbol for Hastings than its
boosters would like. For there is another side to this drink's
story, less about small-town Nebraska loyalties than about American
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Perkins, the inventor whom Hastings now proudly claims,
actually spent only 11 years there: in 1931, four years after
hitting on the formula to reduce juice concentrate to crystals, he
moved on to Chicago, the better to distribute his product
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 he sold his firm to General Foods, which later merged
with Kraft. And so now, after a long odyssey, the product that
stands for farm-town virtue is managed from Rye Brook, near New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Kool-Aid's image has changed as much as its
headquarters. Time has marked the brand indelibly: Tom Wolfe's
``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' describes how the drink changes
when you put LSD in it; hundreds of cult members in Guyana
demonstrated the consequences of lacing it with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kool-Aid's marketers have done their best to stay
abreast of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s Kool-Aid sponsored a youth movement called Scouts
of the Stars and Stripes; from the 1970s, thrifty patriotism gave
way to flashing TV images set to disco rhythms, and later to
mountain bikes and snowboards and rap music.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, likewise, is more mobile and already more mixed than
its boosters say it is. The mayor comes from North Carolina; the
city administrator comes from Georgia; Latinos and Vietnamese have
made their homes there.
</P>
<P>
   A new delicatessen downtown now serves latte coffee; the
traditional stores, with names like Alan's Ace Hardware and Bert's
Drugs, compete with Walmart.
</P>
<P>
   Even the local farms have changed their character. Most of the
corn no longer goes to farm kitchens but to ethanol plants as
monumental as the federal subsidies they burn.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not surprising. America is always shifting,
and a town created by railways is part of this theme. At the same
time, America is always trying to manage the consequences of
mobility: it muffles rootlessness by talking about ``community'';
it clings to traditions, even imagined ones.
</P>
<P>
   And, just possibly, the imagined connection between Genuine
Nebraska and Genuine Kool-Aid will help bring Hastings new people.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Kool-Aid has quite a following. Enough sachets are
sold each year to reach from Hastings to Chicago 100 times over;
and there is a lively trade in discontinued flavors on the
Internet. Already a nursing association has chosen Hastings for its
convention because it is the birthplace of Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, sugary nostalgia may revive small towns across the
country. Not long ago, LeRoy, N.Y., celebrated the 100th
anniversary of Jell-O with a fine ceremony at its Jell-O museum. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was a typical story of urban woe. In 1983, Sears,
Roebuck closed the doors of its State Street store in Chicago after
51 years in business. Two neighboring retailers had gone bankrupt;
pedestrians had all but abandoned the street.
</P>
<P>
   End of the story? No. Sears is coming back. The retailer has
announced plans to open a five-story, 237,000-square-foot store on
State Street by the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a revival matched by the downtown areas of many other
American cities, Chicago's State Street is once again a place for
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   All Chicagoans can hum ``State Street, that great street.''
Alas, they have not always meant it. State Street was the heart of
Chicago's retail world in the early 1900s. The second half of the
century was not so kind.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers flocked to new suburban malls. Some Chicago retailers
went bust; others migrated to trendier Michigan Avenue. Then, in
1979, the city made bad worse by converting State Street into a
``transit mall.'' It was closed to all vehicles except public
transport; the pavements were widened to make it feel like a
suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   Far from attracting more shoppers, this repelled them. As the
planners have since learned, some spaces can be too open. The wide,
grey pavements were empty and uninviting. The increased bus
traffic, belching exhaust, made things still bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   By the time State Street hit bottom, seven department stores
with a total of 2.5 million square feet of retail space had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later, the city has taken another crack at
redeveloping State Street, and this time it has done a better job.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the transit mall was scrapped and traffic was
reintroduced in 1996. The pavements were narrowed from 36 feet to
26 feet, providing ``a pleasant sense of bustle.''
</P>
<P>
   The street got a $25 million facelift designed to recall its
greatness in the early 1900s: old-fashioned subway entrances,
landscaped flower beds, decorative newspaper kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The designers even found the company that made the first street
lamps in 1926, and ordered replicas. All this not only drew
sightseers, it won the American Institute of Architects' honor
award for urban design.
</P>
<P>
   And business followed the award. The total available retail
space in the State Street area increased by 8 percent between 1990
and 1997, and vacancy rates fell from 6.4 percent to 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmer House Hilton, a smart hotel just off State Street, is
enjoying its highest occupancy rate since it opened in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   The south end of the street has evolved into an ``education
corridor''; on one count, more than a dozen local universities and
colleges have come to show off here, bringing 40,000 students with
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time for downtowns in many parts of America. The
demand for office space is growing; consumers are spending freely.
</P>
<P>
   And a more subtle and potentially longer-lasting force is at
work: demographics. Young professionals are having children later
and are therefore staying in cities longer. (Many would not leave
at all, if the schools were better.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples whose children have
left home, are moving back to the city because it is more practical
than a big, empty house in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups have a taste for sports, culture and entertainment,
all of which can be found in town centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since the suburbs are now saturated with malls,
retailers are rediscovering downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's central business district has the second-largest
concentration of office space in North America. More than 15,000
workers walk by some downtown blocks every day. Many of them, with
more money than time, do their shopping there.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has a large new store on State Street; that is
where your correspondent buys baby diapers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a strong economy that has revived State
Street. The redevelopment program has made aggressive use of a
public-finance tool called tax increment financing (TIF), which
allows the city to finance economic development by tapping into the
future tax revenues it is expected to generate.
</P>
<P>
   The city identifies a specific area that is economically
stagnant and then issues bonds to pay for projects to give it a
boost _ anything from renovating historic buildings to subsidizing
private developers.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are later paid off by using the new tax revenues
generated by rising property values in the TIF district.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's mayor, Richard Daley, loves this device. The city has
created 44 of its 54 TIF districts since he was elected in 1989.
All told, they have earned $270 million in incremental property
taxes. The city boasts that each dollar of tax increment financing
generates $6 of private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that TIF often puts money in developers' pockets
for doing things they would have done anyway. They add that success
stories like State Street draw tenants away from other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The program also puts the government in the position of
parcelling out subsidies (Sears is asking for an undisclosed amount
of TIF money to help its move back to State Street).

   CHICAGO _ It was a typical story of urban woe. In 1983, Sears,
Roebuck closed the doors of its State Street store in Chicago after
51 years in business. Two neighboring retailers had gone bankrupt;
pedestrians had all but abandoned the street.
</P>
<P>
   End of the story? No. Sears is coming back. The retailer has
announced plans to open a five-story, 237,000-square-foot store on
State Street by the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a revival matched by the downtown areas of many other
American cities, Chicago's State Street is once again a place for
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   All Chicagoans can hum ``State Street, that great street.''
Alas, they have not always meant it. State Street was the heart of
Chicago's retail world in the early 1900s. The second half of the
century was not so kind.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers flocked to new suburban malls. Some Chicago retailers
went bust; others migrated to trendier Michigan Avenue. Then, in
1979, the city made bad worse by converting State Street into a
``transit mall.'' It was closed to all vehicles except public
transport; the pavements were widened to make it feel like a
suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   Far from attracting more shoppers, this repelled them. As the
planners have since learned, some spaces can be too open. The wide,
grey pavements were empty and uninviting. The increased bus
traffic, belching exhaust, made things still bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   By the time State Street hit bottom, seven department stores
with a total of 2.5 million square feet of retail space had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later, the city has taken another crack at
redeveloping State Street, and this time it has done a better job.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the transit mall was scrapped and traffic was
reintroduced in 1996. The pavements were narrowed from 36 feet to
26 feet, providing ``a pleasant sense of bustle.''
</P>
<P>
   The street got a $25 million facelift designed to recall its
greatness in the early 1900s: old-fashioned subway entrances,
landscaped flower beds, decorative newspaper kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The designers even found the company that made the first street
lamps in 1926, and ordered replicas. All this not only drew
sightseers, it won the American Institute of Architects' honor
award for urban design.
</P>
<P>
   And business followed the award. The total available retail
space in the State Street area increased by 8 percent between 1990
and 1997, and vacancy rates fell from 6.4 percent to 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmer House Hilton, a smart hotel just off State Street, is
enjoying its highest occupancy rate since it opened in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   The south end of the street has evolved into an ``education
corridor''; on one count, more than a dozen local universities and
colleges have come to show off here, bringing 40,000 students with
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time for downtowns in many parts of America. The
demand for office space is growing; consumers are spending freely.
</P>
<P>
   And a more subtle and potentially longer-lasting force is at
work: demographics. Young professionals are having children later
and are therefore staying in cities longer. (Many would not leave
at all, if the schools were better.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples whose children have
left home, are moving back to the city because it is more practical
than a big, empty house in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups have a taste for sports, culture and entertainment,
all of which can be found in town centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since the suburbs are now saturated with malls,
retailers are rediscovering downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's central business district has the second-largest
concentration of office space in North America. More than 15,000
workers walk by some downtown blocks every day. Many of them, with
more money than time, do their shopping there.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has a large new store on State Street; that is
where your correspondent buys baby diapers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a strong economy that has revived State
Street. The redevelopment program has made aggressive use of a
public-finance tool called tax increment financing (TIF), which
allows the city to finance economic development by tapping into the
future tax revenues it is expected to generate.
</P>
<P>
   The city identifies a specific area that is economically
stagnant and then issues bonds to pay for projects to give it a
boost _ anything from renovating historic buildings to subsidizing
private developers.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are later paid off by using the new tax revenues
generated by rising property values in the TIF district.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's mayor, Richard Daley, loves this device. The city has
created 44 of its 54 TIF districts since he was elected in 1989.
All told, they have earned $270 million in incremental property
taxes. The city boasts that each dollar of tax increment financing
generates $6 of private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that TIF often puts money in developers' pockets
for doing things they would have done anyway. They add that success
stories like State Street draw tenants away from other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The program also puts the government in the position of
parcelling out subsidies (Sears is asking for an undisclosed amount
of TIF money to help its move back to State Street).
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a way to raise money for economic development at
a time when Chicago's ration of federal money for such projects has
fallen by 56 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem is that the success of central business
districts has not spread to the poorer parts of America's cities.
Most cities will probably finish the decade more segregated by race
and class than they started it. Most are still losing middle-class
residents. The bulk of America's job growth is still in the
suburbs.

   WASHINGTON _ As the first family flew in for its annual summer
break in Martha's Vineyard, all seemed as normal: the warm embraces
for celebrity friends, the practiced small-talk for the waiting
crowd. But how can it be politics or, indeed, family life, as
usual?
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the day before the family vacation, the president
sat in the White House Map Room and spent more than four hours
testifying by closed-circuit television before a grand jury and its
grand inquisitor, independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The same evening, in a four-minute televised address watched by
68 million Americans, he told the people what he had told Starr:
that he had lied to them for seven months about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president then appealed to the nation to turn away from
Starr's inquiry, and to move on.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed a tall order. For Clinton was not merely confessing
to lying on Jan. 26, when he angrily denied on television any
sexual relationship with ``that woman''; he was also confessing
that he had lied on Jan. 17, when in a sworn deposition to lawyers
acting for Paula Jones _ who claims sexual harassment by Clinton in
1991 _ he said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so any ordinary viewer might conclude. But Clinton is not
known as ``Slick Willy'' for nothing. He is a lawyer, too, ever
ready _ indeed over-ready _ to play with words.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the careful crafting of his television address this week:
``As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions
about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were
legally accurate, I did not volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite so. By the Republicans' count of the publicly available
portions of Clinton's Jan. 17 testimony, the president's memory
failed him some 267 times. But since the Paula Jones case has now
been dismissed, many lawyers will argue that perjury in that case
would never be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be true of the allegations of suborning perjury
that stem from the same case: the allegation, for example, that
witnesses were pressured to amend their evidence of other
presidential gropings in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in the end, none of this will stick to Clinton;
perhaps, too, as he must hope, Starr will not manage to come up
with anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he is wrong? What if Starr presents Clinton's
misdeeds as part of a pattern of deceit that would justify the
punishment of Congress? This is what he is aiming at, and Clinton
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, in an implicit challenge to Starr, the direct-eyed
declaration: ``I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to
lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful
action.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim is a bold one, and it goes to the heart of what Starr
has been investigating. The Clinton past is littered with questions
for which answers are either absent or are not quite convincing.
</P>
<P>
   What were the Clintons, husband and wife, exactly doing in the
Whitewater property venture that failed in the 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   Why were seven employees in the White House travel office
dismissed in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Why did Vince Foster, the White House deputy counsel, apparently
commit suicide in 1993, shortly after filing three years'-worth of
delinquent Whitewater tax returns?
</P>
<P>
   Did Mrs. Clinton hide billing records connected with Whitewater?
</P>
<P>
   Did the Clinton administration improperly use FBI files on the
Reagan and Bush administrations?
</P>
<P>
   Was Webster Hubbell, a former associate attorney-general and a
partner with Mrs. Clinton in the Rose Law Firm, paid to keep silent
during 18 months in jail for fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Seeking that pattern has led Starr _ a man of absolutist
principles and, under the independent counsel statute, almost
limitless powers of inquiry _ to issue dozens of subpoenas, with
high and humble alike incurring legal costs that they, not the
government, will have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   To know Clinton, it seems, is to be a suspect for Starr; so no
wonder Clinton on Aug. 17 appeared not so much contrite as angry,
devoting _ apparently at the urging of Hillary _ half of his
address to an attack on his tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   But was it wise to mix attack with apology? Instant and
not-so-instant polls after the president's speech show his
job-approval ratings remain comfortably above 60 percent and, even
though half the population disapproves of Clinton ``as a person,''
more than two-thirds think he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Go beyond the incestuous political world within the Washington
Beltway, and the public does indeed express a wish to consign both
Whitewater and the Lewinsky saga to history. Clinton can look at
the first polls and take comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort, however, may be an illusion. Dick Morris, a
one-time adviser to Clinton (official links were severed after news
broke of an affair between Morris and a prostitute), accurately
noted that the president had appeared ``more angry than abject'';
he wished there had been ``more contrition in his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18 Morris took his turn before the grand jury, telling
it of conversations with the president back in January over the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he advised a forthright apology to the public; the
president looked at the polling data and decided it would not work.
The eventual apology, being so incomplete, may not work either.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, devil-may-care as it seems, is not immune from
the world of the pundits and politicians; and their verdict is
hardly encouraging for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   True, Al Gore, safely lodged in Hawaii, announced that Clinton
was a ``great'' and ``honest'' president; but as the man being
groomed by Clinton to succeed him, what else could Gore say?
</P>
<P>
   A more convincing reaction came from Dianne Feinstein, a
Democratic senator from California and a longtime ally of Clinton,
who said his address had left her trust in him ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dick Gephardt, the minority leader in the House of
Representatives, and Tom Daschle, his counterpart in the Senate,
said they were ``disappointed'' in the president.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is a hard profession, and November's midterm
congressional and gubernatorial elections are fast approaching. No
leading Democrat is going to express more than ``disappointment'';
better to soldier on and hope the voters turn out.
</P>
<P>
   As Jennifer Laszlo, a Democrat loyalist, puts it, the economy is
good, the budget is balanced and the president ``is woven of the
same flawed fabric as we are.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100 WORDS. OPTIONAL MATERIAL
</ANNOTATION>
FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Perhaps that is why most leading Republicans _ with the
exception of House Whip Tom DeLay and presidential hopefuls Dan
Quayle and John Ashcroft _ are taking pains not to demand the
president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The common reaction is that of Utah's Orrin Hatch, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``I'm one of those people that does
not want impeachment, if he tells the truth and if it's not more
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, who knows what Starr will tell Congress in the
report he is expected to deliver next month?
</P>
<P>
   As Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, says: ``My deepest belief
is that all of this is part of a much bigger story, and we have to
wait until the report is in before we make judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes perfect political sense. To be too partisan
would support the notion of a right-wing conspiracy, and so play
into the hands of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, think the Republicans, to let events take their
course (the next mishap for Clinton could be a decision by the
attorney-general to appoint yet another independent counsel, this
time to look into the Democrats' 1996 campaign finances).
</P>
<P>
   And why push for impeachment when it would hand the White House
over to fairly-clean Gore? The best chance for a Republican
president is surely to let Clinton stagger to the end of his term,
remembered not for his considerable virtues but for his
``inappropriate'' vices. &QL;

   For the public, devil-may-care as it seems, is not immune from
the world of the pundits and politicians; and their verdict is
hardly encouraging for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   True, Al Gore, safely lodged in Hawaii, announced that Clinton
was a ``great'' and ``honest'' president; but as the man being
groomed by Clinton to succeed him, what else could Gore say?
</P>
<P>
   A more convincing reaction came from Dianne Feinstein, a
Democratic senator from California and a longtime ally of Clinton,
who said his address had left her trust in him ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dick Gephardt, the minority leader in the House of
Representatives, and Tom Daschle, his counterpart in the Senate,
said they were ``disappointed'' in the president.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is a hard profession, and November's midterm
congressional and gubernatorial elections are fast approaching. No
leading Democrat is going to express more than ``disappointment'';
better to soldier on and hope the voters turn out.
</P>
<P>
   As Jennifer Laszlo, a Democrat loyalist, puts it, the economy is
good, the budget is balanced and the president ``is woven of the
same flawed fabric as we are.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100 WORDS. OPTIONAL MATERIAL
</ANNOTATION>
FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Perhaps that is why most leading Republicans _ with the
exception of House Whip Tom DeLay and presidential hopefuls Dan
Quayle and John Ashcroft _ are taking pains not to demand the
president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The common reaction is that of Utah's Orrin Hatch, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``I'm one of those people that does
not want impeachment, if he tells the truth and if it's not more
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, who knows what Starr will tell Congress in the
report he is expected to deliver next month?
</P>
<P>
   As Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, says: ``My deepest belief
is that all of this is part of a much bigger story, and we have to
wait until the report is in before we make judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes perfect political sense. To be too partisan
would support the notion of a right-wing conspiracy, and so play
into the hands of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, think the Republicans, to let events take their
course (the next mishap for Clinton could be a decision by the
attorney-general to appoint yet another independent counsel, this
time to look into the Democrats' 1996 campaign finances).
</P>
<P>
   And why push for impeachment when it would hand the White House
over to fairly-clean Gore? The best chance for a Republican
president is surely to let Clinton stagger to the end of his term,
remembered not for his considerable virtues but for his
``inappropriate'' vices. &QL;

<P>
   Central Africa is on the brink. The rebellion in Congo has drawn
in its neighbors. The result, unless all sides draw back, could be
a conflagration involving half a dozen countries in the heart of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Congolese rebels, strongly backed by Rwanda and
to an extent by Uganda too, closed in on the capital, Kinshasa. As
they did so, Zimbabwe and Angola said they would be sending arms
and troops to help President Laurent Kabila fight them.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia is also believed to be sending him military aid. But
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, fearing a large-scale
regional conflict, has condemned the military rescue mission, and
appealed for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20 the rebels, recognizing that Zimbabwe's intervention
might swing the war against them, said that they were ready to
negotiate a cease-fire with the government. But military aid for
Kabila is said to be already arriving in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwean aircraft are reported to be flying equipment to
Kinshasa and to Lubumbashi, the capital of the southern province of
Katanga. Some 70-100 Zimbabwean soldiers are said to be already in
the country as ``advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Namibian newspapers say that 21 tons of military equipment have
been flown to Congo from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Angolan aircraft are reportedly ferrying Kabila's troops to the
front line though, as yet, there is no sign of Angola's fighter
planes _ which, if they come, could definitively turn the war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are a complex mixture, including Rwandan troops,
Tutsis from eastern Congo, remnants of the old army of Mobutu Sese
Seko, the man deposed by Kabila last year, and ex-supporters of
Kabila, both military and civilian.
</P>
<P>
   They are advancing west from Congo's eastern border but have
also flown contingents across the country to the west coast where
they hold the main port at Matadi, plus the nearby Inga Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Water and electricity supplies to Kinshasa have been
intermittently turned off during the past week. Western countries
have urged their nationals to leave Congo, and closed or reduced
their embassies in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Kabila's call to arms to repel a ``foreign
invasion,'' volunteers are being armed and rushed to the front.
``The operation for restoring territorial integrity has begun,''
said Congo's information minister. Yet, for a time last week, the
president made himself scarce, retiring to Lubumbashi in his home
area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, he travelled to Angola's capital, Luanda,
and on Monday sent Joseph, his son and deputy army commander, to a
meeting in Zimbabwe called by President Robert Mugabe. It was after
this meeting that Zimbabwe and the others announced their military
commitment to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   What next? It is hard to see a quick end. If Angola commits its
relatively well-equipped air force to Congo, it could close the
air-bridge the rebels are using to ferry troops from the east to
their western front. The rebels in the west would then be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In the east, however, neither rebels nor Rwandans are likely to
give up, despite their talk of a cease-fire. Under threat from Hutu
extremists, they believe they must have military control to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rebels were eventually to take Kinshasa, it would
not necessarily be the finish of Kabila. He would probably flee to
Lubumbashi and continue the fight from there. If the Katangans
backed him, the province could become virtually independent and
hard for the rebels to take.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Katanga tried to go it alone, in the early 1960s,
it was forced back into Congo with the assistance of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and the other African leaders backing Kabila see him as
the only alternative to the breakup of Congo. They believe Rwanda
and Uganda want to carve out eastern Congo for themselves. But
their intervention has opened up differences between the region's
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Africa, Mandela's fierce opposition to Mugabe's
military support for Kabila could tear apart the 14-member Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC), which was supposed _ with
American help _ to become the peacekeeping and security
organization for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and Mugabe were already at odds over who should lead
SADC; now they are deeply split on what it should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, Rwanda and Uganda both back the rebels but
disagree on strategy. Uganda wants eastern Congo to be under the
control of an authority that does not allow its rebels to use it as
a springboard for cross-border attacks; it does not think it
necessary to change the government in Kinshasa to achieve this.
Rwanda, on the other hand, does.
</P>
<P>
   The only sensible result would be if the South Africans
succeeded in making Kabila and the rebel leaders negotiate peace
with one another. If this does not happen, the prospect of a larger
war, and the breakup of Congo, draw ever closer. &QL;

TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT TEES IT UP IN AMATEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Erik Compton, the nation's top-ranked junior
golfer, may never know the identity of the person whose heart beats
in his body. ``Whoever is with me, I'm taking them for a ride,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton, an 18-year-old from Miami, is the sentimental favorite
at the U.S. Amateur Championship, which begins Monday here at Oak
Hill Country Club. He is the first heart transplant recipient to
qualify for the event, amateur golf's most prestigious tournament,
but he has already earned distinction far beyond his medical
chart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has captured two of junior golf's majors _ the Rolex Junior
Championship in 1997 and the Pine Isle Championship earlier this
year _ and he has finished in the top three in the last nine
national junior tournaments. Compton hopes to play professionally,
but first he will attend the University of Georgia on a
scholarship, beginning next month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton sat in the deserted Oak Hill bowling alley Saturday
morning, reflecting on his fortune. He spent the critical years
after his transplant at age 12 trying to hide his history. Now he
is at peace with being known as the golfer with the heart
transplant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of
my life,'' he said. ``If I play golf and I play well, it makes a
better story.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton's mother, Eli, said later, ``Once he got to be No. 1,
then it was OK, because he made it without the transplant being
mentioned.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton was a sports-obsessed 9-year-old when he went for a
routine examination. The doctor listened to Compton's heart and
called in two more doctors to listen. Then two more doctors showed
up. They excused Compton and called in his mother. ``I knew
something was wrong,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day came the diagnosis: He had dilated congestive
cardiomyopathy, an enlarging of the heart that hinders its ability
to pump blood. Compton needed a transplant, and he would have to
cease all athletic activity while he waited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst thing you could say to me because all I did
was play sports,'' he said. ``I didn't believe it. I pretended it
wasn't happening, and I would run around and play and get myself
sick and exert myself to the point I was throwing up and seeing
white spots.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierine, a Miami suburb, launched several fund-raisers, but
Compton's heart was functioning at 65 percent capacity, relegating
him to low priority on the transplant list. Three years later, his
heart had dipped below 30 percent function and time was running
out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton's legs fidgeted and his blue eyes looked far away as he
recalled Feb. 26, 1992. ``It's my new birthday,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A phone ringing woke him around midnight. Compton said he knew
right away and walked into the kitchen to face his father, Peter.
``It's time, right?'' the boy asked. The father nodded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he was being wheeled into surgery, Compton could hear the
helicopter carrying the car-crash victim's heart landing on the
hospital roof. His chances of surviving the surgery ranged between
50 and 60 percent, according to his mother, now the head of an
organ-donor agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 12, you don't realize the consequences,'' Compton
said. ``That's why it was a gift from God that I had the transplant
early on in life, because at this age I don't know if I could
handle it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton said one of his first post-surgical memories was of
watching a golf tournament on television and becoming frustrated by
a golfer's inability to hit straight. Six months later, Compton,
pumped by anti-rejection drugs that made him ``look like an egg
with pencil sticks for legs and a big head,'' walked on to a golf
course to see if he could do better.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How he got there is another story. The Comptons' house was blown
away by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the family relocated to an
apartment in a country club. There he took lessons, grew stronger
and began to pursue golf seriously. At 15, he shot a 7-under-par
65. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-8-inches and 135 pounds, Compton relies on steadiness.
``The way Erik plays is not where he's going to make 80-foot
putts,'' said Hank Amundson, Compton's caddy and a childhood
friend. ``He's not extremely weak or strong in anything. It's more
of a complete, consistent game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Compton is rarely rattled. ``Going through all that he has,
has created a pretty solid base to handle certain situations,''
Amundson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton's physical resilience continues to improve. He still
takes medication to safeguard against his body rejecting the heart,
but his chances for long-term survival improve with each day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton exchanged letters with the donor's family for a while
without knowing the family's name because of confidentiality
considerations. But lately the correspondence has ceased. Their
last letter, Compton recalled, his voice cracking, said, ``Have a
good life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compton took a moment to collect himself. ``I try not to focus
too much on it,'' he said. ``I have to live my life and go on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.

<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.

   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.

HUSKEY SUFFERS A SETBACK

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Butch Huskey returned to New York Sunday, but it was
a setback rather than a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey's rehabilitation from the strained left hamstring that
has sidelined him since Aug. 3 was placed on hold Sunday. After
playing two games with the Class AAA Norfolk Tides on Friday and
Saturday, he was feeling too much pain to continue, and the Mets
decided that he should return to New York and work on strengthening
the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a major setback,'' Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips said. ``We're setting off his rehab right now. I talked to
him and he said he had pain coming out of the batter's box. He's
swinging the bat fine. It doesn't hurt him to swing. But getting
out the batter's box, he cannot go 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey was successful swinging the bat with the Tides, rapping
three hits and driving in three runs in his two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought rather than risk doing something where there is
pain, we'd back him off until he's pain-free,'' Phillips said. ``We
knew when he initially injured it that it was a different injury
than the normal hamstring, because it was at the muscle-tendon
junction and there's less blood flow there, so it takes a longer
time to heal.''

   Remember rock'n'roll? Remember feminism? Those were the warm-up
acts. They were cultural revolutions of power and moment, but the
main attraction, the baby boomers' ultimate coup and 21st century's
first Big Idea, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   What? you say. Bigger than the invention of the teenager? Bigger
than civil rights? Bigger than the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ because the last, best thing the baby boomers are
going to do in this world they've created in their own image is to
grow very old.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit us yet, but soon old people will be the happening
demographic _ between the years 2010 and 2030, the over-65
population in the U.S. will increase by 75 percent, to more than 69
million souls.
</P>
<P>
   To put their consumer spending power in perspective, consider
that the Census Bureau estimates there are now just under 20
million 15- to 19-year-old ne'er-do-wells afoot. And just look at
how much marketing hype they get, given that most of them don't
have jobs, let alone estates.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a brave new world in which baby boomers redefine what it
means to be old.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly we know in 1998, our parents and grandparents,
contracted with the government (via the Social Security Act of
1935) and private industry (pension plans had become widespread by
the 1930s) to work with Protestant doggedness for 20 years or more
and then to STOP completely and play golf or else sit in a chair
and watch the neighbors come and go from the front window.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current rate of increase in both life expectancy and
quality of life, that scenario doesn't look so viable anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be-elderly baby boomers haven't worked in
anticipation of a gold watch and a fare-thee-well at 65. Unlike
their parents, they haven't worked for one company, they've
accumulated their own irritatingly-complex-tax-situation estates,
and they will no longer be put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible that by 2030, the golf-and-bridge model of
senior citizenship will be a thing of the past. For one thing,
older Americans will want to work. In some cases they'll stay with
their jobs longer. In other cases they'll work part-time, perhaps
as interns, often as volunteers, in entirely new fields, or they'll
undertake the advanced study of fascinating but unremunerative
things (comparative lit, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   The concept of senior leisure will evolve, too, away from
passive, pleasant time fillers toward more dynamic activities: a
sail around the world, say, instead of an Alaskan cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Work, pleasure, or a combination _ it all depends on your
priorities, and the way things are headed, you'll have time for
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to say `elderly' or `senior.' We prefer the term
`Third Age,''' says a spokesman for Third Age Media, which operates
a Web site (www.thirdage.com) for the 50-plus American.
</P>
<P>
   The division of ages into quarters of a hundred is bold and apt:
Recapture the under-65 set (the 50-plussers) and you reinvigorate
the concept of aging entirely. (Also ignore the fact that 0 to 25
isn't exactly a lifestyle category, though no less so than 25 to
50).
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of such thinking will be your 60-year-old college
students and consumers of retail goods. Pretty soon the middle
years will be the necessary evil, and retirement will come to seem
the be-all in addition to the end-all.
</P>
<P>
   There's no innate reason why it shouldn't. Among the Dagara of
West Africa, old age and childhood are held to be the important
times in life, the times when one does great work.
</P>
<P>
   Children and the ``elders,'' being chronologically closer to the
spirit world, hang out together and discuss the meaning of life,
while those in their middle years are seen as more or less taking
up space, providing little more than manual labor to feed the wise
children and elders.
</P>
<P>
   This might not be such a bad model for 21st-century America,
after all: Live like hell in the First Age, pay for it in the
Second, and do it right this time in the Third.
</P>
<P>
   And after age 75, by the year 2030, you might as well call
yourself an elder and go for broke _ the statistics are in your
favor. &QL;

   Remember rock'n'roll? Remember feminism? Those were the warm-up
acts. They were cultural revolutions of power and moment, but the
main attraction, the baby boomers' ultimate coup and 21st century's
first Big Idea, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   What? you say. Bigger than the invention of the teenager? Bigger
than civil rights? Bigger than the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ because the last, best thing the baby boomers are
going to do in this world they've created in their own image is to
grow very old.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit us yet, but soon old people will be the happening
demographic _ between the years 2010 and 2030, the over-65
population in the U.S. will increase by 75 percent, to more than 69
million souls.
</P>
<P>
   To put their consumer spending power in perspective, consider
that the Census Bureau estimates there are now just under 20
million 15- to 19-year-old ne'er-do-wells afoot. And just look at
how much marketing hype they get, given that most of them don't
have jobs, let alone estates.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a brave new world in which baby boomers redefine what it
means to be old.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly we know in 1998, our parents and grandparents,
contracted with the government (via the Social Security Act of
1935) and private industry (pension plans had become widespread by
the 1930s) to work with Protestant doggedness for 20 years or more
and then to STOP completely and play golf or else sit in a chair

<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL;

<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>

in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that

<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the

<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.

MAN ARRESTED AFTER GIRL, 5, IS FOUND SCALDED 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police arrested a 35-year-old man Monday morning
after a 5-year-old Brooklyn girl in his care was found severely
scalded, unconscious and suffering from brain injuries Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Monday morning, no specific charges had been filed
against the man, Terrence Finney, 35, of 68 Fountain Avenue in the
East New York section.
</P>
<P>
   But Officer George Jensen, a spokesman for the Police
Department, said the charges would likely include assault and
endangering the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, whose name was not released, was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The child was in extremely critical condition Monday morning at
Brookdale Hospital Medical Center with brain injuries and severe
burns.
</P>
<P>
   There were also indications that the girl may have been the
victim of sexual abuse, said Detective Robert Samuel, a Police
Department spokesman, but specific details were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old, together with her four siblings, was supposed to
have been in Finney's care Sunday afternoon while the mother went
to church.
</P>
<P>
   But when the mother returned to the apartment about 2 p.m., she
found the girl, her body scalded by hot water, and called 911, said
Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   The police later found the boyfriend and the other four children
at an unspecified location away from the apartment in a two-story,
two-family home, Samuel said. The four children, ages 5 to 11, did
not appear to be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The four siblings, meanwhile, have been transferred to the
custody of the city's Administration for Children's Services,
Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors performed brain surgery on the 5-year-old to relieve
pressure caused by bleeding in the brain, said a hospital official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The girl also had severe burns
on her face and torso, but no determination had been made on
whether skin grafts would be necessary, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known what caused the hemorrhage, but it
was possible that the injuries were caused by a blow to the head,
extreme scalding or a combination of both, the hospital official
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no preliminary word on whether the mother or her
boyfriend have a criminal record or a record with the
Administration for Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is standard procedure in cases of suspected child abuse,
the Children's Services agency was also investigating the case
Sunday night, said Leonora Weiner, a spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agency was trying to determine who would take over
care of the four children .

   NICOSIA _ Carrying out President Bill Clinton's promise of dire
punishment of the bombers of U.S. embassies in Africa once again
raises the old ghost of the CIA's war against the Soviets in
Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. It also involves major trouble for
old allies in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect thus far in the assaults on the two embassies
is the Saudi construction tycoon Osama bin Laden, 45, who was
described in the early 1990s as a mastermind of international
terrorism by the U.S. State Department and other Western agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric used in claims and near-claims of the bombings,
signed by an ``Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Muslim Holy
places'' or ``The Exiles,'' is virtually identical to bin Laden's
fiery declarations of war against America.
</P>
<P>
   The claims have to come either from him, from his disciples (the
few reporters who have visited him in his Sudanese and later Afghan
lairs estimate their number at about 3,000) or from someone wanting
to put the blame on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi multimillionaire, despite disavowals of him by his
family, probably has additional billions at his disposal from the
bin Laden construction firms, a Saudi business and engineering
empire with global reach. This gives him unlimited financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   He put these at the disposal of the CIA and Pakistan during
their 10-year war to evict the Russians in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources, bin Laden and his acolytes can continue to
recruit and finance terrorists everywhere, including the likes of
the 1993 World Trade Center bombers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been the well-protected guest of the Taleban, the
Muslim zealots now overwhelming Afghanistan. The Taleban have
condemned the embassy bombings. They say they have warned bin Laden
not to proclaim holy war from Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their appearance as fiercely austere ``students''
opposing the corruption and banditry of local Afghan warlords and
their conquest of Kabul in the mid-1990s, the Taleban have had
supply, training and political support from Pakistan's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Russia and governments of nearby ex-Soviet Muslim
republics such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan fear
that, feeling flush with current victories, the Taleban's Islamist
warriors _ who deny women schooling and skilled jobs, and enforce
medieval punishments for everything from adultery to inadequately
long men's beards _ may send ideology as well as soldiers abroad in
a jihad across the South and Central Asian borders.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, the CIA's companion-in-arms in the Afghan conflict,
which was the largest covert American operation since the wars in
Vietnam and Laos, is accused, possibly justly, of now lending
support by regular Pakistani military forces to the Taleban.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan vehemently denies this. However, it has long been clear
that Pakistan wants the Taleban to prevail over its Afghan foes.
Islamabad wants to control trade and energy routes between the
Indian Ocean and Central Asia. Despite Iranian, Russian and Indian
support, those Afghan foes are now on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the main ally of the United States in the Muslim
world, has been financing the Taleban since their appearance, just
as it financed their immediate predecessors and godfathers, the
Afghan mujahidin who fought Russians and are now fighting their own
governments and societies, from Egypt and Algeria to the
Philippines and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Washington policymakers must consider the price that
is still being paid for their anti-Communist alliance with Muslim
extremists during the previous generation, especially in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taleban do not abandon bin Laden, could the United States
send air cover and strong special forces to break Taleban
resistance and arrest him or his followers, against opposition from
their Pakistani and Saudi allies?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Clinton administration sell to the U.S. Congress and
American public a reversal of alliances?
</P>
<P>
   It would mean opposing, at least temporarily, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia, and joining instead the anti-Taleban coalition of Iran,
India, Russia and Russia's former Islamic subject states of Central
Asia, and perhaps igniting new conflicts. &QL;

HITTING CAN'T MASK PITCHING INCONSISTENCY

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Mike Stanton, a former football player from
West Texas, was in a destructive mood when he returned to the
clubhouse Saturday night after giving up back-to-back home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his fury, however, Stanton managed to joke a bit with
David Cone, who had also pitched poorly. They won in spite of us,
Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning off
John Wetteland, the Texas closer, to drive the Yankees to a crazy
12-9 victory Saturday night. Ryan Bradley, whom the Yankees drafted
in 1997 with a compensation selection they received because
Wetteland signed with the Rangers, pitched one and two-thirds
innings to get his first major-league victory in his first
major-league appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees moved closer to 100 victories, to clinching a
playoff spot before the end of August; their magic number for
qualifying for the postseason stood at eight, going into Sunday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankees Manager Joe Torre would probably trade that victory
for some assurance that Stanton can resolve his inconsistency
before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He did not get it Sunday night. Stanton entered in the sixth
inning, with the Yankees trailing 7-6, and proceeded to give up a
four-pitch walk and a single before being removed. Bradley then
came in and gave up four more hits and a walk, as the Rangers
increased their lead to 12-6 in a game they eventually won, 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Torre met with Stanton. ``We're going to get it
straightened out,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stanton: ``The way I feel right now, this is my loss. We
lost by two runs, I gave up two runs. I don't have any
explanations. I don't have any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go before the playoffs, the Yankees' middle
relief is something of a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of the right-hander Jeff Nelson recovering from back
trouble are about 50-50, and there's no telling how effective he
might be after missing more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton has an 8.19 earned run average over his last 24
appearances. And he isn't quite sure why. His velocity is good;
it's not as though the quality of his stuff is in question.
</P>
<P>
   But his results over the last four months, Stanton said before
Sunday night's game, are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, lately this team has won more despite
me than because of me,'' Stanton said. ``There's no reason I should
be getting hit like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre theorized that Stanton might simply be losing the movement
on his fastball by trying too hard and by overthrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton can be dominant for a month or two and then ineffective
for a time. ``I've had stretches before in my career,'' he said.
``But not this prolonged, and I would say not this frustrating. I
feel like I was throwing pretty well, but when I give someone a
pitch to hit, they hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Stanton pitched in relief of Cone, whose control
failed him; he allowed six runs over his five and two-thirds
innings, but nonetheless left the game with a 7-6 lead and a chance
for his 19th victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton pulled the Yankees through the sixth and they scored
another run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Rusty Greer singled to lead off the seventh and Juan
Gonzalez hit a low forkball for a two-run homer to tie the score
before Will Clark homered on Stanton's next pitch to give Texas a
9-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton was finished for the night, and according to others, he
was apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius saved him from a measure of angst, however. Tino
Martinez and Chad Curtis hit singles in the eighth inning, and
Johnny Oates, the Texas manager, called for Wetteland to face
Brosius with two outs. Brosius couldn't remember facing Wetteland
before; maybe in Class AAA, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland threw a fastball and Brosius reached out and drove the
ball to right, where it cleared the wall by a foot or so.

FIRES ARE BLOW TO THE BRONX AS IT TRIES TO LURE BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Lozano spent Sunday with his son, Tomas Diaz,
and 4-year-old grandson, Frayme, picking through the charred
remains of his auto body shop on Webster Avenue in the Bronx. Not
far from there, on East 170th Street, shoppers expecting to find
discounts on back-to-school outfits at Kids Town or Jimmy Jazz
instead encountered the wreckage of another devastating fire.
</P>
<P>
   And over at Southern Boulevard and Boston Road, Sunday services
took place as usual at the Mision de Dios Pentecostal Church, which
was rebuilt after a fire in May. But rubble was all that remained
of the five other businesses that had burned.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, politicians and Bronx boosters have been
boasting about the rebuilding of the borough, which has seen more
than 30,000 homes and $2.5 billion in new construction in the last
decade. That, they said, finally repaired the damage done in the
1970s and early 1980s, when arson obliterated whole neighborhoods
and made the South Bronx infamous around the world as a symbol for
urban decay.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at a time when officials are trying to lure businesses
back to the borough, eight major fires in the last six months have
destroyed more than two dozen small businesses and indirectly hurt
many others, mostly in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   No one has died in the eight unrelated fires, save the puppies,
parakeets and other animals killed when a pet shop was leveled in
the Throgs Neck section on Feb. 8. And all but two fires that are
still under investigation have been ruled accidental.
</P>
<P>
   But the fires have rekindled memories of an era when the skyline
was ablaze day and night, and when investors, like residents, were
in full flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days, there were fires everywhere in the
Bronx,'' recalled Gustavo Guerra, 40, a mechanic at Lozano's shop,
El Che's Body Repair, on Webster Avenue near 166th Street in the
Morrisania section. ``Now, it seems like there's a fire here almost
every day,'' he went on, pointing every which way: ``Here, there,
there-there-there.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, while they had no statistics available Sunday, Fire
Department officials said that the seeming outbreak of burning
businesses did not begin to approach the activity seen in the
1970s, when a city policy that provided housing for residents
displaced by fire prompted many to burn themselves out of their own
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when I was a captain in a battalion then,
standing on a rooftop and seeing two or three multiple-alarm fires
going at the same time within a mile from me,'' said First Deputy
Fire Commissioner William Feehan.
</P>
<P>
   As for fires at businesses, he said, ``We probably had eight
taxpayer fires a week back then.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City parlance, ``taxpayers'' are one-story
commercial buildings, usually constructed on the cheap by property
owners hoping to recover just enough in rent to pay their real
estate taxes. And the Bronx seems to have more of them than any
other borough, Feehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayer fires in the Bronx have been the bane of this
department's existence for decades,'' he said. ``Most of them are
quite old, and there'll be a cockloft between the ceiling and the
roof board that extends over several shops. Often the partition
walls extend only up to the ceiling, so the fire'll spread through
the cockloft, right down the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, many of the businesses that go up in flames are filled
with combustible material like oil, gas or propane tanks, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The four-alarm fire Friday morning at East 170th Street and
Walton Avenue, for example, began when workers who were building a
second floor atop the Jimmy Jazz and Kids Town stores accidentally
set off an explosion with a welder's torch, said Hermes Caraballa,
an official in the Bronx borough president's office. More than 50
people were evacuated from an adjacent apartment building as the
fire burned for more than four hours, and eight firefighters were
treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Gas and telephone service still had not been restored Sunday to
several neighboring buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On Webster Avenue Sunday, Lozano was busy trying to salvage a
compressor or two from among the oily black ash and the briar patch
of jagged metal where his 12-year-old body shop had stood.
</P>
<P>
   The fire there, which also consumed a travel agency and a
transmission shop, began Aug. 16, when a can of gasoline spilled at
a 24-hour garage a few doors down, Lozano said. Rather than throw
sand on the gasoline, someone hosed it down with water, he said _ a
dangerous mistake. The water and gasoline spread underneath a hot
water tank, where it was ignited by a pilot light.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never even got a chance to use their fire
extinguishers,'' Lozano said.

<P>
   Contemplating America last week has been like watching a
gigantic edition of The Jerry Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the usual procession of dysfunctional
representatives of the U.S. underclass, falling over their own
blubber and ponytails in an attempt to knock five kinds of
theatrical crap out of each other, we have _ up on stage (a big
hand folks!) _ Bill, Monica, Ken Starr, Hillary, Linda Tripp and as
many others as can be conceivably subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the audience made up of the usual mischievous voyeurs,
who enjoy nothing better than to yell ``whoarrr!'' in mock horror
whenever a fight looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   No, this special show is being conducted entirely in front of a
handpicked audience of sober-suited media commentators, columnists,
political journalists, presenters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   The strapline at the bottom of the screen reads, ``They Had Sex.
Or Did They?'' This event is (unlike the alleged sex itself) both
salacious and exhausting. And clearly, for those in the audience,
it is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   For what is truly remarkable about the Monica Lewinsky affair is
how the American people themselves say ``it isn't that important,''
and how most journalists seem to come up with ever more ingenious
arguments for why it is, in fact, the biggest show in town. And why
it should never, ever, end.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seems to be a wide agreement among pundits that
Bill Clinton's rather pathetic address to the nation last Monday
night could not represent the final stage of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been frank enough. Nor had the president, apparently,
answered all of Ken Starr's detailed questions earlier about
exactly what he and Lewinsky had done.
</P>
<P>
   This, you see, was important when establishing whether Clinton
had grounds for saying that what happened did not constitute a
sexual relationship. He should, said the broadsheet press (both
here and over there), have answered these questions candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Reading the gossipy Drudge Report on the Internet one
morning last week, I came across this line: ``The DRUDGE REPORT has
learned that Monica Lewinsky, when asked by prosecutors if the
president performed `cunnilingus' on her, responded by saying she
did not know what the word `cunnilingus' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ken Starr asked Clinton the same question. Or perhaps
the independent counsel asked the president, in detail, about the
suggestion that Bill had allowed Monica to fellate him for a while,
and had then procured his own climax while the chubby intern danced
a little Salome number on the Oval Office carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that their conversation turned to the propulsive
qualities of the presidential semen, and its capacity for landing
far away. Anyway, Clinton refused to answer such queries, labelling
them as ``intrusive,'' whereas the conventional wisdom is that he
should have replied candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget why all this semen and cunnilingus stuff is
supposed to matter. In 1991, before he was elected, Clinton
probably (though he denies it) showed his willy to a woman called
Paula Jones in a hotel bedroom. She did not want to see it, told
him so, and he put it away again.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later she filed a case against him for sexual
harassment, and subpoenaed everyone that might have had any carnal
knowledge of him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Linda Tripp bearing tapes, enter Monica Lewinsky, enter
Clinton's evasion (or lie) to the Paula Jones grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's case _ a civil one _ was dismissed, not because of
Clinton's testimony, but because the allegation did not amount to
harassment. But by now Ken Starr was on the case. If Clinton had
fibbed then, he was a perjurer. If he had attempted to get Monica
to fib, then he was suborner.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the fact that the original case had come to nothing,
despite the fact that the Monica relationship was (according to
her) consensual, if Ken could show that there had been knobbing,
then he had his man by the short and curlies.
</P>
<P>
   A Martian, landing on earth at this point, might wonder at the
sanity of the whole business. Indeed, an American landing in
Washington might wonder the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to go into the question of whether lying in court
about your consensual sexual relationships constitutes perjury or
not. If it does, then it's a perjury that many decent people would
commit, and feel themselves entitled to commit. Most Americans know
this, even if the press doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that several good American presidents have
strayed, some far more egregiously than Bill. And they no more
expect to judge presidents by their lower body polkas, than they
query the world-renowned surgeon who ogles the anesthetist, or the
skilled pilot with a girl in every airport. But, according to the
press, they haven't truly understood.
</P>
<P>
   In last Wednesday's Washington Post, for instance, the comment
was universally unfavorable to Clinton. Columnist David Broder
encapsulated the argument when he disputed Clinton's claim that it
was nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that it were so,'' intoned Broder, piously. ``But he
made it our business _ the nation's burden _ first by showing utter
disrespect for the high office he holds, and second by refusing all
this time to do what he alone could do: clear up the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Broder even invoked a previous crisis. ``He (Clinton) not only
lied to Paula Jones's lawyers, he lied to the public and to his
closest political associates, and implicated the leaders of his
party and his government in the deception. In all those respects,
Clinton's behavior is truly Nixonian.''
</P>
<P>
   This is such staggering rubbish, that it makes one despair.
Nixon engaged in a criminal conspiracy to burgle opponents, and to
cover up the results.
</P>
<P>
   He and Kissinger also connived at the secret destruction of
Cambodia, the overthrow of the democratically elected government of
Chile, and the unnecessary bombing of North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents waged secret war against Cuba, organized the
military removal of the progressive and elected government of
Guatemala (with the consequence of the deaths of many thousands of
innocent people), fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and _
latterly _ permitted Contragate.
</P>
<P>
   And this litany of presidential sins is supposed to be less
serious than fibbing about muff-diving? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   At least one serious article in a major British broadsheet
newspaper last week seemed to suggest that Clinton has showed
himself to be unfit for the presidency, by reason of having sex
with Monica Lewinsky yet ``not reciprocating any affection or
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the excuse of the trivializer everywhere, the alibi of
the TV executive who cuts the current affairs program, and brings
in yet another ``people show.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tortuous tergiversations have a parallel in those of
the press, who have been happily complicit in this heroic
trivialization of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the difficult, intractable problems, the ones where lives
hang in the balance. Forget the Congo. Forget the environment. As
the planet heats up, there's only one kind of emission control that
they're interested in.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, we're now told (having passed through fraud, perjury
and cover-up), is ``character.'' And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Soviet Union was dubbed ``Upper Volta with missiles.''
Today the U.S. is Oprah with nukes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating America last week has been like watching a
gigantic edition of The Jerry Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the usual procession of dysfunctional
representatives of the U.S. underclass, falling over their own
blubber and ponytails in an attempt to knock five kinds of
theatrical crap out of each other, we have _ up on stage (a big
hand folks!) _ Bill, Monica, Ken Starr, Hillary, Linda Tripp and as
many others as can be conceivably subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the audience made up of the usual mischievous voyeurs,
who enjoy nothing better than to yell ``whoarrr!'' in mock horror
whenever a fight looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   No, this special show is being conducted entirely in front of a
handpicked audience of sober-suited media commentators, columnists,
political journalists, presenters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   The strapline at the bottom of the screen reads, ``They Had Sex.
Or Did They?'' This event is (unlike the alleged sex itself) both
salacious and exhausting. And clearly, for those in the audience,
it is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   For what is truly remarkable about the Monica Lewinsky affair is
how the American people themselves say ``it isn't that important,''
and how most journalists seem to come up with ever more ingenious
arguments for why it is, in fact, the biggest show in town. And why
it should never, ever, end.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seems to be a wide agreement among pundits that
Bill Clinton's rather pathetic address to the nation last Monday
night could not represent the final stage of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been frank enough. Nor had the president, apparently,
answered all of Ken Starr's detailed questions earlier about
exactly what he and Lewinsky had done.
</P>
<P>
   This, you see, was important when establishing whether Clinton
had grounds for saying that what happened did not constitute a
sexual relationship. He should, said the broadsheet press (both
here and over there), have answered these questions candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Reading the gossipy Drudge Report on the Internet one
morning last week, I came across this line: ``The DRUDGE REPORT has
learned that Monica Lewinsky, when asked by prosecutors if the
president performed `cunnilingus' on her, responded by saying she
did not know what the word `cunnilingus' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ken Starr asked Clinton the same question. Or perhaps
the independent counsel asked the president, in detail, about the
suggestion that Bill had allowed Monica to fellate him for a while,
and had then procured his own climax while the chubby intern danced
a little Salome number on the Oval Office carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that their conversation turned to the propulsive
qualities of the presidential semen, and its capacity for landing
far away. Anyway, Clinton refused to answer such queries, labelling
them as ``intrusive,'' whereas the conventional wisdom is that he
should have replied candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget why all this semen and cunnilingus stuff is
supposed to matter. In 1991, before he was elected, Clinton
probably (though he denies it) showed his willy to a woman called
Paula Jones in a hotel bedroom. She did not want to see it, told
him so, and he put it away again.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later she filed a case against him for sexual
harassment, and subpoenaed everyone that might have had any carnal
knowledge of him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Linda Tripp bearing tapes, enter Monica Lewinsky, enter
Clinton's evasion (or lie) to the Paula Jones grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's case _ a civil one _ was dismissed, not because of
Clinton's testimony, but because the allegation did not amount to
harassment. But by now Ken Starr was on the case. If Clinton had
fibbed then, he was a perjurer. If he had attempted to get Monica
to fib, then he was suborner.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the fact that the original case had come to nothing,
despite the fact that the Monica relationship was (according to
her) consensual, if Ken could show that there had been knobbing,
then he had his man by the short and curlies.
</P>
<P>
   A Martian, landing on earth at this point, might wonder at the
sanity of the whole business. Indeed, an American landing in
Washington might wonder the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to go into the question of whether lying in court
about your consensual sexual relationships constitutes perjury or
not. If it does, then it's a perjury that many decent people would
commit, and feel themselves entitled to commit. Most Americans know
this, even if the press doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that several good American presidents have
strayed, some far more egregiously than Bill. And they no more
expect to judge presidents by their lower body polkas, than they
query the world-renowned surgeon who ogles the anesthetist, or the
skilled pilot with a girl in every airport. But, according to the
press, they haven't truly understood.
</P>
<P>
   In last Wednesday's Washington Post, for instance, the comment
was universally unfavorable to Clinton. Columnist David Broder
encapsulated the argument when he disputed Clinton's claim that it
was nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that it were so,'' intoned Broder, piously. ``But he
made it our business _ the nation's burden _ first by showing utter
disrespect for the high office he holds, and second by refusing all
this time to do what he alone could do: clear up the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Broder even invoked a previous crisis. ``He (Clinton) not only
lied to Paula Jones's lawyers, he lied to the public and to his
closest political associates, and implicated the leaders of his
party and his government in the deception. In all those respects,
Clinton's behavior is truly Nixonian.''
</P>
<P>
   This is such staggering rubbish, that it makes one despair.
Nixon engaged in a criminal conspiracy to burgle opponents, and to
cover up the results.
</P>
<P>
   He and Kissinger also connived at the secret destruction of
Cambodia, the overthrow of the democratically elected government of
Chile, and the unnecessary bombing of North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents waged secret war against Cuba, organized the
military removal of the progressive and elected government of
Guatemala (with the consequence of the deaths of many thousands of
innocent people), fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and _
latterly _ permitted Contragate.
</P>
<P>
   And this litany of presidential sins is supposed to be less
serious than fibbing about muff-diving? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   At least one serious article in a major British broadsheet
newspaper last week seemed to suggest that Clinton has showed
himself to be unfit for the presidency, by reason of having sex
with Monica Lewinsky yet ``not reciprocating any affection or
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the excuse of the trivializer everywhere, the alibi of
the TV executive who cuts the current affairs program, and brings
in yet another ``people show.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tortuous tergiversations have a parallel in those of
the press, who have been happily complicit in this heroic
trivialization of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the difficult, intractable problems, the ones where lives
hang in the balance. Forget the Congo. Forget the environment. As
the planet heats up, there's only one kind of emission control that
they're interested in.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, we're now told (having passed through fraud, perjury
and cover-up), is ``character.'' And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Soviet Union was dubbed ``Upper Volta with missiles.''
Today the U.S. is Oprah with nukes. &QL;

 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial part of the U.S. innovation system is the ready
availability of venture capital to back startup companies in
high-tech fields. The venture markets have been roaring in recent
years _ pouring private money into fledging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data from a variety of sources show that 1997 was a
banner year for new private investment, particularly in information
technology companies _ and that 1998 looks like another winner.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, says Pat Gray, a managing partner at Price
Waterhouse, are particularly ``heartening'' because they point to
investments in a diverse mix of businesses and for companies at
different stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   Investment growth, he says, ``was pretty broad-based, except in
biotech. Software and communications hit the cover off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   These optimistic sentiments are based on numbers from several
sources. Price Waterhouse, the New York-based consulting firm, says
venture capital investments climbed to $12.8 billion in 1997, up 34
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company's numbers show that most of the money _ about $8.5
billion _ went to high-tech businesses, such as Internet services,
software companies, and computer firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that track venture investments paint a similar
picture. Private investments have nearly doubled during the past
three years, says Rolf Selvig, director of business development at
San Francisco-based VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   If private investment is a crucial part of the innovation
system, so is the next step in the process: the initial public
offerings (IPOs) that bring public money into the startups. And
there the picture isn't quite so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs for venture-backed companies slowed dramatically in 1997.
After a record year in 1996, the number of IPOs for startups
dropped 41 percent in 1997 and the amount of money raised plummeted
by 43 percent to $5.4 billion, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the slowdown in IPO markets, there's lots of
venture money available.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says, Clinton Harris, an investment advisor at Grove
Street Advisors in Lexington, Mass., for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists, ``it's a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harris raises a cautionary note. ``If you're an
investor it may be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes the danger is that the success rate of
venture-backed companies will drop. While the supply of money is
growing, he says, ``the availability of high-quality investments is
not changing as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the natural lag time in venture markets, says
Harris, ``if there is too much money now, it will still be two to
three years before the returns drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it looks as though the venture capital cog in
the innovation system is turning at a high rate. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial part of the U.S. innovation system is the ready
availability of venture capital to back startup companies in
high-tech fields. The venture markets have been roaring in recent
years _ pouring private money into fledging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data from a variety of sources show that 1997 was a
banner year for new private investment, particularly in information
technology companies _ and that 1998 looks like another winner.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, says Pat Gray, a managing partner at Price
Waterhouse, are particularly ``heartening'' because they point to
investments in a diverse mix of businesses and for companies at
different stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   Investment growth, he says, ``was pretty broad-based, except in
biotech. Software and communications hit the cover off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   These optimistic sentiments are based on numbers from several
sources. Price Waterhouse, the New York-based consulting firm, says
venture capital investments climbed to $12.8 billion in 1997, up 34
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company's numbers show that most of the money _ about $8.5
billion _ went to high-tech businesses, such as Internet services,
software companies, and computer firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that track venture investments paint a similar
picture. Private investments have nearly doubled during the past
three years, says Rolf Selvig, director of business development at
San Francisco-based VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   If private investment is a crucial part of the innovation
system, so is the next step in the process: the initial public
offerings (IPOs) that bring public money into the startups. And
there the picture isn't quite so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs for venture-backed companies slowed dramatically in 1997.
After a record year in 1996, the number of IPOs for startups
dropped 41 percent in 1997 and the amount of money raised plummeted
by 43 percent to $5.4 billion, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the slowdown in IPO markets, there's lots of
venture money available.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says, Clinton Harris, an investment advisor at Grove
Street Advisors in Lexington, Mass., for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists, ``it's a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harris raises a cautionary note. ``If you're an
investor it may be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes the danger is that the success rate of
venture-backed companies will drop. While the supply of money is
growing, he says, ``the availability of high-quality investments is
not changing as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the natural lag time in venture markets, says
Harris, ``if there is too much money now, it will still be two to
three years before the returns drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it looks as though the venture capital cog in
the innovation system is turning at a high rate. &QL;

   Sometimes it seems as though the Internet had been invented to
foster manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   There's the glee of finding information in a few seconds. Then
the head-banging frustration of waiting as an image fills the
screen pixel by excruciating pixel.
</P>
<P>
   Most home Net users, in particular, sip data through modems
operating at 28.8 kilobits per second. The newest modems offer 56
kilobits per second _ not an overwhelming boost.
</P>
<P>
   But home Internet users may soon have available to them the Net
equivalent of lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this year, phone companies will begin to offer a
technology called ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) that
will bring fast network access through the copper wires that still
connect virtually every home to the phone network.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone within a few miles of a phone switching center can get
the benefits of ADSL _ connection rates exceeding today's fastest
modems by some 20-fold. And an ADSL connection is like an
electrical socket: It's always on.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL works because most households need high-speed connection in
only one direction. ADSL grants the high downloading speed by
splitting the information stream in two _ a low-frequency channel
for voice and a high-frequency one for data.
</P>
<P>
   This separation allows the copper to carry data at speeds of up
to 7 megabits per second in one direction without interfering with
the voice conversations that occupy the same wires.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ADSL is not new. But phone companies have until now
treated it as an exotic service, and it has required installing an
electronic filtering device, or ``splitter,'' at each home.
</P>
<P>
   To accelerate ADSL's penetration into the consumer market, a
host of computer and telecommunications companies have joined
forces to push for a new standard that would eliminate the need for
the splitter _ although by limiting data rates to less spectacular
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``universal ADSL'' would permit downloads at 1.5
megabits per second and upstream transmission at 500 kilobits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the drive for universal ADSL is a coalition of three
dominant players in the personal computer industry _ Compaq, Intel,
and Microsoft _ and several regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies will probably be conducting trials of the
service by year's end, and widespread availability should begin
sometime in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL should have an edge over another telephone technology _
ISDN (integrated services data network), which provides only 128
kilobits per second. This latest ingredient in the
telecommunications alphabet soup should provide more substantial
nourishment. &QL;

<P>
   Remember monorail? That Jetson-era relic, one step above an
amusement park ride, zipping around airports, hotels, and yes,
amusement parks?
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment in the 1960s, monorail _ cars or trains
running on or under a single, elevated guide rail _ looked like the
future of mass transit. But that bright vision was eclipsed by a
surge of highway building and, more recently, the rush to build
urban light-rail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail was written off as a novelty, fine for Disneyland but
hardly a serious option.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday's dreams are today's leaps forward. Thanks partly
to technological improvements, partly to new recognition of the
limitations of conventional rail, and especially to the grass-roots
activism of impatient citizens, monorail is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Today, space-short Japan leads the world in elevated transit,
with eight urban monorails. Sydney, Vancouver, and Singapore all
use monorails, as do planned communities in Brazil and parks in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now monorail boosters in several U.S. cities are vying to make
their towns next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, those boosters recently attempted to persuade
transit officials to build a monorail in place of a controversial
planned light-rail system, on the ground that light rail would eat
too many precious street lanes.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed, but monorail boosters have made more headway
with the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council, which has proposed
a new light-rail system for the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Vexed because light-rail vehicles can't handle the grade to the
regional airport on their side of the Ohio River, residents of
Covington, Ky., are pressing for a switch to monorail, whose rubber
tires and enclosed guideways provide better traction than
steel-wheeled light-rail vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They've persuaded their congressman, Jim Bunning, to arrange
federal funding to study the monorail option.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Seattle, home of the mile-long monorail left from the
1962 World's Fair, that has given the technology its broadest
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Seattle voters approved a 42-mile monorail system
running to all four corners of the city, over the opposition of
city officials and the business establishment, who favored light
rail and buses.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure was an unusual exercise in do-it-yourself
transit planning, drafted and promoted by an activist/cab driver,
Dick Falkenbury, who says he got the idea while ``stuck in traffic,
watching the monorail zip by overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you get out of traffic, you're still stuck in traffic,''
Falkenbury explains. ``Once you realize that, only monorail makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most U.S. monorails are at theme parks and other
private venues only proves the technology's efficiency, he insist:
``When you build with other people's (i.e., public) money, you
build light rail. When you build with your own money, you build a
monorail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even monorail's critics concede that, because it weighs less, it
can be elevated less expensively than rail. Elevated systems can be
built quickly; because they needn't tango with traffic and
pedestrians, they can be automated, eliminating the driver salaries
that are conventional transit's biggest operating expense. (The
other way to get trains out of traffic's way, digging tunnels, is
prohibitively expensive _ as Los Angeles is discovering.)
</P>
<P>
   Though view-sensitive residents squirm at the thought of a
monorail's elevated guideways blocking their light, today's
guideways are much thinner than 1962's concrete behemoths. And
their pillars are spaced more widely _ 100-plus feet apart in a
leading model from Montreal-based monorail maker Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Technical improvements have also obviated another longtime
monorail shortcoming: awkward switching from one track to another.
Bombardier can now switch tracks in 8 to 12 seconds, making
multi-track systems feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop with a conventional, mass-transit monorail?
University of Washington engineering professor emeritus Jerry
Schneider notes that Seattle's Monorail Initiative would allow the
city to implement a truly revolutionary solution: personal rapid
transit (PRT).
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the 1970s and now being revived on three
continents, PRT offers individualized, point-to-point service in
private (say, four-seater) cars running on lightweight,
computer-controlled, elevated guideways _ usually monorails but
sometimes dual rails.
</P>
<P>
   Variously dubbed ``automated taxis,'' ``horizontal elevator,''
or ``personal monorail,'' it's the only transit form that just
might match the automobile's convenience, without its environmental
downside.
</P>
<P>
   The monorail of the future may surprise even its present-day
proponents. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   After airline passengers walked through the metal detectors at
Albuquerque airport last fall, some volunteered to be scrutinized
one more time by a device that ``sniffed'' them to detect chemical
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they stepped into a portal about the size of two
shower stalls, where nozzles puffed jets of air from their
shoulders to their knees. A few seconds later, a computer screen
handed down the verdict: ``clean'' or ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosives-detection portal worked so well that researchers
at Sandia National Laboratories, who developed the device with
funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are now
seeking partners to commercialize it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA gave the researchers $2 million three years ago to
develop a way to ferret out people who are carrying or have
recently handled chemical explosives _ including so-called plastic
explosives _ which conventional methods cannot detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to cover any and all possible ways an explosive
could get on a plane,'' explains Paul Jankowski, manager of the
FAA's trace detection program, inaugurated in 1992 to stay a
technological step ahead of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The device is based on technology Sandia scientists developed to
protect nuclear weapons facilities from bomb threats and to prevent
people inside the facilities from smuggling out restricted chemical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   It sprays several cubic feet of air over a person's hands and
clothes to dislodge any chemicals adhering to them. The air is
sucked into a device below the traveler's feet and passes through a
chemical sensor called an ion mobility spectrometer that can
identify the chemical signatures of many different types of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity and type of chemicals detected then appear on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Sandia's research team was to develop the
preconcentrator technology _ the part of the device that aggregates
the air molecules quickly enough so that the ion spectrometer can
analyze them.
</P>
<P>
   The team succeeded so well that the device can detect very small
concentrations of all ``explosives of interest'' to the FAA,
according to project leader Kevin Linker, a mechanical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, given the task at hand, neither Sandia nor the FAA
will reveal what types of explosives the device detects or its
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial test, on 2,500 volunteers, worked well,
members of the research team say the process _ at 12 seconds per
customer _ still takes too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is 6 to 10 seconds,'' says chemical engineer Chuck
Rhykerd. ``That's the current speed of metal detectors. It doesn't
seem that long, but once you take your keys out of your pocket, put
your bags on the conveyor belt, walk through slowly, and pick up
your bags, that's how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the speed will be a challenge, he admits. ``Five
seconds to collect the air. Five seconds to do the analysis. We can
probably cut the analysis time by one to two seconds. But cutting
the sample time may reduce the device's sensitivity. It's a
trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another glitch that researchers hope to fix before the device
can go into production is that the machine occasionally sounds a
false alarm. As for what causes the false positives, the
security-minded Rhykerd says: ``I have a suspicion, but I can't
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhykerd believes that ultimately, the rate of false positives
can be held to 5 percent, ``well below'' that of metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving its accuracy, Rhykerd and his
colleagues hope to overcome two other technical challenges:
decreasing size and cost. The machine is bound to be expensive, but
the benefits could also be high.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, the FAA's Jankowski notes, the CTX5000, a
million-dollar machine designed to inspect luggage, is already in
use at some airports. ``And this device is nowhere near that
expensive,'' he adds. &QL;

 3 RECEIVERS ARE HUNGRY FOR WORK  &HT;     By TIM KEOWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; The 49ers say there will be plenty of receptions to go around
this year, which means enough for the statistics to accumulate fast
enough for three egos to remain soothed. And without drawing too
fine a point on anything that happens before school starts, the
49ers might want to hope they're right.
</P>
<P>
   To look at it another way, they probably don't want to see what
happens if they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was raised Sunday after Terrell Owens went through the
Miami Dolphins' defense as if it wasn't there, and most of the
afternoon it wasn't. He came out of the game with seven receptions,
142 yards, three touchdowns and an odd end-zone dance. The dance
included a hand-waving gesture indicating something down there
stunk; it might have been the Dolphins' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Owens has spent the first four games of the virtual season
working on his telepathy skills with Steve Young. It worked Sunday,
especially on a 72-yard touchdown that must have been harder than
it looked. In fact, Owens might have exerted more energy dancing in
the end zone than he did getting there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at me to be like Jerry Rice, to get in
the end zone and act like I've been there before,'' Owens said.
``At some point in my career I'll incorporate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is watching this from the sideline, reluctantly and against
his wishes. In two weeks, he'll be off restriction and on the
field, along with Owens and J.J. Stokes. Owens doesn't consider
himself a second option, Stokes isn't interested in being a decoy
and everyone knows what Rice will expect when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, the 49ers see as a good thing. One look at the
excruciating performance of the team's second- and third-teamers is
enough to make them be thankful for depth, wherever it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Young says Rice ``is sulking because he's not on the field. J.J.
is sulking because he's not making big plays. I love that. We're
going to be explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of equal distribution is gaining support across party
lines, and while it sounds good and teamlike and all that, it also
includes an element of necessity. By the early looks we've had of
the running game, the passing game is going to be carrying all the
dressers and sectionals.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Young became discouraged with Steve Mariucci's
insistence on the running game. This season Mariucci promised Young
an offense that would rip at the seams, with runs and passes
merging in seamless gulps of yardage.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's 21-20 loss to the Dolphins included 276 yards
passing and 50 rushing. The yards-per-carry average of 2.1 was
bloated; Young ran three times for 17 yards to pad the running
stats. It was shades of the good old days, when Young running for
his life was the 49ers' idea of a diverse offense.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get too far down this road, a word from Young:
``Don't fret over the preseason too much. It's never as bad as it
looks or as good as it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's final pass was a touchdown over the middle to Owens, who
covered 26 yards compared to zero for the Dolphins' secondary. At
the end of the play, Young banged his throwing hand on a defensive
player's helmet and stood on the sideline with it wrapped in ice
for the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan during the exhibition season is to get some work
in and get out _ as soon as possible, in both cases. Get your
starters into halftime with all the proper cords attached and
genuflect at your good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The speed and passion with which the training staff descended on
Young as he left the field reinforces the contention that this is a
team being held together by slim threads.
</P>
<P>
   The one place they have depth, to return to the original
premise, is wide receiver. They don't have it on the defensive or
offensive lines, and they don't have it behind Garrison Hearst at
running back. And as for quarterback _ put it this way: Ty Detmer
and Jim Druckenmiller combined to complete 7 of 19 for 44 yards,
and the statistics look much better on paper than they did while
they were being compiled.
</P>
<P>
   (Because Druckenmiller has become the designated frog on the
dissection table during the exhibition season, he's worth further
mention. For one, he threw Sunday like an outfielder missing a
cutoff man. For another, when Mariucci was asked what it would take
for Druckenmiller to be a good NFL quarterback, he said, ``Time,
coaching, preparation, practice time, repetition ...'' In other
words, everything but taking the snap.)
</P>
<P>
   With those factors safely digested, and the memory of Sunday's
game safely tucked away in his head, Mariucci said he won't give
his starters more than a few fleeting seconds of action Friday
night in the second installment of the heated and storied Seahawks
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   No one had to ask him why.

 49ERS' PASSING ONLY PLUS IN LOSS  &HT;     By IRA MILLER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; The 49ers' passing game _ at least with the starters on the
field _ is ready for the regular season to begin, which should
hardly come as a surprise. When has it not been ready?
<P>
   But, aside from Steve Young's three touchdown passes to Terrell
Owens and another stout performance from new left tackle Dave
Fiore, the news from their penultimate exhibition exercise Sunday
was hardly encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been all summer, the running game, which was so good
last year, was awful. Once more, the backups looked dreadful,
blowing a 13-point second-half lead and allowing the Miami Dolphins
to escape with a 21-20 victory. Second-year quarterback Jim
Druckenmiller threw poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Also, coach Steve Mariucci passed up an opportunity to at least
get a line on what the only placekicker on the roster, John
Becksvoort, could do with a tough field-goal chance in the home
stadium _ which could mean Mariucci has decided to look elsewhere
for a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   And veteran offensive lineman Harris Barton, who has made a
marvelous comeback from four knee surgeries, suffered a sprained
ankle late in the game, complicating planning for tomorrow's first
mandatory NFL roster cutdown because Barton is the primary backup
at center. His injury, however, is not believed serious.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci took encouragement from the 20-7 lead built by the
49ers while starters from both teams were in the game. He was
pleased with the way his front-line defense held up against the
combination of Dan Marino and Miami's running game behind an
improved offensive line. But he minced no words about the 49ers'
lack of depth, which has been apparent all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take out our starters ... we really drop off,'' he
said. ``We've got to find some people who can help us win in those
backup spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those starters were fine, even though &LR; ju  &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; c,12p2  &LR; Young was not at mid-season sharpness. He missed several
throws but still completed 13 of 21 for 232 yards while playing one
series into the second half. He scrambled well, directed receivers
down the field to turn at least one busted play into a 40-yard
completion to Mark Harris, and threw a TD pass on an audible.
</P>
<P>
   Young was due to go out after his one series in the third
quarter, anyway. But on his last play, a 26-yard touchdown pass to
Owens on a play Young changed at the line when he saw a blitz
coming, Young hit his passing hand on a Dolphins' helmet, bruising
it ever so slightly. He came off the field shaking the hand in the
air, and an ice pack was applied on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of 49ERS (100127 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I'm fine,'' Young said after the game. ``It just stung. It's
absolutely not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who could be ready for a breakout year, caught seven
passes for 142 yards and was Young's primary target most of the
game as J.J. Stokes drew extra coverage on the other side. Stokes
caught just four passes for 33 yards but nonetheless showed some
significant progress. For example: fighting for extra yardage and
requiring the Dolphins to gang-tackle him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about some of those other areas:
</P>
<P>
   _The backups. The 49ers gained 255 yards on 36 offensive plays
with the starters in the game and 66 yards on 28 plays with backups
in the game. Backups on both sides were on the field, with the
49ers' defenders unable to get away from blocks, when rookie John
Avery ran 71 yards for the winning touchdown early in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _The running game. Not counting scrambles by Young, the 49ers
rushed for 33 yards on 21 carries, an average of barely a yard and
a half. The four-game rushing average is a dismal 2.3 yards a
carry. Coaches admit they are starting to get concerned; Mariucci,
who has been trying to open up the offense this summer, said he
might need to put more emphasis on the running game again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not run the ball like we intended to last year or
hoped to this year,'' Mariucci said. ``We need to be better in our
running game. That's an absolute must.''
</P>
<P>
   _The kicking. Last week, Mariucci said he would look for chances
to try a field goal more than he might during the season. But when
the 49ers had an opportunity, on 4th-and-2 at the Miami 32-yard
line in the third quarter, he called instead for a pass.
Druckenmiller, who completed just 5 of 12 for 34 yards with an
interception, threw incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said he didn't want Becksvoort to attempt a 50-yarder
into the wind. But for the second week in a row, he also was
critical of Becksvoort's kickoffs, principally the first of the
game when the kicker slipped and the ball traveled only to the
28-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be better in that area,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of 49ERS (100127 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Becksvoort, who said he made a 58-yarder in the same direction in
warmups (the wind changed during the game), has tried, and made,
only one field goal in four exhibition games, and that was a
31-yarder in a dome. It is known to get windy at Candlestick Point
in the fall, too, but Mariucci chose not to see what Becksvoort
could do on a field-goal attempt in those circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to hit that field goal if he wanted me to,''
Becksvoort said.
</P>
<P>
   From Mariucci's comments, it appears the 49ers will plan to take
a look at some other kickers who will become available this week.
All NFL teams must trim their roster to 60 players by tomorrow; for
the 49ers, that means a reduction of 17.

   1. PRINCESS DIANA : A LOOK BACK Who could forget her? The
``people's princess,'' was a devoted mother and determined
humanitarian who died one year ago at the height of her popularity.
This cover story from Biography magazine takes a look back at the
life of Princess Diana, who felt she was just beginning to fulfill
her personal destiny. By Dorothy Rompalske. 4,000 words. 2. DUMB
DOLPHINS? SCIENTISTS NOW SAY EVEN RATS ARE SMARTER Dolphins, with
their streamlined bodies and permanent smiles, have long been
thought to be among the smartest creatures in the ocean. Stories of
drowning sailors being helped to safety by the sleek mammals are as
old as the sea. No one who has seen them perform stunts can fail to
be impressed. But scientists have now gone to the core of the
dolphin mind, minutely studying inner brain structures. The
dolphin, they conclude, is in most ways quite low in intelligence -
below even pigeons, and rats. From Der Spiegel. 800 words. (English
translation available.)
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
IRELAND'S UNCERTAIN PEACE At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering
and grumbling its way toward a highly uncertain peace. Although it
withstood one severe challenge this summer, the Omagh bombing is a
threat even more tragic and perilous. By John Lloyd. From Foreign
Affairs magazine. 1,800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
VIAGRA AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS Reading the headlines about
Viagra, what popped into the head of this typical, fun-loving
economist? After a series of calculations estimating the gross
domestic product and so forth, he came to realize that Viagra
signifies how economics is not about wealth - it's about the
pursuit of happiness. By Paul Krugman. From The New York Times
Magazine. 800 words.

ONTOGENY RECAPITULATED Biologists are learning to turn on the genes
that make our cells young. With them, we might repair our bones,
replenish our blood, replace our limbs - and, maybe, some brain
cells too. By Gary Taubes. From Discover magazine. 1,500 words +

confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital. Eve Schaenen gives tips on events,
sightseeing, hotels and restaurants in this German city. From New
York Times Way To Go! 1,500 words + photos + map. 7. TODAY'S
BLOCKBUSTER HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT FACTORY One writer adds a few jokes,
another beefs up romance, still another polishes dialogue - these
days, a big budget movie travels an ever-growing conveyor belt of
specialists to production. By Jaime Wolf. From The New York Times
Magazine. 2,000 words. 8. From NATURE NEWS SERVICE (Embargo : 18h00
GMT Wednesday August 26. N/A France and Spain.)
</P>
<P>
   A. Feminine Attractions : What is it about a face that makes it
attractive? Attraction seems to lie in features perceived as more
feminine - in males as well as females, - according to a new
report. B. Starving The Immune System : Malnutrition can kill, but
often the cause of death is an infectious disease rather than a
direct lack of nutrients. The susceptibility to infection in people
with low body weight is linked to a suppressed immune system, but
it was never clear how. A new report describes why starvation diets
have such a detrimental effect on the immune system. C. To
Canterbury, By Computer : The Canterbury Tales is a classic of
early modern English literature. Written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the
14th century, one would have thought that the text of such a
prominent work would have been settled centuries ago - but far from
it. Six hundred years later, 20th-century computing is pointing the
way towards a radical reassessment of Chaucer's work.

ATTACKING HIV An infectious-disease specialist at the Dana-Farber
Center Institute in Boston has created an antibody that attacks HIV
inside T cells. If the trials are successful, doctors may have a
new weapon against AIDS. By Josie Glausiusz. From Discover
magazine. 700 words + photo.

CLINTON'S LIST OF CHALLENGES NEEDS SERIOUS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My disappointment in Bill Clinton is deep and broad. How could
he? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you how: He didn't ask me. I'd have told him what the
``seven big long-term challenges'' facing the country are. Instead,
in a recent but widely ignored political speech in California, he
listed his own magnificent seven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a joke. Not that his list doesn't contain legitimate stuff
about which someone should worry. But his list proves he's lost
touch with the average American, who is, as you know, the American
who thinks he's above average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is Clinton's list and my helpful thoughts about why they're
so dumb. (No need to thank me. It's my job.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We have got to stop playing with whether we're an
isolationist power or whether we're going to lead the world for
peace and freedom and prosperity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No nation led by a man whose list of girlfriends is longer than
the list of names in the Hope, Ark., phone book is an isolationist
anything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We have got to build one America across the lines the divide
us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, no. The lines that divide us are called borders. Borders are
good. They keep Iowa from leaking into Missouri. They keep New
Hampshire from claiming to be Vermont. They keep cartographers
employed. These lines are not a problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We have got to look out for the next generation and the
implications of the retirement of the Baby Boomers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why should we worry about people who insist they are smarter
than we are? The next generation hasn't listened to us for years.
What makes Clinton think they're about to start now? And if the
Baby Boomers want to retire, let 'em. It'll mean fewer of them on
the highways at rush hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``No serious person believes we have the best system of
elementary and secondary education in the world. . . Until we can
say we do, we will never be what we ought to be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quality is fine, but if you get to be the best in the world at
something, people resent you. Why else do you think you see so many
``Yankees go home'' signs all over the world? It's because the
Yankees are, at the moment, the best in the world _ about 60 games
over .500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We've got to prove that we can grow the economy and improve
the environment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, first we've got to prove we can get back to using the word
grow correctly. But that's probably a lost cause. Bill Clinton has
been talking about how to ``grow the economy'' for so long that it
almost sounds right. Can we outgrow it? Probably not, but let's
try. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We've got a great economic recovery, but there are places _
cities, rural areas, Indian reservations _ where there is no free
enterprise economic recovery.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cities, rural areas and reservations? That's about the whole
country. Well, wait. Maybe he means this been a recovery only for
suburban malls and small towns. And that's unfair. So let's tear
down all those dispiriting shopping centers and, instead, plant law
schools. So many lawyers are tied up working the Clinton scandals
that now there aren't enough to let Americans file all the
frivolous suits they love and that keep the economy humming along. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Finally, health care.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Health care, shmealth care. If we keep improving health care,
some day everyone will live to 110 (except Clinton, whom Hillary
may kill Jan. 21, 2001). Then we'll have to listen to a lot of
110-year-olds talk about the good old days. You know, back when
there were only seven big long-term challenges. &QL;
</P>

   &UR; THE NAPOLEON OF CRIME: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ADAM WORTH, MASTER
THIEF &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ben Macintyre. Delta, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorian era's most famous crook was an ingenious
quick-change artist whose career culminated in the heist of
Gainsborough's celebrated portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire;
after his death, he was mourned by his nemesis, William Pinkerton,
as one of the ``great gentlemen thieves.'' Last year, John Mortimer
called this ``a hilarious and highly readable account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOTEL EDEN: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ron Carlson. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   With their self-deprecating narrators and confiding tone, these
12 tales invite the reader's participation, making the frequently
farfetched scenarios _ a baseball player becomes famous by
accidentally killing 11 spectators with his hitting, for example _
believable. Even the most realistic stories, about a rafting trip
on the Green River or the sexual awakening of a college student on
summer vacation, have weird, surprising moments. Last year,
reviewer Margot Livesey admired the ``lavish imagination'' of the
author, calling him ``a master of that rarity in contemporary
fiction, the happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLASS, PAPER, BEANS: REVELATIONS ON THE NATURE AND VALUE OF
ORDINARY THINGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Leah Hager Cohen. Doubleday, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing her attention on her morning newspaper, her coffee and a
glass tumbler, the author explores in meticulous detail the
history, politics and economics behind these common objects, and
their hidden connections. ``After you read it, nothing ... will
seem ordinary again,'' Jeanne Schinto wrote last year. A more
cosmic look at how things tick,  &UR; THE FABRIC OF REALITY: THE SCIENCE
OF PARALLEL UNIVERSES _ AND ITS IMPLICATIONS &LR; , by David Deutsch
(Penguin, $14.95), maintains that quantum theory _ which allows for
a multitude of other universes _ is not just a measuring tool but a
serious explanation for how the world really works. The book ``is
full of refreshingly oblique, provocative insights,'' George
Johnson wrote in in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DOCTOR DOGBODY'S LEG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Norman Hall. Owl/Holt, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In an 18th-century British pub called the Cheerful Tortoise, a
Royal Navy surgeon spins a series of increasingly outlandish yarns,
each capped by a different version of how he lost his ``larboard''
leg. This seafaring adventure, reissued as part of the publisher's
Heart of Oak Sea Classics series, is ``about the jolliest bit of
chaff one is likely to come across in a long month of Sundays,''
Percy Hutchison wrote in 1940. Another title in the series,  &UR; THE
BLACK SHIP &LR; , by Dudley Pope ($15), is a nonfiction account of the
bloody mutiny aboard the British frigate H.M.S. Hermione in the
Caribbean in 1797, and the ship's subsequent recapture. In 1964 one
critic called this ``an exciting story'' and ``a thoughtful study
of those inexhaustible subjects, discipline and leadership.''

   By Enrique Krauze. Translated by Hank Heifetz. Harper Perennial,
$18.

   This ambitious study takes a volcanic view of Mexico's history
as a series of eruptions of its Aztec-Spanish colonial past in the
present, a connection that explains the nation's semisacred
attitudes toward authority. ``This shrewd and in many ways brave
book is necessary reading,'' Sarah Kerr wrote in 1997. Jeffery M.
Paige, the author of  &UR; COFFEE AND POWER: REVOLUTION AND THE RISE OF
DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AMERICA &LR;  (Harvard University, $18.95), argues
that the only way to understand Central American politics is by
focusing on the coffee-growing elites that have long dominated the
region. Last year, reviewer Thomas Carothers found the approach
limited, but said ``Paige has illuminated a path for comprehending
countries'' that are often poorly understood.

   &UR; DANCE OF THE HAPPY SHADES: AND OTHER STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alice Munro. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In this early collection of short fiction, the author focuses on
the revelatory moments that bubble up in the lives of farmers and
townspeople in southwestern Ontario. ``Munro poses more questions
than answers _ a refreshing strategy,'' Martin Levin wrote here in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIMEQUAKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Kurt Vonnegut. Berkley, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author mixes the best bits from an unworkable novel set deep
in Vonnegut country with a running commentary on his own life and
its relationship with his imagination. It's a strange but ``highly
entertaining'' brew, Valerie Sayers wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD: LIVING WITH LOSS THROUGH THE YEARS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ann K. Finkbeiner. Johns Hopkins University, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author, whose 18-year-old son died in a train accident,
interviews others who have lost children and finds that although
acute grief usually eases in a few years, the bereaved never
entirely ``let go.'' In 1996, Winifred Gallagher called this a
``powerful book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLU'S HANGING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lois-Ann Yamanaka. Bard/Avon, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Three precocious children in a Hawaiian village are beset by
misfortunes and humiliations after the death of their mother and
the descent of their father into poverty. The novel ``fluidly
explores the brutal divide between family duty and
self-preservation,'' Megan Harlan wrote last year. &QL;

 IN A SUMMER OF SEARCHES, A RETURN TO LOW TECH  
(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For much of the summer, hundreds of searchers dressed in
camouflage and armed with tracking devices that detect the
slightest motion of warm-blooded bipeds have been scouring the
woods of North Carolina and the slick-rock canyons of Utah looking
for three of the United States' most-wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   They have used helicopters, night-vision scopes, heat sensors,
motion detectors, smoke bombs, armored personnel carriers, small
planes and radios with encrypted transmissions _ all for naught.
</P>
<P>
   The technology may be James Bondian. But what the searchers
really need, says one frustrated sheriff, is a snitch and a good
bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   The searches are among the biggest ever mounted, authorities
say, and they have relied heavily on technology and gadgetry that
make the manhunts in movies like ``Cool Hand Luke'' seem quaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``These motion detectors, they're largely worthless as near as I
can tell,'' said Sheriff Mike Lacy, of San Juan County, Utah, where
a dragnet has been used in an attempt to find two men suspected of
killing a police officer and wounding three others. ``You pick up
something and you can't tell if it's a cow or a deer or a dog or a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, nearly 500 people were involved in the search for
Alan Pilon and Jason McVean, the fugitives who vanished into the
red rock country of the Southwest in late May. But the search party
dwindled to a few sheriff's officers and amateur bounty hunters who
keep bumping into the deputies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, an army of more
than 200 people were engaged at the height of the hunt for Eric
Rudolph, who has been charged with the death of a security guard in
the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a white separatist, had disappeared into the woods
shortly after the bombing on Jan. 29. He is also wanted for
questioning about three bombings in Georgia, including one during
the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   As the North Carolina task force dwindled, that search became
entangled with freelance bounty hunters and volunteers _ notably
James ``Bo'' Gritz, the former Green Beret colonel who makes his
living selling survivalist gear and railing on his radio talk show
about millennial conspiracies. On Friday, even Gritz gave up and
ordered his troops to prepare to break up their paramilitary camp
near Andrews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is believed to be hiding in the Nantahala National
Forest, south of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He has a
$1 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodhounds are still used. But heat has been a hindrance to the
dogs, particularly in the arid West. The hot weather _ in Utah,
temperatures have reached 106 degrees _ has also hobbled some of
the heat-seeking devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have people giving you tips, or you don't do
basic police work, it can get pretty tough to find a guy,'' said
Capt. Terry Blue of the Montgomery County sheriff's office in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, officers from Blue's small office nabbed a
fugitive who was wanted in the killings of two campers. The
suspect, James A. Finley Jr., had bragged to friends that he could
elude authorities as well as Rudolph. But after a six-day search,
he was caught by men on foot, with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the search party had done their homework, reasoning
that Finley might return to an old hunting hideout he had used
before. They also had a tip from a person who reported him trying
to enter a cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came running right to where we were waiting,'' said Blue.
``But we had everybody helping us. You've got a little different
mind-set up there with Rudolph. A lot of people aren't so eager to
turn him in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   T-shirts that say ``Run Rudolph Run'' have sold not far from the
search base for Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   A 31-year-old carpenter with survivalist skills, Rudolph has
left money behind after stealing groceries, and is said to have a
polite demeanor _ endearing qualities to some in the Appalachians
who resent the show of force by state and federal law-enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is a ninth-grade dropout who is on the FBI's 10
most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the search has centered on a relatively small
30-square-mile area in the mountains. But it is a thicket of
rhododendrons and hardwood brush, with plenty of caves and hollows
in which to hide.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Utah search has centered on 5,600 square miles
of public land _ an area bigger than the state of Connecticut _
that contains part of the Navajo Indian Reservation, the canyons
around Lake Powell, the expanse of Monument Valley, the high
reaches of the Henry Mountains and two areas whose names say it
all: the Dark Canyon Primitive Area and the Grand Gulch Primitive
Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go hide out there now and nobody could ever find me,''
said Lacy, whose office is leading the search. ``There's plenty of
water, and food and old mine shafts to hide in if you know what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the aid of the National Guard and the array of
technology, the Utah search is back to square one, with few
substantial leads, said the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to trying to do the leg work and following up on
tips,'' Lacy said. ``One day we'll catch them, or find them dead.
Could be a long time, though.''

 U.S. EMBARKS ON A STRUGGLE, WITH DOMESTIC COSTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Certainly the images and the oratory last week
were those of a fast-spreading war.
</P>
<P>
   In the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, Tomahawk cruise missiles
roared from the decks of U.S. warships, bound for targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan, where they smashed into what U.S. officials
describe as a terrorist training center and a chemical-weapons
plant.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some of President Clinton's harshest
congressional critics put aside partisanship and saluted the
nation's scandal-burdened leader for responding to terrorism with
military strikes. Days before, in East Africa, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had wandered the rubble of the bombed-out U.S.
Embassy in Kenya, comparing the scene here to her childhood
memories of the blitz in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like being in a war,'' she said after returning to
Washington from Africa to help plan the attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan. ``I think we are embarked on a venture in which we have to
deal over the long run with what is the very serious threat to our
way of life.'' Clinton warned that the United States was facing ``a
long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between the
rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Battle
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the first blow in the struggle. The bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York in 1993 shocked Americans out of
feeling safe in their geographic isolation. And the U.S. military
had struck back before, at targets in Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's attack was portrayed as more than just
retaliation; this was a pre-emptive strike against a continuing
threat. And, ominously, the speechmakers were saying not that an
enemy had been crushed, but that a battle had been joined.
</P>
<P>
   So is the United States prepared for the consequences of what it
now insists is a global war on terrorism? Experts in terrorism _
and more specifically, in the activities of Osama bin Laden, the
multimillionaire Saudi-born extremist believed responsible for the
embassy attacks this month in Kenya and Tanzania _ say that if the
Clinton administration is true to its word, Washington is embarked
on a decades-long battle in which Americans may find themselves
increasingly targeted on the streets of their own cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a war, they say, in which the United States is confronted
by an enemy who is difficult to identify and harder to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States understands what it's in
for,'' said David M. Anderson, a senior lecturer at the School of
Oriental and African Studies in London, who has studied the Islamic
fundamentalist groups in East Africa that have been tied to bin
Laden. ``This will be a long, perhaps never-ending, attritional
war. Pandora's box has been opened, and it won't be closed again.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism experts wonder if the United States is ready to add
itself to a roster of nations, including Britain, Ireland and
Israel, that have curbed cherished civil rights in order to combat
terrorism waged on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Irish government responded to a bombing in
Northern Ireland that killed 28 people by announcing ``draconian''
measures to deal with terrorism, including a proposal that would
make it easier to hold suspects without charging them with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan, the Pentagon
refused to provide basic information about how the air strikes were
carried out _ a degree of official censorship by the military
rarely seen in Washington since World War II. Lawmakers have cited
the embassy bombings in calling for Clinton to revoke an executive
order that bans assassination as an instrument of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan seem to reflect the move by
the Clinton administration away from what had been its preferred
course in dealing with international terrorists _ treating them as
criminals and bringing them to justice through the niceties of law
enforcement, trial by jury and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Due process may now be a luxury. While bin Laden is not known to
face charges in any U.S. court, the United States was willing to
dispatch dozens of cruise missiles to Afghanistan to destroy his
training camps and to kill anyone unlucky enough to have been there
as they landed, including bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been and will be times when law enforcement and
diplomatic tools are simply not enough, when our very national
security is challenged,'' the president said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that by retaliating for the
embassy bombings, bin Laden and his followers will think twice
before striking again against U.S. targets. It is a popular
strategy among many of the president's political foes. The attacks
in Afghanistan and Sudan drew widespread bipartisan praise on
Capitol Hill, where Clinton was otherwise under siege over his
acknowledgment of an improper relationship with a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to applaud the president,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and who earlier
in the week had called the president a ``jerk'' over his handling
of the intern scandal. ``I want to give him credit for being
willing to take this action at this time.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Retaliation
</P>
<P>
   But while retaliation pays early political dividends and may
serve as a deterrent, history shows that one act of retaliation may
simply inspire another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the United States bombed Libya after terrorists linked
to the Libyan government killed an American soldier at a Berlin
discotheque. Two years later, a Pan Am jumbo jet blew up over
Scotland, an attack that killed 270 people and was blamed by the
Justice Department on two Libyan intelligence agents. And the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York demonstrated that
foreign terrorists had already arrived on U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned last week of the consequences of a tougher line
in dealing with terrorists: ``What I think is very important for
the American people to understand is that there may in fact be
retaliatory actions. We are very concerned about this.'' Even
before the U.S. strikes, half a dozen U.S. embassies in Europe,
Africa and the Middle East had been effectively shut down after
warnings that they were next on the list of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Some sort of retaliation for last week's air strikes seems
inevitable, if only because bin Laden's Muslim extremist followers
are so numerous and far-flung _ from Pakistan to the Philippines,
from Sudan to Afghanistan _ and so eager to follow his edict to
make targets of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The loose nature of this network, though, presents problems for
Americans in thinking about how to confront it. Focusing just on
the leader, some experts argue, is not a promising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden is a bogeyman,'' said Anderson, the African
specialist. ``He didn't build the bombs in East Africa. He didn't
plant them. He just paid for them. There are lots of other small
groups who would have been happy to take his money and carry this
out. I don't think the United States really understands the way the
activists among Islamic radicals have broken into very small
fragments. They are connected to each other, but only loosely.''
</P>
<P>
   So targeting them for retaliation, he said, is likely to be
difficult. For now, the United States is eager to paint bin Laden
as the chief architect of the bombings in East Africa _ ``perhaps
the pre-eminent organizer and financier of international terrorism
in the world today,'' as Clinton put it last week.
</P>
<P>
   But should bin Laden be captured or killed, there are other,
more shadowy extremists who appear likely to take his place in
their holy war against the United States. In a sense, bin Laden's
notoriety has made it easier for Washington to mount its global war
against terrorism. Without him, the United States might be left to
battle an enemy that is increasingly dangerous but without an
obvious face.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The savings that may not be
 &HT;    (For release, Aug. 26, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida, chock-full of ex-New Yorkers, this year stole a
page from New York City's political gambitry. State legislators,
flushed with a sales tax surplus, decided to curtail collections a
trifle with a one-week abatement of its 6 percent sales tax, but
only on certain items of clothing costing $50 or less.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, on the other hand, is waiving its 8 1/4 percent
sales tax on most clothing and shoes for items costing $500 or
less. Both were timed for the week that back-to-school clothing
sales would be at their peak.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the two examples is best focused in a New York
Times illustration of savings on a pair of running shoes. The sales
tax waiver ``will mean a savings of $7.42 on a $90 pair of Nike Air
Max running shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, however, with its $50 cap, there would be no savings
on the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, others soon will begin following the disparate examples
of New York City and Florida. Legislators will commence issuing
their own version of sales tax savings because, come election time,
politicians love to point out that they voted for a tax respite.
</P>
<P>
   All this tells us that the states, or in the case of New York
City, the cities, are floating in surplus funds while habitually
telling the public there is not enough money to go around for
schools, roads, etc. (During Florida's sales tax relaxation last
week, I got my new property tax notice; it's going up.)
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the sales tax on clothing items for one week amounts
to a tax break of $19.2 million in Florida, or enough to build some
schools, or hire a bunch of teachers, or more police, or to fix up
the jails where we don't have to release convicted murderers
because the prisons are too crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, $19 million won't come close to answering our funding
problems, but it can make some dents in some badly needed public
services.
</P>
<P>
   I would not be carping about this were it not for a suspicion
that the sales tax abatement has more to do with helping out
retailers than it does families buying back-to-school clothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty nasty generality, but let me cite an example.
</P>
<P>
   A mother of three, a conservative shopper, had been scouting
clothing sales for several weeks prior to Florida's tax-free week.
She carefully noticed the continuing sales prices, their relation
to the $50 week cap, and what would or would not be considered
eligible for the tax break. (No ties, Monica, but suspenders are
OK.)
</P>
<P>
   In particular, at this one store, she zeroed in on an article of
clothing that was marked at two for $13. When she went into the
store last week, during the tax break, that clothing was now marked
at $10 apiece, thus more than negating the tax savings and putting
a bigger profit into the store's cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this is the naivete of many shoppers who come to accept a
routine 10 percent off sale as day-to-day stuff, but who smash down
the doors to get into a store when the 6 percent sales tax is
waived _ even though the 10 percent savings has been eliminated by
shrewd retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, I do not accuse all retailers of taking advantage of
the politically motived savings being passed out but there are
those out there who do _ and, in at least this one cited case, did.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with retailers doing better business, but
let us be clear about what is transpiring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the politicians are gathering good-guy points for
their efforts. The New York State Legislature, feeling the heat
generated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's example,
already has voted to eliminate, beginning Dec. 1, 1999, the state
sales tax on clothing and shoes costing less than $110.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend with a future, but before you begin getting excited
about it, wonder if the total savings will be there, or if
retailers are the eventual beneficiaries of the savings.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Psychological gender genocide
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's more than one kind of terrorism in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   What will the world do when half of Afghanistan's population is
put into virtual slavery? The prospect is imminent. The radical
Taliban is within a relative few square miles and maybe only days
of securing its rule all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, a tyranny that is now broad will become universal,
with a zealotry and absolutism that makes the ayatollahs of Iran's
Islamic republic look like a fun bunch. The Taliban's fierce
version of Islamic law falls on all of the population but by far
the heaviest on the women.
</P>
<P>
   Afghani women may go out in public only in an enveloping cloak
with just a small grid open for sight. Their shoes must make no
sound (so no man will be inflamed by thoughts of hidden high
heels). Women in public must be accompanied by a male relative; one
found with an unrelated man was stoned to death by religious
rulers. Tailors who dare to measure women for clothing are
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Women in public violation of any edict are summarily beaten in
the street by religious police using clubs, tree branches or
electric cables.
</P>
<P>
   Little-educated in the past, Afghani women are now banned from
all government schools. They may be educated only up to the age of
8, and then only in the Koran. They have been barred from nearly
all work. Now, even home vocational classes _ in sewing and
weaving, for instance _ have been forbidden. Home windows must be
covered if any passing man might glimpse a woman through them.
</P>
<P>
   Afghani women have been shunted from most hospitals to inferior
clinics. One died because it was illegal for physicians to remove
her clothing to treat her burns, lest the doctors become sexually
excited even by charred nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of what passes for international law discourage
intervention in the internal affairs of nations. Custom warns us
against carrying our religious or cultural revulsions into
over-strong state action; that way lie endless wars. And where does
a difference in degree go over into a difference in kind? If the
Taliban were penalized, shouldn't Saudi Arabia be punished, too,
for its similar if lesser offenses to women?
</P>
<P>
   Still, some abuses are so broad and so grave that the norms of
restraint have to be questioned. Remember the million or more who
died in Cambodia while the world stood off from the internal
affairs of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, some 8 million women are having their very lives
stolen, under religious cover.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. agencies are pressing the Taliban clerics to soften their
policies. Some nations will refuse to recognize the tyranny,
including the United States, whose secretary of state, Madeleine
Albright, bluntly calls the Taliban ``despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   But mere shunning can mean little to a regime that wishes to
ward off modern life and anyway is receiving mixed signals from
outside. International companies are competing there for natural
gas rights with the easy amorality of main-chance commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is making life for its girls and women almost
literally a living hell. Can't appalled nations, on their behalf,
at least somehow make life for the Taliban pretty much the same?

 A LAND WHERE GOD IS WORKING OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ In southern Nigeria, which is mainly Christian,
religious bumper stickers abound. ``Be a sweatless winner,'' says
one. ``Work with us at the Living Faith Church.'' Another advises
that ``Jesus Christ gives, heals and delivers.'' Or there is this
simple admonition: ``Be careful, God is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhortations can be hard to read through the black exhaust
fumes that belch from Nigeria's crumbling fleet of vehicles, but
there is no mistaking the religious fervor that has gripped the
southern half of Africa's giant as misery has grown. In Lagos,
billboards advertising cut-rate Bibles hover over streets seething
with people fighting to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, where Islam is dominant, religious belief is no
less fervent, but it takes another form. Ordered, hierarchical,
rigorous, fatalistic, the faith of the dominant Hausa and Fulani
ethnic groups provides the bedrock of a society still structured
around the authority of traditional Muslim rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's motto is simple: ``Unity and Faith.'' But there is so
little of the former and so much of the latter that the survival of
Africa's giant is no simple affair. As Nigeria moves toward a
treacherous democratic transition next year, after decades of
military rule, unity is as fragile as the religious faith is
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is faith, in the end, that may offer the nation its best
hope for unity. The simple habit _ and its extraordinary intensity
_ is something that almost every Nigerian believer seems to share.
</P>
<P>
   God, constantly invoked, works overtime in Nigeria. He alone,
for many people, can explain how an oil-rich country came to find
itself without gasoline; how more than $10 billion a year in oil
revenue can be stolen or squandered; how a longed-for democracy has
taken the form of a repetitive mirage. If there is a single refrain
from the suffering, it is ``What this country needs is a
God-fearing ruler.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Nigeria finds one _ and Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
who took office in June, shows signs of more probity than his
predecessors _ the wounds are deep. Old fault lines _ ethnic,
cultural and social _ have been worsened by a spreading poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen apart once _ in 1967, when the southeastern Ibo
declared the state of Biafra _ Nigeria is haunted by fears of going
down Rwanda's path. Because of its weight in Africa _ in
population, resources, universities, military power or its vibrant
press _ such a road would be a cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the fissures in this country, which was thrown together
on the whim of a British colonial governor in 1914, those based on
religion may be the most treacherous. But it is still not clear
whether religion will ultimately push Nigerians toward fracture or
reconcile them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three main ethnic groups, the northern Hausas are Muslim,
the southeastern Ibos are overwhelmingly Christian and the
southwestern Yorubas mixed.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only part of the picture: There are more than 200
other groups of various religions; the relaxed, fluid Islam of many
Yorubas has nothing to do with that of the Hausas; paganism is
strong in some areas; thriving Baptist, Pentecostal, Catholic,
Seventh-Day Adventist and other churches compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion _ whether Christian, Muslim or pagan _ is a booming
business throughout Nigeria,'' said Onaolapo Soleye, a former
finance minister from the southwest. ``But in the north, religion
is different: more fatalistic and more all-encompassing. Everything
there is Allah's work. Well, we do not think it's Allah's work that
more and more people are poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments reflect a thinly veiled resentment in the south
over what is seen as the long domination by northern, devoutly
Muslim generals. The most reviled was Gen. Sani Abacha, the
dictator who died suddenly in June. There is a widespread
conviction in Lagos and other southern towns that a northern Islam
has held sway too long.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's predecessor, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, enraged many
Christians with actions that included steering Nigeria into the
Organization of the Islamic Conference in 1986. In the early 1990s,
riots between Muslims and minority Christians in two northern towns
left more than 1,000 people dead. The army clamped down, but the
danger still lurks.
</P>
<P>
   Babangida, now in retirement, has abruptly become vociferous
about the need for compromise in the interests of Nigerian unity.
``When I decreed a two-party system for the 1993 election, everyone
said there would be a Muslim-Christian split,'' he said. ``Well,
they were wrong. There were Muslims and Christians in both parties.
Nobody wants to break this country into pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent winner of that election was Moshood K.O. Abiola, a
Muslim and a Yoruba from the south who attended a Baptist school
and won huge support in the Islamic north. His following did
suggest that the religious divisions could be overcome, but then
the army annulled the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was jailed, and was still in detention when he died last
month. Now, with resentment about his loss running high, it will be
more difficult, perhaps impossible, to find a leader who can reach
across Nigeria's religious and regional divides.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there are voices of reason, including the emir of Kano and
other prominent northerners who suggest it is time that a
southerner rule.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in any part of the country that it was God's
intervention that saved Nigeria from Abacha. On that point, unity
is absolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians really do pray,'' said Bashir Ikara, a university
professor in the northern town of Kaduna. ``There may be a tug or
war between us, but we are united in our prayers. And tell me, what
does the average northern Nigerian really have to show for the long
domination of a small northern caste?''
</P>
<P>
   In a Lagos slum, Stephen Aiyeyimi, an unemployed university
graduate and an ardent Christian, expressed similar sentiments.
``Everyone in Nigeria is very close to God,'' he said. ``That is
because we have all been pushed to the wall, northerners and
southerners. We have been made poor, we have little money to meet
our needs, and so there is a tendency to want to depend on a
strange, unknowable force.''

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Who can forget Crocodile Dundee?
 &HT;    More than a decade ago the backwoods Australian arrived in
America in the form of the wry, irrepressible Paul Hogan and took
the box office by storm in two Dundee adventures.
 &HT;    He hosted the Oscars, adding a much needed touch of Aussie
irreverence to the whole overhyped proceedings and became the
definite flavor of the year.
 &HT;    While Dundee disappeared into the bush somewhere Down Under,
Hogan stuck around. He made a handful of movies _ none of which
came close to duplicating his Dundee popularity.
 &HT;    Today Hogan lives in Santa Barbara with his Dundee costar, now
his wife, Linda Kozlowski. She gave birth on Aug. 10 to their first
son, Chance. (Hogan, 58, has five children and eight grandchildren
from an earlier marriage.)
 &HT;    He also has an offbeat new movie in which he is virtually
unrecognizable from the weatherbeaten, wisecracking wild man of Oz.
``Floating Away,'' (airing Aug. 30 on Showtime) is a picaresque
comedy drama with Rosanna Arquette as a boozy mother trying to
regain custody of her baby. Along the way she meets Shane (Hogan),
a womanizing, reformed alcoholic, and a paraplegic.
 &HT;    If Hogan was trying to shatter his swaggering Dundee image, this
role would seem a good place to start. Yet Shane shareS two
important traits with Dundee, Hogan said: ``Shane has a crusty
humor and he's the biggest liar in the world.''
 &HT;    Indeed the movie's running gag is that every woman hears a
different story of how Shane happens to be in a wheelchair. He's an
ex-stuntman, he brags to one lass, and while working on a film with
Raquel Welch, she insisted he make love to her on horseback. He
tumbled and ... hence the wheelchair.
 &HT;    ``He's a first class b.s. artist,'' Hogan says proudly of his
character. ``Shane exploits his situation _ if he can get sympathy
or money from it, that's fine with him.''
 &HT;    Of course there's a serious reason for Shane's paralysis and the
part comes complete with an all-stops-out death scene, one any
actor would relish. But it's not exactly what one expects from one
of Australia's favorite import. ``People who expect me to do comedy
all the time or play some triumphant figure might be in for a
surprise with this one,'' Hogan said.
 &HT;    After Dundee hit pay dirt, Hollywood offered the craggy faced
Hogan the earth. He starred in ``Almost an Angel'' (1990) and a
western, ``Lightning Jack'' (1994) _ both box office
disappointments. In 1996 he popped up in the movie ``Flipper''
(based on the TV series) and that too sank at the box office.
 &HT;    ``That wasn't my film, '' he explains, ``I was an actor for hire
in that one. But I did rewrite my lines a little.''
 &HT;    But he regrets nothing about it. ``Linda and I and the dog went
to the Bahamas for 10 weeks and I was nicely paid and got to swim
with the dolphins. But it was incredibly boring just being an actor
and I decided I didn't want to do that for a living.''
 &HT;    He admits he never expected to be an A-list movie star. Dundee
was a shot in the dark that just happened to hit box office gold.
``You can't top that,'' Hogan said, ``so you don't try. I don't
expect to suddenly come up with a grand idea tomorrow and write the
script and produce a movie that's going to be more successful than
that.''
 &HT;    And since he didn't expect the success in the first place, he
hasn't been devastated by the fact that he hasn't managed to
duplicate it.
 &HT;    ``Look I realize they don't sit around in Hollywood saying,
'Now, let's see: 'Should we hire Harrison Ford or Paul Hogan for
this movie?''' he shrugs. ``And Linda doesn't get scripts because
they can't decide whether to hire her or Meryl Streep. I never
wanted to be a film star or an actor. These days what I get offered
is B-grade action scripts that none of the big stars will do. So I
don't do them either. I also get sent all the stuff that has the
word Australian in it _ whether it's a head nurse or a nun, they
send it up to me.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Hogan, who alone and unaided revitalized the Aussie
tourist industry with his ``shrimp on the barbie'' commercials for
his native land, says he's been making good money again as a
pitchman _ selling Suburu cars on TV in North America _ and he no
longer has to work as hard as he once did.
 &HT;    ``They pay me well, as well they might, because I've got
credibility,'' he says.
 &HT;    Though mainstream Hollywood is not exactly beating a path to his
door, he says he's perfectly content. Even more since the arrival
of Baby Hogan. ``Right now I've got nothing on my agenda _ just to
practice being a Dad again. It's been a long time _ and I've
forgotten a lot.''

 TO SAVE THE RUBLE, RUSSIA DANCES WITH THE WOLVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally file on Saturday, August(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, armchair diplomats took comfort in their
mastery of heady terms like ``throw-weight'' and ``detente,'' and
tested their mettle parsing the differences between SALT talks and
START talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the Cold War and the swift, furious opening of
financial markets in far-flung locales like Malaysia, Brazil and
the Czech Republic have changed all that. Now anyone interested in
world affairs has to contend with a new vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's woes of the past week have illustrated, the new
buzzwords of international diplomacy are ``devaluation,''
``currency speculation'' and ``debt moratorium'' _ terminology just
as opaque and loaded with free-floating dread as anything in the
Cold War lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, not only were Russian lawmakers calling for the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, but the world's financial
markets were being pummeled, largely because of fears set in motion
by the decision of Yeltsin's government to devalue the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation typically occurs when a country suffering through
an economic downturn decides it's time to lower the value of its
currency in relation to another _ usually the dollar _ to give its
exporters more muscle in international trade. A country's exports
suddenly become cheaper overseas and, ideally, local cash registers
start ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Russia decided to do just that, announcing that
it would let the value of its currency fall as low as 9.5 rubles to
the dollar from 6.5 rubles, effectively devaluing its currency by
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russia is not likely to get much of a boost from the
devaluation because the price of its most important export, oil,
has already plunged this year, as have prices for other basic
commodities the country exports.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia exported cars, CD players or personal computers,
devaluation might have helped undercut the prices of other
international competitors. But as any shopper knows, Russia makes
nothing that competes with brand names like Toyota, Sony and
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of devaluation is that it makes imports more
expensive. Since Russia imports quite a bit of food and other
staples, the average Russian is going to find it even harder to
make ends meet. And Russian financial institutions that owe
dollar-denominated loans are discovering that the cost of paying
off their debts will rise in direct proportion to the drop in the
ruble's value.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news all around. So, why did Russia devalue?
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no choice,'' said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for
Thomson Financial Services in Boston. ``You have everyone and their
mother trading against the ruble, and if you don't want it to fall
below a certain level the government has to go in there and defend
it. And the government didn't have the cash to do that, because
Russia is basically bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   What Russia has learned, as have several Asian countries that
are now economic basket cases, is that inviting market forces into
your economy also invites the wolves. Traders who make their living
betting on the direction of currency prices smell blood when a
strong currency masks a weak economy. Russia, which had already
squandered International Monetary Fund aid bolstering the ruble,
opted out of the blood bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians know that if they defend the currency's value,
it's just going into the pocket of some currency trader,'' Ms.
Kimelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also declared a debt moratorium last week, which amounts
to a 90-day breather on the repayment of $40 billion in foreign
loans and perhaps as much as $100 billion in ``hedges'' _ insurance
that traders and banks use to protect themselves from sudden
currency swings.
</P>
<P>
   Moratoriums typically give battered economies some wiggle room
by allowing lenders and borrowers to renegotiate loans. But the
tactic, which has had mixed results in countries like South Korea
and Indonesia over the last several months, does nothing to address
underlying economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Russia's moratorium was lauded by some analysts.
``I wouldn't have advised them to devalue,'' said Morris Goldstein,
a former IMF official and a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``I think it would have been
smarter to restructure the debt first.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But everyone has to be treated fairly for such a restructuring
to work, and foreign investors, who have grown used to reaping fat
profits in Russia, went into a tizzy last week when they learned
that some of the debt would be repriced more favorably for domestic
investors than for foreign investors, according to Credit Suisse
First Boston. Foreign investors, threatening never to open their
wallets in Russia again, quickly slapped down that proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Private jets are now ferrying foreign lenders into Russia to
repackage the debt in a way that all sides can agree on, and a new
proposal is expected by Monday. But while the debt restructuring
may calm Russian markets, the devaluation genie that has been let
out of the bottle may produce even more turmoil in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Russia carried more weight on the international
stage in the old world of detente than in the new world of
devaluation. It still sits atop a formidable nuclear stockpile, but
for all its military might the nation of 147 million people
currently lacks the economic heft of the temporarily declawed Asian
tigers. And in a world where vast sums of money zip across borders
with a few taps on a computer keyboard, the ruble is just a blip on
traders' screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Ms. Kimelman said. ``If Russia had the
wealth to support its geopolitical might, it would be a different
story. But they don't.''

 POLITICIANS: PEOPLE WHO NEVER SAY THEY'RE SORRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never admit fault or apologize after a car accident, especially
if you caused it. That's the standard warning of a personal-injury
lawyer, but unnecessary advice for politicians. Most would rather
be flayed than express actual contrition for a mistake, especially
if they have to use those two unthinkable words, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a simple, direct apology is often the one thing
voters most want to hear, as polls showed many Americans were
telling President Clinton last week. Such words are simply
unutterable for most public figures, whose fear of weakness is
hard-wired into their souls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's inability to use any form of the the word
``apologize'' last week in his speech to the United States about
his affair with Monica Lewinsky was the aspect of his remarks that
was most criticized the next day and placed him in the pantheon of
elected officials who couldn't quite say they were sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made'' is the famous circumlocution, and a
marvel of compact indirection, used by President Reagan to explain
the arms-for-hostages deal.
</P>
<P>
   More common is the phrase ``If I've offended anyone, I'm
sorry,'' used by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato after he mocked Lance Ito,
the Japanese-American judge who presided in the O.J. Simpson case;
it was a conditional construction that conceded no real ground to
his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   A more elaborate variation came from Sen. Bob Packwood in his
reference to women who accused him of physical trespass: ``Am I
sorry? Of course _ if I did the things that they said I did.''
</P>
<P>
   If an apology is absolutely required, its power can be reduced
with explanations, excuses and the half-hearted stiffness of a
schoolboy summoned to the front of the room.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurt Waldheim, the president of Austria and a Nazi
intelligence officer during World War II, had to apologize on
behalf of his country for Nazi war crimes, he did it this way:
``Obviously there is no collective guilt. Nevertheless, as head of
state of the Republic of Austria, I wish to apologize for Nazi
crimes committed by Austrians.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian politicians appear to have a better understanding of the
cathartic value of complete repentance, although Japan has long
refused to apologize for its wartime atrocities in Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more than unbearable for me to face you and make this
confession of my shameful deeds, and I deeply apologize,'' said
former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan in a 1988 admission of
abuse of power. ``The scar will be forever with me in my heart for
the people who have suffered, and for this I feel more regret than
I can express.'' Now that's remorse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the United States, though, the most effusive apologies are
often those made by politicians for someone else's mistakes. ``I
apologize to the citizens of Crown Heights, to the Rosenbaum family
and to all of the people that were affected by this,'' New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said recently, referring to the way his
predecessor, David Dinkins, conducted himself during the 1991
disturbances in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But after he criticized his electoral opponent, Ruth Messinger,
last year for failing to attend a Catholic Mass, he issued an
apology ``to anybody who feels they need an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush was full-throated when righting a
historical wrong. ``The internment of Americans of Japanese
ancestry was a great injustice,'' he said, ``and it will never be
repeated.'' But he was a bit more pragmatic in wishing he had never
raised taxes: ``I did it and I regret it and I regret it. Any time
you get hammered on something, I guess you want to redo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did express regret in his remarks last week, and said
his actions were wrong. In the taxonomy of political penitence,
that at least is a few degrees above the norm, as captured in this
classic 1987 statement from former New York Mayor Edward Koch,
referring to the president of one of the city's boroughs: ``If I've
insulted him in the past, then I'm sorry and I withdraw my remarks.
But I can't think of any.''

 LATEST FORMULA FOR PEACE: LIE ABOUT WHO'S IN CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If diplomats are sent abroad to lie for their
countries, sometimes their greatest contribution to peace can be to
sell creative, convenient and competing fictions to both sides in a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   As Chechnya went, so, perhaps, can go Kosovo. In both places the
ideals of absolute sovereignty and self-determination are bent
these days to make way for the notion that peace is more
complicated than either of those ideals permits.
</P>
<P>
   And not just in the lands of Eastern Europe. Something similar
is happening in far-flung corners of an ethnically divided world,
from Northern Ireland to Abkhazia to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is Chechnya, the secessionist province of southern Russia,
that has begun to serve as a model, at least for Kosovo. A brutal
war was brought to a halt in 1996 when both sides agreed to
contradictory pretenses. The bargain kept Chechnya legally a
territory within Russia, but the Chechens were left to run it on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Chechens, who had fought for independence, can behave as
if that was what they won. And the Russians, whose army was
humiliated, can insist they remain sovereign over a territory they
do not control.
</P>
<P>
   In this fine area between what the diplomats call de facto and
de jure (loose translation: really and legally), negotiators found
something perhaps more valuable than literal truth _ a bit of room
to stop the slaughter and buy some time by putting off a final
determination of sovereignty. Temporary peace may not be divine
justice, but it may be more infectious.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, of course, is that in a few years the politicians who
began the ethnic wars will have passed from the scene, opening the
way for other, newer politicians more capable of negotiating a
peace based on realities rather than fictions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats are thinking along those lines when they try to
stop the killing in Kosovo, the southern Serb province. Ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, are demanding
independence, but the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic refuses to
grant more than limited autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   So negotiators are pressing for a Chechnya-like solution: full
autonomy that amounts to de facto independence for Kosovo, with
legal sovereignty remaining with Belgrade (so long as the Kosovars
agree to protect the rights of the minority Serbs and Serb holy
places). The Kosovars would maintain current borders and reject any
political association with Albania or other surrounding states. And
international observers would monitor the whole semantic fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After all, said Moises Naim, the editor of the journal Foreign
Policy, ``The gap between international law and realities on the
ground is growing by the day, and new forms of arrangements are
growing, too, especially where borders become much more open to
trade and investment than to tolerance and ideas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Trend
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland and in the territories to which the
Palestinian Authority lays claim, as well as in the Abkhazia region
of Georgia and the Tatarstan republic of Russia, traditional ideas
of sovereignty are being subverted in the name of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend may be hard to see because it is surrounded by
ethnic cleansing and conflict,'' said Naim. ``But pressures are
building for more flexible notions of sovereignty. While people
claim borders are sacred, reality makes them very porous and in
many dimensions, irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul R. Williams worked as a State Department lawyer and advised
the Bosnians at the Dayton talks, as he now advises on Kosovo.
``During the Cold War, everyone needed states with borders,'' he
said. ``It demarcated the chessboard.'' But a messier world
requires more imagination; in Kosovo's case, he suggests a form of
``phased independence or intermediate sovereignty,'' with
restrictions on its ability to associate with Albania, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goble, a former State Department and intelligence analyst
now at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that before World War
II there were varying kinds of sovereignty in a world that was
beginning to move away from colonial rule, with numerous
protectorates and mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II and during the Cold War, we decided to
treat all states as nation states, with equal status,'' he said.
``But the world is more complicated than that. With the end of the
ideological divisions that defined a lot of what we did at the
United Nations, we're more open to complications.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norm
</P>
<P>
   Border changes, which were unknown from 1945 to 1989, are the
historical norm in a Europe of nationalities, Goble said. ``What a
state can and cannot do, and its relationship to its own population
and the rest of the world, are now more open questions.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be particularly true in eastern and central Europe,
where questions of national identity and suppressed national
minorities kicked off World War I. Communist leaders _ like Stalin
and Tito _ tried to bury them under the repressive and false new
identity of ``socialist man.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its empire _ in
considerable part because of the unsolved nationalities question _
successors like Milosevic have openly manipulated these tensions
for political support and reaped horrors like Bosnia, Chechnya and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Chechens fought the Russians to a standstill,
Milosevic's army has been rolling up the insurgent militia, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and has driven nearly a third of Kosovo's
population from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Serb depredations have made it impossible for the Kosovar
Albanians to agree on a negotiating position that would be accepted
by both the moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova and the shadowy fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Bosnia _ and like Chechnya _ the war is a civil one
within the internationally recognized boundaries of the former
Yugoslavia, making it much harder for the world to intervene. As
important, Washington and NATO do not favor the independence that
the Kosovars want, fearing that new borders will mean wider
conflicts in the region and even the destruction of the Bosnian
settlement, which set up a multiethnic state.
</P>
<P>
   So despite their horror at Milosevic's tactics and duplicity,
the West, thus far, favors an outcome closer to his position than
to the KLA's.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic's brutal and at least temporarily successful
campaign against the KLA, while NATO has watched, probably makes
the prospect of negotiating an extended form of autonomy for Kosovo
easier than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's beaten them back, and that changes things,'' said one
senior NATO-country diplomat. ``The West wants to avoid both
intervention and independence. So if Milosevic can handle it
himself, it makes it easier to negotiate the kind of intermediate
outcome we prefer.''

 `THAT WOMAN' HAS TURNED POLITICS UPSIDE DOWN  
(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When American voters entered into a liaison with
Bill Clinton in 1992, they had no idea how politically dangerous it
could be. In the primaries, Clinton swerved from the draft to
Gennifer Flowers to questions about the state of his marriage. In
the White House, the tumult only escalated, but the self-styled
``Comeback Kid'' managed to win re-election anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But even taking for granted a president who has made the
unpredictable predictable, Democrats and Republicans alike have
been knocked completely off balance by the Monica Lewinsky debacle.
Things are so unsettled that politicians in both parties last week
found themselves alternately condemning Clinton and offering solace
_ and keeping their mouths shut.
</P>
<P>
   While the uproar over sex at the White House appears to have
eclipsed the congressional elections that are only 72 days away, it
could have a tremendous influence on them, as well as on the battle
for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first election in which the outcome _ that is,
control of the House _ could determine whether a presidential
impeachment process goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some unforeseen domestic crisis or war could render
the whole scandal moot. Who would have thought that Clinton's
dramatic admission last Monday that he had lied about his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky would be overtaken later in the week by
unparalleled, simultaneous cruise-missile strikes against terrorist
targets on two continents? Clinton, whether intentionally or not,
managed to change the subject, at least for now. Talk about an
August surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's madness to predict where we are at this point,'' said
Tony Dolan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan.
``You can't strategize about chaos. And we're just entering the
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the speculation, no one has a clue about the true
repercussions of the scandal. It is the biggest unanswered _ and,
for now, unanswerable _ question in U.S. politics. Here, though,
are some possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   The `Voters Stay Home' Scenario
</P>
<P>
   The most popular scenario among Republicans is that as more and
more embarrassing revelations about Clinton pour out, they will
galvanize Republicans to vote against Democrats _ and Democrats
will grow so irate that they stay home. The result would be that
the Republicans not only keep control of the House and Senate but
also pick up some seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things happen that make one side's partisans unhappy,
they stay home,'' Gingrich told a crowd of young Republicans in
Atlanta last week. ``When they stay home, they stay home for the
whole ticket. I believe this fall we're going to see a surprisingly
big Republican victory almost everywhere in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely three months ago, Gingrich counseled Republicans to
attack Clinton on his personal ethics. But last week, he was mum.
The last thing he wants is his mug featured in Democratic
commercials as the bogeyman who is out to do in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give Clinton the life preserver that he
would like: to make this a partisan attack,'' said a leading
Republican strategist, who was so reluctant to appear out to get
Clinton that he spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans are less timid. In Tennessee, Dan Page
unveiled an anti-Clinton commercial in his bid to unseat Rep. Bob
Etheridge. As headlines of Clinton scandals pop on the screen, the
announcer intones: ``Scandal after scandal. Day after day. And who
stands with Bill Clinton, even now? Liberal Bob Etheridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that with a besieged Democrat in the White
House, voters will be even more inclined to keep a Republican
Congress. Even some White House officials say the Lewinsky debacle
has already exacted an ``opportunity cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats began mapping out a strategy in late 1997 for a
unified national message on issues like ``saving'' Social Security,
improving health care and making schools safer. But so far it has
been lost in the swamp of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are gleefully waiting to see if there is a
``reverse coattails'' effect, in which Democrats resist having the
president campaign in their states or districts for fear that his
troubles could rub off on them. ``I want to see the first Democrat
who has the guts to haul him into a remotely competitive race,''
said Charles Cook, editor of a nonpartisan political report.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the White House is planning to keep Clinton out of the
conservative South, and to dispatch him to states that might be
reliably hospitable, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Backfire Scenario
</P>
<P>
   For all their worries, Democrats are taking solace in polls
showing, at least thus far, that Clinton's high job-approval
ratings are essentially unchanged by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he believes the initial shock over
Clinton's confession will subside. ``People will say, `Oh my gosh,
he actually did this?''' he said. ``But when people start thinking
about this in human terms _ not in presidential terms _ they'll
recognize that we all fall from grace. It's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also hold out hope for a backlash. One possibility is
that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, will make
some huge miscalculation that gives Democrats ammunition to cast
him in commercials as a villain on a partisan vendetta. Sometime
this fall, Starr is expected to forward a report to Congress of his
investigation of Clinton that could be the basis for impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting already to pre-empt Starr, the Democratic Party last
week distributed ``talking points'' (an interesting choice of
words), urging candidates around the country to tell voters that
``rather than politics of personal destruction, Americans deserve
an agenda'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats recall that despite fears that the party would lose
its big donors after the Lewinsky scandal broke, many donors were
so furious at Starr that contributions actually increased for a
time. If not Starr, Democrats might try to bait the unpredictable
Gingrich into attacking Clinton, enraging Democrats and drawing
them to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party,
is counting on the opposition to be overzealous. ``The Republicans
who are standing close to the fire and fanning the flames are going
to be the ones who get burned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Gore
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats weigh whether to distance themselves from Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore already has. He is on vacation for two weeks
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Remote as it seems, there is always the chance that Clinton will
be forced from his job, thrusting Gore head first into the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing is, if Bill Clinton leaves now, all bets are
off in November,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``You
could have an outpouring of support for Al Gore in this time of
great crisis that could immediately change the political landscape.
Or you could have such disgust among the American people that
nobody votes in November.''
</P>
<P>
   As an incumbent, Gore might be in a more commanding position to
win the Democratic nomination in 2000, and perhaps the election. It
could be that voters will want a president who seems too much the
Boy Scout to be a womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet voters may simply want a respite from anyone connected with
Clinton. And Gore is not helped by his own campaign-finance woes.
The Justice Department last week reopened its investigation of Gore
amid evidence that contradicts the vice president's contention that
he did not improperly solicit campaign money from the White House
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't a bad idea for the vice president to take cover
in Kauai.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm Moral'
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter is already reverberating among Republicans
running for president. They are wooing the conservative voters who
dominate the primaries _ and stumbling over one another trying to
be the first to call for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Already former Vice President Dan Quayle, ex-Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, Sen. Bob
Smith of New Hampshire and Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research
Council, are in the resignation chorus.
</P>
<P>
   While they hardly expect Clinton to heed their advice, a
resignation call makes a sure-fire applause line. Yet the more
candidates cry ``Resign!'' the less likely it is that any of those
candidates will gain political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the political impact is real: As prominent Republicans
speak heatedly and publicly about Clinton's troubles, that
increases the likelihood that other Republicans will call for the
president's resignation _ and exacerbates partisan tensions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, expect Republicans to emphasize their moral
rectitude, and place an even greater premium on candidates with
clean biographies. In fact, the scandal may change the rules:
Potential candidates with any kind of skeleton in the closet may
stay clear of the fray. ``Some Republicans may be tempted to think
they have to run an archbishop to garner votes,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, maybe Republicans shouldn't get too carried away. While
voters may hope for a modicum of ethics, in the age of Clinton they
no longer seem to expect high virtue.
</P>
<P>
   `Monica Who?'
</P>
<P>
   Under this approach, there is no intersection between the
Lewinsky matter and electoral politics. Instead, people view
Clinton's relationship as having nothing to do with matters closer
to home, like whether their potholes are filled or they are getting
a steady paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most candidates are so uncertain about the Lewinsky
fallout that they appear to be subscribing to this theory, saying
little about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said Clinton could end up as
something of an afterthought in the campaigns this year. ``The
president is less relevant in this election cycle than he has been
in previous years,'' he said. ``That's because one party doesn't
want to run against him, and one party doesn't want to run with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an isolated president.
</P>
<P>
   A Hobbled Clinton
</P>
<P>
   For all their cries for Clinton to resign, it's pretty much
conventional wisdom now that this may be the last thing Republicans
want. Once they get past November, it may be in Republicans' best
interest to keep a beleaguered Democratic president beleaguered _
and in office. The longer the Lewinsky matter drags on, presumably,
the less influence Clinton will have on Capitol Hill and the less
unified the Democratic Party will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth has a way of marching on,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the majority leader, ``and I think truth has not yet
completed its journey in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Republicans are not about to let Monica
Lewinsky fade away.

 IN WASHINGTON, BREAKING THE RULES OF HYPOCRISY  
(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president sets his jaw and shakes his finger.
His aides, friends and fellow Democrats swallow their doubts and
accept, or second, his denials. Seven months later, as evidence
against him mounts, the president sets his jaw and concedes that he
``misled people.'' His aides, friends and fellow Democrats swallow
their pride and confess dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Could they really not have known?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken with Bill Clinton many times about this problem,
and he never admitted to me what happened,'' one of them, Sen.
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, said last week after the president
acknowledged having a relationship ``that was not appropriate''
with Monica Lewinsky. ``But I could always hear it in his voice. I
could feel the pain and embarrassment, and there was never any
doubt in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others _ not all of them Democrats _ Torricelli chose
not to share that view publicly, and in so choosing he accepted a
set of subtle and elaborate rituals often demanded in public life.
Call them the rules of required hypocrisy. This is roughly how they
work:
</P>
<P>
   A politician professes innocence of wrongdoing. Other people who
owe him their loyalty, or livelihood, or love, may also know him
well enough to doubt him deeply. But they doubt the motives of his
adversaries even more, so they close ranks. As time passes, the
demands of the defense grow greater, and the defenders' own
credibility is at stake. Positions freeze. The politician has,
after all, denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a social convention,'' said Letitia Baldridge, the
doyenne of manners who was Jacqueline Kennedy's chief of staff in
the White House. While Miss Baldridge made it clear that she found
no mitigating circumstances in Clinton's deceptions, she said he
was owed deference by his supporters all the same: ``People expect
you to be loyal. When you are in a place of trust, even if those
above you abrogate that trust, you should remain loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Torricelli put it, ``At a point when a friend has a
problem, you let them come to an admission on their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, Clinton, with his missile strikes on terrorist
outposts abroad, had given politicians yet another occasion to
squelch private doubts in public comments. Even a harsh critic like
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said that despite ``a cloud of
mistrust'' over the president, Clinton ``is entitled to the
presumption that his action is based solely on his judgment of the
national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Lying'' (Vintage, 1989), the philosopher Sissela
Bok reflects on the dilemmas faced by doctors who suspect
malpractice by their colleagues or superiors. ``No one likes to be
an informer and to destroy a reputation or a career, perhaps even
mistakenly,'' she wrote. ``One cannot always be certain of one's
suspicions; and in order to support them with clear evidence, steps
may be required that few are willing to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Even journalists, however jaded, are confined to reporting
unflattering accretions of facts, and letting those facts suggest,
but not confirm, conclusions. It was not until after the
president's own carefully couched confession, after all, that the
New York tabloids felt free at last to call him a liar in their
front-page headlines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The problem is that President Clinton has always been a
politician who plays by his own rules: Never give people more
information than they know, never use active words when passive
words will do, accept responsibility but place blame elsewhere,
excuse yourself within any admission. So people who abide by the
more conventional rules of required hypocrisy when they deal with
him almost always get burned.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. She sat in the front row of
the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing on Jan. 26, feet from Clinton's
stern face, when he insisted, ``I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' What's more, the senator's
friends said, Clinton privately assured her that Ms. Lewinsky had
been transferred from the White House because she fantasized about
him and was ``on the verge of stalking him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feinstein later issued a statement denying such a talk, but
when she finally allowed last week, ``My trust in his credibility
has been badly shattered,'' friends said the comment only began to
suggest the depth of her true distaste for the president's
deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, White House political aides like Paul Begala and Rahm
Emanuel who defended the president vigorously all year decided to
do so only after receiving assurances from Clinton's lawyers that
he was not making precisely the semantic distinctions among sexual
activities that he and his lawyers are now making.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some politicians follow the rules more cynically. ``A
lot of people who supported him are now saying, `I'm outraged' for
the benefit of the voters back home,'' Miss Baldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Art of Lying'' (Red Brick Press, 1998), a current book
of pocket philosophy that Clinton's disappointed friends might be
tempted to recommend, the author, Kazuo Sakai, writes: ``A healthy
psyche is not entirely based on the ability to tell the truth. A
healthy psyche includes the ability to skillfully control the use
of lies and the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Edward Koch of New York is as candid a politician
as the modern era has produced. But even he used to sign his most
sarcastic, stinging letters to critics like Rep. Charles Rangel,
``All the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti served as an aide to Lyndon B. Johnson, the
president whose deceptions about Vietnam prompted the coining of
the phrase ``credibility gap.'' But he insisted last week that his
president had never lied to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there are some limits,'' Valenti said. ``If LBJ had
said to me that `This is the truth,' and then if I found out he was
deliberately lying to me, maybe I would let slip these bonds of
loyalty,'' and quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other hand,'' Valenti added, ``I would probably
seek a private audience and try to ascertain how he could have done
it, and then I'd probably go out and defend him in some way. It's
just how I was raised, and I'm too old to change now.''

 ONE MAN'S PET IS ANOTHER'S POT ROAST  
(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Jenkins was never much for T-bones or rib eyes, but she was
always a sucker for a good burger. That is, until Maggie the cow
came along.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jenkins and her husband, who live in the Catskill
Mountains, bought her four years ago. Their motive was fresh milk,
but the cow quickly became more than dairy in Mrs. Jenkins' eyes.
Maggie came when called and was loquacious with her mooing,
seemingly trying to communicate. She followed the car up the
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   When Maggie gave birth to a bull, Augie, Mrs. Jenkins figured he
would be slaughtered eventually. But he was just like mom, gentle
and loyal and smart. He's now a 2-year-old, 800-pound pet, and
burgers don't sit as well in Mrs. Jenkins' stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, once you've had a one-on-one relationship,'' Mrs.
Jenkins said, adding that she is close to banishing beef entirely
from her diet. ``I mean, you'd never eat a dog or cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Mrs. Jenkins' conversion to bovine appreciation lies a
serious question: Is there really any hard logic to which animals
Americans exempt from consumption, and which ones they exploit? Is
the triage of concern for different breeds _ whether they are
eaten, used in experiments or simply eliminated as pests _ a matter
of sense or sentimentality?
</P>
<P>
   A ballot initiative in California also raises this question. In
November, voters there will decide whether to criminalize the sale
of unwanted horses for slaughter and export to meat shops in
Belgium, France and Japan, where many people see little difference
between Maggie and Flicka, who are protein all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some who support the referendum eat beef and pork, despite the
fact that cows and pigs are intelligent enough and, under the right
circumstances, every bit as lovable as horses. Just ask Mrs.
Jenkins, or anyone swept up in the modest craze for Vietnamese
potbellied pigs a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any great rhyme or reason to this,''
said Dr. John Saidla, who teaches ethics at the veterinary school
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Animal experts said that Americans often assume that those
animals with whom they have formed the closest bonds _ dogs, cat
and horses, for example _ are smarter or more affectionate than
those they eat, but that appraisal is sometimes as subjective as it
is scientific.
</P>
<P>
   They said the different treatment of these breeds is explained
in part by what they called the social contracts people have
developed with certain species. The more often we turn to a given
type of animal for services beyond nutrition, the more likely we
are to feel squeamish about eating it. It feels too much like a
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Horses once carried soldiers into battle; they now provide sport
for equestrians. Although there were those who promoted it, pig
racing never really caught on, and a game of polo using sheep would
be a little awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Caras, president of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that dogs became pets and
not prey in part because the earliest breeds were relatively small,
offering paltry portions of meat. Wild boar, by contrast, were
four-legged buffets, and today's pigs bear the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Often intelligence is indeed a factor in the degrees of concern
felt for different animals. The special outcry over medical
experimentation on primates arises from the knowledge that they are
extraordinarily bright, more like humans than any other animals.
</P>
<P>
   But why do rabbits elicit more concern than guinea pigs, who may
be equally smart? Some animal experts said it's pure public
relations. Rabbits have Easter and Peter Cottontail on their side;
guinea pigs, by dint of linguistic misfortune, are metaphors for
hapless pioneers, and thus deemed appropriate in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is about fairy tales,'' Saidla said. ``It's about
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also about looks. People have shown a fairly consistent
preference, for example, for the fluffy and the big-eyed. That's
one advantage squirrels have over rats, although experts said they
are strikingly alike. ``Both are potentially plague carriers,''
noted Randy Lockwood, an executive with the Humane Society of the
United States who studies human-animal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   John Gittleman, a biology professor at the University of
Virginia, said more money is spent on the conservation of red
wolves than gray because of prejudice. ``Color has a lot to do with
the way we perceive things, why certain carnivores seem less
threatening to us than others,'' Gittleman said. ``The red wolf
also has a smaller, rounder face _ it looks more cuddly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sometimes arbitrary nature of human judgment is reflected in
the way it changes. A bat clinging to the eaves was once cause for
shudders and maybe a call to the exterminator (bats can carry
rabies); increasingly, Lockwood noted, suburbanites are erecting
bat houses, in belated appreciation of the beast's rapacious
appetite for mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many rules collapse in the face of need. Caras noted
that while dogs were once held in totemic esteem by some Native
American tribes, dogs slipped off that pedestal when meat became
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``In crisis,'' Caras said, ``we will eat anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, some people elevate animals they feel they can
afford to: rabbits because there are guinea pigs and rats to take
up the laboratory slack; minks because there are synthetic sources
of warmth; horses because there are plenty of cattle and they don't
bring to mind ``Black Beauty'' or ``National Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Mrs. Jenkins. Long ago, she swore off veal: too sad,
the way those calves were treated. She gave up lamb: too fleecy,
too meek. She never considered venison: too much like Bambi's
mother, chased through the woods by hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hair away from being a vegetarian,'' she said proudly,
and then reflected on how differently even those closest to her see
the world. Her husband, Lee, still enjoys his sirloin steaks as
much as ever, though he too has grown fond of Maggie and Augie. And
when Mrs. Jenkins recently introduced Augie to her grown son, he
did not find the bull as adorable as she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' she recalled him saying, ``let me tell you. He'd look
much better beside a baked potato.''

   Underground Site May Hide North Korean Nuclear Reactor
</P>
<P>
   When North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to ``freeze'' its
huge nuclear weapons development program at Yongbyon, north of the
capital of Pyongyang, U.S. officials knew it was not an ideal
accord. The North, they thought, might still be hiding enough
material to make two bombs. And building tunnels is almost a
national sport, which means other nuclear plants may be hidden away
where inspectors cannot roam.
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. spy satellites have found one: a huge cavern being dug
out under a mountain 25 miles from Yongbyon, with 10,000 to 15,000
workers at the site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies are fairly certain that it is being
prepared for an underground reactor and reprocessing center, where
nuclear waste is turned to bomb-grade plutonium. But they expect
the North Koreans to claim that it is innocuous _ perhaps a giant
underground parking garage. There's only one problem with that
explanation: The country is so poor it has almost no cars.

   Public Housing May No Longer Be Mostly for the Poor
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans and the Clinton administration are on
the verge of agreeing to legislation that would allow public
housing authorities to give more vacant apartments to working
families.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, federal rules have required that almost
all open public housing units go to the very poor, which has hurt
inner-city neighborhoods, Republicans and many housing experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill would not bring about swift change because
waiting lists at most housing authorities are already long. But
housing officials around the country say it will help them begin
marketing campaigns to entice low-income working families.

   Protests in China
</P>
<P>
   Defying a ban, students and women's groups held emotional
protests over the looting, killing and rape directed against ethnic
Chinese during the riots in Indonesia in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting initially received scant coverage in China. But
photo essays in two newspapers this month caused an outpouring of
public anger primarily aimed at Indonesian leaders and criticism of
Beijing's response. Moreover, the protests showed a greater
willingness to speak out and the government's slightly greater
tolerance of it.

   The largest insurance company in Italy, Generali, agreed in
federal court in New York to pay $100 million to Holocaust
survivors and their heirs who were denied payment on life and
annuity policies after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Generali also said it would give lawyers suing other European
insurers confidential documents detailing how competing companies
cooperated with the Nazis to loot policies owned by Jews, putting

   Justice, 32 Years Later
</P>
<P>
   After four trials ended in deadlock in the 1960s, a former
klansman was found guilty of ordering the firebombing death of a
black civil rights activist in his home in Hattiesburg, Miss.
Samuel Bowers, 73, was convicted of arson and murder in the death
of Vernon Dahmer. Prosecutors said Dahmer was killed for helping
blacks register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several ex-Klansmen testified that Bowers, as imperial wizard of
the Ku Klux Klan, had ordered the killing. The verdict carries a
life term.
</P>
<P>
   Assisted Suicide Tally
</P>
<P>
   After Oregon's voters reaffirmed by a solid majority last year
an earlier and much-challenged vote to make theirs the first state
in the union to allow physician-assisted suicide for the terminally
ill, horrified opponents predicted abuse and suicides by the dozens
or hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, according to state figures released last week, only 10
people have been given authorization to take lethal medication
after filling out a one-page form, titled ``Request for medication
to end my life in a humane and dignified manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the state said, eight had taken the drugs and died,
while the two others died before actually taking the drugs. The
average age at death was 71. Under the law, the drugs can be
prescribed to an adult of sound mind with, in the opinion of two
doctors, less than six months to live. The state's Catholic
Conference, calling the news a ``tragic development,'' said it was
eight deaths too many.

 WARREN G. HARDING GETS SOME RESPECT AT LAST  
(The Week in Review) 
 (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.)  
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's maybe not going too far out on a limb to say that President
Clinton is worried about his legacy nowadays. But he can take
heart: History has a way of turning black to white, or at least to
a lighter shade of gray.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Richard Nixon was rehabilitated, sort of, wasn't he?
And even the reputation of the nation's most scandal-tarred and
least respected chief executive is on the mend. Yes, to judge from
some new historical accounts, Warren G. Harding is on the comeback
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Republican, who died in office 75 years ago this month,
has long been cast as a venal, sybaritic, glad-handing boob who
left behind an administration lousy with corruption, epitomized by
the Teapot Dome scandal, in which oil barons bribed his interior
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The sympathetic new portrayals make one or more of three
arguments: The first (not exactly new) is that, as far as graft is
concerned, Harding was mainly a victim of guilt by association with
corrupt appointees _ a common occupational hazard of the White
House that hasn't tarnished other presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The second argument is that Harding's reputation for
extramarital affairs, especially one with Nan Britton, rests on
much shaky evidence and is in any case exaggerated. The third is
that Harding's accomplishments have gotten short shrift thanks to
the fixation on corruption and philandering. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``A History of the American People''
(HarperCollins, 1998), the conservative British historian Paul
Johnson contends that the so-called Ohio Gang, a group of Ohioans
selling government favors from a K Street office in Washington,
``had nothing to do with Harding.'' He writes that Harding was
implicated in their misdeeds thanks to ``an exemplary exercise in
false historiography'' after his death from a heart attack in San
Francisco in 1923:
</P>
<P>
   ``It began in 1924 with a series of articles in the New Republic
by its imaginative and violently anti-business editor, Bruce
Bliven. He created the myth that the Ohio Gang, run by ((Harry J.))
Daugherty ((Harding's attorney general)), had deliberately
recruited Harding in 1912 as a front man as part of a long-term
conspiracy to hand over America to Andrew Mellon and Big Business.
It now seems that there was no evidence whatsoever for this
invention, and it is not surprising that Bliven went on, in the
1930s, to become a credulous propagandist for the communist-run
Popular Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon came dark intimations about Harding's death, Johnson
writes, and Nan Britton's largely unsupported account of an affair:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1926, a novel, `Revelry,' describes a guilty president who
poisons himself to escape scandals and exposure. It took in the
disapproving ((Herbert J.)) Hoover ((Harding's commerce secretary
and later president)), who always thought he would have made a
better president than Harding. He read it in manuscript and told a
friend it described `many things which are not known.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel's success in turn prompted Nan Britton, an Ohio
girl, daughter of a Marion doctor, to publish in 1927 `The
President's Daughter,' asserting that she had had a baby girl by
Harding in 1919. She claimed that she had been seduced in Harding's
then office in the Senate, and that their affair continued, Harding
writing her many letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at the time she failed to produce those incriminating
letters. Recent research has established that she was the local
``fast'' girl, whose embarrassing crush on Harding had led to
trouble for the unsuspecting man _ including blackmail _ though it
is likely he was unable to completely resist his `stalker.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The child did exist, but the father may have been one of many
men, and Britton's descriptions of later hotel assignations with
Harding have been disproved by research into hotel registers.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cites as a source Robert H. Ferrell, a historian at
Indiana University. In ``The Strange Deaths of President Harding''
(University of Missouri, 1996), Ferrell says he found no credible
evidence to support Miss Britton's claim, often repeated as fact,
of trysts with Harding in a White House closet. Rather, Ferrell
cites interviews with White House employees compiled by a Harding
friend, E. Mont Reily:
</P>
<P>
   ``Reily offered the testimony of the doorkeeper at the executive
offices for nearly 35 years, his friend Patrick Kenney, who told
him he `never had heard of Nan Britton, and that he had never
admitted any woman by such a name in to see or meet any president!'
Kenney was certain of the fact. `I keep a record. I remember, and I
know, and I also know that no strange woman ever came here to see
President Warren G. Harding.' In the event that Ms. Britton might
have gone to the White House proper, rather than the executive
offices, there was the testimony of Ike Hoover ((chief White House
usher)), who had come into the mansion during the administration of
President Benjamin Harrison and left at the outset of the Franklin
Roosevelt administration. Reily asked him about Nan Britton, and he
bristled at the notion that she could have entered the executive
mansion. `Nan Britton? No, there was never a gadabout by that name,
or any other name, in the White House. Nan Britton is a liar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harding was not helped by portrayals like the one presented by
Theodore Roosevelt's daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, who,
Johnson says, resented that Harding made it to the White House
instead of her husband, House Speaker Nicholas Longworth. In a 1933
memoir, she presented the Harding White House as a speakeasy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The air heavy with tobacco smoke, trays with bottles
containing every imaginable brand of whisky stood about, cards and
poker chips ready at hand _ a general atmosphere of waistcoat
unbuttoned, feet on the desk and spittoon alongside. ... Harding
was not a bad man. He was just a slob.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a biographer of first ladies, accepts
that in his private life Harding ``fully lives up _ or down _ to
his deeply tarnished reputation.'' But in yet another positive new
portrayal of Harding, he writes in the July/August issue of
American Heritage magazine that he was surprised at what he learned
in researching his latest book, ``Florence Harding'' (William
Morrow, 1998):
</P>
<P>
   ``As I delved further into the Harding archives, I kept finding
evidence of a more positive side to his administration. For
instance, he is rarely credited for his best appointments, like
that of Charles Evans Hughes as Secretary of State, or for
convening the Washington Naval Conference on the limitation of
armaments, the first global peace summit. Nor is he remembered for
creating the Bureau of the Budget, headed by Charles Dawes, which
first gave the federal government an operational budget. Such
high-caliber choices as Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and
Secretary of Labor James J. Davis certainly counterbalance those of
((Albert)) Fall ((the corrupt interior secretary)) and Daugherty.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony adds that Harding deserves credit for his progressive
views toward blacks and Jews, reflected in his naming Albert Lasker
head of the Shipping Board _ ``the first-ever high-profile
presidential appointment of a Jew.'' In addition, Anthony writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerance shaped Harding's foreign policy as well. `I am very
glad to express my approval and hearty sympathy for the effort of
the Palestine Foundation Fund, in behalf of the restoration of
Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people,' the president wrote
to that organization in an unpublished letter that I found in his
papers. `I have always viewed with an interest, which I think is
quite as much practical as sentimental, the proposal for the
rehabilitation of Palestine and the restoration of a real
nationality. ...' This was a significant discovery; no published
works on Harding even hint at his interest in turning Palestine
into a Jewish homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony writes further:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the most surprising single event of Harding's
presidency was his blunt speech on Oct. 26, 1921, to a segregated
crowd in Birmingham, Ala., stating that democracy would always be a
sham until African-Americans received full equality in education,
employment and political life. The first president to discuss civil
rights in the South so frankly, he was loudly cheered by blacks and
met with silent stares from whites. ... In Birmingham, Harding went
further than any of his predecessors since Lincoln to call for `an
end to prejudice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson concludes that Harding deserves the sort of reputation
that he enjoyed in his lifetime _ as ``the kind of president
American people of all classes love _ kind, genial, decent,
ordinary, human, one of them.'' Furthermore, he notes:
</P>
<P>
   ``As Thomas Edison put it, `Harding is all right _ any man who
chews tobacco is all right.''' &QL;

KELSEY GRAMMER GETS HIS DREAM: THE 9 P.M. THURSDAY TIME SLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes a color slide of Kelsey Grammer (with hands together) and
David Hyde Pierce in a scene from `Frasier.' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Kelsey Grammer dreamed of the day that ``Frasier'' would assume
the nine o'clock slot on NBC's blockbuster Thursday night schedule.
 &HT;    Now that ``Seinfeld'' has gone the way of pterodactyls,
Grammer's fantasy becomes a reality on Sept. 24, when his acclaimed
comedy series switches from Tuesdays to Thursdays for its sixth
season.
 &HT;    The scenario conjures up that old devil's advocate chestnut: Be
careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
 &HT;    ``I suppose it might seem like a pressure situation, but I've
got enough self-inflected pressure to deal with,'' the affable
Grammer says by phone from his ``Frasier'' dressing room after a
rehearsal. ``Nobody's a harsher critic of me than I am. Nobody
drives me harder than I drive myself, and nobody expects more of
`Frasier' than I do.
 &HT;    ``I've already got that mixed blessing of being an
obsessive-compulsive personality. So I don't feel any additional
pressure.''
 &HT;    And, this from a character who plays a shrink!
 &HT;    Perhaps he shouldn't feel the pressure, for precious few shows
so consistently achieve ``Frasier's'' level of quality and
sophisticated humor. For those not in the know, ``Frasier'' casts
three-time Emmy Award winner Grammer as Dr. Frasier Crane, a
well-meaning if pompous bundle of neuroses who earns his living _
or did until last year's season finale _ as an on-air psychiatrist
for a Seattle radio station.
 &HT;    Alternately aiding and abetting or driving Crane to distraction
are his competitive brother, Niles (David Hyde Pierce); gruff
father, Martin (John Mahoney); outspoken producer, Roz (Peri
Gilpin); Martin's daffy live-in nurse, Daphne (Jane Leeves); the
radio station's repugnant sportscaster, Bulldog (Dan Butler); and
Martin's feisty pooch, Eddie (Moose).
 &HT;    ``It's an incredibly well-oiled machine,'' Grammer says. ``We've
acquired what I call requisite disrespect, meaning we don't spend
that much time on things.
 &HT;    ``We trust that if we don't get something right in rehearsal
we'll get it right the next day. We know where scripts will work
and where they won't work
 &HT;    ``Nobody beats their brains out. If we run into a brick wall
once in a while, yeah, we all sit for an hour or two and kick it
around.''
 &HT;    Grammer laughs a bemused laugh.
 &HT;    ``But those sessions are rare these days,'' he continues. ``We
have a great machine, well-built, that always fires on every
cylinder.''
 &HT;    The trick to keeping it fresh, Grammer notes, is to always push
the envelope and travel new terrain, but not to do so arbitrarily.
Thus, audiences tuning into the show this season will witness,
among other developments, Frasier dealing with unexpected
unemployment and Niles struggling with his divorce.
 &HT;    ``Basically, we'll be exploring the next logical steps in all of
these characters' lives,'' Grammer says. ``It just makes sense.''
 &HT;    Amazing as it may seem, Grammer first portrayed Crane 15 years
ago, when he joined the cast of NBC's ``Cheers'' as a love interest
for Diane Chambers (Shelly Long). So associated with Crane is
Grammer that a fair number of people think of him as the character
and not a theater-trained actor portraying a character.
 &HT;    ``I certainly understand the tendency to do that, but I think
it's a shame,'' Grammer says somberly. ``I think it's really a
shame when the creative minds of my own industry have done it.
 &HT;    ``It happens and sometimes you've got to face the music and
realize that, yes, it's hard for people to imagine you in another
situation,'' he says. ``I'm doing my best, believe me, to make sure
that's not always the case.''
 &HT;    Grammer's also toiling hard, day in and day out, to stay sober.
His battles with the bottle, of course, spilled into public view a
couple of years ago, after an inebriated Grammer totaled his brand
new car, a gift from NBC.
 &HT;    The glare of the limelight shines bright enough during the good
times, but as Grammer learned the hard way, it's downright blinding
during the bad times.
 &HT;    ``It's shaming to realize that your privacy is completely done
away with as a result of celebrity,'' Grammer says. ``But it's also
kind of freeing to overcome your failures.
 &HT;    ``That I'm still around is a testament to the fact that I have a
great deal of tenacity and maybe even courage,'' he says. ``I hate
to even pander to the word `demons,' because if a person doesn't
have any demons they wouldn't be interesting.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't be a good actor without them. Demons are my best
friends.''
 &HT;    He pauses again, just for a split second, as he searches for the
right words to convey his feelings.
 &HT;    ``When you have a disease, you have a disease,'' he says. ``You
either treat it or you don't treat it.
 &HT;    ``Finally getting the treatment I needed was the best thing that
ever happened to me. All the old insecurities remain,'' Grammer
notes. ``I'm just better now at dealing with them.''
 &HT;    Helping Grammer deal with his insecurities and demons is his
wife, Camille, whom he married on Aug. 2, 1997.
 &HT;    ``I'm still wildly in love with Camille,'' he says warmly.
``It's new to me, and it's certainly new to me to be in a
relationship with somebody who really cares about me.
 &HT;    ``That has made quite a bit of difference in my life.''
 &HT;    Grammer spent the better part of ``Frasier's'' summer hiatus
relaxing with Camille and his daughter from a previous
relationship. But he also found time to co-star in an upcoming
feature film, ``New Jersey Turnpike,'' his first since the
waterlogged Naval comedy ``Down Periscope'' (1997) was torpedoed by
critics and audiences alike.
 &HT;    ```New Jersey Turnpike' is an affectionate look back at a
charming time in our recent history, the 1970s, when we had the
American Basketball Association (ABA),'' he says. ``It's a fun
movie and, hopefully, it captures the music and clothes of that
period, and the period itself.
 &HT;    ``I play the general manager of a fictional basketball team that
almost made it into the NBA but didn't because of one horrible,
tragic evening.''
 &HT;    And now it's back to ``Frasier,'' which suits Grammer just fine.
 &HT;    ``We've been on for six years, and we're just getting started,''
an enthusiastic Grammer says. He may join co-stars Mahoney and
Pierce for a limited run in the Broadway show ``Art'' during the
next ``Frasier'' hiatus. ``Frasier is this incredible mouthpiece
for all of creation for me.
 &HT;    ``You can do a Shakespearean role for a couple of years and
think, `OK, I've done it.' But `Fraiser' is an everyman in a weird
kind of way.
 &HT;    ``He can absorb all of what's going on in a contemporary society
but still hang onto his tenuous principles, his assumptions about
the world and life,'' Grammer says. ``He's willing to change his
mind about life and people as he gets older.
 &HT;    ``So I don't see even another three or four years of `Frasier'
being a problem.''

 &HT;     Includes a color slide of Larenz Tate (center) with Vivica Fox,
Halle Berry and Lela Rochon, stars of ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love?'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    And you thought Bill Clinton had problems. Larenz Tate has three
wives _ all at the same time.
 &HT;    Only in the movies, of course. For Tate, getting married might
be normal for a single character. But on a sound stage, he's
already promised to marry Vivica Fox, playing a petty thief, and
Lela Rochan, playing a teacher.
 &HT;    That was the previous week. Today it's Halle Berry's turn to be
the bride. Her character is a singer.
 &HT;    Tate knows the drill by heart. ``The first move when you're
getting married multiple times in a movie is to buy a giant sized
bottle of Listerine,'' the star of ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love''
advises. The movie opens Aug. 28.
 &HT;    In Hollywood, they are already dubbing the film ``First Widows
Club,'' after the ``First Wives Club''(1996).
 &HT;    Tate plays singer Frankie Lymon, a black teen idol, who died in
1953 at age 26 of a heroin overdose, leaving three wives. No big
deal these days except he never got divorced. He was married to all
three at the same time _ much to their shock when it comes to
splitting up the estate. (It wasn't hashed out until a 1988 trial.)
 &HT;    Then again, all this love directed at one handsome young man
doesn't sound that outlandish.
 &HT;    Fox calls Tate a fantastic screen lover. ``He was so limber at
one point I thought he was gonna do the splits,'' she says. Berry
told Jane magazine, ``Tate has the fattest, widest, juiciest,
thickest tongue I've ever seen. On that alone, I would have to give
the kissing a 10.''
 &HT;    ``He is a beautiful young man,'' Rochan says.
 &HT;    Tate readily admits his shortcomings. He didn't think he would
get the role, because it's hard to play a singer when you don't
sing. ``I don't have a good voice,'' he admits. ``I did do a lot of
lip synching.''
 &HT;    His character is seen in flashbacks when the widows go to court
over his fortune. ``It's a powerful story about a young man people
might not remember, but was important in black history because he
was one of the first young black singers who crossed over,'' Tate
says.
 &HT;    ``The movie is framed by the women telling their story about
Frankie and who he was to them,'' Tate reveals. ``Each claims that
she was his true love.''
 &HT;    One problem he faced was too much kissing. ``I would get up in
the morning and think, `Oh gosh, another day and I've got to do
kissy face scenes.''' Again, the girls took it the worst. ``Halle
would come in and say to me, `Did you kiss her today?' I wasn't
even sure which `her' she was talking about, but I would bow my
head and nod.''
 &HT;    Tate would use a defense unavailable to most married men. ``I
would yell, `Come on! It's in the script.' Give me a break.''' Of
course, he didn't hope for other breaks. Fox is engaged to R&AMP;B star
Christopher Harvest, who goes by the name Sixx-Nine.
 &HT;    That refers to his height. ``I'd check with Vivica now and then,
and she would say, `Sixx-Nine understands it's just acting although
he might come to the set to make sure everything is cool.'''
 &HT;    Then again, Tate could rely on his street smarts. He's from
Chicago's west side. ``I'm from the `hood, but to me I didn't grow
up in a rough neighborhood,'' Tate says.
 &HT;    As a child, he always knew city limits wouldn't contain him. ``I
was so extremely smart that they couldn't sit me in a classroom,''
Tate says. ``I was just smarter than the other kids (so) that they
had to put me one-on-one with a tutor.''
 &HT;    The little genius never wanted to be an actor. But at age 8, his
father moved to Los Angeles to finish college. The family missed
him so they moved there for the school year and returned to Chicago
for summers.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles with his parents and two brothers, Tate grew
restless. His mother thought a perfect way to ``burn off my extra
energy'' was to perform.
 &HT;    Originally, Tate wanted his brothers and himself to form a
mini-Jackson Five. When that didn't work, he returned to the couch.
``My brothers remind me to this day that I was the one who said, `I
don't want to act. I just want to sit on the couch and watch
cartoons.'''
 &HT;    His mother enrolled him in dance class.
 &HT;    ``I was like, `Come on, man. This dance class is not me.' I
wanted to hang out with the guys and play basketball,'' Tate
recalls. He changed his mind when he nabbed his first role on
televisions's new version of ``The Twilight Zone'' (1987).
 &HT;    ``I was Kid No. 1 on the Christmas show,'' he says. ``I was told
to sit on Santa's lap, but the deal was Santa was supposed to be
drunk, so I fall off his lap.''
 &HT;    Commercials followed, including one for Matchbox cars. The real
money and exposure happened when he got cast on sitcoms. He did a
stint on ``The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air,'' where Tate romanced Will
Smith's cousin.
 &HT;    Tate moved to larger roles in ``Menace II Society'' (1993),
``Dead Presidents'' (1995) and ``Love Jones'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``For me acting was a way out,'' he says. ``As a teen-ager in
both LA and Chicago, I watched some of my buddies making the wrong
choices in life. They just wanted to hang out on the corner and get
in trouble. They didn't want to focus on the bigger picture,'' Tate
says.
 &HT;    Now, Tate lives in Hollywood where he's auditioning for upcoming
roles. With his first starring movie, you might think the ego would
kick in, but he remains good natured. Tate even has a sense of
humor about his megaflop last Christmas, ``The Postman.'' In case
you didn't see it, he played Ford Lincoln Mercury, Kevin Costner's
right hand man.
 &HT;    ``I still think it's a cool movie. Maybe later people will find
it on home video,'' Tate says, adding, it was a chance to work in
the big leagues.
 &HT;    Are the bigs ready for him? Tate has already proven himself as a
dangerous actor. He recalls his first meeting with Costner in
``Postman.'' ``I tackled him.
 &HT;    ``We did a scene where I don't want the Postman to go after the
bad guys,'' Tate laughs. ``I have to scream, 'No! No! Stop Postman!
They're going to kill you!' Kevin didn't know I would follow this
line up by giving him a football tackle hug.''
 &HT;    By all accounts, Costner was ``stunned.'' Tate recalls, ``Kevin
was like, `Wait a minute, man. Get off me.' It was our first
bonding moment. Then Kevin said to me, `Easy, easy, easy, kid.' I
looked him in the eyes and said, `Kevin, this is not the love
scene. Just in case you're wondering.'''
 &HT;    Costner burst out laughing.
 &HT;    Now Tate shakes his head. ``All my female friends are still
going, `What was it like to embrace Kevin Costner?' I say, 'I don't
think I got the same feeling you did.''
 &HT;    The perks included filming in a small town in Washington State.
``I'm a downtown city guy,'' Tate says. ``I don't like Mayberry.
The minute we were done with that movie I couldn't wait to get back
to the big city and just go to a supermarket.''
 &HT;    Almost 30 and still single, the on-screen ladies man is mum on
life partners. ``I think of myself as a down to earth guy who will
put his family first,'' Tate says. First, he is planning on
retiring his mother.
 &HT;    ``She's a sweet lady, and I want to give her the best in life,''
he says.

much lip smacking during kissing. ``I mean it,'' she says.

 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 TV Guide (Canada)  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The most impressive thing about French Stewart is not that he's
willing to wear a peach plaid leisure suit and royal-blue loafers,
it's the way he wears them.
 &HT;    As he sits off to the side of the ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' set,
Stewart, 34, carries himself seriously and with something actually
approaching dignity. As Harry, the alien emissary to Earth who
makes tapioca seem to belong in the same intellectual league as
Immanuel Kant, Stewart has transformed the doofus into a lovable
lug of a guy.
 &HT;    And he's proud of it. ``I like the fact that he's an epic
idiot,'' Stewart says, ``an idiot the likes of which have not been
seen _ an idiot on any planet, a universal idiot.''
 &HT;    It's difficult to imagine anyone else playing Harry, though
executive producers Bonnie and Terry Turner originally had someone
quite different in mind. ``At first, we had the idea that Harry
would be a big guy,'' Terry Turner says, ``but French came in and
sat down and read, and I immediately locked on to him.''
 &HT;    Stewart won over the Turners after auditioning a scene in which
Harry fawns over the aliens' landlady's Angora sweater.
 &HT;    ``She said, `I like the color,' and he said, `Well, it's
wunn-derr-fulll.' He read the line as if feeling and sniffing the
sweater was the way you experience color,'' Terry recalls. ``He was
so completely different and on-target.''
 &HT;    As Stewart remembers it, his audition came just after he had
been dropped from another pilot. ``I felt like I was getting a
little tired and thought that maybe things weren't gonna pan out
for me as an actor,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``So I walked in and just did whatever I wanted to do, and they
seemed to enjoy it. I've had that before, but getting past networks
has always been a treacherous business for me,'' he says. ``I'm
just plain weird, let's face it.''
 &HT;    Terry Turner would be hard pressed to disagree. ``French has
this Buster Keaton thing going. He's one of the few comedians in
television that works in a full-body shot,'' he says. ``His feet
are as important as his face.''
 &HT;    Stewart's career began its ascent in 1989, when he joined Los
Angeles' Cast Theater, a funky enclave whose productions win rave
reviews and cult audiences.
 &HT;    ``Zombie Attack! is the longest running show in Los Angeles,''
he reports. ``I must've been in that show for four years, just
hundreds and hundreds of performances. A lot of people would come
to see shows, and I would get work from it.''
 &HT;    He met his manager at the Cast, and eventually won a recurring
role as the zany disc jockey in ``The New WKRP in Cincinnati''
(1991), though today he admits, ``I'm grateful for that time in my
life, but I felt like it wasn't my strength. It just wasn't what I
do.''
 &HT;    Stewart has also landed a few small parts in movies, including
``Leaving Las Vegas,'' (1995) where he played ``a pervert, you
could say,'' and the recent cinematic incarnation of ``McHale's
Navy'' (1997). But his first love remains ``3rd Rock.''
 &HT;    ``I would love to ride it till it drops, because I've done
enough television to be able to recognize when something's
special,'' he says. ``And we've found our crowd. I feel like the
people who really appreciate us are with us. We enjoy each other.''
 &HT;    He's enjoyed the ride on the show so much he professes not to be
too troubled by the fact that he's been typecast as a dimwit. ``I
used to be able to play a large variety of parts but this has been
so specialized,'' Stewart says.
 &HT;    ``When people call me, they want me to trip over stuff, or some
facsimile of that, which is OK with me. I would love to think that
at some point I could do different things, but I don't know if it's
gonna happen,'' he adds.
 &HT;    ``But I have no complaints, because I've had my shot. This is
more than I expected _ my career has been a wonderful surprise.''

`CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH' CATCHES ON

 Includes a color slide of `combatants' Elvis (left) vs. Jerry
Garcia (right) in a scene from ``Celebrity Deathmatch.'' 
 By MATTHEW PHENIX  
 c.1998 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Could that be the movie reviewer Gene Siskel swinging around his
longtime pal Roger Ebert, helicopter style, by his stock-and-trade
thumb? It could indeed.
 &HT;    Well, almost. Clay renderings of the hotshot critics recently
appeared on ``Celebrity Deathmatch,'' the animated MTV series that
drops news makers into a wrestling ring where they can pulverize
each other.
 &HT;    This half-hour show, shown since mid-May on Thursday evenings at
10, takes celebrities' adversarial relationships, real and
imagined, and pumps them to gleeful, steroidal extremes. Hillary
Rodham Clinton hammering away on a certain ex-White House intern,
for instance, is a scene unlikely to be realized anywhere else but
here.
 &HT;    ``Celebrity Deathmatch'' is the brainchild of the 29-year-old
animator Eric Fogel, whose cartoon series ``The Head,'' about an
average guy who awakens to find an alien named Roy living in his
head, ran for two seasons on MTV in 1994.
 &HT;    The first ``Deathmatch,'' just a brief bout, appeared on MTV in
1997, as part of the network's animated variety series, ``Cartoon
Sushi.'' Clay versions of Marilyn Manson, the singer, and infamous
murderer Charles Manson entered the squared circle to prove once
and for all who was the ``Most Evil Man in America.'' (Charles
Manson won.)
 &HT;    In January, fight fans were treated to MTV's Super Bowl halftime
special ``Celebrity Deathmatch Deathbowl '98,'' featuring Pamela
Anderson and RuPaul fighting each other tooth and nail, and the
Hanson boys slugging it out with the Spice Girls. That broadcast,
with more than 3 million viewers, was the clincher for MTV:
``Celebrity Deathmatch'' is in the middle of a 13-episode run.
 &HT;    Stop-motion animation, whether with clay figures like those used
by the animator Art Clokey in the 1950s for ``The Gumby Show'' or
the articulated dolls he used in his 1962 children's series ``Davey
and Goliath,'' has been a persistent if sporadic presence on
television.
 &HT;    The term ``Claymation,'' often generically applied to clay
animation, is in fact a registered trademark of Will Vinton
Studios, the animation company responsible for the ``Califoria
Raisins'' advertising campaign and the spectacular stone-faced Nome
King in the 1985 film ``Return to Oz.''
 &HT;    Because oil-based clay melts under studio lights and becomes
grimy when handled repeatedly, working with it takes as much
patience as skill. A 30-minute ``Gumby'' episode, for instance,
required the figures to be moved more than 43,000 times _
one-eighth of an inch at a time _ and photographed individually.
 &HT;    From 20 to 30 duplicates of the characters were needed as
backups during the weeklong process of creating an episode. The
process hasn't changed much since Gumby and his horse, Pokey, came
on the scene.
 &HT;    Fogel says he decided on clay animation for ``Celebrity
Deathmatch'' because he enjoys its immediacy. Two episodes of the
show, each with three celebrity bouts, are photographed
simultaneously in a suite of eight rooms at MTV. The network has
set up an ``audition line,'' Fogel said, to find and record the
best celebrity imitations, regardless of location.
 &HT;    If a great Newt Gingrich imitator is found in Los Angeles, the
actor will simply record his part on the West Coast, with Fogel and
company monitoring the session from New York. Because of the show's
topical nature, it is not unheard of, Fogel says, for an episode to
be completed just a day before it is broadcast.
 &HT;    The clay image and real voice of the boxing referee Mills Lane,
who officiated at the notorious 1997 fight that ended with Mike
Tyson's biting Evander Holyfield's ear, presides over most of the
``Celebrity Deathmatch'' bouts.
 &HT;    The brawlers are chosen by Fogel and his team of writers, who
meet three times a week to pore over magazines, searching for
unwitting personalities to sic on each other: Oprah Winfrey and
Rosie O'Donnell, for example.
 &HT;    On its Web site (www.mtv.com), MTV offered fans the chance
recently to vote for the celebrity combatants in a future ``Viewers
Choice'' match. Among the 30 MTV suggestions were Richard Simmons
and Courtney Love.
 &HT;    MTV included a write-in box, should a fan of the show be struck
with the irresistible urge to see, say, a leotard-clad Martha
Stewart puree Bob Vila. Fogel says there were ``thousands upon
thousands of suggestions.''
 &HT;    The most popular requests will be aired this weekend, Aug. 29
and 30.

 &HT;    Brief book reviews
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1988 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Into That Good Night. By Ron Rozelle. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.
$22. 182 pages.
</P>
<P>
   This memoir about memory _ or rather the loss of it _ at first
seems as plain as its East Texas landscape. Ron Rozelle's father,
an educator who ushered integration into the Oakwood schools in the
1960s, develops Alzheimer's disease in his 80s. The book is slow to
get off the ground. Then, lying in bed, little Ron hears a truck
come through Oakwood in the middle of the night. He muses that the
driver ``will know nothing of the lives that are played out daily''
in the town, and ``there seems something not right about his
piercing through, in a matter of seconds, my entire world.'' Those
shocks of fine perception are the batteries that keep this memoir
humming. One poignant chapter describes the effects of Alzheimer's:
His father asks the grown-up Ron: ``Who are you?'' Though Rozelle
places his dad _ who was his home _ front and center, the reader
may wish to know more about his far more intriguing mother, whose
mental illness and shocking death are glossed over. There are
snakes living under the rocks in East Texas, and one wishes Rozelle
had looked under a few more of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Zone. By Tim Green. Warner. $24. 325 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his pro football success, Luther Zorn, NFL linebacker
for the Florida Marauders, still struggles with the psychological
effects of having an abusive father. On the field, he's meaner than
Joe Green. Off the gridiron, he's nice enough, helping out an
abused woman (who becomes his lover) and her son. He's also having
an affair with the wife of the team's owner, and when the owner
turns up murdered, Zorn is the prime suspect. Unfortunately, the
revelation of the real murderer is the only surprise in this
formulaic mystery in which all the characters are cardboard
cutouts. Green, a former Atlanta Falcon, writes clean prose about
dirty doings and is not afraid of examining racial issues in
sports. But the plot is about as engaging as a Falcons game when
the team is down 49-0 in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Manly Man. By Sparkle Hayter. Morrow. $22. 260 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkle Hayter draws on her experience as a news writer at
Atlanta's CNN and as a comedy writer in this comic mystery
featuring Robin Hudson, a reporter at All News Network in
Manhattan. Her TV project about men who plan the future is
interrupted by an incoherent stranger who gives her a hat before he
is hustled away in a limo. Next thing you know, her already
too-full life is overtaken with a mystery that includes her double,
an unidentified body, animal rights activists, mobile drug dealers,
nutsy neighbors and needy boyfriends. It all comes down to some
abducted chimps and a ``Stepford Wives''-like plot to subjugate
women. Little of that matters; Hayter's one-liners and comic scenes
(particularly when she is injected with sodium pentathol) will have
you guffawing. Hudson seems gutsy, but a nightmare reveals her
vulnerability: She has ``one of those Jesus dreams like I used to
have as a kid, after my dad died,'' when Christ swoops down out of
the sky to the rescue. Ultimately, this is a finer portrait of a
single woman than ``Bridget Jones's Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Spin. By Tom Lowe. Pocket Books. $23. 287 pages.
</P>
<P>
   When political spinmeister Jim Asher meets the son of the
California Republican candidate for whom he works, he is pleased
because ``the little rascal ... looked like a great decoration for
family-values speeches.'' Asher loves spinning facts and images on
behalf of his party. He loves his huge salary, his Armani suits,
the leggy models at his sexual beck and call, the limousine life.
But the line between image and criminal activity blur, and Asher is
caught up in a scandal not entirely of his own making. Spin, he
discovers, controls him more than he controls it. Lowe's prose is a
far cry from F. Scott Fitzgerald's, but Jim Asher is a postmodern
Great Gatsby, naive at heart, wending his way toward political
status in California politics. And the book asks a serious
question: Can one play the political game and remain honest?

 &HT;    ``Nosferatu'' adds little to lore of silent films
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Shepard's novel ``Nosferatu'' (Knopf, $22) studiously keeps
you at arm's length throughout, but it belongs on that short but
select shelf reserved for fictional treatments of the silent film
era: Howard Rodman's ``Destiny Express'' (about Fritz Lang), John
Baxter's ``The Kid'' (about Charlie Chaplin) and Garson Kanin's
``Moviola,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nosferatu'' concerns itself with F.W. Murnau, the great German
director of ``The Last Laugh,'' ``Sunrise'' and ``Tabu,'' and it
ricochets for no good reason between third-person objective and
first-person diary entries.
</P>
<P>
   Murnau is an especially rich subject because of his enormous
talent, his early death in a car accident in 1931 and his oblique
personality. Shep-hard's take is that Murnau was haunted by the
death of a lover in World War I and was able to climb out of
himself only through his work:
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmaking offers shelter for a failure to live. The essence
it transfers to the medium is stolen from life.'' This is
undoubtedly true, but the same thing can be said of artists in any
field.
</P>
<P>
   Shephard's book has to be considered a disappointment in that it
conveys little more than a short story about Murnau that Shephard
published two years ago in a collection titled ``Batting Against
Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case at least, less was more.
</P>
<P>
   INSECT LIFE . . . Chronicle Books has published, with an
admirably straight face, ``Bugs in 3-D'' ($18.95), some very nice
photos of all manner of insects, complete with a built-in 3-D
viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The illusion of depth is excellent, and if you have any kids
interested in entomology, or you're just pining for another viewing
of ``The Hellstrom Chronicle,'' this is definitely the book for
you.
</P>
<P>
   The photos of butterflies are particularly beautiful, and you'll
never get a better view of a pair of toad bugs mating than you will
here.
</P>
<P>
   Also new, and worthy of your attention, is ``Art of the Gold
Rush,'' just out from University of California Press ($24.95), the
catalog of an exhibition at the Crocker and Oakland Museums.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a profusion of famous artists, which actually works
to the advantage of the paintings _ you can see through to the
compositions, faces and artifacts without having to get past a
style. These paintings then, are Canaletto, not Titian, but
cumulatively they give you an admirably comprehensive sense of a
period I always associate with Bret Harte.

 &HT;    For ex-smoker, it's thin line between craving, caving
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not sure what's holding me together right now. A promise to
my kid. A little guilt. A report from the surgeon general. Who
knows? Maybe it's nothing more than just a thread.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it's much simpler than any of that. I mean, maybe the
one and only reason I haven't smoked tonight is because I can't
find one. I've already checked. Dirty ashtrays. The pocket of my
husband's jean jacket. An old purse of mine. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This is crazy, I know. It's been more than four months since I
smoked my last cigarette. Four months. Most days are easy, most
days just whiz by. But sometimes, out of nowhere, comes an urge so
powerful, so compelling, so mind-controlling, that I am frozen
right then and there. Sometimes I stand, stuck in this crazy,
obsessed, I-want-to-smoke limbo, unable to move back, unable to
move forward, unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where I am tonight, feeling as though the one thing
in this world that would make me happy is a cigarette. It would
balance my checkbook, and my hormones. It would calm the deadline
nerves, teach the 7-year-old how to handle conflict. It would
ensure that my dad gets home from the hospital. It would make me
appreciate my husband.
</P>
<P>
   It would make me happy, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about smoking, it becomes part of our lives.
We're excited, we smoke. We're unhappy, we smoke. We're mad, we
smoke. Indeed, in the weeks and months and years after we quit,
it's difficult to laugh or cry without wanting to share it with a
cigarette. It's a sick, symbiotic addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But once we decide, for whatever reasons, to quit, researchers
say it doesn't take long for our bodies to heal. According to them,
within two weeks of the last one, my blood pressure and pulse were
back to normal. My circulation was improved and my nerve endings
started to regrow.
</P>
<P>
   By now, say the researchers, I should have more energy, cough
less and walk easier.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is true.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means nothing when you want a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   I know exactly when and where this latest I-want-to-smoke seed
was planted. It was a comment by an old friend. We'd run into each
other when I was on vacation and he said he'd quit seven years ago.
But just recently, he'd started to have one, occasionally, at a
party, at a ballgame. It was going well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is any ex-smoker's dream, to have one once in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   And, so, the thought of that one cigarette has haunted me since.
I want to take it from the pack, smell it, feel the nicotine burn
my lips. I want to strike the match, smell the sulphur, feel that
glorious buzz.
</P>
<P>
   I want to forget about it, but I can't.
</P>
<P>
   This no-smoking business is as serious as it is hard. The last
time I wrote about quitting, I got a boatful of mail from other
people who had quit. I know it can be done. I know I'm going to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   But then, along comes a day like today when I'm ready to chuck
it all, the promise, the good health, the sense of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes a night like tonight, when all I want is one, sick,
narcissistic rendezvous with a Winston Light. What a crazy way to
live. But I guess it's better than dying.

 &HT;    Orchids: A perennial love
 &HT;    By Caroline Kalfas
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Call him Mr. Green Thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Belcik cares for a budding collection of more than 800
orchids.
</P>
<P>
   No, make that 919.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a meeting, and I bought a few more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former assistant professor of biology, who retired from East
Carolina University in June after 33 years, collects the flowering
plants, which he says are a part of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   His passion for the exotic flowers extends to orchid memorabilia
including plates, stamps, cups, tins, crystal bowls and silk
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes like an obsession over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belcik is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   John Myhre of Garner has collected more than 400 orchids. He and
his wife are expanding their 14- by 14-foot greenhouse another 18
feet to give the plants more room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll have more orchids than we did before,'' Myhre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Myhre, past president of the Triangle Orchid Society in Raleigh,
knows people with much larger collections than his. Many are fellow
society members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group includes people with one or two orchids up to people
who have many thousands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Nash, director of education and conservation for the
American Orchid Society in West Palm Beach, Fla., said many orchid
growers amass a large selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orchid people are collectors and accumulators,'' he said.
``And orchids are like `National Geographic.' Nobody ever throws
them away _ even if they should.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of orchids stems from their vast diversity and
beautiful flowers, which bloom in all seasons in an assortment of
fragrances, sizes, colors and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The average orchid costs between $15 and $20. But the plants
range in price from $3.50 to $25,000, Nash said. They also vary in
size. The plants can be as small as a person's smallest fingernail
or as large as vanilla, an orchid with vines that grow to be
hundreds of feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Orchids grow worldwide with more than 30,000 species in almost
every color. The perennials are known for their vivid, long-lasting
blooms and can be cultivated or found growing in the wild. North
Carolina boasts 56 native species, Belcik said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing orchids is difficult enough to be a challenge, but not
so tough that the job's impossible, Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Belcik keeps most of his plants in his shady back yard. A
crowded greenhouse protects many of the orchids. Others are hanging
in teakwood baskets on the branches of a cherry tree or placed in
various plastic and clay pots on the grass near a cement statue of
St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of his orchids are in bloom in July. They show
their best colors in winter-spring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of like being under the trees in the summertime,''
Belcik said. ``If they're sick, they go inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, when daytime temperatures hover around 90 degrees or
above, Belcik waters the plants three days a week, usually early in
the morning between his two cups of coffee. The task takes about
one hour, and watering the plants early gives the roots of the
plants plenty of time to dry during the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the temperatures begin to drop, Belcik decreases his
watering schedule to Wednesday and Saturday in 80-degree weather
and Saturday only when temperatures reach 70 degrees or below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give each plant individually what it needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of them survive.
</P>
<P>
   Since Belcik began collecting orchids in 1991, he said he has
accidentally killed more than 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing orchids is a little more difficult than growing
geraniums or African violets,'' he said. ``You have to know the
plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcik learned his lesson with the first orchid he bought. The
white moth orchid captured his attention right away because of its
vibrant red stripes and spots. His intentions were good, but the
plant died under his care.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I think I watered it eight times,'' he said. ``That's
not what it needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcik has since learned how to better care for the plants with
much success. One of his moth orchids has been in bloom since
April.
</P>
<P>
   He recently produced a bloom from an orchid hybrid bred from
parent plants of two different species and genera. He named the
orchid Centrum Prism Irish Starr and is having it registered with
the Royal Horticultural Society in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which was founded in 1804, is part of a
network of International Registration Authorities that promote
uniformity, accuracy and stability in the naming of cultivated
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Many collectors depend on orchid societies to provide up-to-date
information about their hobby and a chance to network with other
growers.
</P>
<P>
   Belcik is a member of the American and Triangle orchid societies
and recently was elected president of the Neuse River Orchid
Society in Kinston.

 &HT;    Split Shifts
 &HT;    By Kim Grizzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The arrangement works this way: Betsy
Barnacascel has her two boys Monday through Friday. Their father,
Reggie, gets them on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no custody agreement. The Barnacascels are a happily
married couple. They've simply divorced themselves from day care.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't have to quit their jobs to do it. On weekdays,
Reggie heads off to his job as a project manager at WIMCO Corp.
General Contractors in Washington, N.C. Three weekends a month,
Betsy works as a home health nurse for Beverly Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like there's a lot of family splitting, and there
is,'' Betsy said, ``but we're happy when we're together. I feel
like I've got the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study shows many two-income families are dividing the
child care responsibilities two ways instead of three, eliminating
day care from the equation. A third of the two-income families
surveyed by the Families and Work Institute report that they rely
on each other _ not day care centers or baby sitters _ to raise
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the biggest thing is you've got to make up your mind
if you want to let somebody else raise the kids every day,'' Reggie
said. ``It (the arrangement has) allowed the children to be home
with a parent at all times, and it has helped financially as far as
the cost of day care.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy returned to her job after she had her firstborn, Heath,
now 4. But when Coleman, now 9 months, came along, the Barnacascels
had to consider whether they'd still come out ahead after doubling
the costs of day care.
</P>
<P>
   James and Molly Tripp faced that same decision after their
daughter, Brylie, now 14 months old, was born. Financially, it was
hard to see how Molly could justify keeping her schedule as a nurse
practitioner while the family spent $800 a month on child care for
Brylie and 3-year-old Jamie.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Molly took a nursing job at Pitt County Memorial
Hospital that allows her to work a weekend schedule. She works
12-hour shifts Friday through Sunday. James adjusted his schedule
as a sales manager and installer for Thulman Eastern fireplace
company so he could be home when Molly is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to school four years,'' Molly said. ``I always wanted
to be a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have to give up. I'm still able to have a
full-time job and have adult interaction, but yet I have four days
a week that are 'Mommy days.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to take my little girl to dance, to swimming lessons
_ even little side trips during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(James) enjoys the special time that he has with them to do
things. They go out to breakfast. When I go out to work, it's their
special time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol-Ann Tucker, director of the East Carolina University
Regional Training Center, said the split-shift arrangement can be
beneficial to parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the good things about it is they get to spend a good
amount of quality time with each parent,'' she said. ``Lots of
times, I don't think children get an opportunity to spend time with
Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also gives each parent an opportunity to see what it's like
to be a child rearer,'' she said. ``(Many times) the mother is
given the responsibility to raise a child, whether she's working or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   When James and Molly decided to eliminate day care, James
already knew what it was like to get up in the middle of the night
to change and feed the baby. What took some getting used to was
doing that on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever my buddies have got a big golf match going on, I just
drool at the mouth,'' James said, ``but you just gotta do what you
gotta do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie has also had to get used to the idea that his golfing
days are over. Since Betsy is off one weekend a month and the
couple have family nearby, he still gets in a game now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder,'' Reggie said of juggling the kids and their
schedules. ``The inconvenience is more, but I think the outcome in
the end will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnacascels are already seeing some of the benefits. Heath
seems happy and secure knowing Mom or Dad is always around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's a lot happier this way,'' Betsy said. ``I think my
favorite thing is not being rushed in the mornings. You're not
rushed to eat, rushed to dress, rushed to do this. We're not so
rushed and so stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   James said the arrangement has meant his wife doesn't have to
feel torn between work and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of mothers feel guilty having to work,'' he said. ``The
single best part of it is she doesn't have to feel guilty by doing
that. She still feels secure and confident with who's watching the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly also finds satisfaction in knowing that she isn't missing
the best years of her children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with day care,'' she said. ``It's a
viable option for a lot of people. I just felt they were seeing a
lot of things that I wanted to be there to see. I wanted her to be
doing those things with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drive past her old day care, she never says anything
about going back.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   If you're considering the split-shift child care option, there
are a number of factors you should consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- Are your work schedules flexible?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people have jobs where employers will allow them to
work at home,'' said Carol-Ann Tucker, director of the East
Carolina University Regional Training Center.
</P>
<P>
   -- Are both of you in favor of making the change?
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has to take an understanding spouse,'' Ms. Tucker
said. ``(Both spouses) have to buy into it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Do you have the support of extended family members?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have extended family,'' Ms. Tucker said.
``(Involving extended family in the care of a child) is a wonderful
way for a child to get to know a grandparent or an aunt. It's also
a way for them to get to know older people.''
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to try this:
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't forget to figure in some time for you and your spouse
as a couple as well as time for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to schedule that (couple times) just like you
schedule other activities in your life,'' Ms. Tucker said.
``Couples still need to be a couple and then a parent, even though
that child is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Communicate frequently about discipline. Children need to
know that rules are consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents don't communicate well, there can be some real
problems,'' Ms. Tucker said. ``It can actually get into a little
manipulation _ just like when they get to go to Grandma's they get
to eat all they want and stay up late.''
</P>
<P>
   -- This arrangement is not for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people who would not be comfortable every
day taking care of a child,'' Ms. Tucker said. ``Some people can
balance it. I think it takes special people to balance it.''

 &HT;    Double take: twins talk about remake of ``Parent Trap''
 &HT;    By Jennifer White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ When Hannah and Caitie Forde-Smith decided to
trick their teachers by switching places, they figured no one would
be the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   True, the rising third-graders at Elmhurst Elementary are
genetically the same, but their personalities couldn't be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   The twins' switch went unnoticed until lunch, when Caitie's
teacher noticed she (really Hannah) was eating the ``wrong'' chips.
Caitie normally ate barbecue chips, but on this day, she was eating
Cheetos, Hannah's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the little details that reveal the big
differences between identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case in the Disney remake of the movie ``The Parent
Trap,'' which opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The original movie featured Hayley Mills playing each of two
14-year-old twins who were separated when their parents divorced.
The remake stars Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson and 11-year-old
Lindsay Lohan. Lohan plays identical twins Hallie and Annie, twins
unaware of one another and living a continent apart until they meet
at a summer camp, then conspire to get their parents back together.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old twins Jill and Janet Hudson thought it strange
that one actress would play both roles instead of casting twins for
the parts. But the plot of the movie, twins switching places, is an
idea that's all too familiar to Janet and Jill, rising
eighth-graders at Chicod Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   When they were in the sixth grade, Janet was manager of the
softball team. When she didn't feel like going to practice one day,
she sent Jill instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach doesn't know to this day,'' said Donna Hudson, the
twins' mother.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and coaches aren't the only adults easy to fool.
Sometimes even parents have a hard time telling their own twins
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Smith and Lindsay Forde-Smith, parents of Hannah and
Caitie, admit that they don't always know which twin is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always says, 'Hi Caitie,''' Hannah said about her dad. ``I
say, 'I'm Hannah.'''
</P>
<P>
   Donna and Robin Hudson sometimes get their twins confused, but
the girls usually let the mistake go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I call Jill and I've got the wrong one, they don't pay me
any mind,'' Donna said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trouble that adults have telling the twins apart,
Lindsay said their friends always know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids always know who they are,'' she said, adding the
Forde-Smith twins are best friends with three other sets of twins.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are easily distinguishable now _ Caitie has
pierced ears and longer hair _ the girls wore hospital bracelets
for the first year so their parents could tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the Forde-Smith twins say that people often treat them
as one person instead of two individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, 'Hi twins,''' Hannah said. ``I want to be called by
my own name.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that they look alike shouldn't fool anyone; ``there are
millions'' of differences between the two, Caitie said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls have never dressed alike _ Hannah likes purple and
Caitie prefers blue _ and have been in different classes at school
since first grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I kept them in kindergarten together for me, and I've
requested that they not be together since then,'' Lindsay said. ``I
think every child ought to leave school every day thinking they're
the teacher's favorite, the best and brightest and most popular.
That's hard to do when your twin sister is sitting in the desk
right beside you.''
</P>
<P>
   They twins also have different hobbies. Caitie enjoys horseback
riding and basketball, while Hannah likes hockey, skating and
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They perceive themselves to be just Caitie and just Hannah,''
Lindsay said. ``I have always worked incredibly hard at creating
their uniqueness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the twins do share some similarities besides their
genetic likeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the Spice Girls the same, especially Geri,'' Hannah
said. ``(When I'm older) I'm going to either be a model or a Spice
Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   They also benefit from each other's company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have somebody to play with,'' Caitie said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hannah and Caitie, the Hudson twins consider themselves
more alike. The girls have asked to be in the same class at school
since kindergarten, and even at 12, they still occasionally dress
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Both are also members of an All Star softball team where Janet
is pitcher and Jill is catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Janet plays in the school band and Jill is the more
artistic of the two, the girls have many of the same friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a freckle on her nose,'' said Jill, about the
difference between herself and Janet.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Janet and Jill don't like being twins is when they
get in trouble for each other's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't do something right, they think it's you, but
it's the other one,'' Jill said.
</P>
<P>
   For their parents, sibling rivalry takes on a whole new meaning
when the kids are the same age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very competitive,'' Lindsay said. ``I have encouraged
them to be cheerleaders for the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna said that, although her twins are two different children,
they both have agreeable personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody pretty much gets along around here,'' she said.
``When they play ball, they try to compliment each other. I don't
see the rivalry between the two girls.''

 &HT;    ``We don't do trendy''
 &HT;    Has two sidebars: IMAGE-CUTS, IMAGE-MYTHS
 &HT;    PHOTOS AVAILABLE

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They know about skirts cut like carwash
flaps and platform sneakers and nail polish in blue. But they also
know to avoid all this.
</P>
<P>
   Although image consultants are fashion experts, they're hardly
fashion sheep. You won't, as a rule, find them lumbering off a
cliff into fad land, teeny backpacks a-bouncing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do trendy,'' says Irene Nathan of London, in Miami
last month for the Association of Image Consultants International
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to teach people about investment dressing, you
want them to know that classic styles are the best buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a double-breasted suit in wool crepe. Or a neutral silk
blouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what function you're attending, but for the most
part, we live in a conservative world,'' says Susan Bigsby, a
consultant in Delray Beach. ``Look at the most cutting edge fashion
statement for fall _ longer length skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the AICI opening session, most skirts were neither long nor
short but right around the knee. Most shoes were neither stilettos
nor flats, but somewhere in between. And the clear-cut No. 1 outfit
choice? A suit. Timeless, tailored, safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to look like you know what you're doing,'' says
Elaine Stoltz of Fort Worth, Texas. ``But you don't want to look
like you struggled.''

 &HT;    Top tasks: Teaching poise, self-esteem
 &HT;    Sidebar to IMAGE-INTRO
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's more to being image savvy than what frock you wear or
whether your tie's long enough.
</P>
<P>
   And consultants will tell you that whipping someone's wardrobe
into shape is just part of what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Image is an umbrella term that includes communication as well
as appearance,'' says Mari Lyn Henry, who lives in New York. ``It
includes how people present themselves through their voice. Plus,
there's the nonverbal, like body language and posture.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Tel Aviv-based Tami Lancut Leibovitz says, ``If you teach
someone to dress well, but they don't sit up straight, you haven't
done your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a worldwide economy, a growing part of image
development is global etiquette, consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give someone a gift in Japan, for example, you can't
expect that person to open it right away,'' Henry says. ``They
don't tear the paper off and throw the ribbon on the floor like
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're thankful for the act of giving but prefer to open the
gift in private. If you're an American businessperson and don't
know this, you might be taken aback.''
</P>
<P>
   Clare Speigel of Coral Springs teaches not just how to organize
your closet but also how to organize your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating personal style involves more than building a
long-term wardrobe,'' she says. ``It's building self-esteem, which
includes being in control of your time.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney World image specialist Melissa Valiquette, meanwhile,
instructs employees on handshakes, what fork to use, even how to
act at an after-hours party.
</P>
<P>
   And Lauren Castle, publisher of The Image Networker _ an
industry newspaper _ polishes resumes as well as appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to handle all areas of marketing a person when you're
an image consultant,'' she says. ``I can help someone create a
drop-dead resume, then they wear sweats to the interview. So you
can't focus on one area more than another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work to make the entire package appropriate for that person
_ not make that person fit into a mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology also has broadened the scope of an image consultant's
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a client may have sought advice about what to
wear to a board meeting. Nowadays, that same client will want to
know what colors show up best on TV because the meeting will be
video-conferenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``How people look on camera is more important than it's ever
been,'' Henry says. ``That and making an entrance. All stars know
how to do it, but most non-celebs in the business world need
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   The image profession, however, isn't always about business.
Sometimes, it can be about pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've helped people pick the cologne they're going to wear on
their honeymoon night _ both brides and grooms,'' says Brenda
Kinsel of Fairfax, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I even help people learn how to get dates. That's when my
job is the most fun.''

 &HT;    Spinoff to develop cartoon series, related software
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Human Code co-founder Chipp Walters is starting a new
Austin company to develop animated features for television and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called Red Echo, is working on a Saturday morning
cartoon series called ``Mission to Avalon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to produce the Avalon TV series first and build
the brand, and then publish Avalon software,'' said Walters, who
left Human Code earlier this month. ``We think it has a lot of
potential, and we're excited about getting it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The show tracks the adventures of the Earth's best and brightest
kids on a journey through the galaxy in the 22nd century.
</P>
<P>
   Walters, Liz Walker and Gary Gattis founded Human Code in 1993.
Human Code develops multimedia products for the entertainment,
business and education industries. Walker is Human Code's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said Red Echo has signed a letter of intent with a
funding group that plans to distribute the show.
</P>
<P>
   As it develops the Avalon product, Red Echo is getting revenue
from multimedia work for corporate clients. Walters also is
providing seed money to get the company off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The company has seven employees, most of whom were formerly at
Human Code.
</P>
<P>
   Walters developed the Avalon concept at Human Code, which has
granted property rights to him. Human Code will receive partial
royalties on sales related to Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   Human Code also will have the option to develop any interactive
Avalon work, such as creating an on-line community.

 &HT;    Tech Report: It's eBLAST searching the Net, thanks to
Encyclopaedia Britannica
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Encyclopaedia Britannica has been published since
1768, and in the 230 years since its founding in Edinburgh,
Scotland, the venerable reference work has saved countless numbers
of students who waited until the night before an essay was due to
start writing.
</P>
<P>
   The entire 32-volume set has been available on the World Wide
Web since 1994 at http://www.eb.com, and as a two-disc CD-ROM for
Windows and Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   In July the company opened another chapter in its long history
by launching eBLAST, a free Web navigation service featuring a
searchable and browsable directory of more than 125,000 sites
chosen by a team of 25 Britannica editors for their quality and
usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers an editorial forum for some of the world's
leading thinkers and writers. Early contributors have included
novelist Scott Turow, Slate editor Michael Kinsley,
artificial-intelligence expert Marvin Minsky and civil rights
activist Lani Guinier.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to search on eBLAST. Users can enter a word,
name or phrase in a window on the opening screen, or browse an
outline of 17 major subjects, clicking anywhere in the outline to
find subtopics that will lead to a Web site. eBLAST uses AltaVista
technology for its searches.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features is the Britannica Quick Search, a
toolbar that gives access to the entire suite of online reference:
eBLAST, Sample Search from the online encyclopedia, and the
Merriam-Webster dictionary and thesaurus. After a one-click
download, the EB button resides in a corner of the computer screen.
All the user has to do is click on it, type in a search term and
indicate the reference desired.
</P>
<P>
   Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. is based in Chicago. For more
information, call 1-800-747-8503.

   New mouse a mighty mite
</P>
<P>
   A lack of available space can be just as much of a problem on a
desktop as it is on a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Suncom Technologies is trying to remedy that with its Atom
Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse measures just 3 1/2-by-3 1/2 inches. To control the
cursor position on the screen, it uses an optical code bar that
moves in a small arc on a stationary pad that takes up no more
space than a trackball. The mouse never leaves the pad.
</P>
<P>
   The company is targeting users of laptop, notebook and portable
computers, and ``road warriors'' who use computers in cars, trains
or planes.
</P>
<P>
   Suncom, the Wheeling, Ill.-based subsidiary of a Hong Kong firm,
is best known for its F-15 Strike Fighter series of joysticks for
air-combat software. For more information, check out the company's
Web site at http://www.suncominc.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Atom Mouse retails for $40.

   Bringing fine art home
</P>
<P>
   Images of staggering beauty reside within the walls of museums.
But many of us never get to visit the great repositories of art in
our own country, much less the Prado in Madrid, Spain, or the
Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, or the Louvre in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Broderbund is trying to bring some of the
museums' offerings to the rest of us with FineArt, the latest in
its ClickArt family of products.
</P>
<P>
   FineArt includes more than 8,500 images, divided into categories
such as scenic watercolors, fine art oil paintings and elegant
landscapes, as well as 36 fonts and four decorative alphabets. The
software is intended for use in cards, invitations, address labels,
advertisements or just about anything that could use an elegant
splash of color to dress it up.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the images are lifted from museum walls, but the company
says each was handpicked based on its beauty and artistry.
</P>
<P>
   The software includes a full-featured image
browser/viewer/converter and works with dozens of desktop
publishing programs. It requires Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 running
on at least a 486 computer with 4 to 8 megabytes of RAM, a
256-color display and a 2X or faster CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   FineArt retails for $30. Broderbund's other offerings in the
ClickArt series can be seen at the company's Web site:

   Bat makers step up to plate
</P>
<P>
   Two baseball bat manufacturers have sued the NCAA over changes
to bat specifications and performance scheduled to take effect Aug.
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA rules change _ which included reducing the diameter of
the bats and decreasing the allowable speed of a ball coming off a
bat _ was a response to concerns that high-tech bats could lead to
serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Easton Sports Inc., maker of the Z-Core scandium-alloy aluminum
bat, filed a restraint-of-trade lawsuit this month against the NCAA
in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Kan., and is seeking $267
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Baum Research and Development, which makes wood composite bats,
also sued for unspecified damages, accusing the NCAA of conspiracy
to monopolize the bat industry.

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Digital video disc can
 &HT;    swallow CD-ROMs
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My (relatively) new computer is equipped with a
DVD-ROM drive, a technology for which little appears to be
available presently, so I had to go afield for something with which
I could make valid comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   For the purpose, Microsoft sent me the DVD, or digital video
disc, version of its popular Encarta Deluxe encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   The chief advantage of DVD is an enormous increase in capacity.
Digital video discs are the same physical size as ordinary CD-ROM
discs; my drive will read both kinds.
</P>
<P>
   But the single disc of the DVD version of Encarta not only
contains the two-disc CD version, but also Microsoft Bookshelf and
Virtual Globe. DVDs will hold as much as 4.7 gigabytes of
information, as opposed to the roughly 680 megabytes on the
standard CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   What formerly required five discs now fits on one, and in an
enhanced form, too. It is difficult to determine exactly how much
has been added to this version of Encarta itself. My CD-ROM version
of the encyclopedia contained 73 videos; the DVD-ROM has 104.
Furthermore, they can be expanded from their very small starting
size to what would be full screen if you are running your video
card at 800x600. Quality is excellent at that greater size.
</P>
<P>
   There are more of the 360-degree views included in the tour
section.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how rapidly this technology
becomes commonplace. It comes at a time when publishers are
becoming more willing to expand programs onto multiple discs, which
is not really a problem for games, where the insertion of new discs
is progressive and there is no need to swap them in and out.
</P>
<P>
   But putting encyclopedias on more than one disc, and forcing the
user to swap them back and forth, is annoying to us couch potatoes
who went through all that with floppies years ago and thought it
was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no reliable predictor of industry trends. But since DVD-ROM
drives will read both formats, the changeover from one format to
the other would be relatively painless. Unfortunately, the world we
live in now doesn't seem to be driven by things such as
encyclopedias and other electronic reference tools, despite their
enormous value.
</P>
<P>
   It took a game _ ``Myst'' _ to bring the CD-ROM into every
computer room. It will probably take some gargantuan game, with
exquisite graphics running full screen with no loss of quality, to
put DVD over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have reviewed Encarta 98 already, and since the 99
version will be forthcoming soon, I won't rehash that, rather than
to say the DVD version is even nicer than the standard one.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Bookshelf now contains nine separate reference works:
Roget's Thesaurus, the Columbia quotations book, an encyclopedia,
dictionary, the latest World Book almanac, an atlas, something
called The People's Chronology, an Internet directory and, wonder
of wonders, Microsoft's excellent computer dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   If you had the computer dictionary, you would be able to
understand the computer writers who talk about really heavy stuff
like thin clients and thin servers. You would also be pleased to
know there are fat versions of these things, too.
</P>
<P>
   You can access just one of these books, or search through the
entire collection.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Globe is an excellent study tool. Its chief selling
point is its flyovers of certain parts of the world, marking the
cities and showing the terrain. But this is limited; its greatest
value is its excellence as a standard atlas, fully up to the job of
dealing with the homework of most students through high school. It
is very easy to navigate through, too.
</P>
<P>
   Having all these tools on a single disc is as close as we can
get right now to research nirvana on the personal computer.

 &HT;    It's a snap taking a photo now that you can see and send almost
instantly
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz

<TEXT>
<P>
   Strike a pose.
</P>
<P>
   Grab a disc.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the film, just say ``cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to digital cameras _ photography of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect for the impatient, the computer geek or anyone who wants
to see photos in seconds, these hand-held and sometimes
pocket-sized cameras allow you to snap pictures, and see the images
on a computer screen or on paper within minutes. And you can use
your computer to edit the photographs _ no darkroom required.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other high-tech toy, these cameras are becoming more
available and more affordable to consumers. They now range in price
from $200 for low-end, user-friendly models to $800 for the most
technologically advanced. The average price is about $500.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras first hit the market several years ago,
professional photographers and techies were the only ones with
their fingers on the flashes. Now cameras are falling in the hands
of almost everyone _ real estate agents, insurance adjusters and
parents wanting to show off their child's first steps to Grandma
and Grandpa.
</P>
<P>
   James Harris, who works at Elemental Interactive, an
Atlanta-based Internet development company, has been using a
digital camera to check out commercial real estate and office
furniture in San Francisco, where the company just opened a new
office.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought a camera a year ago, and employees took it
across the country to snap shots of potential office space, desks,
chairs, carpets, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Harris bought his own digital camera to take on vacation. Last
year, he and some friends created a Web page of their snowboarding
trip to show to the friends who couldn't make it to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to take these digital pictures and put them
on the Web and e-mail them to people instead of taking regular
pictures and having them developed and scanned in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone should throw away their film and pick up these
digital gadgets. Here's the advice consumers get from a local
photography expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take terrible pictures, that's the first thing I tell
them,'' said Cliff Whitney, Wolf Camera vice president for
technology development.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him wrong. Whitney raves about the cameras, as long as
the prints are only to be viewed on a computer screen. For that
kind of application, the images are just as serviceable as those
from a film camera. But when the images are turned into prints, the
film camera is much better.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how you use them, Wolf Camera and Video is a top
vendor of these toys. The cameras are becoming all the more popular
with people being more Net friendly. Eastman Kodak and Olympus
America are the top manufacturers, with nearly 40 other ones close
on their heels. The cameras also can be found in such stores as
Best Buy, Sharper Image and Brookstone.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be film-free, the first thing to tell the
behind-the-counter camera salesperson is how you plan to use the
camera, Whitney said. Once that's decided, he said it's best to buy
a digital camera that's similar to a typical ``film'' one _ with a
zoom lens and a built-in flash. Kodak's DC210 has a 2X zoom lens,
equivalent to a 29-58mm range on a 35mm camera. It also can take
pictures as close as eight inches, and the lens is focus-free for
point-and-shoot ease.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things to consider when shopping:
</P>
<P>
   -- LCD vs. optical viewfinding
</P>
<P>
   An LCD shows images stored in the camera to view before being
loaded up on a computer or printed out. This way you always have a
second chance to get that first shot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Resolution
</P>
<P>
   It plays a major role in the precise detail and quality of
photos taken and in maximum image size you can display or print
without enlarging the photo. Most digital cameras have a resolution
at 640x480, but others in the high-price range, such as the Fuji
MX700, have a resolution of 1280x1024.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uploading images
</P>
<P>
   Before the use of digital cameras, images could be transferred
to a computer using a scanner. Now they can be stored in the camera
with either a floppy disk or a memory card.
</P>
<P>
   Most cameras come with cables to connect the camera directly to
the computer and also software for viewing the images.
</P>
<P>
   -- Printing
</P>
<P>
   Pictures can turn out OK if the printer used has the same
resolution as that of the camera. Anything lower than the camera's
resolution makes shots look grainy or washed out. But prints will
not be anywhere near as good as the ones from a film camera.

 &HT;    Presidential peccadillos highlighted on the Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the media frenzy surrounding the current presidential
scandal, it's important to remember that President Clinton isn't
the first president to run afoul of special prosecutors,
bloodthirsty media or a pretty girl.
</P>
<P>
   A quick and witty presidential history lesson from the San Jose
Mercury News traces presidential infidelities all the way back to
Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president and author of the
Declaration of Independence. The site at
http://www.mercurycenter.com/nation/media/krt/president takes a
lighthearted but comprehensive look at nearly 200 years of scandal
with the cheeky title ``Presidential Peccadillos? Shocked? Don't
Be.'' The site has brief but illuminating looks at presidential
infidelities throughout history with nifty caricatures accompanying
each thumbnail history.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Washington Post also offers a similar history of
presidential scandals (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv
</P>
<P>
   /politics/special/clinton/stories/scandalhistory.htm), but it's
bundled with the newspaper's coverage of the Clinton scandal and
lacks the visual punch and breezy style of the Mercury News' site.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the media circus surrounding the Clinton scandal, TV
and cable networks have been turning to former Washington Post
reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who more than 25 years
ago broke the story of the break-in at the Watergate Hotel in
Washington and the subsequent trail of cover-ups culminating in
President Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and Bernstein have been busy reminding news anchors, TV
pundits and anyone who asks that the Watergate scandal, unlike the
current Clinton debacle, involved crimes and misdemeanors far more
serious than a dangerous liaison in the Oval Office. There was
embezzlement, stealing, burglary, lying and corruption in nearly
every nook and cranny of the executive branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief Watergate history lesson, start with the Washington
Post article that triggered the newspaper's investigation: http://
</P>
<P>
   washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/tours/scandal
</P>
<P>
   /watergat.htm. The article from June 19, 1972, is simply titled
``GOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair,'' and only
begins to hint at the revelations to come. It's also important to
note that the article also acknowledges the help of six other Post
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Watergate, The Washington
Post has also assembled a sharply designed and informative site to
document Watergate. The Post site offers a cast of characters, a
search engine to locate particular players or events and a
description of what the fuss was all about. There's also a Q&AMP;A with
Woodward and Bernstein, who talk about the mechanics of reporting
potentially disastrous news about the president of the United
States without having to worry about Matt Drudge, Salon or even The
Associated Press beating you to the story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, digging up dirt on a U.S. president was not something
one did as a matter of course. The site can be a little busy and
hard to read at times, but remember this is the primary source for
information about one of the most significant events in American
history. However, if the graphics and the sheer volume of each
information-packed Web page are too much for you, try
http://vcepolitics.com
</P>
<P>
   /wgate.htm. This site looks like a textbook, but the same
information is there and has a more academic feel than the Post's
``you are there'' aura.
</P>
<P>
   What's new:
</P>

$189 round trip from San Francisco strike you? Budget Travel
provides tons of information about low fares to destinations around

 &HT;    Wheels on the bus make your PC go round and round
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying a PC is easy. Prices are lower than I've ever seen;
machines are more powerful, and (with rare exceptions) even the
no-name machines work fairly reliably.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most folks strain and fret too much when getting ready to
buy a new PC. They study magazines, ask friends, consult psychics
and hang out in computer stores. Truth is _ until recently _ you
could do pretty well by simply setting a budget for how much you
can afford to spend on a PC, then shopping for the most powerful
machine you can find in that price range.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you are one of those fretters I was talking about, do I
have good news for you. A new generation of machines hit the market
several months ago. And that's made the buying decision a little
more difficult. So now you can worry and study and scratch your
head without feeling paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to talk about buses today. And I'll do my best to
explain why it's a good idea not to miss the bus.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a computer guru, you'll know all about these new
machines already. But if you're a computer guru, you probably ought
to be spending your Sundays outside anyway and take a break from
all this tech talk. So for the rest of you, let's gather around and
talk about why things got complicated at the computer store.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines have faster chips in them. And most new users
think the speed of the chip, measured in megahertz, is the only
measure of a computer's speed. But speed is just one of the
criteria. While these new machines have chips that run at 350 and
400 megahertz, the real speed increase comes from a faster bus.
Faster bus? If you're a novice user, the last bus you encountered
had a smelly exhaust. The kind of bus we're talking about today is
built into the motherboard (the main circuit board of the PC).
</P>
<P>
   To understand how a bus works, let's think of the motherboard as
a city. The chips on the board, including the processor chip, are
buildings, and the circuitry that ties these chips together makes
up the bus. The bus is roughly equivalent to roadways that connect
the chips together. Until now, buses ran at either 33 megahertz, 60
megahertz or 75 megahertz. But this new generation of Pentium II
machines uses a bus that runs much faster _ at 100 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   So the story here isn't in the chips. The 350 megahertz and 400
megahertz chips are faster, but _ inside _ there's no real
difference in the way they are made.
</P>
<P>
   The real speed increase comes from the speed of the bus. And
like a broader roadway, this 100 megahertz bus means data will
travel faster inside the circuitry of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay a premium for 100 megahertz machines. And because
they work so much faster, you'll also pay more for the faster
memory chips they use. After all, you need a faster chip to take
advantage of the faster bus speed.
</P>
<P>
   So now you have a real choice. If you buy one of these
new-generation machines, you'll be able to upgrade it with faster
chips _ as they're introduced _ and get speed bonuses just not
possible with machines with a slower bus speed.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines really are faster and, if you have plenty of
money to spend on computing, they're the way to go. On the other
hand, not all of us are fabulously wealthy. And depending on how
you use a PC at home, the speed increase from one of these new
machines may not be important to you.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while I have fancy machines here at work, at home
I have a really old PC that runs at 125 megahertz. (That's not a
typo, it's the result of an old Overdrive chip used to upgrade what
had been a Pentium/75.) That home machine is used almost
exclusively for checking e-mail, using a word processor and
browsing the Web. It's not a perfect machine, but it does all I
need right now. And until I win the lottery, it's likely to stick
around.
</P>
<P>
   How about you? Who knows what you ought to do. But if you're
computer shopping these days, at least you now have some
legitimately tough decisions. Enjoy the suffering.

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Clinton's pain might
 &HT;    be felt on Main Street
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When he spoke on the Monica Lewinsky matter last week,
President Clinton insisted that his private life should remain
private. Unfortunately, what the president did behind closed doors
with a former White House intern does directly involve all of us
and our wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal may yet lead to Clinton's impeachment. Even
if it does not, his lies have left him politically damaged and far
less able to shape economic policy. When you are the president,
your private problems quickly become our pain.
</P>
<P>
   Already we can see examples of that in Atlanta. Local
entrepreneurs who wanted to begin offering stock to the public this
summer have had to delay or kill their plans because the stock
market has turned so choppy. The volatility is being caused, in
part, by fears about political instability.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from Clinton's confession could get much worse. For
example, the president may now be too politically weak to assemble
the coalition he needs to win ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate
trade agreements. Without such authority, U.S. exports _ and jobs _
will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, exports already are slowing because of problems in
Asia. Georgia-Pacific Corp. has had to cut 25 percent of its
pulp-making production because of the drop in orders from Asia.
Georgia companies that produce paper, chemicals, textiles and other
exports must quickly find new markets through ``fast-track'' deals.
</P>
<P>
   Every president since Gerald Ford has had the power to open
markets by negotiating trade agreements and then putting them on a
speedy track through Congress for an up-or-down vote with no
amendments. No country would waste time reaching a trade deal only
to have it rewritten at the last minute by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House plans to consider fast-track legislation next month.
But does Clinton still have the clout to expand trade the way he
did when he secured the North American Free Trade Agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Congress also needs to approve a $17.9 billion appropriation to
shore up the International Monetary Fund. If Clinton cannot muster
the votes for IMF funding, the Asian and Russian economic crises
could worsen and further hurt our exports.
</P>
<P>
   Global trade isn't the only concern. The president also must
block irresponsible tax cuts that could send the budget deficit
soaring again. He has to put Social Security reform on track, and
make sure both government and industry are fixing the Year 2000
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the president must maintain his image as a strong
leader who can preserve world order. When Clinton approved surprise
missile attacks on terrorist facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan
Thursday, he underscored the United States' vital role as global
cop. A powerful president discourages terrorists who want to
disrupt order and commerce around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment hearings begin this fall, Congress may have
little energy for other issues. The stock market could become even
more volatile, consumer confidence might wane and terrorists might
become emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's sensible, centrist policies have
been good for the country. On his watch, trade has expanded amid
relative peace in the world, budget deficits have disappeared,
welfare rolls have shriveled, and the unemployment rate has
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   This golden era may well end now that Clinton's immoral behavior
has damaged his presidency beyond repair. It's a shame that we will
all have to lie in the bed the president has made.

 &HT;    IDA program helps pave way to homeownership
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Homeownership may soon be more than just a dream to
some Georgia residents.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen people are participating in an innovative
program designed to open the door to homeownership.
</P>
<P>
   The IDA (the individual development account) Home Ownership
Program is similar to incentive-based savings programs across the
country and is at work in three metro Atlanta neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Norcross, a person's savings account is matched 4-to-1 by the
United Way of Metro Atlanta, which has lined up contributions from
corporations. Participants agree to deposit $50 a month into a
special account, said Nancy Macleod, a housing counselor for the
Gwinnett Housing Resource Partnership in Norcross. If someone puts
$150 in the account, the United Way would contribute another $600.
</P>
<P>
   The matched funds are not available until the person is ready to
buy a home. The program's first new homeowner was scheduled to
close a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also under way in two central city areas,
Reynoldstown and the Old Fourth Ward. Plans call for the expansion
of the program into two additional communities, said Eric Muschler,
United Way director of community and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals and communities benefit. ``It's going to revitalize
and reinvigorate the neighborhood,'' Macleod said. At the same
time, participants can clean up bad credit and develop sound money
management skills.
</P>
<P>
   Participants include hairstylists, secretaries, sales
representatives and schoolteachers. The minimum income ranges from
$19,150 for a single person to $57,750 for a family of eight.
</P>
<P>
   The program also helps participants learn more about managing
money and credit, the home-buying process and maintenance of a
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the program is economic literacy training, which
really talks about how families develop wealth, and buying a home
is the most significant aspect of wealth creation,'' said United
Way's Muschler. ``We're creating good neighbors as well as
opportunities for individuals.''

 &HT;    Index fund investing questioned
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market is down sharply for the last few weeks, and so
are the much-loved index mutual funds that promise _ and mostly
deliver _ the same returns as the indices they mimic.
</P>
<P>
   Many bright people believe the stock market is going down even
more, and some fear it will go down a lot more. If it does, people
who sell index funds all but promise their funds will go down by
about the same percentage.
</P>
<P>
   So it's time to dump index funds and invest elsewhere, right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Take a look at the chart with this story. It compares
total returns of the granddaddy of index funds, the Vanguard Index
500, with the returns of hundreds of mutual funds that have a
similar investment style.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 of the last 15 years, the Vanguard fund _ second-largest
mutual fund in existence _ did better than the large-cap, blend
funds with which it can be compared. It's true the $60.8 billion
Vanguard fund fell further in the one year the underlying Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost ground. But the difference was only
0.2 percentage points. When Vanguard was ahead, it led by as much
as 5.4 percentage points, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, published this month in The Wall Street Journal,
found S&AMP;P 500 funds performed better than actively managed general
stock funds in five of the last seven market downturns. That's not
a bad record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is not whether to buy an index fund,'' said
John C. Bogle Sr., senior chairman of the Vanguard Group and
leading cheerleader for index investing. ``An index fund goes down
with the market, point by point and no question about it. The real
issue is, should you be in equities at all? And that's a question
of long-term vs. short-term investing. If you've been building
capital all these years, should you stay the course?''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the index funds' relatively strong
performance. Over the last few years, the major reason is large-cap
stocks have appreciated very quickly, carrying the S&AMP;P 500 index
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, performance was boosted by the fact index
funds are very cheap to operate. An index fund attempts to match
the performance of a particular stock market index. It buys all or
a representative sample of the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500, for example.
Then it holds those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Both operating costs and trading costs are typically much lower
than those incurred by actively managed funds. That means more of
the profit goes to the shareholder _ you and me _ and less goes to
the fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   That buy-and-hold orientation also means the funds typically
have low turnover in their portfolios, which reduces taxes
investors must pay when they profit from stock sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you a broad exposure to the market at
extraordinarily efficient cost,'' observed Don Phillips, chief
executive officer of Morningstar, a widely respected mutual fund
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum may be a performance booster, too. Lots of people are
buying index funds these days, partly because of their excellent
returns in recent years and partly because many 401(k) retirement
plans include an S&AMP;P 500 index fund among the choices they give to
employees. That buying creates demand for the underlying stocks,
which is a support for their prices.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the time-tested rule that when things go bad,
bigger stocks hold up better than smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   But is an index fund the single answer to all your investment
worries? No.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, an index fund limits you to only one type of
asset. If you buy an S&AMP;P 500 fund, for example, you are investing
mainly in large U.S. companies. Even if you move to a fund that
tracks the Wilshire 5000-stock index, you're still investing only
in U.S. stocks. Most people would like more diversification than
that.
</P>
<P>
   A potential problem grows from the fact index funds are weighted
toward the largest companies in them. Among the S&AMP;P 500 stocks, a
handful of huge companies account for most of the growth in the
overall index.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, you own the most of whatever has gone up the
most in the recent past,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent objection to index funds is their goal itself _
being average. ``I want the opportunity to pick a winner,'' said
William K. Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. The
trick, of course, is to find active managers who have been market
beaters with some consistency over a period of years. A majority of
mutual funds don't gain as much as the indices in any given year.
</P>
<P>
   So what is an investor to do?
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is to put a portion of your portfolio into an
index fund, and consider it a core holding. If you plan to hold
that investment for, say, 10 years or more, you have time to live
through some market downturns. Over a long period, the savings from
low operating costs also will boost your total return
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is to stick with indexing but slide away
from funds that follow the S&AMP;P 500 index. There are very
specialized index funds, including single-country funds, various
bond funds and even socially responsible funds. If you want to
confine yourself to U.S. stocks, there are funds that track the
Wilshire 4500 and Wilshire 5000 stock indices.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic is to make all your moves gradual ones, whether
into or out of index funds. Bogle, who made a very successful
career by building index funds, said if he inherited a chunk of
cash, he would not shove all of it into stocks right now.
</P>
<P>
   He might invest two-thirds in stocks, he said, putting the
remainder in fixed- income investments. He would shift the
remaining third into stocks gradually, over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very sane and sensible, and it could easily be wrong,''
Bogle said. ``The investor is in the tough position of trying to
deal with his future when the future is very, very cloudy. The
weather is never very clear in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to take the first step, but not to be so
precipitate that if you're wrong, you come to regret it forever.''

   CNN-style channel planned for Austin
</P>
<P>
   By R. Michelle Breyer
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Time Warner Cable will launch a local all-news,
24-hour television channel next spring _ a CNN-style station for
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The channel will be available to more than 220,000 of the cable
company's subscribers in areas where the company has installed
fiber-optic cable _ including Austin, Round Rock, Leander and West
Lake Hills. It will report on local news, sports, weather and
special features from Austin and Central Texas, operating from a
20,000-square-foot studio that will be built at 16th and Colorado
streets. Time Warner will most likely change the format of an
existing television channel for the news channel, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, the nation's second-largest cable television
operator, has launched similar channels in New York City and
Rochester in New York and Orlando and the Tampa Bay area in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are more than two dozen local 24-hour cable
news channels operated by Time Warner and other companies.
Elsewhere in Texas, A.H. Belo Corp., which owns the Dallas Morning
News, also plans to start a cable news channel next year.
</P>
<P>
   The news channel in Austin will be Time Warner's first in a
smaller market. The others have been in the nation's 20 biggest
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin was chosen because it is a very vibrant, growing
area,'' said Bill Carey, president of the Austin division of Time
Warner. ``I personally believe the time is right for this type of
programming here in Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where the concept was started six years ago,
the channel is called NY1. In the Tampa Bay area, it's Bay News 9,
and in Orlando, it's Central Florida News 13. No name has been
selected for the Austin station.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner plans to hire 60 to 70 reporters, editors, video
journalists, producers and anchors for the new Austin channel. In
other markets, like Orlando, it has teamed up with local newspapers
to provide coverage. At this time, the company said it has no
formal agreements with any local news organization in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The entire focus of the channel will be Central Texas news _ ``a
local version that will operate like CNN's Headline News,'' Carey
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tampa Bay area, viewers see a repeating cycle of
broadcasts that are divided into half-hour packages of stories,
which can be modified as the day progresses. The station features
weather reports every nine minutes, and a half-hour sports call-in
show.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable is part of Time Warner Inc., one of the
nation's largest media conglomerates. It has 243,000 customers in
the Austin and Central Texas area.

 &HT;    Bankers association chief dies
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Robert E. Harris, president and chief executive
of the Texas Bankers Association, the largest and oldest state
banking organization in the nation, was found dead of a heart
attack Friday, August 21, in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 54, led the association, a trade group for 700 banks,
through the bank failures of the 1980s and into the banking
industry's recovery and record profits in the early 1990s. His
death came as the group was discussing a possible merger with the
smaller Independent Bankers Association of Texas, which represents
community banks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Banking Commissioner Catherine Ghiglieri said Harris'
passing represents a ``great loss to the banking industry. He was a
very strong advocate for the Texas Bankers Association and their
issues. He is going to be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible tragedy and a shock to all of us,'' said
Steve Scurlock, senior vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of Texas. Scurlock worked for Harris at the Texas
Bankers Association from 1991 to 1995. ``Bob had done a good job
leading the Texas Bankers Association into prosperous times from
what was basically a de facto depression in the banking industry
and the Texas economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris became president of the group in 1988. During his tenure,
the bankers association expanded to represent other financial
institutions, including savings and loan associations, trust
companies and savings banks.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining the Texas association, Harris served as chief
executive of the Oklahoma Bankers Association for eight years,
preceded by five years as chief executive of the Nebraska Bankers
Association. He also was senior executive vice president of the
First National Bank of Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the board of directors of the Graduate School of
Banking at the University of Wisconsin, he was in Madison to attend
a board meeting when he died.
</P>
<P>
   He is a past chairman of the State Association Division of the
American Bankers Association and of the Central States Conference
of Bankers Associations and has served as a member of ABA's
Government Relations Council.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a member of the boards of directors of the Graduate
School of Banking at Louisiana State University, the Southwestern
Graduate School of Banking at Southern Methodist University, of
PULSE EFT and the executive committee of BancInsure, an insurance
company for banks owned by banking associations. He also was a
founding director of the Institute for Certified Bankers, a
nationwide banker certification program.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Betty Jo, three sons, one daughter,
three grandchildren and his parents.

 &HT;    Buyer beware when using prepaid phone cards
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a big time of year for college students and prepaid
phone cards. Tens of thousands of students are returning to class,
and many are carrying prepaid cards with them.
</P>
<P>
   The prepaid cards are very convenient but, for some of the
students, they may also serve as their No. 1 consumer lesson:
caveat emptor, let the buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid cards are marketed by about 500 firms, and about 300
million cards are sold annually, according to the International
Telecard Association. Students _ or their parents _ are major
purchasers because of the convenience the cards offer for calling
home.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are also sold in large numbers to travelers; to
immigrants who often call overseas; and to people, such as
prisoners, who don't have normal access to phone service. Others
buy the cards for ``emergency use,'' perhaps when their car breaks
down and they have no change for a pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid cards typically range in price from $5 to $25, and they
are sold at various retail outlets, including convenience stores,
newsstands, drugstores and groceries.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are marketed by firms that buy time from lotance
carriers at wholesale rates, mark up the price and sell it to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To use a prepaid card, you dial an 800 access number, punch in
your card number, then dial the number you are calling. This is
very convenient, but with the convenience comes a need to shop
carefully. Keep these things in mind:
</P>
<P>
   -- Most prepaid cards are marketed by legitimate firms, but some
are bad deals, even frauds. The card doesn't work, or the service
is very poor, or you are hit with undisclosed surcharges when you
make calls. To check the card's quality, buy a small-denomination
one first, say $5, to test the service.
</P>
<P>
   -- Per-minute charges vary tremendously from card to card. They
normally are higher than regular phone charges, but not always.
Most honest cards disclose their U.S. rates on the package or
vending machine. Some cards charge a minimum amount, regardless of
the length of the call. This should be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Before buying a card, look for a toll-free customer
assistance number on the card or vending machine and call it. If
the number is constantly busy or not answered, or if there is no
customer service number, that's a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   -- Perhaps the best way to find a good prepaid phone card is to
do as you might with other services or products: Ask for
recommendations from friends or relatives who have used prepaid
cards.

 &HT;    Year 2000 exchanges magic for hysteria
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who are middle-aged or older, the Year 2000 had a
magical sort of feeling. Back in the '60s and '70s, the new
millennium was seen as almost impossibly far away. And, if folks
thought about a Year 2000 problem at all back then, the problem was
in living that long.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 is almost here now. It's no longer magical. And,
for the governments and businesses of the world, it is a
multi-billion dollar problem.
</P>
<P>
   By now, unless you live in a cave somewhere around Katmandu, you
have read all about the Y2K bug that plagues many computers. The
stories have taken on an almost hysterical tone, with serious (and
perhaps credible) predictions of everything from a paralyzed air
traffic control system, to the failure of the government to be able
to handle Social Security payments, to a nuclear war triggered by
faulty software running the missile system in some relatively
underdeveloped country.
</P>
<P>
   Since even the experts have trouble agreeing and since _ for
people who aren't computer programmers _ the problem itself is so
difficult to understand, let's start today's trek through the World
Wide Web at a site that provides a very basic look at the problem,
what causes it, and what makes fixing the problem so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The site is called What is the Y2K Millennium Problem and it's
located at http://www-de
</P>
<P>
   .ksc.nasa.gov/specsintact
</P>
<P>
   /sib1096/year2000/sld003.htm. As you'll notice, this is a NASA
site. The information is presented in slide show fashion. Instead
of clicking on links, use the VCR-like control buttons at the
bottom of the page to move ahead or backwards on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of fancy graphics, this site can be a little
slow. If you'd like a faster text page, simply press the icon for
the letter ``A'' on that same control panel.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has a slide show that's the heart of an online
seminar called Solving the Year 2000 Problem. You'll find the show
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .microsoft.com/seminar/98
</P>
<P>
   /Y2KStrategy714/portal.htm. By Microsoft's estimate you'll be
able to cover the material _ presented on 17 slides _ in little
over 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, especially for PC users, a lot of the software in
your computer comes from Microsoft. The giant software company has
done a good job explaining the problem and offering help.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still hungry for more information from Microsoft,
there's an entire collection of links that deals with almost every
aspect of the Year 2000 problem. You'll find this general purpose
collection at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .microsoft.com/year2000
</P>
<P>
   /?RLD &QC; 53. Once there, you can follow the links to pages that
offer information at various degrees of technical complexity.
You'll also find a link to a section that lets you find out just
what problems Microsoft's own software has with the Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Microsoft site, make sure you visit the FAQ
(frequently asked questions) section devoted to the problem at
http://www.microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   /ithome/topics/year2k/2kfaq
</P>
<P>
   /2kfaq01.htm. You'll have to search hard to find a place that
does a better job explaining almost any facet of the problem. And
since it's organized by question, you can jump right to the part
that interested you most.
</P>
<P>
   This is all serious stuff. And by now, if you've followed all
the links, you may be a bit depressed. So save this link for last.
It's called 12 Reasons to Ignore the Y2K Problem at
http://www.ecl.udel.edu/(tilde)hague
</P>
<P>
   /ignore.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons cited: ``4. Nostradamus never mentioned this
problem. 5. You believe a comet is due to hit the Earth in 2000 _
why bother?''

 &HT;    West Palm Beach man's heart 'beautiful' after 50 years of study
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ On Sept. 27, the city of Framingham, Mass.,
will honor the 10,000-plus men and women who have taken part in the
largest, longest and most productive study of heart disease in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   After careful consideration, Samuel Seltzer has decided not to
make the trip from his Century Village apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he says, waving the very idea out the window. ``What do
I wanna do that for?''
</P>
<P>
   The famous Framingham Heart Study turned 50 this year, and
Seltzer turned 103.
</P>
<P>
   Both are still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, when the U.S. Public Health Service decided to study
heart disease, Framingham was chosen because it offered a stable
population with low unemployment, an ethnic mix and proximity to
Boston's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer was 53 at the time, a native of Russia who came to the
United States in 1919. _ ``It cost me $52.'' He'd started out with
a horse and cart, peddling clothes around Framingham, and worked
hard until he owned a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask me much,'' he remembers. ``They wouldn't take
my wife, but they liked me. They checked me a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the study agreed to be examined every two years.
After his wife's death in 1969, Seltzer moved to Long Island, then
to Century Village in 1977. His examinations became infrequent, but
the study sent a nurse to examine him four years ago, while he was
visiting his children on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart, they told me it's beautiful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But not the oldest heart they've ever seen. Esta Shindler, a
study spokeswoman, says that honor goes to a woman three months
older than Seltzer, who's confined to a Canadian nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   But people listen when a 103-year-old man who still lives alone
offers health tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, I go to bed at 7 p.m., and I'm up at 5 a.m.,'' he
explains. ``When it's clear, I walk a quarter-mile to services
every morning. Then I come back and have breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is All-Bran, Raisin Bran or Cheerios, a slice of
pumpernickel bread and _ this is important _ juice diluted with a
little water.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is fruit cocktail or cottage cheese, with a slice of
pumpernickel and a glass of milk _ diluted with a little water.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, boiled eggs and tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take much ice cream,'' Seltzer says with a shrug. ``A
little vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a sip or two of wine at Passover, he has not drunk
alcohol, and he never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' he says, holding up a finger for attention,
``I didn't eat what I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   During Seltzer's 103 years, he has seen America change from a
place where horse carts were common to a place men leave to walk on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   What's the most impressive change he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer thinks a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to buy a suit of clothes for $30,'' he says. ``Now
you'd pay $90.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, listen,'' he says, ``I'm doing the best I can, and
whenever it comes, I'm ready. I live from day to day. I don't
expect miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock says 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be in bed by now,'' Seltzer says.

 &HT;    iMac making mark in sales, offering a symbolic success for
fallen Apple
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week was one of the most important in Apple
Computer's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the company's re-entry into the consumer market. And
it was quite a debut.
</P>
<P>
   Star of the ball was its iMac computer, a model that includes a
built-in screen and retails for $1,299. It's the best deal Apple
Computer has ever offered on a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, iMac sales have been brisk. Stores in Atlanta
and nationwide have reported people standing in line to see this
new computer, which resembles an iridescent gumdrop.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the iMac was selling well before Apple Computer even
released it. The company announced two weeks ago that it had
pre-sold 150,000 iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are forecasting that Apple Computer will
sell 250,000 iMacs by year-end, helping raise sales nearly 13.5
percent to 740,000 for the fourth quarter. The company sold 652,000
computers in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, brisk sales of the iMac are expected to dilute the
company's profit margin. That's because the iMac sells for such a
low price. Wall Street analysts estimate Apple's profit margin will
shrink to about 20 percent from a current 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While not a financial windfall, the iMac is an important
symbolic success for Apple. It has repositioned the company as once
again the computer industry's hip innovator.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers in The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other
leading newspapers have heralded the iMac as the most interesting
new computer since, well, the original Mac. It also was an
all-in-one unit.
</P>
<P>
   These high-profile reviews have more than turned back the storm
of criticism that nearly swamped the company during the past two
years. Respect for the company is rising and so is its profit and
market share, although it remains a small player with about 5
percent of total computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   What Apple needs to do now, many observers believe, is expand
its small market share. That means attracting customers other than
current Mac users. Will the iMac do that? Industry observers say
it's too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   While selling well now, the iMac may lose steam once users start
kicking the tires. It lacks some key features standard in most
computers today. One of them is a floppy drive, which lets users
easily copy and move files via a 3.5 inch disk.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature missing is standard connections for today's
peripherals such as printers. The iMac instead uses a new standard
that the industry is slowing moving toward.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is users will have to buy either a new printer
or a special device that lets them use their old ones with the
iMac. And, of course, that adds to the computer's price.

 &HT;    Bonnie gives Florida a near miss
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie, its winds churning at 115 mph, followed a
track to keep it far out to sea when it passes Palm Beach County
tonight, according to forecasts from the National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters don't expect the 300-mile-wide storm to hit land,
saying it should be 250 miles out to sea and as far north as South
Carolina by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They put the chance of Bonnie hitting Palm Beach County at 5
percent and the Treasure Coast at 7 percent. They expect the
Category 3 storm to be more than 400 hundred miles out to sea when
it passes South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As a Category 3 hurricane, Bonnie is considered capable of
causing severe coastal flooding and serious damage to buildings and
homes if it nears land.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew, which hit south of Miami six years ago today,
carried recorded winds of 145 mph, making it a Category 4 storm.
Forecasters, whose instruments failed them, believed Andrew's winds
were much stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie slowed to about 5 mph Saturday night after initially
racing across the ocean at speeds of close to 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters cautioned _ as spooked residents already knew _ that
it was too early to say exactly what Hurricane Bonnie would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping the (possible landfall) area pretty broad
because it isn't moving, it's just meandering a little bit,'' said
center meteorologist Michelle Huber. ``We're not letting anybody
off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of hurricane supplies such as plywood and water slowed
Sunday in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast as residents
took note of the hurricane's path.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, Eastpak and Bic took the place of Duracell, Evian and
Energizer as the hot products at a Target store in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many more people interested in back-to-school
supplies. . .today,'' manager Gary Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot near Royal Palm Beach brought in extra cashiers
but sent them home early when business didn't pick up where it left
off Saturday, assistant store manager Kevin Wagaman said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm moving slightly northward was 180 miles east-northeast
of San Salvador in the Bahamas at 8 p.m., centered near latitude
24.8 north, longitude 71.8 west. But the hurricane center said it
was expected to turn to the northwest later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer models remain consistent with the slow turn to
the northwest,'' said Daniel Brown, another meterologist with the
hurricane center. ``They feel pretty confident that it will happen.
It's still worth watching. The official forecast has it going 250
miles east of the Carolinas.''
</P>
<P>
   The coastline, Brown noted, was within the 300-mile margin of
error of the three-day forecast. Any possible landfall would be
late Tuesday, but already a heavy surf advisory was posted from
Jupiter Inlet to Brunswick, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane dwarfed the sparsely populated Bahamian islands,
drenching them with some rain and gusty winds. Its worst
thunderstorms battered the open seas to its north, said National
Hurricane Center forecaster John Guiney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lucky thing is ... the Bahamas will not be feeling the
full brunt of the storm,'' he said. But he noted that Bonnie has
been ``very erratic ... meandering around,'' making forecasts less
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew blasted its way ashore around 4 a.m. Aug. 24, 1992,
pummeling south Dade County for five hours until 100,000 homes and
80,000 businesses had been damaged or destroyed. Parts of
Homestead, just south of Miami, were practically leveled. Chaos
reigned as residents faced a wasteland without electricity or food;
animals, even escaped monkeys, roamed; and swindlers moved in to
take advantage of the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Tad DeMilly, who was mayor of Homestead then, said the town of
24,000 still has not recovered economically. Fully 90 percent of it
was affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to turn to the north soon, then immediately to the
east, and get rid of it,'' he said. ``We don't want anybody else to
go through what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post reporters Rachel Masory, Seth Mnookin and Joe
Viduiera contributed to this story, which was supplemented with
information from wire stories.

 &HT;    Free home drug test worth a pass
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While his parents watched Jay Leno,
Jonathan Abdo lighted a joint and smoked it in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   It was stupid, he knew. His parents could just walk outside and
smell the weed wafting through the open window.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdo liked how it made him feel _ and besides, he'd been
doing it since he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to his parents, who finally found some marijuana
in Jonathan's room in March. They told Jonathan, 18, he'd have to
leave the family's West Palm Beach home if he didn't agree to pay
for drug testing and counseling to prove he was trying to beat his
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed, because he likes living at home until he graduates
from Forest Hill High School. And, because drug tests cost about
$60 at local pharmacies, Jonathan was very happy his dad knew Dr.
Douglas Smith, an emergency-room doctor at Good Samaritan Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is developing an at-home kit that tests for marijuana,
cocaine, amphetamines, opium and heroin. He plans to hand out kits
free to parents. He gave the Abdos kits to try.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan has taken about 10 of them and he's been drug-free for
six months. The test gives Jonathan proof. And it provides relief
for his father, David.
</P>
<P>
   When his dad brought the test home, Jonathan said, ``bring it
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to hide,'' he says. ``It's a good way to be
like, `There, I showed you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   David is relieved that Jonathan's tests have proved he's been
clean for six months. Still, a therapist told him that he doubted
Jonathan could give up his long-standing habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see what it does to people and I don't want that for
(Jonathan),'' explains David, a paramedic. ``I don't want that for
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   As Smith listens to Jonathan tell his story, he says this is the
exact result he and his group of supporters have hoped for as they
have worked on the project during the past couple years. But Smith,
the father of two boys, knows not every family will have as good an
outcome and he says drug testing isn't for every family. He just
wants to make it available to parents who do want a way to hold
their children accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Since an initial news story on Aug. 13, Smith has gotten about
50 calls asking about the drug kits _ even though they won't be
given away to the general public until the end of October. That's
when advisory board member and former Secretary of State Al Haig,
who lives in Palm Beach, will help kick off the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those people call, it's in their voice. They're scared,''
says Smith, 38, sitting in his one-story home a short distance from
the ocean in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   With persistence, Smith has been able to attract interest from
benefactors in Palm Beach and beyond to pay for the kits and
testing at SmithKline Beecham Laboratories. About $300,000 would be
needed to cover all the costs of buying 10,000 kits and running the
tests _ $30 per kit, Smith says. But $210,000 will be enough to get
the program started, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He has about half of that raised, including an undisclosed
amount from most of the people on his advisory board, $40,000 from
the Lattner Foundation in Delray Beach and a $30,000 pledge from
the Birmingham Foundation in Boston. The group has spent about
$23,000 so far on legal fees to set up the corporation, grant
writing, color brochures to raise money and postage and printing,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group, Drug Free America, doesn't plan to stop in
Palm Beach County either. Smith already is talking to three to five
cities in North Carolina and Texas, but he declined to say which
ones. Smith's group is not related to the national Partnership for
a Drug Free America.
</P>
<P>
   (break)
</P>
<P>
   No specific event prompted Smith to develop the kits. Just many
scenes from the emergency room. Parents who came in with their
children and asked for drug tests. Kids who were stoned and
seriously injured after an accident. Smith saw their fear and
wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   So he started his anti-drug crusade quietly and wherever he
could.
</P>
<P>
   One night, he made a key connection when Ruby S. Rinker brought
a friend in to the emergency room. Rinker already knew of Smith
because of her work on the advisory board to Good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   He took the opportunity to tell her about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker, who once worked in the Palm Beach County school system,
liked the idea so much she convinced local philanthropist John
Brogan to back another cause.
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing, Brogan acknowledged, because he wasn't
looking for yet another cause to champion. He in turn introduced
Smith to more potential supporters, including Haig. Politicians
have signed on, too, including Palm Beach County Commissioner Mary
McCarty and U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, R-West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Haig says he became interested in the campaign against drugs at
the end of the Vietnam War. He recommended using drug tests because
so many soldiers appeared to be addicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what drugs did to young soldiers in Europe and
Vietnam,'' Haig says. ``I've seen what it has done to our inner
city. . . . It attacks everyone touched by it in very dreadful
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   After the idea was researched, drug testing began in the
military, Haig says.
</P>
<P>
   When the kits become available in Palm Beach County, parents
will be able to pick them up at the sheriff's office and the West
Palm Beach Police Department. They will be available to anyone who
wants one.
</P>
<P>
   Drug testing is not for every family, Smith says. For example,
some parents might want to consider counseling for family problems
that resulted in the drug use.
</P>
<P>
   After parents choose to use the drug test, they should tell
their children they will test them in four weeks. That gives kids a
chance to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to clean out their system,'' Smith explains. ``We
don't want them to catch their kids. We want this to be a
deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   After a urine sample is taken, it is sealed in a container and
sent to the lab in an envelope provided with prepaid postage.
</P>
<P>
   Then the parent calls to get results. If the child tests
positive, the parent will talk to a doctor about the results to
make sure the child wasn't taking a legal drug that could show up
on the test.
</P>
<P>
   At local drug stores, the only kit available tests hair strands,
which generally are not considered as accurate as urine tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Abdos say they bought one, but then discovered it was of no
use. Jonathan had been shaving his hair so there weren't any
strands to test.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith's tests, Jonathan's been able to prove he's beating
his drug habit. It's been six months since he tasted marijuana.
It's been tough, Jonathan says, because he liked how the drug made
him feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends feel sorry for me,'' he says. ``It's not so bad.
It's better than getting kicked out of the house over a little
weed.''

   COMMENTARY: Gay-bashing can be cured
</P>
<P>
   By Martin Gottlieb
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What people don't understand about gay-bashing is
that it can be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will try to tell you gay-bashing is genetic, that
people are born with it. Baloney. Nobody has ever proved that. No
gay-bashing gene has been isolated. It's all speculation.
</P>
<P>
   What we know for sure is that some people used to be gay-bashers
and no longer are.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who once would have shunned any public association
with gay forces now go to gay fund-raisers and promise support.
Mainstream comedians who used to habitually make homosexuals the
objects of ridicule now look elsewhere for material.
</P>
<P>
   What we have to understand about gay-bashers is that, even
though we reject their behavior as mean - sinful, if you will -
that doesn't mean we have passed permanent judgment upon them as
people. The issue is (ITAL NEXT WORD) behavior. If they change
their behavior, there's no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Look, lots of other people behave badly, too: alcoholics,
kleptomaniacs. That doesn't mean we hate them. We try to help them
come to terms with their problem. We provide loving support.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing we could possibly do to them would be to simply
accept their behavior. They need us to help them change. Same thing
with gay-bashers. Moreover, when we say change, we don't even
necessarily mean they must change their desires. Again, the issue
is behavior. If some guy's blood pressure rises (for political
reasons) every time he sees Ellen DeGeneres, if he is driven to
tell her she is headed for hell, that she's a sinner, fine. As an
American, he is entitled to think whatever he wants to think.
</P>
<P>
   Just so long as he doesn't act. Just so long as he behaves
according to societal norms. If he keeps quiet, if he denies his
fundamental nature, we can love him as a fellow human being who's
entitled to live as a free American just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The worst problem arises when these people go beyond living
their own lives inappropriately. When they start to promote their
lifestyle; when the politicians start being influenced by the
gay-bashing agenda; when you can't turn on a television without
seeing notions being promoted that are repugnant to all Americans
who believe in the traditional values of human dignity and
tolerance, then it is time to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the gay-bashing interest groups will say we are
trying to squelch them, trying to exclude them from First Amendment
protections. But it doesn't matter what the spokesmen say. We know
we will be reaching individuals as individuals. We know we will be
bringing some people to the light. Others will not be ready, of
course. But if we know we can reach some people, can we justify not
trying?
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing mysterious about the techniques of conversion
therapy as applied to gay-bashers. There's nothing any official
groups of psychologists or psychiatrists could object to or debunk.
The first thing you do, obviously, is separate people from
temptation. Get them away - for a little while, at least - from
other gay-bashers who will congratulate them for agreeing with
them, who will, in other words, be enablers.
</P>
<P>
   Then you simply confront the prospective converts with reason.
You point out that the idea of, say, a 15- or 17-year-old boy (ITAL
NEXT WORD) choosing homosexuality - when he knows that would make
him, of all things, different from his friends in a fundamental way
- is pretty seriously dubious. You point out that a huge number of
deeply religious, highly expert people read the Bible quite
</P>
<P>
   differently from those who point to a quote here and there
denouncing homosexuaou discuss the meaning of the term
``pursuit of happiness,'' and you ask whether it has any meaning if
one's sexual nature is to be completely suppressed. Piece of cake.
It works. We have to believe it works - on those who are ready to
listen - if we believe in reason. To say it doesn't work is to
abandon faith in our fellow man.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: I had eveything to do with my son's success
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ My son Kristofor was an early talker - just
about 11months that sultry July afternoon he stuck his first words
together.
</P>
<P>
   I was putting him down for a nap when he declared: ``Mmm wants
Pwacky.'' Translation: ``Bring me Pyewacket (the cat).'' He wasn't
about to close an eye without his best Siamese buddy by his side. I
was thrilled. ``It was an entire sentence!''
</P>
<P>
   I proudly babbled to anyone who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, he hotfooted it into the kitchen
(another surprise since he hadn't bothered to let me know he was
walking), grabbed a handful of my leg, and demanded: ``Drammich,
Momma!''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``I'm hungry woman; how about a sandwich?''
</P>
<P>
   Unprepared as I was for the finer points of motherhood, my
budding orator caught me with my signs down, an oversight I quickly
remedied.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, everything in the house had a label stuck to it...except,
of course, Pyewacket, whose dignity would have been offended at
being labeled a C-A-T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spell it, Momma,'' young son would command and point.
``P-I-A-N-O'' I'd carefully sound out and then pronounce:
``Piano.''
</P>
<P>
   ``P-I-A-N-O'' he'd copycat. ``Paano.'' Close enough. Soon it was
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever I said to him, he'd insist I spell it first. And when I
reminded him, ``It's time for B-E-D,'' he would answer in kind:
``N-O,'' which of course called for bribery. ``How about an
S-T-O-R-Y?'' I'd ask. He'd grin, grab Pooh bear by his remaining
ear, and spell, ``O-K.''
</P>
<P>
   And so my son's fascination with words and their meanings had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   He was reading before he started kindergarten. No Plato or James
Joyce, but he could rip his way through Sendak and Scarry like a
pro. ``Storytime!'' he'd announce as he grabbed his book of the
moment and headed for his room. That meant the cats and I were to
follow him down the hall and join him in his bottom bunk. After a
brief, extemporaneous introduction, he'd read us all to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor was 14 when he joined the high school debate team. It
was no surprise that he began bringing home trophies he'd earned
with his silver-tongued shmooz. I already knew this kid could argue
the horns off a Billy goat and it didn't make a bit of difference
whether or not he knew anything about the topic under discussion.
He could invent believable facts faster than a politician on a
platform, which came in
</P>
<P>
   real handy once he started driving.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, as the years passed and the boy eased into manhood, I
found myself basking in the spillover of his various
accomplishments. When he graduated from high school with that gold
cord around his neck attesting to his honor student status, I
secretly congratulated myself for having done all of the right
stuff when he was just a sprout. Later, when he was accepted into a
particularly selective grad school program, I was convinced it was
my love, affection, and dedication that had brought him this far.
</P>
<P>
   But that was last week. This week all the talk is about a book
written by a New Jersey grandmother who claims parents have little
or nothing to do with their children's successes or failures.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Nurture Assumption'' by Judith Rich Harris, a
writer of psychology textbooks, the only thing a parent contributes
to a kid is genes (not limited to the designer kind), which leaves
me out in limbo land if my adopted heir-apparent buys into the
book. Ms. Harris allows that environment counts, but not the home
kind _ more the peer group and schoolhouse kind. She insists that
the person a child becomes has little or nothing to do with how his
parents brought him up, hence the statement: Sometimes good parents
just have bad children.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, that comes under the heading: ``Stuff happens.''
Meanwhile, how am to explain to my 31-year-old son that all of his
accomplishments do NOT stem from my devoted parenting? That his
successes are in no way related to my chocolate chip cookies and
erudite chat? Or even worse _ that my nagging was in vain?
</P>
<P>
   Time to come clean. I call my son and confess. You know what he
says?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull!''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he says.
</P>
<P>
   So there, Ms. Harris.

Tami Lancut Leibovitz says, ``If you teach someone to dress well,
but they don't sit up straight, you haven't done your job.'' Thanks
to a worldwide economy, a growing part of image development is
global etiquette, consultants say. (Grantham, Palm Beach Post)

   TECH-REPORT _ ATLANTA _ The Encyclopaedia Britannica has been

Edinburgh, Scotland, the venerable reference work has saved
countless numbers of students who waited until the night before an
essay was due to start writing. In July the company opened another

   MAC-REPORT _ ATLANTA _ This week was one of the most important
in Apple Computer's recent history. It marked the company's
re-entry into the consumer market. And it was quite a debut. Star
of the ball was its iMac computer, a model that includes a built-in
screen and retails for $1,299. It's the best deal Apple Computer
has ever offered on a new computer. (Haddad, Atlanta

   NETWATCH _ A quick and witty presidential history lesson from
the San Jose Mercury News traces presidential infidelities all the
way back to Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president and
author of the Declaration of Independence. The site at
http://www.mercurycenter.com/nation/media/krt/president takes a
lighthearted but comprehensive look at nearly 200 years of scandal
with the cheeky title ``Presidential Peccadillos? Shocked? Don't
Be.'' (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   DIGICAM _ Perfect for the impatient, the computer geek or anyone
who wants to see photos in seconds, these hand-held and sometimes
pocket-sized cameras allow you to snap pictures, and see the images
on a computer screen or on paper within minutes. And you can use
your computer to edit the photographs _ no darkroom required.

   CYBERSCENE _ For those who are middle-aged or older, the Year
2000 had a magical sort of feeling. Back in the '60s and '70s, the
new millennium was seen as almost impossibly far away. And, if
folks thought about a Year 2000 problem at all back then, the
problem was in living that long. The Year 2000 is almost here now.
It's no longer magical. And, for the governments and businesses of
the world, it is a multi-billion dollar problem. (Husted, Atlanta

   TECHNOBUDDY _ Most folks strain and fret too much when getting
ready to buy a new PC. They study magazines, ask friends, consult
psychics and hang out in computer stores. Truth is _ until recently
_ you could do pretty well by simply setting a budget for how much
you can afford to spend on a PC, then shopping for the most
powerful machine you can find in that price range. Well, if you are
one of those fretters I was talking about, do I have good news for
you. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TECH-TOOLS _ ATLANTA _ My (relatively) new computer is equipped
with a DVD-ROM drive, a technology for which little appears to be

the DVD, or digital video disc, version of its popular Encarta
Deluxe encyclopedia. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

newsmagazine shows. There are so many, and they are so cheap to

 &HT;    COLUMN: Joke lifting a common failure among reporters, including
me
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Barnicle, who wrote a fine column for the Boston Globe for
25 years,
</P>
<P>
   resigned recently after a weeks-long furor over stolen jokes and
fabricated
</P>
<P>
   stories.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Barnicle was suspended without pay after lifting some
jokes from
</P>
<P>
   comedian George Carlin's book without properly attributing them.
The paper
</P>
<P>
   asked him to resign but then backed down when he refused and
hundreds of
</P>
<P>
   readers raised Cain about his imminent departure.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle says he used jokes friends told him or he found on the
Internet,
</P>
<P>
   and he had never read Carlin's book. Trouble is, Barnicle, who
appears
</P>
<P>
   regularly on a Boston TV station, had plugged the book a month
or so before.
</P>
<P>
   He still says he never actually read the book, and that's his
story and he's
</P>
<P>
   sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   Then he resigned after it became obvious he had made up entire
parts of a
</P>
<P>
   column several years ago. He should have quit. Stealing jokes is
one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Making up stories and pretending they're true ought to get any
journalist
</P>
<P>
   canned.
</P>
<P>
   I found this story fascinating and sad, for two reasons. The
Boston Globe
</P>
<P>
   is one of the newspapers I grew up reading, so it's always held
a warm place
</P>
<P>
   in my heart. I got my addiction to ink on paper reading the
Globe, its
</P>
<P>
   blue-collar competitor the Boston Record-American, and then the
New
</P>
<P>
   Hampshire papers, the staid, classy Concord Monitor, and the
right-wing
</P>
<P>
   foaming-at-the-mouth Manchester Union-Leader. The latter's
publisher then
</P>
<P>
   was William Loeb, who made Ed Muskie cry in 1968 while running
for
</P>
<P>
   president, effectively ending his campaign. My dad, a commercial
artist, did
</P>
<P>
   occasional free-lance editorial cartoons for the Union-Leader in
the late
</P>
<P>
   1950s. I remember one cartoon he drew showing Russia's Kruschev
wearing
</P>
<P>
   devil horns just before the famed Kitchen Debate with Nixon.
Subtlety was
</P>
<P>
   not a virtue at the Union-Leader, and my dad understood that.
</P>
<P>
   The Union-Leader is still right-wing but considerably better
</P>
<P>
   journalistically under Loeb's widow. The Concord Monitor, to
which my mother
</P>
<P>
   still subscribes, is one of the finest small dailies in the
country. The
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe is owned now by The New York Times, while the
Record-American is still a delightfully trashy tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason I avidly read every word I could about the
Barnicle saga
</P>
<P>
   is that I constantly steal jokes, puns and one-liners for
columns. If you
</P>
<P>
   read a joke or pun in my column, the odds are overwhelming that
I stole it.
</P>
<P>
   There, I said it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference, however. I have always freely admitted
that I stole
</P>
<P>
   the material, whether I got it over the Internet - the world's
best resource
</P>
<P>
   for jokes and puns - or a friend told it to me. And I tell where
I stole it
</P>
<P>
   from.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is wonderful because:
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of jokes floating around in cyberspace, no
doubt
</P>
<P>
   contributing to a decrease in productivity among white-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes are written down.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I can just cut and paste them into my column. This is a
good thing,
</P>
<P>
   because my ability to remember jokes ranks right up there with
my ability to
</P>
<P>
   dunk a basketball into a regulation goal. Zip. Zilch. I am
</P>
<P>
   punchline-challenged. I have mangled jokes so badly that
listeners thought I
</P>
<P>
   had lapsed into tongues. But I can cut and paste them with the
best.
</P>
<P>
   Since I recently wrote a column with a few stolen jokes and
one-liners in
</P>
<P>
   it, I have been happily deluged with one-liners and such from
readers across
</P>
<P>
   the country. One reader, in Moline, Illinois, wants to know what
the heck
</P>
<P>
   ``Nacogdoches'' means. ``Sounds like a Mexican greeting,'' he
wrote. I set him
</P>
<P>
   straight in a hurry. Another reader, in Lima, Ohio, sent a
rather ribald
</P>
<P>
   joke that can't be printed in a family newspaper. And yet
another, writing
</P>
<P>
   from the anonymity of cyberspace, sent:
</P>
<P>
   10 Words That Don't Exist, But Should
</P>
<P>
   Hope you enjoy. Remember, I stole these. I'm admitting it.
</P>

columnist.

</P>
<P>
   Just weeks ago, after many rounds of hard bargaining, the IMF
finally authorized a $22.6 billion loan package for Russia.
Meanwhile, the Russian markets have continued to plunge and fears
of a total inflationary collapse persist. Despite initial optimism
from the IMF, investors are asking hard questions about progress,
before putting money into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, the ordinary men and women on the street are
living day to day, trying to feed their children, often going for
weeks and months unpaid, despite holding, perhaps, two or three
jobs and exhausting themselves with work.
</P>
<P>
   What is the problem here? Is Russia, as the president states,
really under control?
</P>
<P>
   Other questions are being asked too both in Russia and the West:
Did the IMF do the right thing? Can the latest IMF bailout affect
the Russian situation in a positive way? How can IMF money
influence the course of events in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   At home and abroad, I am asked very often whether aid to Russia
is necessary and, if so, what kind of aid. Legitimate questions,
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary package was an endorsement of the program of
anti-crisis measures proposed by the government of former Prime
Minister Kirienko. When presenting the plan to Parliament, the
prime minister said that the Cabinet was, in effect, charting a new
economic policy aimed above all at reviving production. But it is
already clear that the new economic policy is no more than a
mirage.
</P>
<P>
   His modest steps initially planned to stimulate production _ the
real economy _ have now been dropped from the government's program.
The tax burden is set to increase, most of it falling on the
beleaguered people. Hence, the too-small amounts of real income and
effective demand can be expected to shrink. With tax pressures on
business continuing to increase, economic growth will not resume.
</P>
<P>
   In today's global society, a total collapse of the Russian
economy would send tremors throughout the world. The old Cold War
thinking _ ``let them suffer, we will win'' _ has no place in this
world where boundaries are slim and we are one people.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia and its partners are facing a dead end, this has
strong implications for the West, for Asia and for the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe is that the root causes of the crisis _ despite
Western bailouts _ lie in Russia. They lie in the flawed economic
policies pursued for seven years now, with the West's support.
These policies have had a bad effect on Russia. They have
discredited democracy and magnified corruption, lawlessness and
arbitrary rule. They have allowed organized crime to penetrate ever
deeper into the bodies of government.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, most analysts feel that the IMF package, based on the
pledges of the president and the Kirienko government, just like the
previous bailout in spring 1997, is bound to fail because it lacks
popular support.
</P>
<P>
   If so _ and the conclusion rings true _ what should we expect?
Moscow is awash with scenarios trying to predict further
developments.
</P>
<P>
   If the president and his ever-changing entourage continue to
insist on a flawed and unworkable economic program, it could ignite
mass protest. Currently, 90 percent of those polled think that a
social upheaval could erupt in Russia in the near future. It is
quite ominous and the events could go out of control. This is an
unacceptable scenario.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a different course of action, which offers a
realistic alternative to chaos. I suggest that if the breathing
space allowed by the IMF loan _ we were told that it would allow us
a respite _ does exist, then it should be used as time to chart an
orderly way out of the most dramatic phases of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to us to implement the reforms that best suit our own
circumstances. Our reforms are entirely our responsibility. We do
need support from other nations. I am, however, against handouts.
We need equal and mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we should have early presidential and parliamentary
elections, held simultaneously, this fall or early spring, to open
the way to a type of federal government that would have credibility
among a majority of the Russian people and thus be strong enough to
implement a program for ending Russia's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The president should call for these elections, and they should
be coupled with a referendum on certain sections of the
Constitution, in order to reallocate the powers of government
between the president, the cabinet and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1993 Constitution, which vested the president with
unlimited powers, has turned out to be both unworkable and
dangerous. It is a source of political instability, engendering
irresponsible behavior and confrontation between the branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   I also propose submitting to the referendum a constitutional
amendment creating a post of life-long senator for former
presidents after they leave office. Such an initiative would help
to ease this very dramatic moment, avoiding a dangerous division in
Russian society and assuring a democratic transition from one team
to another.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come for the president to prove that Russia's
interests and stability and, above all, the interests of its people
are indeed his highest priority.

   Just weeks ago, after many rounds of hard bargaining, the IMF
finally authorized a $22.6 billion loan package for Russia.
Meanwhile, the Russian markets have continued to plunge and fears
of a total inflationary collapse persist. Despite initial optimism
from the IMF, investors are asking hard questions about progress,
before putting money into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, the ordinary men and women on the street are
living day to day, trying to feed their children, often going for
weeks and months unpaid, despite holding, perhaps, two or three
jobs and exhausting themselves with work.
</P>
<P>
   What is the problem here? Is Russia, as the president states,
really under control?
</P>
<P>
   Other questions are being asked too both in Russia and the West:
Did the IMF do the right thing? Can the latest IMF bailout affect
the Russian situation in a positive way? How can IMF money
influence the course of events in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   At home and abroad, I am asked very often whether aid to Russia
is necessary and, if so, what kind of aid. Legitimate questions,
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary package was an endorsement of the program of

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Polls show Americans are happy
about last week, because two days after Bill Clinton admitted being

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ahh, Disneyland. Mickey Mouse, Space Mountain, the very latest
in ultrasound equipment...
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Ultrasound equipment?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The health-and-fitness world of the future (along
with the worlds of the home, the workplace, transportation and
entertainment), is now on display in Tomorrowland's new
``Innoventions'' exhibit. The exhibit combines Disney's
storytelling abilities with the expertise of companies like Kaiser
Permanente to demonstrate the hottest developments in technology.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking hands-on fun here, for grownups and kids. Kids
ages five and up will get the most out of the ``Focus on Health''
exhibit, says Disneyland spokesperson John McClintock. But even
younger kids will enjoy the lights, sounds, and action o and will
love running through the interactive heart and hearing the steady
``thump, thump, thump'' sound. (And after viewing the Kaiser
exhibit, parents of preschoolers and busy toddlers will want to
stop by Honeywell's ``Home'' exhibit, where young children can
crawl through a designed-for-kids heating system that includes a
maze of ductwork.)
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Focus on Health'' exhibit, you'll learn, at interactive
kiosks, about medical advances such as artificial skin, minimally
invasive surgery, ultrasound, and how plants such as bananas can be
used to deliver the immunizations of the future. (Now why didn't
they have that when my son needed his baby shots?)
</P>
<P>
   ``'Innoventions' breaks new ground on many levels,'' says Terry
Dobson, Walt Disney Imagineering senior concept designer for the
exhibits. ``Guests have traditionally visited Disneyland to ride
the rides and see the shows. Now they'll be able to play
interactive games together as well.''
</P>
<P>
   When you enter ``Innoventions,'' you'll board a ``loading pod''
on the slowly rotating lower level. You'll be greeted by your
enthusiastic audio-animatronic host, ``Tom Morrow'' (with actor
Nathan Lane o a perfect choice o providing the voice). You'll then
step through a portal to enter the turning building, where more
than 120 interactive games, displays and activities await.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``Focus on Health'' exhibit, you'll visit hands-on
ultrasound and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) kiosks, see the
latest devices for laparoscopic surgery, and compare the workings
of the heart and lungs as they are influenced by both healthy and
unhealthy lifestyles. And be sure to check out the ``Dr. Elixer''
live show, which involves guests in a high-energy, truly funny show
about health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibits are very theatrical,'' says Richard Hutton,
senior vice president, creative development, for Walt Disney
Imagineering. And (yippee!) you won't have to tell the kids ``don't
touch,'' he adds. ``Today, people learn best in an interactive
environment. You remember something if you can touch it, feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hutton says, ``You can play with an MRI machine
that scans the human body, slice by slice.'' Another highlight is
the 10-foot-high interactive human heart, he adds, noting that when
you put your hand on the heart, you can hear your own heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in healthcare and wellness aren't strictly limited to
the ``Focus on Health'' exhibit. If you have allergies or asthma,
for example, be sure to check out Honeywell's ``Home'' exhibit,
which showcases an innovative indoor-air-quality system.
</P>
<P>
   As time and medical technology march on, won't ``Innoventions''
look a little, ah, dated? Not to worry, says Hutton. ``Innoventions
will be refurbished every year, and totally redone every three
years. It will be very dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   What's my favorite part of ``Innoventions''? You can stay as
long as you like, playing games and interacting with some truly
cool exhibits. Unlike many Disneyland attractions, which feature
lines followed by a two-minute ride (Don't get me wrong o I love
Space Mountain), ``Innoventions'' lasts as long as you want it to.
</P>
<P>
   When you leave ``Innoventions,'' you'll probably come away with
some great ideas for improving your family's health and fitness.
For tips on staying healthy while you're at Disneyland, check out
the sidebar.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a little cotton candy o followed by a ride on
Space Mountain, of course o can't hurt.

   The negotiations rivaled those between President Clinton and
Saddam Hussein. Trying to cajole my daughter into leaving a
friend's house was excruciatingly delicate, requiring all the
fortitude of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah hated goodbyes, and from around age 2 until 6,
leave-takings were difficult. Despite my telling her when I planned
to pick her up and promises of fun stuff for her at home, she'd
either hide or announce that she ``needed'' to do 103 things first.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, she'd fling herself onto some furniture and
lose all movement in her arms and legs.

   I'd apologize and try to cover my embarrassment with a few bon
mots. Still, after a day of work, I'd inevitably lose my temper,
and threaten punishments that I rarely enforced. After what seemed
like an eternity, Sarah would surrender.
</P>
<P>
   My second child, Michael had difficult moments, but I was
delighted that leave-taking wasn't one of them. Experts agree that
children vary widely in ability to cope with transitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems like an inconsequential step for an adult can loom
quite large in the eyes and mind of a child,'' notes Allan Gonsher,
president of Kids Inc., a counseling center in Omaha, Neb.
``Interestingly, parents often prepare for the major changes in a
child's life - a switch in schools, a move to a new town, the birth
of a sibling, the day Mom goes back to work - but overlook the
hundreds of small moments in the day that can be just as tough for
a child to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is easier for some children than for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although almost all kids have trouble with transitions from
time to time, temperament plays a major role,'' says Harold S.
Koplewicz, M.D., director of New York University's Child Study
Center in New York. ``Youngsters are born with either an ability or
an inability to adjust to change in their external as well as
internal environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some possess a basically sunny disposition, which allows them
to shift gears and go with the flow,'' he says. ``Others are by
nature more sensitive, cautious, and rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is stressful for youngsters because they thrive on
predictability,'' adds Debbie Webb Blackburn, Ph.D., director of
clinical training at the Virginia Treament Center for Children in
Richmond, Va. Even positive change, like leaving home for a party
or the beach, can trigger anxiety in kids.
</P>
<P>
   Although young children have short attention spans, they often
focus on an activity singlemindedly. It's not easy to break that
concentration. To be told by a parent or teacher that they must is
even more stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child wants to feel that she has some control over her
life,'' notes Harry Z. Coren, M.D., a San Francisco-based child and
adolescent psychiatrist. ``Consider how much less burdened you feel
when you make your own decision to do something, as opposed to when
your boss or your spouse says that you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   While my daughter was temperamentally change-challenged, there
was much I could have done to help her. Kids need parents to guide
them through changes of emotion and environment.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get a child to move faster can backfire and trigger a
struggle because dawdling is a child's way of saying she's in
charge. As I learned late, there are effective ways to encourage
kids to handle transitions.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a change-resistant youngster, many assume our child
is dragging his heels to get back at us, and we expect an F in
Parenting 101.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Claire Lerner, the mother of 7-year-old Sam and
2-year-old Jessica, assumed. Though now a child development
specialist with Zero to Three, the National Center for Infants,
Toddlers and their Families in Washington, D.C., Lerner was stumped
when she noticed Sam fussed at even minor transitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While his pre-school classmates seemed to glide with relative
ease from activity to leave-taking, Sam became gridlocked when it
was time to say goodbye,'' Lerner recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise stepping back and asking, ``What is my child
struggling with here? Is he scared? Tired? Worried?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to understand what led up to the behavior before you
can figure out how to handle it,'' explains Blackburn. If you don't
give yourself distance, you may do things that are ineffective in
getting what you want - and what your child needs. Yelling and
ultimatums don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your child that you know change is hard, and that her
feelings are legitimate. ``The emotions welling up inside a child
can be confusing and overwhelming,'' says Koplewicz. ``Parents have
to interpret what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sam Lerner had a tough time leaving school or a friend's
house, his mother found it helped to put her arms around him and
say softly, ``I know that it's very hard to put all the toys away
and say goodbye, so why don't we do it together?'' His teachers
started to handle things the same way; things improved.
</P>
<P>
   Until age of 6 or 7, kids have little concept of time. ``Telling
a child of 3 or 4 that you're leaving in five minutes means nothing
to her,'' notes Coren. Although you should still give these
messages, add visual cues or link times to an event in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Anzelmo Glasner, a mother of three in Potomac, Md., sets a
kitchen timer so her kids can see the arrow moving. ``I think it
gives them a sense of time passing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some children have difficulty with transitions because they
think that all their fun is being removed - and that they'll never
have a good time again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have enough life experience to know that though one
good thing is ending, something else will take its place,'' notes
Coren. So use a positive spin: ``I'm sad, too, that we have to
leave the museum, but when we get home we can read the book we
bought that tells all about what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider how flexible you can be and what choices might be
appropriate. You might say, ``It's time to get ready to go, but we
can still read one more story or draw one more picture. Which would
you like to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling? Try behavior modification, suggests Koplewicz.
You can say, ``This seems to be hard for you. Here's the deal: Each
time you leave a play date without a fuss, you'll get a star. If
you earn three stars, you can pick a small prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes, the best-laid plans don't work. If your
child loses control, says Coren, you might say, ``We can do this
the easy way or the hard way, but we must go.''
</P>
<P>
   When you help children build skills to deal with change, you are
teaching them how to handle whatever curveballs life brings.
</P>
<P>
   I confess my daughter rarely left anyplace without at least a
small struggle until, well, maybe fourth grade. Still, I can say
that my husband and I found that understanding why she was behaving
this way helped us cope better and apologize less.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As commercial venues on the Internet continue to multiply, it
has become increasingly difficult to find the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a book, for example, chances are that
you'll search for it at one of the big American online bookstores,
like Amazon.com, Barnes &AMP; Noble or Borders and end up buying it
from one of these stores.
</P>
<P>
   But is the price they charge really the lowest possible? What
about delivery deadlines? How do you know there isn't another
lesser-known store somewhere on the Web that can ship it cheaper
and faster?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the shopbots, or shopping robots, software agents that
automate traditional Web surfing and search the Internet for the
best prices or shortest delivery times. Shopbots have long been
regarded as a technology with the potential to revolutionize
consumer retailing on the Internet by making comparative shopping
easy and fast.
</P>
<P>
   They may ``help to overcome the barriers that keep consumers
from using the Web,'' said Heather Stark, a principal with Ovum, a
British consulting company. ``They can make the Web faster and more
reliable, and make online shopping a convenient experience,'' she
added in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and her team estimated in a study that total revenue
earned from agent-related sales on the Web will hit $1.6 billion by
2001, up from $19 million in 1996 and $159 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far shopping robots have been fairly primitive. The
category's ancestor, Andersen Consulting's Bargain Finder, searches
10 online stores for the price of a compact disk and displays the
results on a single page. Since its launch two years ago, however,
Bargain Finder has not been developed any further.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, other services like Yahoo's Shopguide, Snap's
Deal Finder or Viaweb's Shopfind have hit the Web. They cover a
broad spectrum of products, from sporting goods and flowers to
computers and peripherals, but they work much like a standard
search engine and don't provide the buyer with a good comparison of
the retailers' offerings beyond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Two young Germans have now gone a step further toward a
``smarter'' shopping agent.
</P>
<P>
   While studying economics at the University of Heidelberg, over
the last year Christopher Muenchoff, 22, and Christoph Janz, 21,
have been developing Acses, the most interesting example to date of
the way shopbots may evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Acses can search for a book by title, author, keywords
or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike all the other systems, Acses does not submit queries
directly to the bookseller's Web sites. It digs first into
Muenchoff and Janz's own database, and comes up with all the
matches.
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Into Thin Air,'' for example, would bring up
references to books from seven different authors with the same
title. Users can then select Jon Krakauer's best-selling account of
the tragedy that occurred on Mount Everest two years ago, in the
format they prefer (hardcover, paperback, audio).
</P>
<P>
   This allows the system to identify the unique ISBN number
attached to the exact book the user is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The query is then sent to the online bookstores based on this
number, but not before an additional layer of information is added:
users are asked about their geographic location and how they would
like the prices displayed (half a dozen currencies are available at
the moment).
</P>
<P>
   Then the Acses robot checks 25 American, German, British and
Australian online bookstores -- new ones are constantly added --
and returns the matches ranked by price. Prices include shipping
and handling charges calculated according to the location of the
customer, and delivery time is displayed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on a link takes the customer directly to the store,
where she can actually buy the book.
</P>
<P>
   Handling and delivery information are unavailable from Acses's
competitors, yet both are essential to allow the comparative
shopper to weigh shipping time against price and thus find the
buying scheme that best suits her needs.
</P>
<P>
   To take another example, Arie De Geus's management book ``The
Living Company'' was available from over a dozen different
bookstores. At $22.83 Books.com clearly had the best price, but
shipping would take 6 to 12 weeks, while Barnes &AMP; Noble, when using
a parcel service, would guarantee delivery in 3 to 5 days --
charging $53.41.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the list, however, I found two other stores that best
matched my preference for both a reasonable all-inclusive price and
a quick delivery. Kingbooks of the United States promises shipping
in 3 to 7 days and would charge $29.95, while for an extra dollar
Bookpages of Britain (recently acquired by Amazon) would have the
package delivered at my door in 4 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, lesser-known stores are cheaper,'' Janz said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   To make the service even more effective, Muenchoff and Janz have
introduced a couple of enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid wasting time waiting for one slow Web site to answer
the queries, users can define a maximum access time, say 18
seconds, after which the search is timed out and the slow store is
excluded from the displayed list -- which, in return, may encourage
online booksellers to install powerful servers and high-speed
connections.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody wants to buy 10 books, it is possible to launch an
parallel Acses search for the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   Janz concedes that his and Muenchoff's system is far from
perfect, and that shopbots in general still suffer from a high
level of customer wariness, especially when it comes to reliability
and privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, exporting the model to goods other than books may be
difficult. ``Technically, books are easy targets for our software
robot because of the standardized ISBN number,'' he explained.
``Since the same product is available from all retailers, price and
shipping time are the only variables on which a customer makes a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The system may be used for other commodity items like CDs or
diskettes -- and indeed, as more online buyers start to use
shopbots, retailers in these markets may soon feel downward price
pressure. But in other sectors, consumers may still want to see and
touch the products they want to buy, and take into consideration
other factors like service after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, even Acses is still a pale imitation of true
personal agent technology in development in labs around the world,
which, Stark said, could even take into consideration ``situations
where your software agent meets my agent and they negotiate for
prices and conditions.''

   Ahh, Disneyland. Mickey Mouse, Space Mountain, the very latest
in ultrasound equipment...
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Ultrasound equipment?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The health-and-fitness world of the future (along
with the worlds of the home, the workplace, transportation and
entertainment), is now on display in Tomorrowland's new
``Innoventions'' exhibit. The exhibit combines Disney's
storytelling abilities with the expertise of companies like Kaiser
Permanente to demonstrate the hottest developments in technology.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking hands-on fun here, for grownups and kids. Kids
ages five and up will get the most out of the ``Focus on Health''
exhibit, says Disneyland spokesperson John McClintock. But even
younger kids will enjoy the lights, sounds, and action o and will
love running through the interactive heart and hearing the steady
``thump, thump, thump'' sound. (And after viewing the Kaiser
exhibit, parents of preschoolers and busy toddlers will want to
stop by Honeywell's ``Home'' exhibit, where young children can
crawl through a designed-for-kids heating system that includes a
maze of ductwork.)
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Focus on Health'' exhibit, you'll learn, at interactive
kiosks, about medical advances such as artificial skin, minimally
invasive surgery, ultrasound, and how plants such as bananas can be
used to deliver the immunizations of the future. (Now why didn't
they have that when my son needed his baby shots?)
</P>
<P>
   ``'Innoventions' breaks new ground on many levels,'' says Terry
Dobson, Walt Disney Imagineering senior concept designer for the
exhibits. ``Guests have traditionally visited Disneyland to ride
the rides and see the shows. Now they'll be able to play
interactive games together as well.''
</P>
<P>
   When you enter ``Innoventions,'' you'll board a ``loading pod''
on the slowly rotating lower level. You'll be greeted by your
enthusiastic audio-animatronic host, ``Tom Morrow'' (with actor
Nathan Lane o a perfect choice o providing the voice). You'll then
step through a portal to enter the turning building, where more
than 120 interactive games, displays and activities await.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``Focus on Health'' exhibit, you'll visit hands-on
ultrasound and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) kiosks, see the
latest devices for laparoscopic surgery, and compare the workings
of the heart and lungs as they are influenced by both healthy and
unhealthy lifestyles. And be sure to check out the ``Dr. Elixer''
live show, which involves guests in a high-energy, truly funny show
about health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibits are very theatrical,'' says Richard Hutton,
senior vice president, creative development, for Walt Disney
Imagineering. And (yippee!) you won't have to tell the kids ``don't
touch,'' he adds. ``Today, people learn best in an interactive
environment. You remember something if you can touch it, feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hutton says, ``You can play with an MRI machine
that scans the human body, slice by slice.'' Another highlight is
the 10-foot-high interactive human heart, he adds, noting that when
you put your hand on the heart, you can hear your own heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in healthcare and wellness aren't strictly limited to
the ``Focus on Health'' exhibit. If you have allergies or asthma,
for example, be sure to check out Honeywell's ``Home'' exhibit,
which showcases an innovative indoor-air-quality system.
</P>
<P>
   As time and medical technology march on, won't ``Innoventions''
look a little, ah, dated? Not to worry, says Hutton. ``Innoventions
will be refurbished every year, and totally redone every three
years. It will be very dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   What's my favorite part of ``Innoventions''? You can stay as
long as you like, playing games and interacting with some truly
cool exhibits. Unlike many Disneyland attractions, which feature
lines followed by a two-minute ride (Don't get me wrong o I love
Space Mountain), ``Innoventions'' lasts as long as you want it to.
</P>
<P>
   When you leave ``Innoventions,'' you'll probably come away with
some great ideas for improving your family's health and fitness.
For tips on staying healthy while you're at Disneyland, check out
the sidebar.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a little cotton candy o followed by a ride on
Space Mountain, of course o can't hurt.

   The negotiations rivaled those between President Clinton and
Saddam Hussein. Trying to cajole my daughter into leaving a
friend's house was excruciatingly delicate, requiring all the
fortitude of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah hated goodbyes, and from around age 2 until 6,
leave-takings were difficult. Despite my telling her when I planned
to pick her up and promises of fun stuff for her at home, she'd
either hide or announce that she ``needed'' to do 103 things first.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, she'd fling herself onto some furniture and
lose all movement in her arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   I'd apologize and try to cover my embarrassment with a few bon
mots. Still, after a day of work, I'd inevitably lose my temper,
and threaten punishments that I rarely enforced. After what seemed
like an eternity, Sarah would surrender.
</P>
<P>
   My second child, Michael had difficult moments, but I was
delighted that leave-taking wasn't one of them. Experts agree that
children vary widely in ability to cope with transitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems like an inconsequential step for an adult can loom
quite large in the eyes and mind of a child,'' notes Allan Gonsher,
president of Kids Inc., a counseling center in Omaha, Neb.
``Interestingly, parents often prepare for the major changes in a
child's life - a switch in schools, a move to a new town, the birth
of a sibling, the day Mom goes back to work - but overlook the
hundreds of small moments in the day that can be just as tough for
a child to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is easier for some children than for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although almost all kids have trouble with transitions from
time to time, temperament plays a major role,'' says Harold S.
Koplewicz, M.D., director of New York University's Child Study
Center in New York. ``Youngsters are born with either an ability or
an inability to adjust to change in their external as well as
internal environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some possess a basically sunny disposition, which allows them
to shift gears and go with the flow,'' he says. ``Others are by
nature more sensitive, cautious, and rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is stressful for youngsters because they thrive on
predictability,'' adds Debbie Webb Blackburn, Ph.D., director of
clinical training at the Virginia Treament Center for Children in
Richmond, Va. Even positive change, like leaving home for a party
or the beach, can trigger anxiety in kids.
</P>
<P>
   Although young children have short attention spans, they often
focus on an activity singlemindedly. It's not easy to break that
concentration. To be told by a parent or teacher that they must is
even more stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child wants to feel that she has some control over her
life,'' notes Harry Z. Coren, M.D., a San Francisco-based child and
adolescent psychiatrist. ``Consider how much less burdened you feel
when you make your own decision to do something, as opposed to when
your boss or your spouse says that you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   While my daughter was temperamentally change-challenged, there
was much I could have done to help her. Kids need parents to guide
them through changes of emotion and environment.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get a child to move faster can backfire and trigger a
struggle because dawdling is a child's way of saying she's in
charge. As I learned late, there are effective ways to encourage
kids to handle transitions.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a change-resistant youngster, many assume our child
is dragging his heels to get back at us, and we expect an F in
Parenting 101.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Claire Lerner, the mother of 7-year-old Sam and
2-year-old Jessica, assumed. Though now a child development
specialist with Zero to Three, the National Center for Infants,
Toddlers and their Families in Washington, D.C., Lerner was stumped
when she noticed Sam fussed at even minor transitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While his pre-school classmates seemed to glide with relative
ease from activity to leave-taking, Sam became gridlocked when it
was time to say goodbye,'' Lerner recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise stepping back and asking, ``What is my child
struggling with here? Is he scared? Tired? Worried?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to understand what led up to the behavior before you
can figure out how to handle it,'' explains Blackburn. If you don't
give yourself distance, you may do things that are ineffective in
getting what you want - and what your child needs. Yelling and
ultimatums don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your child that you know change is hard, and that her
feelings are legitimate. ``The emotions welling up inside a child
can be confusing and overwhelming,'' says Koplewicz. ``Parents have
to interpret what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sam Lerner had a tough time leaving school or a friend's
house, his mother found it helped to put her arms around him and
say softly, ``I know that it's very hard to put all the toys away
and say goodbye, so why don't we do it together?'' His teachers
started to handle things the same way; things improved.
</P>
<P>
   Until age of 6 or 7, kids have little concept of time. ``Telling
a child of 3 or 4 that you're leaving in five minutes means nothing
to her,'' notes Coren. Although you should still give these
messages, add visual cues or link times to an event in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Anzelmo Glasner, a mother of three in Potomac, Md., sets a
kitchen timer so her kids can see the arrow moving. ``I think it
gives them a sense of time passing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some children have difficulty with transitions because they
think that all their fun is being removed - and that they'll never
have a good time again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have enough life experience to know that though one
good thing is ending, something else will take its place,'' notes
Coren. So use a positive spin: ``I'm sad, too, that we have to
leave the museum, but when we get home we can read the book we
bought that tells all about what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider how flexible you can be and what choices might be
appropriate. You might say, ``It's time to get ready to go, but we
can still read one more story or draw one more picture. Which would
you like to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling? Try behavior modification, suggests Koplewicz.
You can say, ``This seems to be hard for you. Here's the deal: Each
time you leave a play date without a fuss, you'll get a star. If
you earn three stars, you can pick a small prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes, the best-laid plans don't work. If your
child loses control, says Coren, you might say, ``We can do this
the easy way or the hard way, but we must go.''
</P>
<P>
   When you help children build skills to deal with change, you are
teaching them how to handle whatever curveballs life brings.
</P>
<P>
   I confess my daughter rarely left anyplace without at least a
small struggle until, well, maybe fourth grade. Still, I can say
that my husband and I found that understanding why she was behaving
this way helped us cope better and apologize less.

<P>
   As commercial venues on the Internet continue to multiply, it
has become increasingly difficult to find the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a book, for example, chances are that
you'll search for it at one of the big American online bookstores,
like Amazon.com, Barnes &AMP; Noble or Borders and end up buying it
from one of these stores.
</P>
<P>
   But is the price they charge really the lowest possible? What
about delivery deadlines? How do you know there isn't another
lesser-known store somewhere on the Web that can ship it cheaper
and faster?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the shopbots, or shopping robots, software agents that
automate traditional Web surfing and search the Internet for the
best prices or shortest delivery times. Shopbots have long been
regarded as a technology with the potential to revolutionize
consumer retailing on the Internet by making comparative shopping
easy and fast.
</P>
<P>
   They may ``help to overcome the barriers that keep consumers
from using the Web,'' said Heather Stark, a principal with Ovum, a
British consulting company. ``They can make the Web faster and more
reliable, and make online shopping a convenient experience,'' she
added in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Stark and her team estimated in a study that total revenue
earned from agent-related sales on the Web will hit $1.6 billion by
2001, up from $19 million in 1996 and $159 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far shopping robots have been fairly primitive. The
category's ancestor, Andersen Consulting's Bargain Finder, searches
10 online stores for the price of a compact disk and displays the
results on a single page. Since its launch two years ago, however,
Bargain Finder has not been developed any further.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, other services like Yahoo's Shopguide, Snap's
Deal Finder or Viaweb's Shopfind have hit the Web. They cover a
broad spectrum of products, from sporting goods and flowers to
computers and peripherals, but they work much like a standard
search engine and don't provide the buyer with a good comparison of
the retailers' offerings beyond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Two young Germans have now gone a step further toward a
``smarter'' shopping agent.
</P>
<P>
   While studying economics at the University of Heidelberg, over
the last year Christopher Muenchoff, 22, and Christoph Janz, 21,
have been developing Acses, the most interesting example to date of
the way shopbots may evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Acses can search for a book by title, author, keywords
or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike all the other systems, Acses does not submit queries
directly to the bookseller's Web sites. It digs first into
Muenchoff and Janz's own database, and comes up with all the
matches.
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Into Thin Air,'' for example, would bring up
references to books from seven different authors with the same
title. Users can then select Jon Krakauer's best-selling account of
the tragedy that occurred on Mount Everest two years ago, in the
format they prefer (hardcover, paperback, audio).
</P>
<P>
   This allows the system to identify the unique ISBN number
attached to the exact book the user is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The query is then sent to the online bookstores based on this
number, but not before an additional layer of information is added:
users are asked about their geographic location and how they would
like the prices displayed (half a dozen currencies are available at
the moment).
</P>
<P>
   Then the Acses robot checks 25 American, German, British and
Australian online bookstores -- new ones are constantly added --
and returns the matches ranked by price. Prices include shipping
and handling charges calculated according to the location of the
customer, and delivery time is displayed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on a link takes the customer directly to the store,
where she can actually buy the book.
</P>
<P>
   Handling and delivery information are unavailable from Acses's
competitors, yet both are essential to allow the comparative
shopper to weigh shipping time against price and thus find the
buying scheme that best suits her needs.
</P>
<P>
   To take another example, Arie De Geus's management book ``The
Living Company'' was available from over a dozen different
bookstores. At $22.83 Books.com clearly had the best price, but
shipping would take 6 to 12 weeks, while Barnes &AMP; Noble, when using
a parcel service, would guarantee delivery in 3 to 5 days --
charging $53.41.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the list, however, I found two other stores that best
matched my preference for both a reasonable all-inclusive price and
a quick delivery. Kingbooks of the United States promises shipping
in 3 to 7 days and would charge $29.95, while for an extra dollar
Bookpages of Britain (recently acquired by Amazon) would have the
package delivered at my door in 4 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, lesser-known stores are cheaper,'' Janz said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   To make the service even more effective, Muenchoff and Janz have
introduced a couple of enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid wasting time waiting for one slow Web site to answer
the queries, users can define a maximum access time, say 18
seconds, after which the search is timed out and the slow store is
excluded from the displayed list -- which, in return, may encourage
online booksellers to install powerful servers and high-speed
connections.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody wants to buy 10 books, it is possible to launch an
parallel Acses search for the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   Janz concedes that his and Muenchoff's system is far from
perfect, and that shopbots in general still suffer from a high
level of customer wariness, especially when it comes to reliability
and privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, exporting the model to goods other than books may be
difficult. ``Technically, books are easy targets for our software
robot because of the standardized ISBN number,'' he explained.
``Since the same product is available from all retailers, price and
shipping time are the only variables on which a customer makes a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The system may be used for other commodity items like CDs or
diskettes -- and indeed, as more online buyers start to use
shopbots, retailers in these markets may soon feel downward price
pressure. But in other sectors, consumers may still want to see and
touch the products they want to buy, and take into consideration
other factors like service after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, even Acses is still a pale imitation of true
personal agent technology in development in labs around the world,
which, Stark said, could even take into consideration ``situations
where your software agent meets my agent and they negotiate for
prices and conditions.''

WANTED: TV NEWS GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Rob Puglisi, the news director of Albany-area
station WTEN-TV, picked out a pile of applicant tapes at random
from his office and started ticking off the names.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth. Jennifer. Karen. Allison. Doug. Erica. Cathy.
Roselle. Mary Ann. Kelly. Gail. Kristen. Glenn. Holly. Robert.
Melanie. Luke. Barry. Tim.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen names, six men. And you want to know the unusual thing
about that list?
</P>
<P>
   That there were that many men.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the guys? News directors at television stations here
and across the country are growing increasingly concerned that
males, particularly qualified and experienced male anchors, are not
just hard to find, but simply don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   WNYT News Director Paul Conti said out of the 200-plus tapes he
received for an open anchor spot, women applicants outdistanced men
20 to 1. WRGB reported the same breakdown. None of the Albany-area
stations seeking candidates stated any gender preference in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the tapes which I received, say 80 tapes, I'd say
at most 15 were from men,'' Puglisi said. ``I don't know why more
men aren't attracted to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Fitzpatrick does. The San Francisco-based headhunter is
possibly the foremost expert on television news talent. Need a
certain anchor, a certain age, heck, a certain hair color? He'll
find one for you.
</P>
<P>
   But guys? Well, that is a hard one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have not gotten into the business for the last 10 to
12 years,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``What is happening in Albany is
happening in every television market in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick offers some historical perspective: Television news,
like so many bastions, was an all-white, all-male industry at its
inception, drawing on-air people from radio and newspapers. With
social changes exploding in the 1960s and 1970s, the Federal
Communications Commission came out with guidelines (which are now
being challenged) mandating the hiring of more women and
minorities, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In the game of catch-up, men, particularly white men, were
frozen out. A generation or two was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden it was a total dead end for men,''
Fitzpatrick said. ``Men were finding it very difficult to be hired
by stations.''
</P>
<P>
   So men turned away from the business in the 1980s. This means
graduates from that era would today be 34 to 38 years old, the
ideal range for an anchor to be brought into a market and developed
over time. But instead they are computer programmers or accountants
or lawyers or whatever, leaving local television stations
scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Papper, a professor of telecommunications at Ball State
University in Munice, Ind., said women are still a minority in
television but make up the majority of reporters, producers and
students. Papper said the shortage of males is made more critical
by the proliferation of news outlets like Fox affiliates and cable
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is an enormous strain on the system,'' Papper
said. ``We have stations scrambling over kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick lectures at colleges across the country, and said he
knows of only one broadcast journalism program where males
outnumber females in pursuing on-air jobs: Syracuse University in
New York. But Syracuse has more males only because there are still
guys out there who want the success of alumni Bob Costas, Marv
Albert and others in sportscasting.
</P>
<P>
   Take away those who want to go into sports and the student ranks
there are also predominantly female.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Smith, a former WTEN general manager, teaches at Syracuse.
He said low starting wages and a lack of opportunity caused men to
turn away from television news, a situation that will continue to
get worse as established newsmen step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen is the male anchors are getting older
and starting to retire,'' Smith said. ``It is very difficult to get
a male anchor. The men have been discouraged because there haven't
been that many jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said something interesting: he has a theory that women may
be ``better communicators.'' But if this trend continues, they may
be the only ones talking.

WHITHER THE YOUNG BILL CLINTON? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ On May 28, 1964, Bill Clinton gave the benediction
at his graduation from Hot Springs High School in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In what his biographer, David Maraniss, calls his first
political speech to a sizable audience, the young Clinton said,
``Now we must prepare to live only by the guide of our own faith
and character. We pray to keep a high sense of values while
wandering through the complex maze which is our society. Direct us
to know and care what is right and wrong, so that we will be
victorious in this life and rewarded in the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Today those words are far removed in time and practice from the
17-year-old who became president of the United States. The complex
maze that is Clinton's character has guided him to disgrace. There
on national television was the most powerful man in the world
confessing that he'd had a sexual liaison with a White House intern
and lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   If the essence of Kenneth Starr's case against Clinton is
consensual, albeit ``inappropriate'' sex, between two adults, we
didn't need to know this. No more than we need to know the details
of anyone else's sexual life that doesn't affect us.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Starr's creepy obsession with the president's
hyperactive libido, it is Clinton's recklessness that has relegated
him to a national embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as Hillary Rodham Clinton stated, there has been a
right-wing conspiracy to get Clinton. How else do you explain Jerry
Falwell and Larry Nichols peddling videos that all but link the
president with every murder in Arkansas throughout the past decade?
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the right-wingers who made the president drop his
pants for Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the president's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, there are
no innocents in this tiresome and nauseating peep show. But no one
is more to blame than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was his choice to engage in behavior he now concedes as
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton who looked the nation in the eye and lied.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton who lied to close friends and advisers and sent
them out like lemmings to foolishly declare his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Clinton who is responsible for those same friends and
advisers accruing tens of thousands of dollars worth of legal
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was Clinton who, if he'd had the courage, could have
made his confession in January, won the nation's forgiveness
without dragging it through seven months of sordid nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is a good president who could have been a great
president. None of the other men who has occupied the Oval Office
in this century was as intellectually and politically gifted as he.
But he has allowed his Achilles' heel of deceit to slay his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1964 benediction, the young Clinton asked the Lord to
``leave within us the youthful idealism and moralism which have
made our people strong. Sicken us at the sight of apathy, ignorance
and rejection so that our generation will remove complacency,
poverty and prejudice from the hearts of free men.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the 17-year-old Bill Clinton sounds much better than
the 52-year-old president.

FAREWELL, MR. PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB RICHTER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Out of all the millions of good men and women in
this country, how did we get Bill Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   He burst in like a young missionary full of ideas, but now he's
the house guest who stayed too long _ who's freeloading, lounging
in his underwear and eying our wives and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He's been reduced to a bull's eye for abuse here an abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been better. Clinton is an appealing genius. He
has the aw-shucks goodness of a Sheriff Andy Taylor, not the
pedantic, wise meanness of, say, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   He is comfortable in jeans or a tux. He has a savvy that appeals
to Wall Street, to old and new money, as well as to Elvis fans and
jocks and people of arts and letters.
</P>
<P>
   He can talk to people of all ages and backgrounds, and this
nation has more rings of life than a redwood tree.
</P>
<P>
   He can be anyman, anywhere, anytime. While some call that
disingenuous, those are qualities that made many of us feel
comfortable with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he has demonstrated that he is genuinely interested
in lifting all the boats in this nation's sea. And he's made good
on his promise to have an administration that mirrors the makeup of
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Clinton was lucky. Just think of those who
helped him get where he got:
</P>
<P>
   _ Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader who continued to belch
brimstone after George Bush thought he'd put him away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Sen. Bob Dole, whose presidential campaign style was
that of an angry neighbor swearing at the kids who punted their
football into his yard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voters who stayed home in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ And, lately, the Republican leadership in Congress who make
the aforementioned Saddam look like a brilliant tactician.
</P>
<P>
   But after special prosecutor Kenneth Starr sends Congress his
report, it will be up to those clueless Republicans to decide what
to do with the adulterous, dissembling president.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tempting to dawdle, to let Clinton and every Democrat
running for office this fall twist in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   But, to cut to the chase, here are the options: (1) Congress
will either impeach him, (2) not impeach or (3) Clinton will
resign. Nos. 1 and 3 are bad; No. 2 may be worse.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr's report contains nothing more damning that the tawdry
coupling between the president and a young intern, we don't see
Clinton being impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the Republicans can have some fun with this. But
they run the risk of putting politics over the national good.
</P>
<P>
   I expect that as the process most certainly drags on, Democratic
Party leaders will grow restless and pressure Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Clinton is no different than other talented
individuals who are told every day how wonderful they are until
they think they're bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Clinton isn't. He looked quite mortal in his pathetic
mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will do the American people a favor and prove that he
cares more about us than himself if he resigns.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Shirley Fong-Torres, founder and owner of Wok Wiz Walking Tours
in San Francisco's Chinatown, guides a group of mature travelers
across narrow, bustling Grant Avenue and past Pagoda Gate with its
two stone lions.
 &HT;    ``Notice the curved roof line on many of the buildings,'' she
points out. ``The Chinese are very superstitious. They believe that
evil spirits travel in a straight line. By curving the roofs, evil
spirits stay away.''
 &HT;    Accompanying Fong-Torres' group is our friend, Millie Alexander,
who tells us about the continuing growth of ethnic communities in
the San Francisco area.
 &HT;    Chinatown is a favorite attraction for many first-time visitors
to San Francisco. While they expect to see cable cars, the Golden
Gate Bridge and many different types of boats on the water, ``what
comes as a surprise are the large number of newly arrived
immigrants now living in the City by the Bay,'' Alexander says.
 &HT;    The picturesque 24-block community of Chinatown continues to
provide housing and social interaction for thousands of new Chinese
and Asian immigrants, she says. They love it because it reminds
them so much of home. They love the sound of mah jong tiles
clicking against one another in boisterous games. They love the
pungent smell of healing herbs prescribed by white-coated herb
doctors. And they love the sight of roasted ducks hanging in
restaurant windows, inviting them inside for a delicious meal.
 &HT;    The entire city is a kaleidoscope of ethnic diversity.
 &HT;    The Hispanic culture marks the Mission District, with salsa
music blaring from inside dance clubs. Taquerias serve handmade
tortillas, and colorful murals adorn walls, fences and garages.
 &HT;    On the other side of the hills not far from the ocean is Geary
Street, where the golden onion domes of the Holy Trinity Russian
Orthodox Cathedral bring a touch of home to Russian emigres.
 &HT;    Although they're eager to begin a new life in America, they
still long for familiar foods such as piroshkis and pelmeni. Many
bakeries, delicatessens and restaurants specialize in Russian food
and advertise with signs printed in both English and Cyrillic
letters.
 &HT;    ``We shouldn't be a melting pot in America but a salad bowl,''
says Dorothy Quock, a guide with Wok Wiz Walking Tours. ``Each
culture should keep its ethnic identity, yet still be part of the
mix.''
 &HT;    ``San Francisco has had a long history of accepting (sometimes
reluctantly) different nationalities into its salad bowl,'' says
Alexander, who has lived in the Bay Area for many years. She
explains that since the days of the 1849 Gold Rush, the city has
had mass migrations of Italian fishermen, Chinese railroad workers,
Mexican laborers and, most recently, Vietnamese boat people, all
seeking happiness in the Golden State.
 TOURING THE CITY  
 &HT;    For the visitor, this multi-ethnic flavor presents an
extraordinary sensory experience in sights, sounds and tastes. And
Alexander adds that it's all reachable by buses, streetcars and
cable cars at discounted prices for mature travelers.
 &HT;    Personal guides go to famous neighborhoods such as Pacific
Heights and Telegraph Hill, Castro Street and the Haight Ashbury.
 &HT;    ``Because of its cultural diversity, San Francisco has a flavor
that does not exist in other cities,'' says Thomas Weed, who runs
Tours for One, a personalized guide service, (415) 387-3448. ``I
learn what interests the visitors, and then we go exploring in
those neighborhoods.''
 &HT;    To fully enjoy San Francisco, however, the mature traveler
should bear in mind several facts, says Alexander:
 &HT;    The city is located on the tip of a peninsula with the Pacific
Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other side. This
means that micro-climates abound, especially during the summer
months. While the sky can be sunny and blue at Pier 39, it may be
gray and foggy at the Cliff House. Consequently, sweaters and
jackets _ even lightweight coats _ are appropriate for the city's
mercurial weather.
 &HT;    San Francisco is also located on 43 hills with Lombard Street
being the steepest and most famous for its eight curves. Cars full
of uneasy passengers carefully navigate these S-turns while more
ambitious pedestrians climb up and down Lombard Street on the
sidewalk stairs.
 &HT;    Not all the city's famous attractions are on hills. Fisherman's
Wharf, Golden Gate Park, Union Square and Ocean Beach are on level
ground that requires comfortable walking shoes. Attractions located
on hilltops are accessible via cable cars, taxi cabs and tour
buses.
 &HT;    For touring other city sights, Muni, the public transit system,
charges visitors ages 65 and older a 35-cent fare instead of $1 to
travel around the city all day.
 SAN FRANCISCO RESOURCES  
 &HT;    Because San Francisco is so popular with visitors, advance hotel
reservations are a must, Alexander warns, adding that in the first
three quarters of 1997, San Francisco hosted 11.4 million visitors.
 &HT;    To help with accommodations, the San Francisco Convention and
Visitors Bureau has a city-wide hotel-reservations service. By
calling toll-free (888) 782-9673, mature travelers can make
reservations at more than 70 hotels. Be sure to inquire about their
senior discounts.
 &HT;    In addition, the visitors bureau has a new Web site,
www.sfvisitor.org, to help visitors plan their trips. The
Information available includes travel tips, frequently asked
questions (FAQs), maps and links to other San Francisco resources
on the Web.
 &HT;    One useful guidebook published by Good Life Publications is
``Good Life San Francisco,'' and purchasers ages 50 and older get
30 percent off.
 &HT;    Book tours like Wok Wiz Walking Tours through your hotel.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Shirley Fong-Torres, founder and owner of Wok Wiz Walking Tours
in San Francisco's Chinatown, guides a group of mature travelers
across narrow, bustling Grant Avenue and past Pagoda Gate with its
two stone lions.
 &HT;    ``Notice the curved roof line on many of the buildings,'' she
points out. ``The Chinese are very superstitious. They believe that
evil spirits travel in a straight line. By curving the roofs, evil
spirits stay away.''
 &HT;    Accompanying Fong-Torres' group is our friend, Millie Alexander,
who tells us about the continuing growth of ethnic communities in
the San Francisco area.
 &HT;    Chinatown is a favorite attraction for many first-time visitors
to San Francisco. While they expect to see cable cars, the Golden
Gate Bridge and many different types of boats on the water, ``what
comes as a surprise are the large number of newly arrived
immigrants now living in the City by the Bay,'' Alexander says.
 &HT;    The picturesque 24-block community of Chinatown continues to
provide housing and social interaction for thousands of new Chinese
and Asian immigrants, she says. They love it because it reminds
them so much of home. They love the sound of mah jong tiles
clicking against one another in boisterous games. They love the
pungent smell of healing herbs prescribed by white-coated herb
doctors. And they love the sight of roasted ducks hanging in
restaurant windows, inviting them inside for a delicious meal.
 &HT;    The entire city is a kaleidoscope of ethnic diversity.
 &HT;    The Hispanic culture marks the Mission District, with salsa
music blaring from inside dance clubs. Taquerias serve handmade
tortillas, and colorful murals adorn walls, fences and garages.
 &HT;    On the other side of the hills not far from the ocean is Geary
Street, where the golden onion domes of the Holy Trinity Russian
Orthodox Cathedral bring a touch of home to Russian emigres.
 &HT;    Although they're eager to begin a new life in America, they
still long for familiar foods such as piroshkis and pelmeni. Many
bakeries, delicatessens and restaurants specialize in Russian food
and advertise with signs printed in both English and Cyrillic
letters.
 &HT;    ``We shouldn't be a melting pot in America but a salad bowl,''
says Dorothy Quock, a guide with Wok Wiz Walking Tours. ``Each
culture should keep its ethnic identity, yet still be part of the
mix.''
 &HT;    ``San Francisco has had a long history of accepting (sometimes
reluctantly) different nationalities into its salad bowl,'' says
Alexander, who has lived in the Bay Area for many years. She
explains that since the days of the 1849 Gold Rush, the city has
had mass migrations of Italian fishermen, Chinese railroad workers,
Mexican laborers and, most recently, Vietnamese boat people, all
seeking happiness in the Golden State.
 TOURING THE CITY  
 &HT;    For the visitor, this multi-ethnic flavor presents an
extraordinary sensory experience in sights, sounds and tastes. And
Alexander adds that it's all reachable by buses, streetcars and
cable cars at discounted prices for mature travelers.
 &HT;    Personal guides go to famous neighborhoods such as Pacific
Heights and Telegraph Hill, Castro Street and the Haight Ashbury.
 &HT;    ``Because of its cultural diversity, San Francisco has a flavor
that does not exist in other cities,'' says Thomas Weed, who runs
Tours for One, a personalized guide service, (415) 387-3448. ``I
learn what interests the visitors, and then we go exploring in
those neighborhoods.''
 &HT;    To fully enjoy San Francisco, however, the mature traveler
should bear in mind several facts, says Alexander:
 &HT;    The city is located on the tip of a peninsula with the Pacific
Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other side. This
means that micro-climates abound, especially during the summer
months. While the sky can be sunny and blue at Pier 39, it may be
gray and foggy at the Cliff House. Consequently, sweaters and
jackets _ even lightweight coats _ are appropriate for the city's
mercurial weather.
 &HT;    San Francisco is also located on 43 hills with Lombard Street
being the steepest and most famous for its eight curves. Cars full
of uneasy passengers carefully navigate these S-turns while more
ambitious pedestrians climb up and down Lombard Street on the
sidewalk stairs.
 &HT;    Not all the city's famous attractions are on hills. Fisherman's
Wharf, Golden Gate Park, Union Square and Ocean Beach are on level
ground that requires comfortable walking shoes. Attractions located
on hilltops are accessible via cable cars, taxi cabs and tour
buses.
 &HT;    For touring other city sights, Muni, the public transit system,
charges visitors ages 65 and older a 35-cent fare instead of $1 to
travel around the city all day.
 SAN FRANCISCO RESOURCES  
 &HT;    Because San Francisco is so popular with visitors, advance hotel
reservations are a must, Alexander warns, adding that in the first
three quarters of 1997, San Francisco hosted 11.4 million visitors.
 &HT;    To help with accommodations, the San Francisco Convention and
Visitors Bureau has a city-wide hotel-reservations service. By
calling toll-free (888) 782-9673, mature travelers can make
reservations at more than 70 hotels. Be sure to inquire about their
senior discounts.
 &HT;    In addition, the visitors bureau has a new Web site,
www.sfvisitor.org, to help visitors plan their trips. The
Information available includes travel tips, frequently asked
questions (FAQs), maps and links to other San Francisco resources
on the Web.
 &HT;    One useful guidebook published by Good Life Publications is
``Good Life San Francisco,'' and purchasers ages 50 and older get
30 percent off.
 &HT;    Book tours like Wok Wiz Walking Tours through your hotel.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Dozens of new travel guidebooks have recently arrived in
bookstores and on Internet bookstore sites. Here's a selection of
the best.
 &HT;    ``Time Out Dublin,'' edited by Peter Fiennes (Penguin, 1998,
$14.95) is Time Out's first guide to the booming Irish capital.
Hip, street-smart and savvy, it runs the gamut from gay bars to
hurling matches.
 &HT;    Accommodations, from bed &AMP; breakfasts to The Clarence, the chic
hotel owned by the rock band U2, are also well-covered.
 &HT;    There are detailed descriptions of the best pubs, such as
Mulligan's, which offers ``a legendary pint of Guinness _ perhaps
the most celebrated and discussed in the entire town.'' And there
are suggestions for excursions out of Dublin, such as to Thor
Ballylee, home of the poet W.B. Yeats. All told, it's the only
guide that the Dublin-bound should need.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet has published a slew of new guides of late. Among
them are ``The Deep South: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama'' by Kap
Stann, et al (Lonely Planet, 1998; $19.95), which offers close to
600 pages on plantation mansions, blues clubs and gumbo
restaurants.
 &HT;    Their ``London,'' by Pat Yale (Lonely Planet, 1998; $14.95), is
a much-needed guide to one of the most expensive cities in Europe
and a good source for restaurants and hotels that are easy on the
wallet.
 &HT;    But the best of the lot is ``Chicago,'' by Ryan van Berkmoes
(Lonely Planet, 1998; $15.95), a detailed labor of love.
 &HT;    The author knows his city very well. He's informed, informative
and opinionated. He offers a wry 90-minute tour of the Art
Institute of Chicago.
 &HT;    After watching the Cubs lose, he suggests a stop at Bernie's
Tavern, which ``doesn't jack up its prices on game days to fleece
unsuspecting fans, as the many upscale joints in the neighborhood
do.'' And he advises walking around Chicago as the best way to see
it ``except when huge chunks of windblown sleet are smacking you in
the face.''
 &HT;    Like the smart aleck on the next barstool, van Bermoes is
cranky, funny and obviously loves the Windy City. His book is the
next best thing to a personal tour.
 &HT;    Two books have staked out one of America's most beautiful areas,
the California coast. ``The California Coast; A Traveler's
Companion,'' by Donald B. Neuwirth and John J. Osborn (Countryman
Press, 1998; $17.95) is readable and easy to use.
 &HT;    Besides noting scenic high points, hotels and restaurants, the
book offers profiles of people like Rim Fay, a retired Los Angeles
lifeguard, and Rene Avant, a coast ranger. Pack it for a family
driving tour.
 &HT;    The other guide worth perusing is ``Coastal California,'' by
John Doerper (Compass American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). With
photographs by one of America's best-known outdoors photographers,
Galen Rowell, this book is a rich look at the history and the
culture of the area. Birders, wine lovers and sightseers will be
well served by it.
 &HT;    The Compass series is one of the best around for those who crave
well-written background information. But this one also shines with
practical details about hotels and restaurants _ not to mention
tattooed La Jolla surfers, ocean kayakers and the Channel Islands.
 &HT;    With Rowell's stunning photographs and Doerper's sensitive and
intelligent prose, this is an ideal travel guide.
 &HT;    The Compass series has also produced ``Underwater Wonders of the
National Parks,'' by Daniel J. Lenihan and John D. Brooks (Compass
American Guides/Fodor's, 1998; $19.95). Spectacular photography and
a wide range of locations makes this a terrific read.
 &HT;    From Devil's Hole cave in Death Valley to St. John in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Isle Royale in Lake Superior to Biscayne National
Park in Florida, this book shows a watery side of America's
National Parks that is rarely glimpsed.
 &HT;    Moon Travel Handbooks, noted for their detail and no-nonsense
prose, has recently tackled New England. Their ``Maine Handbook,''
by Kathleen Brandes (Moon, 1998; $18.95) offers a close look at the
state that calls itself ``Vacationland.''
 &HT;    On her top 10 list of attractions, Acadia National Park ranks
first, L.L. Bean's store in Freeport ranks fourth.
 &HT;    She notes that what ``looks like a squished spider on Maine's
license plate is actually, of course, the state's favorite menu
item _ a lobster.''
 &HT;    But Maine's wilderness is what she really loves. Brandes remarks
that ``looking out over Maine from Mt. Katahdin today, as Thoreau
did in 1857, you get a view that is still a mass of green
stretching to the sea, broken by blue lakes and rivers.''
 &HT;    Also deserving a look are ``New Hampshire Handbook,'' by Steve
Lantos (Moon Travel Handbooks, 1998; $18.95) and ``Massachusetts
Handbook,'' by Jeff Perk (Moon Travel Handbooks, 1998; $18.95).
 &HT;    Finally, ``Frommer's San Francisco from $60 a Day,'' by Erika
Lenkert and Matthew R. Poole (Macmillan Travel, 1998; $14.95) is a
find for anyone who's tried to beat the high cost of visiting the
city by the Bay.
 &HT;    Cheap eats? Readers will learn about dim sum at the Hong Kong
Flower Lounge, pizza to go at Golden Boy Pizza in North Beach and
Latino specialties at Pozole in the Castro District.
 &HT;    There are loads of recommendations for cheap sleeps throughout
the city, as well as sightseeing and shopping tips that should
please anyone who's watching their budget in San Francisco.

</P>
<P>
   These days, when the sun is shining and daylight lingers into
late evening, Berliners are outside talking about their city. The
question is always the same, accompanied by a sweeping gesture
toward the crane or bulldozer inevitably positioned nearby: ``You
think it will work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor interested in urban development, contemporary
architecture or, indeed, world history, Berlin is a veritable candy
store for the mind. All over town the city's physical past is being
confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital.
</P>
<P>
   There is the newly transplanted heart at Potsdamer Platz, where
the steel-and-glass towers of Sony and Daimler Benz near
completion. The area was the commercial center of prewar Berlin _
but it was also the site of Hitler's bunker, of the wall and the
mined no man's land behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Reichstag, birthplace of the Weimar democracy in
1918, but also the setting for the infamous fire used by the Nazis
to seize power in 1933. Refashioned by Sir Norman Foster, the
British architect, the building will once again house the German
Parliament in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a less monumental scale, there is the old Jewish quarter in
the Mitte district. Due to conflicting claims, much of the area was
off limits to investors after the wall fell, resulting in a
squatters' paradise and a flourishing subculture that left its mark
in the neighborhood's trendy galleries, clubs and restaurants.

   Yet all this is just the sideshow. For in reclaiming its status
as government capital, Berlin is determined to reclaim its 1920s
role as cultural capital of Europe.

   The city boasts three state-subsidized opera houses, five
symphony orchestras and three ballet companies. Some 15,000 seats

   The best way to immerse oneself in the rhythm of Berlin is to
step into its noisy unfinished center. Emerge from the Potsdamer
Platz S-Bahn station to a sky filled with 30 cranes, lifting,
swiveling, loads dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half-hour tours through the construction sites at
Potsdamer and Leipziger Platz are given as part of the ``Showcase
Berlin'' summer program. The English-language tour (No. 9) begins
Thursday at 10:30 a.m. through Sept. 3. Tickets ($9.85) can be
bought beneath the Info Box building by the S-Bahn station.
</P>
<P>
   If Potsdamer Platz offers a glimpse at Berlin's self-styled
future, Tacheles, 54-56 Oranienburger Strasse, bears witness to the
city's disappearing past.

   Built in 1909 as part of a noble shopping passage connecting the
Friedrichstrasse to the Oranienburger Strasse, the building was
scheduled for demolition in 1990 when an idealistic group of East
and West German artists occupied the space.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn may be the last chance to visit the ruin in its
dilapidated glory. The artists expect to be evicted before the end
of the year by the new investors, who have presented plans to
integrate the space into a larger commercial complex.

<P>
   A short walk into the heart of the old Jewish quarter leads to
the Hackeschen Hofe, 40-41 Rosenthaler Strasse, eight connecting
Jugendstil buildings and courtyards that successfully combine the

p.m. Thursday until 8 p.m., weekends from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.

   These days, when the sun is shining and daylight lingers into
late evening, Berliners are outside talking about their city. The
question is always the same, accompanied by a sweeping gesture
toward the crane or bulldozer inevitably positioned nearby: ``You
think it will work?''
</P>
<P>
   For the visitor interested in urban development, contemporary
architecture or, indeed, world history, Berlin is a veritable candy
store for the mind. All over town the city's physical past is being
confronted, restored, reshaped or at times obliterated to make way
for the 21st-century capital.
</P>
<P>
   There is the newly transplanted heart at Potsdamer Platz, where
the steel-and-glass towers of Sony and Daimler Benz near
completion. The area was the commercial center of prewar Berlin _
but it was also the site of Hitler's bunker, of the wall and the
mined no man's land behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Reichstag, birthplace of the Weimar democracy in
1918, but also the setting for the infamous fire used by the Nazis
to seize power in 1933. Refashioned by Sir Norman Foster, the
British architect, the building will once again house the German
Parliament in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a less monumental scale, there is the old Jewish quarter in
the Mitte district. Due to conflicting claims, much of the area was
off limits to investors after the wall fell, resulting in a
squatters' paradise and a flourishing subculture that left its mark
in the neighborhood's trendy galleries, clubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the sideshow. For in reclaiming its status
as government capital, Berlin is determined to reclaim its 1920s
role as cultural capital of Europe.

   PARIS _ Victor Chernomyrdin.MDBR/.MDNM/ returns as Russia's
prime minister in a more powerful personal position than he was
before President Boris Yeltsin fired him five months.MDBR/.MDNM/
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a financial crisis, Yeltsin has ``humiliated
himself by recalling the man he abruptly dismissed along with the
whole Cabinet,'' said Nicholas Chomsky, who runs a Paris-based
management consulting agency for foreign investors in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Chernomyrdin's successor, the young and
politically inexperienced Sergei .MDBR/.MDNM/Kiriyenko, who
unceremoniously got the ax. ~``Yeltsin has effectively admitted
Kiriyenko, his personal choice, was a complete error,''
Chomsky.MDBR/.MDNM/ said. ``At the same time, he has acknowledged
Chernomyrdin was the only viable option and that he was wrong to
fire him in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vishnogradov, a specialist in Russian politics at the
respected French National Research Council, added that it is
``virtually inconceivable Yeltsin would remove Chernomyrdin a
second time, so he looks safe for the last two years of Yeltsin's
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes him a leading contender to succeed Yeltsin,
Vishnogradov said. Not a popular figure, Chernomyrdin.MDBR/.MDNM/
is nonetheless widely respected for being hard-working and
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian president is notoriously unpredictable and
could change his mind again, he appears to have turned full control
of government actions over to Chernomyrdin. This is the sort of
power no previous prime minister has possessed, Vishnogradov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experiment in naming the untried Kiriyenko was supposed to
demonstrate Yeltsin's political flair,'' he said. ``But, instead,
it was such a flop that Yeltsin had little recourse but to summon
Chernomyrdin whose price for returning was greater power and much
less presidential interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, 60, came back only days after the government was
compelled to devalue the ruble by more than 30 percent. Kiriyenko,
36, lacked personal prestige in financial markets and his
tough-seeming steps to sustain the ruble had been contemptuously
dismissed by financial experts.
</P>
<P>
   While Chernomyrdin had plenty of ups and downs during his first
stint as prime minister, his reputation among Russian bankers and
businessmen stands high. As a former head of Russia's gas industry,
he is considered by them to be one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Vishnogradov described Chernomyrdin as ``an insider who knows
which strings to pull. He may lack charisma, but he has savvy which
may be more important these days in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin, never really close,
have been strained since the Cabinet shuffle in March, Vishnogradov
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could hardly be more contrasting,'' he noted. ``Yeltsin
is typically Russian: impulsive and tending to rely on his
intuition. Chernomyrdin also is a typical Russian, but of a
different type. He is serious, methodical and not inclined to place
his trust in others.''
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly regards Yeltsin as having grown dangerously
erratic, Vishnogradov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the two men who are now fated to stand together in
order to rescue the country from economic shambles,'' Vishnogradov
concluded. ``They are an unlikely couple.''

BILL CLINTON NEEDS TO SPEAK AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The disappointment among President Clinton's
usual supporters and friends with his restrained confession to the
nation early last week is a telltale sign that this country is in
for a rough two years no matter how this deplorable affair
eventually concludes.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out that the president's credibility in his office
has been undermined by what appears to be regarded by some of the
public as an inadequate expiation of his sins, there is no recourse
apparent to extract this nation from the political purgatory in
which it would find itself.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a triumph for obsession and recklessness: the
personal behavior of Bill Clinton and the professional behavior of
Ken Starr and his years' long investigation that in its denouement
has come down to exposing sex between two consenting adults. On
such underpinnings is our crisis of national confidence erected.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's Republican critics argue that the crux of the
Starr investigation is not about sex (about which the American
people have said they really don't care and don't want to hear any
more), but about weightier matters of perjury and the subornation
of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But that is merely camouflaging what is happening. In fact, the
perjury and obstruction of justice allegations now on the table
emanate not from the probe of Whitewater, or Filegate or
Travelgate, but only from what Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky did
in private, by mutual consent. As contemptible as his behavior was,
as much as her role was deplorable, what they did violated no
statute. Therefore, any obstruction of justice so far alleged is
based on sex, and nothing but sex.
</P>
<P>
   What next? The odds against impeachment are very long, because
perjury and obstruction of justice hinge on intent and are
considered by legal authorities to be difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   If the president were to lose the effective backing of the
public in his official role, which he has so far retained, would
resignation emerge as a possibility because he would no longer
possess the requisite stature needed to govern? In that event,
would the country find relief and renewal knowing that the crisis
ws founded not on grave constitutional issues, but on sexual
truancy?
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking office, would the new president, Al Gore, be able to
accomplish what his damaged and dented predecessor could not: Unite
the people and Congress behind bold policies at home and abroad?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it more likely that a President Gore would himself become
beleaguered by political opponents within his own party and without
because of his announced ambitions to run for president two years
from now?
</P>
<P>
   The future is not promising. Thursday's anti-terrorist strikes
against the United States underline one aspect.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's motives were immediately questioned. More
impacting than the handful of Republican partisans, were the doubts
expressed by the general public. It is useful for the citizenry to
retain a certain reserve about the acts of government. That is
built not only into the Constitution but hopefully also into the
American political character.
</P>
<P>
   But the instantaneousness and the depth of the skepticism, in
the face of fairly clear evidence that the cruise missiles were not
launched to bury the Lewinsky scandal (and in fact would not do
so), revealed the unusually wide gulf between the people and their
president right now.
</P>
<P>
   That rift exists partly because President Clinton likely made a
political miscalculation in his speech Monday night. His
acknowledgment of an inappropriate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, his taking responsibility and voicing regret left too
many people feeling short-changed.
</P>
<P>
   It was said he should have apologized explicitly for having lied
to the people, that he was too artful in characterizing the
Lewinsky relationship, that he should have shown more remorse.
Republicans, not surprisingly, tended to add that he should not
have tried to shift responsibility onto Starr's investigation.
Nevertheless, so far the pattern of his support holds: His
job-performance approval remains very high, while he gets much
lower marks on his personal behavior. Earlier suggestions by some
politicos that forgiveness and understanding would follow honest
confession appear to have given way as opponents now assail him as
a self-convicted liar.
</P>
<P>
   The actual loss in public esteem he will suffer has to be gauged
over a longer time. But Bill Clinton would be well served if he
again spoke to the American people, not to address the shortcomings
voiced by political opponents, but rather to speak to the general
disquiet and dissatisfaction with his person. He should do so as
soon as the terrorism crisis permits.

CLINTON PULLS THE TRIGGER, WINS THE POLL STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Polls show Americans are happy about last week,
because two days after Bill Clinton admitted being a liar, he shot
$100 million worth of fireworks at bad guys holed up in two beggar
nations.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``sending a message,'' the form of warfare used by a
president more concerned with symbolism than substance, and more
concerned with not taking losses than winning.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile is the perfect political weapon. No American
casualties. Buildings go down. Polls go up.
</P>
<P>
   The message terrorists will get is that the U.S. doesn't have
the stomach to send commando forces to kill them. The rules of war
in America say that American troops should never die, even if
they're trying to stop some madmen who may wipe out Manhattan with
a suitcase nuke.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly the fault of the media, because they'd be all over
Clinton as soon as the first helicopter burned in the desert. It's
also the fault of a president who has his eye on the polls even
more than he does on women.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we were so wrapped up in Clinton's sex life and
on-again-off-again relationship with the truth that we missed a
debate between California's gubernatorial wannabes, Republican Dan
Lungren and Democrat Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Darn, I forgot completely about these guys.
</P>
<P>
   So you wanted real debate, not negative TV ads? What you got
were two intelligent, articulate, experienced men arguing about who
was going to put the lethal injection needle deeper in the veins of
the two inmates a year executed at San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   This debate was in Fresno, where there is high unemployment, low
achievement test scores and far too much teen pregnancy and gang
activity. But no, killing a couple of guys a year is a bigger
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Labor Day is coming, and soon we'll have good old
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, for this debate Lungren's people remembered that
he has the Nixon problem _ profuse debate sweat _ so they cranked
the air-conditioning up in the auditorium and didn't let him
outside all day.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has a sense of humor, so he gave reporters sweat bands
printed with his name. Davis doesn't sweat at all because he's a
cyborg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, columnist Mike Barnicle was fired by the Boston Globe
for inventing two kids with cancer for a column. As if there aren't
enough real kids with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This came just two months after Globe columnist Patricia Smith
was fired for fabricating columns, including one about a woman with
brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for Boston is that its cancer rate isn't as
high as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle is brazen. In the fabricated column, the fake kids with
cancer shared an interest in the Red Sox and one kid's favorite
song was ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' because it was played before
each game at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the fake patriotism or making up kids with cancer.
Barnicle sullied the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of it is that the Globe's editor had tried and failed
to fire Barnicle a few weeks before for stealing lousy George
Carlin jokes.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes. Even the demand for Barnicle's resignation had been
seen in print before.
</P>

   Last week San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown appeared on the
television show ``Politically Incorrect.'' Naturally, the talk
revolved around Bill Clinton's lies and peccadilloes, with Brown
and actor Ron Silver taking Clinton's side against ditzy actress
Victoria Jackson, formerly of ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was rattling on about what a liar Clinton was when she
abruptly said that when the movie is made she wants to play Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Without skipping a beat, Brown asked her if she wanted to do
some rehearsing, and then cackled the patented Willie Brown cackle.
</P>
<P>
   The guy can say anything and get away with it.

THE BLOOD OF BOTH SIDES FLOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Geraldine Breslin and Ann McCombe were
the best of friends.
</P>
<P>
   And so last weekend, when a policeman burst into the clothing
shop here where the two women worked, saying there was a bomb
scare, Breslin and McCombe left the store together. They linked
arms, as women here do, and walked down High Street to a security
cordon the police had put up.
</P>
<P>
   But either because of the sheer incompetence or the breathtaking
calculation of the bombers, the two women unwittingly walked
directly toward the maroon sedan that contained the 500-pound bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Breslin and Ann McCombe were standing together,
probably still arm in arm, when the bomb exploded, killing them
instantly. They lived as soulmates, mothers who chatted endlessly
about their kids, and they died together.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Breslin, 43, was a Catholic. Ann McCombe, 48, was
Protestant. They were just two of the 28 people who died when a
dissident Irish republican group's bomb exploded in this market
town on Aug. 15, in what has been described as the worst atrocity
in Northern Ireland this century.
</P>
<P>
   But their deaths reflect a bigger story than the tragic events
of last week.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many acts of violence because of the ancient
squabble over national identity that the Irish, in their inimitable
penchant for understatement, call ``The Troubles.'' But in nearly
all of these acts, one or the other of Northern Ireland's two
communities _ Catholic nationalists who consider themselves Irish,
or Protestant unionists who see themselves as British _ was the
intended target, while the other side was the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   The violence here in Omagh changed that, and in a perverse way
demonstrated in the most compelling way ever that the blood of
people on this island is not orange or green, but red.
</P>
<P>
   As the rubble in Omagh is carted away for forensic examination,
and the terrible litany of disfiguring injuries is added to the
horrific catalog of death, the dignity of most people on this
island, but especially those in County Tryone who have borne the
brunt of the suffering, has shown through. They have eulogized and
buried their dead with awe-inspiring grace.
</P>
<P>
   And by and large, they have resisted the urge to call for
anything but a redoubling of efforts to make sure the peace process
that the overwhelming majority of people on this island have
endorsed by referendum continues. This is a starkly different
reaction from those that greeted most of the other atrocities over
the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Protestant extremists bombed McGurk's Bar in Belfast,
killing 15 Catholics. The bombers said it was retaliation for IRA
bombs that had killed Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, British paratroopers shot dead 14 Catholic civil rights
marchers in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Most Protestants
were ready to accept the British Army's initial claim _ later shown
to be a lie _ that the victims had been armed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the IRA bombed a British Army war veterans'
commemoration in Enniskillen, a quiet town just 20 miles from
Omagh, killing 11 Protestant civilians. The IRA claimed it wanted
to kill soldiers, but the deaths of civilians gathered in the
square for a ceremony was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the IRA put a bomb in a fish shop on the Shankill Road
in West Belfast, saying it wanted to kill loyalist extremists who
were meeting upstairs. There was no meeting. Nine Protestant
civilians, some of them children, and the IRA man who carried the
bomb, were killed. In retaliation, loyalist gunmen sprayed a
Catholic bar in Greysteel with gunfire, killing six Catholics and a
Protestant. The killers said it served the Protestant right for
drinking in a Catholic bar.
</P>
<P>
   The segregation of suffering has prevented many people here from
finding the common ground of victims. It helped create an
ambivalence about violence when it was directed at ``them.'' Over
the last decade, whenever people were asked how they felt about
violence being carried out in their name, very often the response
was a defensive, ``What about what they did to us?''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in Omagh last week, where neither side had
a monopoly on suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb in Omagh killed Catholics and Protestants, nationalists
and unionists, men and women, boys and girls. It killed twin girls
in their mother's womb, less than a month from birth. It killed
three little boys from the Irish Republic. It killed two Spanish
visitors, incredibly, the first tourists ever killed by an act of
terrorism in Northern Ireland. It killed Brenda Logue, 17, whose
family supports Sinn Fein, the political allies of the IRA. It
killed Esther Gibson, 36, a Sunday school teacher in the church of
the hardline unionist Rev. Ian Paisley.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the 1974 bombings in Dublin, when 27 people were
killed on the same day six were killed by a bomb in Monaghan, the
Irish Republic has been largely insulated from the violence that
has been so common in Northern Ireland. But three of the victims
were boys from Buncrana, in County Donegal, shopping in Omagh with
their Spanish friends who every summer for the last 10 years had
come to Ireland to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the newly elected leader of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, crossed the border to attend the funeral of the three
Donegal boys _ as much a crossing of the Rubicon for the leader of
mainstream unionism as was the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams's
unequivocal condemnation of the bombing last weekend. It was the
first time Adams condemned an act by armed republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Trimble were in St. Mary's Church as the bishop of
Derry, the Rev. Seamus Hegarty, eulogized the three boys. Looking
at Trimble, Bishop Hegarty said, ``You, Mr. Trimble, are
particularly welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic congregation burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble _ who refuses to speak to Adams because of Sinn Fein's
links to an IRA that, despite a cease-fire, will not give up its
weapons _ did not shake hands with Adams. But there was a handshake
that did suggest what happened in Omagh has had a humanizing
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and Mary McAleese, the first president of Ireland to
hail from Northern Ireland, were bitter rivals at Queens
University, where they both worked as law professors. The rivalry
turned to open hostility when McAleese got a promotion that Trimble
thought should have gone to him. But in St. Mary's Church, they
shook hands and greeted each other warmly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency to overestimate the impact the sudden,
violent death of innocents can have here. Last month, the loyalist
firebombing of a Catholic home in Ballymoney killed three little
boys and shocked the world. Some people said that would be the end
of it. Of course, sectarian hatred will survive the peace process.
But there is considerable evidence that the peace process will
survive even the horrors of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   It may be what happened in Omagh is a turning point in this
island's tortured history. Because maybe the people here have
finally found common ground. How sad, how terribly sad, that it had
to be a burial ground.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There must be some reason why a politician who is
riding high risks it all on an illicit romance. Otherwise, it would
not happen again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Even close friends of President Clinton say they are baffled by
his behavior. Why, they ask, would a man stalked by the reputation
of a womanizer and truth shader be tempted to have a White House
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a 21-year-old intern, and then
emphatically deny it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused and disappointed,'' said Robert Reich, a
classmate of Clinton's at Yale Law School and the labor secretary
in his first term. ``I said in January he couldn't have had this
relationship ... because he wouldn't have been so stupid. I was
wrong on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad to see him throw away such a huge opportunity,''
said Reich, now a professor at Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton biographer David Maraniss calls such risk-taking both
the central feature and the ``riddle of Clinton's life.'' The
recurring themes of his career have been exhilarating win,
humiliating loss, and remarkable recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has followed the other with unerring regularity since the
beginning of'' Clinton's political career, Maraniss, a Washington
Post reporter, wrote in a recent essay. ``When the public perceives
him as being down, he is already plotting his comeback. When he
thinks he is on top, the seeds of disaster have been planted.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Comeback Kid showed up once again last week. On
Thursday the president's commanding authority over US military
strikes on terrorist targets overseas erased, at least for the
moment, the image of an angry and embarrassed president confessing
to a relationship that was ``not appropriate'' on national
television Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who voted for Clinton in 1992 knew they weren't voting
for a saint or the pope, but they were voting for someone who would
turn the country around,'' said Skip Rutherford, an old friend of
Clinton's and coordinator of his planned presidential library in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also knew he was human _ a young president who wasn't
content just to sit on the front porch,'' Rutherford said. ``I
think a lot of people can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger once called power
``the ultimate aphrodisiac,'' which could help explain why
politicians, including a long list of presidents, have expended
considerable energy and taken unusual risks in the pursuit of women
and sex. There is no way of knowing whether Washington's
extramarital affairs have become more common in recent years, but
they have become riskier because the media show less restraint in
exposing them.
</P>
<P>
   There does seem to be a pattern that the higher the stakes, the
greater the risk-taking. In 1992, candidate Clinton gambled that he
could explain away an alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers and
still win the Democratic nomination and the presidency, which he
did. The gamble in his second term is that he can explain away a
relationship with Lewinsky and save his presidency and legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado senator Gary Hart, the leading Democratic
presidential hopeful in 1987, set a milestone in risk-taking when
he dared the press to find him unfaithful. Reporters did; Hart got
caught in a Washington townhouse and on a yacht called Monkey
Business with Donna Rice, a young woman who was not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-stakes risk-taker was former senator Robert
Packwood, Republican of Oregon. He was chairman of the Finance
Committee when he was forced to resign over allegations from dozens
of women of sexual misconduct. Two decades before, Wilbur Mills, an
Arkansas Democrat, was one of the House's most powerful lawmakers
when a stripper known as Fanne Fox, the Argentine Firecracker,
jumped from his car and into Washington's Tidal Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Berglas, a clinical psychologist at Harvard Medical
School, said these men are representative of those who suffer from
a psychiatric disorder, which he loosely calls a success syndrome.
Highly successful men, at the top of their game, get bored and seek
new challenges and conquests that frequently drive them to extremes
and to savor the thrill and risk of going beyond what is legal,
moral, or appropriate, Berglas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual gratification is never what the power-crazed,
philandering executive is after,'' said Berglas, who treats many
white-collar criminals in his practice. ``It's about daring the
devil, ducking under the radar, and seeing what, clandestinely,
they can get away with. It's truly an abuse of power, not a sexual
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   While a subject of controversy itself, ``sexual addiction''
could explain the president's irrational behavior, said Jerome
Levin, a psychotherapist who treats addictions at the New School
for Social Research in New York. In his book, ``The Clinton
Syndrome,'' Levin suggests the president's traumatic childhood and
dysfunctional family _ his stepfather was an alcoholic and abusive,
his mother was a gambler, his brother was hooked on cocaine _ set
the biological and environmental stage for Clinton's own addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton does have a problem with sex, and'' it ``has led him
to do impulsive, dangerous things that make little sense,'' said
Levin, who acknowledges he has never met the president. ``His
actions suggest a drivenness and compulsiveness that certainly have
the overtones of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing the president could do is admit he has a
problem with sex and compulsion and get some professional help,''
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take a psychiatrist, of course, to know that
politicians tend to have oversized egos, appetites for adulation,
and serious needs to be wanted and loved. The risks inherent in
those needs turning sexual are often overlooked and occasionally
even encouraged by political groupies and aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unspoken, but staffers do facilitate and find ways for
their bosses to, well, relax,'' said a former aide to several
senators and who asked not to be identified. ``It's in the staff's
interest to know their horse and know what keeps him ready to run
and win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   To Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, that is sexual exploitation at the highest levels. ``No CEO
and no elected official, including the president, should take
advantage of the aphrodisiac of power to have sex with interns or
staff,'' Ireland said. The president, according to Ireland, seems
to divide women into two categories: ``Women he must treat with
respect ... and those he can use and toss aside like tissue
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts governor Michael S. Dukakis said the
president's behavior makes ``absolutely no sense,'' but he has
studied the presidency long enough to know that throughout history,
the smartest leaders have taken unnecessary risks and made colossal
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents, like all of us, are fallible, they make
mistakes,'' Dukakis said. ``Only theirs are magnified because the
spotlight is so intense.''

 &HT;    It's not too late to spare us the gory details
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the several roads still open to President Clinton, one seems
almost certain to lead to his further humiliation and a forced
exodus from office.
</P>
<P>
   That's the road Clinton seems stubbornly determined to travel.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech last week, Clinton claimed he had been ``legally
accurate'' in the Paula Jones case when he denied a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. By sticking to that claim, the
president still hopes to avoid perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   There are two dangers in that lawyerly approach. First, it
insults the intelligence of the American public to claim that what
went on between the president and Lewinsky did not constitute a
sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The second danger is more subtle and more threatening.
</P>
<P>
   By quibbling over the definition of a sexual relationship,
Clinton makes the details of who did what to whom relevant. In
essence, it extends an invitation to independent counsel Kenneth
Starr to explore the physical details of the Clinton-Lewinsky
relationship in excruciating detail.
</P>
<P>
   And Starr is apparently making the most of that invitation.
White House spokesmen say that in his grand-jury testimony, Clinton
refused to answer several questions from Starr because he
considered them too intimate. Ordinarily, such a stand might win
Clinton a lot of sympathy. But in this case, the president cannot
logically base his defense on quibbles about details and then
refuse to discuss those details.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the details that will ruin him.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have run out of patience with both Clinton
and Starr. They have had their noses rubbed in someone else's dirty
laundry for months now, and they don't much like the experience.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, few Americans are demanding that Clinton leave
office. However, release of graphic details about the president's
sexual behavior _ which seems inevitable _ would move his
relationship with Lewinsky from something almost hypothetical to
something that is all too real.
</P>
<P>
   It would make the whole thing much harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had chosen instead to admit his perjury, the probable
consequences would have been relatively minor. Some Republicans
would no doubt have seized upon the admission as grounds for
impeachment, but the American people would not have supported such
a move.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the perjury occurred as Clinton gave immaterial
testimony about his private sex life in a politically motivated
case that was thrown out of court as groundless. Americans would
not accept that as reason to abandon a successful president. The
punishment would seem out of line with the crime. The fact that
Clinton was manipulated into the perjury by a conspiracy among
Jones' attorneys and Starr's office would also have counted in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton has already traveled so far down this road to
ruin that turning back is impossible. His grand jury testimony and
that of Lewinsky may be more or less secret for the moment, but it
is bound to emerge eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legalistic defense has doomed the American people to
learn exactly what Bill did to Monica and what Monica did to Bill.
That sordid knowledge and the revulsion it inspires will erode
public support for Clinton just as surely as the Colorado River
carved the Grand Canyon, and far more quickly.

   It's like making a deal with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is no better product placement than having an
``it'' starlet wearing a designer's drop-dead gown. On the other,
what happens when celebrities are caught in compromising positions
while wearing designer labels with which they have no commercial
association?
</P>
<P>
   Slap a logo on anything and find out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, paying Demi and Bruce to star in an ad campaign is
one thing, but who'd have thought Monica Lewinsky would become an
unwitting Donna Karan spokesmodel when she wore a DKNY beret to a
November 1996 photo op with the president?
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant shilling for Tommy Hilfiger? In 1995, the actor
donned a Hilfiger cap for the most unglamorous of occasions _ his
arrest for soliciting a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Coco have thought if she knew socialite Jocelyne
Wildenstein _ whose history of cosmetic surgery borders on the
bizarre _ was the sort of person who would create international
headlines as she battled her ex-husband for custody of, among other
things, a $350,000 Chanel couture dress?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the world's most notorious unpaid product pitchman
these days is O.J. Simpson, the man who sent sales of white Ford
Broncos soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handedly, Simpson pumped up sales of Aris Isotoner gloves
and established Bruno Magli's brand name in the United States by
denying he wore the company's shoes and calling them ``ugly-ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, unsolicited, has now taken to wearing a Nike cap to
public appearances. Most notably, he was televised wearing the hat
as he discussed an appeal of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment
against him in the deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Is Nike grateful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't react in any way,'' said Robert Mitchell, Nike senior
manager of corporate communications. ``The main thing here is that
we did not place that product with him. He just went out and bought
it like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's reaction _ distant, indifferent, but not damning _
illustrates how companies view these random product appearances.
Whether they can really damage brand equity is a tricky issue, even
if the consequences are only comical.
</P>
<P>
   There is one school of public relations that maintains ``any
press is good press.'' Even if the product is associated visually
with an infamous person, the thinking goes, its image is still
subliminally ingrained in the consumer consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, image can be everything. Since there are more
and more media covering more famous and more notorious faces, the
number of random associations of designer labels linked to news
images is proportionately on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   While many are absurd and probably have negligible impact on the
label, there are much more serious cases when a product repeatedly
is linked to a negative news story or figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect varies according to the brand and the brand's
personality,'' said Erik Gordon, director of the Center for
Retailing Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
``Some brands are so tiny that anywhere they are noticed can have a
deep impact,'' he said. ``But for a more established brand, it's
not so simple because the power of a brand extends from so many
things, especially the effects of association.''
</P>
<P>
   Being linked to the wrong person can be a serious problem for a
brand, he said. And while brand managers can pay to have their
products placed in movies, on television or on celebrities,
``there's no way you can pay to keep the wrong people from wearing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands are pretty fragile,'' Gordon said. ``The way to tank a
brand like Diesel would be to have Bill Clinton or David Brinkley
wear it, because that kills the effectiveness of the image that the
brand is young and hip. It doesn't have to be someone like Mike
Tyson or the obvious shock of seeing a mass murderer wearing your
sweatshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan got a shock in January when Time magazine ran an
up-close image of Monica Lewinsky wearing a DKNY beret in the
well-worn video clip in which she's embraced by President Clinton.
The hat turned out to be part of a 1992 collection; it sold for
$38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmed is the word,'' said Patti Cohen, senior vice
president of public relations, describing her reaction to the
ensuing media requests for information about the hat. ``I got a fax
from the Washington Post asking all these questions about a hat on
the cover of Time,'' she said. ``I couldn't quite get why such a
serious publication would be asking such questions about a hat. I
thought it was an April Fool's Day joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Fisher, senior vice president of global communication
at Tommy Hilfiger, said companies naturally want to see their
products shown in the best possible light. But, she said, when
products appear in a negative situation, consumers are smart enough
to realize these images are not a reflection on the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's label is geared to images of diversity,
multiculturalism and a broad range of ages, which in some ways
buffers the company from the side effects of unexpected
associations. Whether the label appears on a rhythm and blues
singer like Aaliyah or on President Clinton, who was photographed
in China last month wearing a polo shirt with a Hilfiger crest,
Hilfiger sees these as positive images.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hugh Grant situation, Fisher said, ``I don't think
customers would in any way associate Tommy with, uh, the deed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems an obvious conclusion that in an age when
cultural media often is driven by paid product placements, when
sharp-eyed moviegoers and television watchers have become
accustomed to stop-frame images of Kodak cameras and Calvin
Klein-wardrobed sets, consumers notice when these products appear
in other, unexpected places.

<P>
   It's like making a deal with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is no better product placement than having an
``it'' starlet wearing a designer's drop-dead gown. On the other,
what happens when celebrities are caught in compromising positions
while wearing designer labels with which they have no commercial
association?
</P>
<P>
   Slap a logo on anything and find out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, paying Demi and Bruce to star in an ad campaign is
one thing, but who'd have thought Monica Lewinsky would become an
unwitting Donna Karan spokesmodel when she wore a DKNY beret to a
November 1996 photo op with the president?
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant shilling for Tommy Hilfiger? In 1995, the actor
donned a Hilfiger cap for the most unglamorous of occasions _ his
arrest for soliciting a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Coco have thought if she knew socialite Jocelyne
Wildenstein _ whose history of cosmetic surgery borders on the
bizarre _ was the sort of person who would create international
headlines as she battled her ex-husband for custody of, among other
things, a $350,000 Chanel couture dress?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the world's most notorious unpaid product pitchman
these days is O.J. Simpson, the man who sent sales of white Ford
Broncos soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handedly, Simpson pumped up sales of Aris Isotoner gloves
and established Bruno Magli's brand name in the United States by
denying he wore the company's shoes and calling them ``ugly-ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, unsolicited, has now taken to wearing a Nike cap to
public appearances. Most notably, he was televised wearing the hat
as he discussed an appeal of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment
against him in the deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Is Nike grateful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't react in any way,'' said Robert Mitchell, Nike senior
manager of corporate communications. ``The main thing here is that
we did not place that product with him. He just went out and bought
it like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's reaction _ distant, indifferent, but not damning _
illustrates how companies view these random product appearances.
Whether they can really damage brand equity is a tricky issue, even
if the consequences are only comical.
</P>
<P>
   There is one school of public relations that maintains ``any
press is good press.'' Even if the product is associated visually
with an infamous person, the thinking goes, its image is still
subliminally ingrained in the consumer consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, image can be everything. Since there are more
and more media covering more famous and more notorious faces, the
number of random associations of designer labels linked to news
images is proportionately on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   While many are absurd and probably have negligible impact on the
label, there are much more serious cases when a product repeatedly
is linked to a negative news story or figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect varies according to the brand and the brand's
personality,'' said Erik Gordon, director of the Center for
Retailing Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
``Some brands are so tiny that anywhere they are noticed can have a
deep impact,'' he said. ``But for a more established brand, it's
not so simple because the power of a brand extends from so many
things, especially the effects of association.''
</P>
<P>
   Being linked to the wrong person can be a serious problem for a
brand, he said. And while brand managers can pay to have their
products placed in movies, on television or on celebrities,
``there's no way you can pay to keep the wrong people from wearing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands are pretty fragile,'' Gordon said. ``The way to tank a
brand like Diesel would be to have Bill Clinton or David Brinkley
wear it, because that kills the effectiveness of the image that the
brand is young and hip. It doesn't have to be someone like Mike
Tyson or the obvious shock of seeing a mass murderer wearing your
sweatshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan got a shock in January when Time magazine ran an
up-close image of Monica Lewinsky wearing a DKNY beret in the
well-worn video clip in which she's embraced by President Clinton.
The hat turned out to be part of a 1992 collection; it sold for
$38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmed is the word,'' said Patti Cohen, senior vice
president of public relations, describing her reaction to the
ensuing media requests for information about the hat. ``I got a fax
from the Washington Post asking all these questions about a hat on
the cover of Time,'' she said. ``I couldn't quite get why such a
serious publication would be asking such questions about a hat. I
thought it was an April Fool's Day joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Fisher, senior vice president of global communication
at Tommy Hilfiger, said companies naturally want to see their
products shown in the best possible light. But, she said, when
products appear in a negative situation, consumers are smart enough
to realize these images are not a reflection on the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's label is geared to images of diversity,
multiculturalism and a broad range of ages, which in some ways
buffers the company from the side effects of unexpected
associations. Whether the label appears on a rhythm and blues
singer like Aaliyah or on President Clinton, who was photographed
in China last month wearing a polo shirt with a Hilfiger crest,
Hilfiger sees these as positive images.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hugh Grant situation, Fisher said, ``I don't think
customers would in any way associate Tommy with, uh, the deed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems an obvious conclusion that in an age when
cultural media often is driven by paid product placements, when
sharp-eyed moviegoers and television watchers have become
accustomed to stop-frame images of Kodak cameras and Calvin
Klein-wardrobed sets, consumers notice when these products appear
in other, unexpected places.

SMALLPOX STOCKS VULNERABLE, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The modern-day terrorist's arsenal typically is stocked with the
highest of high-tech weapons, from nerve gas to night goggles,
remote detonators to heat-seeking missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But what has some scientists more worried than any of those
new-age armaments is a potential tool of destruction that dates
back at least 3,000 years: the virus that causes smallpox, the
deadliest disease ever.
</P>
<P>
   Although the virus was eradicated in the wild 22 years ago,
small stocks of it are still kept in research laboratories. If they
get into the wrong hands, they could be turned into a biological
weapon that virologists say would be impossible to contain or
counteract.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were spelled out last week by two of America's most
eminent authorities on smallpox, who insisted the world must
destroy its remaining stocks of the virus and restart large-scale
manufacture of smallpox vaccine. Their call, published in the New
England Journal of Medicine, seemed to take on new urgency
following American cruise missile strikes that same day against
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the
recent US embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked the questions, `Why would we keep our smallpox
virus? To zap them if they zapped us?' Everyone agrees that is
morally not right,'' said one of the journal authors, Dr. Donald A.
Henderson, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our destroying all of our smallpox doesn't guarantee everyone
will destroy all of theirs...but it would put a lot of pressure on
Russia and other countries to conform,'' added Henderson, who runs
the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins
University. He coauthored the journal article with Dr. Joel G.
Breman of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the fate of the world's remaining stocks of
smallpox virus has been raging for years within the scientific
community, and last week's events showed nothing is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate and professor emeritus at
Rockefeller University in New York, had a decidedly different
outlook: ``If there was a way you could wave your magic wand and
destroy all the smallpox in the world, I would be very much for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that simply isn't going to happen, Lederberg said. Although
there is no immediate need to the further research with the virus,
he said, ``I don't want to destroy that opportunity irrevocably.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the debate are gearing up in anticipation of a
decision early next year by the World Health Organization on
whether to proceed with plans to eliminate all stocks of the
smallpox virus. It is an intense controversy, stoked by all the
memories that smallpox stirs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that smallpox has exacted a larger death toll than
any disease in human history, dating back at least to ancient
Egypt. It's also the way it has touched nearly every part of the
planet, killing up to 30 percent of those infected.
</P>
<P>
   The illness typically shows itself within 12 days of infection,
beginning with a high fever and aches and pains that mimic the flu,
then quickly progresses to form small pimples, which grow into
pustules that blend into one another as they spread across the
body. Among survivors, the pustules turn to scabs and leave pitted
scars that serve as lifelong reminders of the disease. For the less
fortunate, death generally comes within a couple weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A universal vaccination program had eliminated smallpox in
America by 1949. A worldwide eradication campaign began in 1966,
when smallpox still was killing 2 million people a year, and within
a decade the disease was wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   But while the illness is gone, the virus that caused it remains.
Officially, there are only two labs in the world that have it _ one
at the US Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the other at a
government facility in Russia _ both of which maintain the
highest-level security. Unofficially, however, ``there is a lot of
discussion currently about the possibility that smallpox may have
ended up somewhere other than these two centers,'' says Brian Mahy,
who as director of CDC's Division of Viral Diseases oversees that
agency's stock of the virus. There is special concern that it may
have been stockpiled at at least three unauthorized labs in Russia,
along with labs in Iran and Iraq, where there was an outbreak of
the disease in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming terrorists have the smallpox virus, or could buy or
steal it, could it pose a threat?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be difficult to administer,'' said Henderson, who
led the WHO eradication campaign. ``It certainly is possible to put
up an aerosal of smallpox, have it drift a long way ... and have it
infect people with very few particles. It would not become apparent
like a bang... There'd be a delay in recognition, and the disease
would begin to spread by the time the diagnosis was made.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed and efficiency with which smallpox can spread was
underscored in 1970 in Germany when a young electrician developed
the disease. He was taken to a specially-equipped hospital where
everyone was vaccinated, but the disease still infected more than a
dozen others, including an unlucky visitor who, Henderson says,
``came to a corridor door a long way from where the patient's room
was, opened the door, asked for directions, then left. That visitor
came down with smallpox.''
</P>
<P>
   To make things more perilous, there is no known treatment for
smallpox. There is a vaccine, but Americans haven't been getting it
since 1972. Researchers say most vaccines administered before then
probably aren't effective any more, and US stocks of vaccine are so
low that they could only protect about 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   All that means a biological weapon armed with smallpox could
pose an even greater public health threat than the oft-raised
specter of a weapon bearing anthrax, said Dr. Alfred DeMaria,
director of communicable disease control at the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health. ``We've talked about it considerably,
we've done tabletop simulations,'' he added. ``The problem is,
there's no resources to stockpile (smallpox) vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, say Henderson and his coauthor in the New England
Journal, is a four-pronged approach: The WHO should call on all
countries to immediately destroy their stocks of the virus.
International agreements should be signed to ensure more rigorous
inspection of suspect facilities worldwide. Production of vaccines
should be ratcheted up. And plans like one proposed recently by
President Clinton should be developed to cope with attacks by
smallpox-fueled biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO already has approved such a program, but it is due to be
considered again by its executive board and full assembly.
Opponents argue that countries we most fear aren't likely to abide
by any call to destroy the virus, and that further research on it
could yield clues to how human disease-fighting mechanisms work and
help society cope with related viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net effect of proceeding with destruction would be that
the US would destroy its stock and be very poorly positioned to do
research for therapeutic measures if smallpox should come back,''
said Lederberg.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of eradicating remaining virus stocks, however, say
noninfectious DNA strands still would be available for research,
along with safer samples of the related monkeypox virus. And they
say they have learned all they can from available supplies of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no use from a public health sense of these two stocks
of virus, and they are a public health threat,'' concluded Mahy,
who has responsibility for the freezer at the CDC that contains its
stock. After a centuries-long battle to rid the planet of smallpox
virus, he said, ``It would be an entirely logical ending to the
campaign to get rid of it.''

VENUS TO MARS: WE NEED TO TALK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   You live with a man, share every intimacy, until one day, sooner
or later, he says or does something and you find yourself thinking:
Who is this person?
</P>
<P>
   These Mars Moments are among the reasons John Gray's 1992
self-help book ``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus'' has sold
more than 6 million copies, spawned spinoff books, seminars,
workshops, a magazine, and, most recently, a board game. Gray's
basic premise, that men and women are so different that they might
as well live on separate planets, is attractive not only because
there's a lot of truth in it, but because it's so simple.
Bewildered by the man in your life? He's from Mars. That explains
it.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the self-help spectrum is the newly
published ``We Have to Talk,'' subtitled ``Healing Dialogues
Between Men and Women.'' The authors, Janet Surrey and Samuel Shem,
the pen name of novelist/psychiatrist Dr. Stephen J. Bergman, are
married and on the faculty of Wellesley College's Stone Center.
They see Gray's Mars/Venus model as ``a masked return to the
stereotypic 1950s couple.'' Shem and Surrey emphasize the
similarities, not the differences, between men and women.
Biological differences are important, they write, but social
conditioning is what leads to those Mars Moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the separate worlds of Mars and Venus, men retreat into their
emotional caves while women talk. Gray doesn't advocate wholesale
behavioral changes but suggests little ways to bridge the
communication gender gap. The authors of ``We Have to Talk'' think
that if men and women are going to learn to connect, big behavioral
changes are in order, changes that may be especially threatening to
men. They suggest that men and women stop thinking of relationships
as sexually polarizing power struggles and instead think in terms
of mutuality, not just of ``I'' and ``you,'' but ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   In their work at the Stone Center, Shem and Surrey found that
some men hesitate to improve their ability to communicate within a
relationship for fear they will become ``more like women.'' ``The
book's title, then, is an interesting choice, since, as the authors
note, ``To men, these may be among the most feared words in the
language.'' Uttered by a woman, the phrase ``We have to talk,''
often results in what the authors call ``male relational dread,''
characterized by responses like, ``Let me out of here!'' and ``Next
stop, divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   The title won't scare women, the chief buyers of relationship
self-help books. With so many books of this genre in print you
might think relations between the sexes would have improved to the
point where no new titles would be necessary. But they keep coming.
A little while ago a book landed on my desk, ``All Men Are Jerks: A
Woman's Guide to Understanding Men,'' a title that doesn't seem
likely to promote rational discourse between the sexes. But
rational discourse isn't always the point. Consider ``The Rules,''
Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider's much-publicized guide to
manipulating men by playing hard to get. It's stupid and
superficial, but it's a bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``We Have to Talk'' is that it's not simple
enough (or simple-minded enough). It's not gimmicky. It doesn't
hold out the possibility of a quick fix. Serious changes in
attitude and behavior take a lot of hard work. Surrey and Shem
write that gender dialogues, as they call them, should start young,
in grade school. Boys and girls should be encouraged to talk,
together, about their differences and their similarities, and to
make friends across gender lines. The result, they believe, will be
adults who won't find themsleves trapped on Mars or Venus.

 WITH EYE ON THE PRIZE, McGWIRE REMAINS A HUMBLE DIPLOMAT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flashbulbs blink at every pitch now, shining
thousands of points of light on Mark McGwire. People know they are
witnessing something special, something they'd like to see and feel
and touch and taste as long as they live.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire gets standing ovations when he lumbers to the plate for
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the St. Louis Cardinals are at home or on the road,
thousands of fans show up hours before game time to marvel at
McGwire's matter-of-fact shows of force. Fans good-naturedly boo
when McGwire performs the obligatory bunt attempt at the first
batting-practice offering. The boos give way to oohs and awe, to
slack jaws and bulging eyes, as soon as McGwire begins swinging in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's doubleheader against the New York Mets, McGwire
took six swings during his first round of batting practice and
deposited six baseballs over the outfield wall. McGwire took four
swings in the second round and hit four more home runs. He homered
again with his next swing before settling for a line drive that
would have decapitated anybody in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven swings. Eleven home runs. Not once did McGwire change
expression. McGwire has too much respect for what he does, for
everybody and everything that has preceded him, to allow the daily
carnival surroundings to turn him into the jester. His word for the
public's fascination with every step he takes toward the season
home run record is ``overwhelming,'' but he has come to peace with
it rather than declare war.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid and playing the game, who keeps track of
hitting home runs?'' McGwire wondered aloud the other day. ``You
play the game because you enjoy it, kids in school play it, you
want to do what everybody in school is doing. I never dreamed of
being in this position. I dreamed about trying to be a big
leaguer.''
</P>
<P>
   They say that God watches over fools and small children.
Somebody up there must have a soft spot for baseball, too, because
there is no logical explanation for the forces that serendipitously
intervene on behalf of the grand old game.
</P>
<P>
   When the Black Sox scandal undermined the very fabric of the
game, baseball got Babe Ruth swinging from the heels and making his
way around the bases with little pitty-pat steps. When a strike
robbed fans of a World Series, Cal Ripken Jr. reminded a country
that some players want to give an honest day's work for a day's
pay. When the time came for Roger Maris' season record of 61 home
runs to come under assault, baseball got McGwire to lead the
charge. McGwire has a chance to elevate the nation's interest in
and esteem for the game, and he takes the responsibility seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's America's pastime,'' McGwire said. ``Every child, boy or
girl, has picked up a bat, ball, glove and played the game in some
form. Softball. Whiffle ball. Little League. I think that's why
people are drawn to baseball more than other sports. Not everybody
has picked up a basketball and shot it. Not everybody has picked up
a golf club and swung a golf club or played football, bowling,
hockey. That's why I think this is the best sport in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine if a self-centered, obnoxious creep like Albert
Belle had been put in this position of public trust? Fans would
come to the ballpark to boo and heckle Belle, hoping and praying
that their ill will would sidetrack his efforts. Each time the word
of another home run by Belle would come, fans would fling their
newspapers and remote controls in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, baseball gets a thoughtful, appreciative 34-year-old
hulk of a man who is holding on to his sense of proportion as
forcefully as he grips his bat. McGwire could have sold his
services to the highest bidder last year, but he made a
quality-of-life choice to stay with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   People took him in as one of their own after a mid-season trade,
and that meant more to him than money. Upon announcing that he
would donate $1 million a year to a charity for battered children,
McGwire broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was genuinely moved Thursday night when he became the
first player in history to reach 50 homers in three consecutive
seasons. After all the questions had been asked and answered,
McGwire grabbed a couple of boxes of baseballs. He took them to his
hotel room, and he began writing. Into the wee hours, McGwire wrote
personal notes on the balls to his teammates, his coaches, his
manager, the equipment men, the public-relations staff. He wrote
the date on each ball, putting the numbers 50-50-50 after each
signature.
</P>
<P>
   If what goes around comes around as often as it should, any
balls of historical or sentimental significance that McGwire hits
will come into his possession. The ball that McGwire hit for No. 50
landed in the hands _ sigh _ of a Yonkers lawyer who is _ groan _
weighing his options.
</P>
<P>
   A Long Island man showed up to Shea Stadium that night waving a
fistful of $100 bills and offering $10,000 for the ball. The
possible asking price for the ball for the record-breaking 62nd
homer is too sickening to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is, all these balls are going to be held up for
ransom,'' McGwire said. ``I don't know if I'll get (the No. 50
ball) back, or if somebody will buy it _ some collector. I would
like to have it back, and I sure would like to give it to the Hall
of Fame. It's history, and that's where the history of the game is
_ in Cooperstown.''

<P>
   A part of McGwire wishes he were better-versed in the history of
the game, that he had taken an interest when he was younger. A
bigger part of him understands that it is better this way, because
too much analysis could cause just enough paralysis to undermine
his efforts. As a rookie in 1987, McGwire's uncluttered mind
triumphed to hit 49 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great low-ball hitters of our time,'' Mets manager
Bobby Valentine, then with the Texas Rangers, called McGwire in
those days.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers adjusted, learned that they could tie up McGwire with
high fastballs. McGwire hit .201 and bashed only 22 homers in '91.
His career and confidence were in shambles when a new batting coach
arrived the next year. Doug Rader convinced McGwire that every out
was not a failure, that pitchers occasionally deserve credit for
doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had the mental aspect that I use now back when I was
24,'' McGwire said. ``I really don't know how I did it. All I know
is this game is 99 percent mental. I've worked on it very, very
hard. This game is about failure. It can really beat you up. Your
mind is the strongest thing on your body. If you're going to allow
your mind to put yourself down or think about failure or not being
successful, then you're not going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   An onslaught of foot injuries had McGwire seriously considering
retirement just four years ago. McGwire thought of how his father
had polio and couldn't play sports. He decided he was fortunate
just to have the chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've climbed a wall, or busted through the wall, quite a few
times,'' McGwire said. ``It has made me a better person, a better
player, because of it. There's a lot of players who never climb
that wall or never bust through it, and you never hear from them
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody is listening to this or somebody is going to read
it _ if it's a ballplayer in college or a minor-leaguer who is
going through a rough time _ I'm a perfect example that you can
turn things around.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashbulbs blink, shining thousands of points of light on Mark
McGwire. People are watching something special and magical,
something they want to capture and never let go.

MUSEUMS' PERMANENT COLLECTIONS DO CHANGE, AS CAN PAINTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We
Going?'' It was the third question in the title of the great
Gauguin painting in the Museum of Fine Arts that sprang to mind as
I wandered through the museum the other day, wondering where some
of my favorite paintings had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Monet Mania _ preparations for the ``Monet in the
20th Century'' exhibition opening on Sept. 20 _ has caused a
massive domino effect in the galleries, with star attractions
including the fabulous little Rembrandt ``Artist in His Studio''
relocated and three big permanent collection galleries closed.
``Monet,'' in sheer acreage the biggest show the museum has ever
mounted, will spill over from the temporary exhibition space into
permanent collection galleries _ where the installation isn't
permanent at all.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in museums are. That goes for the MFA's neighbor,
too, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, still ruled by that pesky
will that says everything will stay just as Mrs. Gardner left it,
forever. It can't, of course. Paintings have lives. They get dirty
and have to be whisked away for cleaning. They get loaned to shows
at other museums. They get downgraded, upgraded, and reattributed:
Thursday's Rembrandt is today's ``school of.'' They get stolen, as
in the horrifying 1990 heist that left the Gardner without its
prized Vermeer.
</P>
<P>
   The painting that's undergone the biggest recent change at the
Gardner is ``Juana of Austria and a Young Girl,'' a 16th-century
work that, in curatorspeak, used to be ``given to'' Alonso Sanchez
Coello and, before that, to Titian. The great art historian Bernard
Berenson, acting as Gardner's agent, procured it for her ``at a
Titian price,'' says Gardner Museum chief curator Hilliard
Goldfarb. Gardner paid between 15,000 and 20,000 pounds for the
painting; scholars don't yet know if Berenson got a cut from the
seller, as he probably did in certain other instances, which would
have made it worth his while to see Gardner pay a hefty price.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ``Juana'' has been misidentified, misattributed,
and misdated. Now, research by Portuguese historian Maria Kusche
indicates that the painting was the work of the first major woman
artist of the Renaissance, Sofonisba Anguissola. An Italian
noblewoman who studied painting in her native country and then went
to Spain in 1559, Sofonisba became a royal portraitist of such
stature that, after she retired to Italy, Van Dyck made a
pilgrimage to her home to pay his respects. Kusche's efforts on
behalf of Sofonisba are part of the burgeoning research on women
artists of centuries past, which promises to turn female painters
including Sofonisba, Judith Leyster, and Artemisia Gentileschi into
the Frida Kahlos or Georgia O'Keeffes of their eras.
</P>
<P>
   What makes art historians take a painting away from one artist
and ``give it'' to another? In this case, there was evidence both
stylistic and substantive. Kusche found a letter Sofonisba wrote,
describing how she was working on a portrait of Juana for the pope.
At the time she wrote the letter, in 1561, her style of painting
was the same as in the Gardner ``Juana.'' While Sanchez Coello's
works were hard and enamel-like, ``Sofonisba's of this period show
an Italianate interest in more softly modulated lighting and
looser, more atmospheric brushstrokes,'' says Goldfarb.
</P>
<P>
   About three dozen paintings are now given to Sofonisba, who is
one of only a handful of female painters of note in the
Renaissance. As part of her rediscovery, Sofonisba was the subject
of a 1995 exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts,
in Washington, D.C., but although a color reproduction of ``Juana''
was the catalog's frontispiece, the painting itself was too fragile
for the Gardner to send to the show. It's since been bolstered up
in the conservation labs at Harvard, though, and this fall it goes
to the Prado, in Madrid, for a show about Philip II, the king of
Spain who was Juana's brother _ and who liked Sofonisba so much
that he personally paid her dowry.
</P>
<P>
   While there's a lingering public impression that the Gardner
will doesn't allow loans, Goldfarb says there's no specific
prohibition on them, and that Gardner herself loaned works during
her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That lifetime was almost at its end when Gardner's friend John
Singer Sargent painted his last portrait of her, ``Mrs. Gardner in
White,'' in 1922, just two years before her death. He showed her
wrapped head to toe in a pale shroud, her face receding under a
gauzy hood, as if she were already retreating from the here and
now. The portrait, inaccessible to the public for several years,
can now be seen again, thanks to the museum's recent reopening of
the gallery where it lives, the ground-floor Macknight Room. Named
for another of Gardner's artist pals, Dodge Macknight, it is filled
with small works by Degas, Paul Manship, and lesser lights
including Macknight himself, who comes under the category of
``skillful.'' One of the charms of the Gardner Museum as monument
to the chatelaine's taste is that sometimes her taste was for the
tepid. It's fun to see the dramatic fluctuations in quality in her
museum, and to know that the will prevents curators with hindsight
from ``fixing'' her goofs.
</P>
<P>
   Meandering through the paintings galleries in the MFA, unable to
find the little Rembrandt, I did an about-face and headed to the
West Wing Information Desk to ask its whereabouts. The info desk
was gone. There is nothing at all in the room where it used to be:
It's all being done over for ``Monet.'' Meanwhile, there's a tiny
ground-floor information outpost opposite the West Wing escalator.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
! 1/2 ``The Avengers''  Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman look cool as
John Steed and Emma Peel, those unflappable defenders of the
British Empire on '60s TV. But the film is clueless when it comes
to capturing the twinkling subterranean interplay between them as
they save the world and pretend not to notice. And Sean Connery
seems surprisingly uneasy as the heavy, a Scottish meteorologist
whose ranting contributes to the dead space. (PG)
<TEXT>
<P>
   (FR)!! &UR; 1/2 ``Blade''  &LR; This film of a gothic comic begins
interestingly as Wesley Snipes's fearless vampire hunter comes
closer than any previous American action star has to Hong Kong's
acrobatic supermen. But the film degenerates into empty special
effects that relegate it to big-screen video game status. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! &UR; 1/2 ``Dance with Me''  &LR; A clunky soap opera plot is carried by
sizzling dance moves, smartly photographed by Randa Haines. Imagine
``Flashdance'' and ``Strictly Ballroom'' with lots of salsa added
and you'll get the idea. Vanessa Williams projects intensity,
Puerto Rican pop star Chayanne steals the movie with his sunny,
boyish, sexy charm. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   !!! &UR; ``Gadjo Dilo''  &LR; A French musicologist searching for a
legendary gypsy singer is won over to the gypsy way of life,
although filmmaker Tony Gatlif never minimizes its harshness. The
cast of mostly real Romanian gypsies all but explodes from the
screen as they act out their apparent belief that infusing their
second-class citizen status with lusty vigor is the best revenge.
(Unrated) (Romany, Romanian, and French with subtitles)
</P>
<P>
   !!! &UR; ``Next Stop Wonderland''  &LR; A refreshing against-the-grain
quality subverts Hollywood romantic comedy formula as Hope Davis's
melancholy, sharp-tongued nurse and Alan Gelfant's plumber dreaming
of being a marine biologist edge closer together, unbeknownst to
each other, fatefully linked by the fact that each has a stubborn
integrity beneath an unruly surface. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! &UR; 1/2 ``Regeneration''  &LR; High-minded, brooding but dramaticlaly
inert study of the clash between idealism and expediency in an
upper-class WWI rehab facility, a converted castle in Scotland,
where James Wilby's poet, Siegfried Sassoon, has been stashed as a
shellshock victim to discredit his antiwar writings. Jonathan
Pryce's compassionate doctor and Stuart Bunce as Sassoon's protege,
poet Wilfred Owen, add to the film's sense of committed
craftsmanship. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   ! &UR; ``Dead Man on Campus''  &LR; Dumb and sluggish college comedy with
Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar as two flunking friends
who hope to drive their roommate to suicide so they can get

RECASTING HOLLYWOOD AND LITERARY LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last June, the American Film Institute released an extremely
silly list that purported to rank the 100 greatest American movies.
A month later, the Modern Library released a list very nearly as
silly, ostensibly ranking this century's 100 greatest novels
written in English. Both proved so controversial they're still
making news.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, AFI took its latest drubbing when TV Guide ranked
the 50 best films on video (the magazine's No.1 title, ``The
Godfather Part II,'' limped in at a risible No.32 on the AFI list).
As for the Modern Library, two members of its selection panel,
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and William Styron, recently made acts of
literary contrition in, respectively, The Wall Street Journal and
The New Yorker. And The New York Times reports that the Modern
Library, knowing a publicity gold mine when it stumbles into one,
is gearing up a nonfiction list.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with cultural list making is its inherent
misguidedness (isn't a work of art's uniqueness one of the things
that make it a work of art?) but that fact makes lists no less
diverting to argue over or, when they're done better than the AFI
and Modern Library's were, even get some artistic bearings from. In
fact, what's most intriguing about the two lists in question is
that with less they could have been a great deal more: If only it
had occurred to someone to combine them! This idea isn't as crazy
as it might sound. Even the AFI couldn't keep Orson Welles's
``Citizen Kane'' from taking first place on its list, but it did
manage to overlook Welles's next film, ``The Magnificent
Ambersons,'' a work that in its depth of humanity and emotion is
``Kane'''s superior. The omission of ``Ambersons'' may well be the
AFI list's single most glaring sin (well, that or leaving out
Howard Hawks's ``Red River''). Yet the single oddest selection by
the Modern Library is _ what else? _ ``The Magnificent Ambersons,''
just making the cut at No.100, the otherwise-forgotten Booth
Tarkington novel on which Welles based his film. The right title
was on the wrong list.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the two lists could have come to each other's
rescue through complementing each other. The leading complaint
about the AFI was its slighting of older films (``Forrest Gump''
and ``Fargo'' but not ``The Lady Eve'' or ``Top Hat''?). The
leading criticism of the Modern Library was its being top-heavy
with pre-1945 novels (John O'Hara's ``Appointment in Samarra'' and
Erskine Caldwell's ``Tobacco Road'' but not Evelyn Waugh's ``Sword
of Honour'' or Thomas Pynchon's ``Gravity's Rainbow''?).
</P>
<P>
   As this century's foremost vehicles for narrative expression,
movies and novels share a common storytelling bond, and the degree
of cross-fertilization between the AFI and Modern Library lists is
considerable. Thirty-eight of the AFI-cited films are derived from
novels _ and six of them are in the Modern Library 100: Anthony
Burgess's ``A Clockwork Orange,'' Dashiell Hammett's ``The Maltese
Falcon,'' James Jones's ``From Here to Eternity,'' John Steinbeck's
``The Grapes of Wrath,'' ``Apocalypse Now'' (based on Joseph
Conrad's ``Heart of Darkness''), and ``A Place in the Sun'' (based
on Theodore Dreiser's ``An American Tragedy'').
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Modern Library list can seem at times like a
Merchant-Ivory prospectus. From it have come at least 57 feature
films, as well as nine television movies or miniseries and one
full-length cartoon (of George Orwell's ``Animal Farm'').
Furthermore, of the 73 novelists on the list, no fewer than 16
tried their hand at screenwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikeliest is Vladimir Nabokov, commissioned by director
Stanley Kubrick to adapt his own ``Lolita'' (No.5 on the Modern
Library list). Nabokov turned in an epic scenario of 400 pages _
the rule of thumb for screenwriters is one page equals one minute
of screen time _ which Kubrick then politely ignored, though it's
Nabokov who's credited with the script. That credit earned him an
Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay. Twelve years
later he had the final word, publishing the script as a book.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess also ran afoul of Kubrick. Besides the director's
adaptation of ``A Clockwork Orange,'' the two collaborated on a
script about Napoleon that never went into production.
</P>
<P>
   Both F. Scott Fitzgerald and Aldous Huxley were contract writers
at MGM in the late '30s and early '40s. As a Warner Bros. contract
writer, William Faulkner got to adapt the work of a fellow Top 100
novelist, Ernest Hemingway (``To Have and Have Not''), and
collaborated on what is surely the best screen adaptation by anyone
on the list, ``The Big Sleep.'' (Raymond Chandler's novel is not on
the Modern Library list. Far less excusable is the absence of
Howard Hawks's film from its AFI counterpart.) As for Hemingway, he
wrote the screenplay for a 1937 documentary, ``The Spanish Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Any prize for best original screenplay by a Modern Library
author belongs to Graham Greene for ``The Third Man'' (No.57 on the
AFI list). A close second would be Thornton Wilder, who wrote
``Shadow of a Doubt'' for Alfred Hitchcock in 1942. Two years
later, Hitchcock drew on the services of John Steinbeck for
``Lifeboat.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer's screenwriting experience led to his novel ``The
Deer Park.'' That didn't make the list (``The Naked and the Dead''
did), but there is one Hollywood novel cited by the Modern Library:
Nathanael West's ``The Day of the Locust'' (No.73). West was a
contract writer at RKO in the '30s. As for Richard Wright, he not
only adapted but played the lead in the 1950 screen version of
``Native Son'' (No.20 on the Modern Library list).
</P>
<P>
   Other Modern Library Top 100 members who dabbled at the screen
trade include Hammett, O'Hara, Joseph Heller, James M. Cain,
William Kennedy, and John Fowles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Ambersons,'' there are at least eight novels that
would appear to have gotten on the Modern Library list by
piggybacking on the reputation of their movie versions: ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``From Here to
Eternity,'' all of which are on the AFI list, and Robert Penn
Warren's ``All the King's Men'' (winner of the best picture Oscar
in 1949), Cain's ``The Postman Always Rings Twice'' (there have
been three film adapatations), Muriel Spark's ``The Prime of Miss
Jean Brodie'' (Maggie Smith's performance in the title role won her
the best actress Oscar in 1969), E.M. Forster's ``A Room With a
View,'' and James Dickey's ``Deliverance'' There's also Robert
Graves's ``I, Claudius,'' which surely owes its place at No.14 to
the superb BBC miniseries that ran on PBS 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it's a sad commentary on the cultural standing of
the novel that, at most, only one movie could be said to have
gotten on the AFI list because of its literary cachet, William
Wyler's 1939 adaptation of Emily Bronte's ``Wuthering Heights.''
Even then, parsing its selection is more problematic than with the
movie-aided novels: It's hard to dismiss the merits of the film
that Laurence Olivier, who plays Heathcliff, credited with teaching
him how to be a movie actor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's long been a truism that trashy novels make for
better movies than serious novels do. What the former excel at,
plot and energy, play to the movies' strengths; and what they don't
do well, prose style and characterization, either never make it to
the screen or the power of the image more than compensates for.
With a great novel, so much has to get left out when a film version
is made that the result is almost always a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   By no means is this a statistically accurate sampling, but the
justified obscurity of the film adaptations of the top three Modern
Library titles _ James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' (No.1) and ``A Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man'' (No.3), and Fitzgerald's ``The Great
Gatsby'' (No.2) _ certainly bear this out. By contrast, the
top-ranking novel adaptation on the AFI list, ``The Godfather''
(No.3), comes from a book that one can safely assume was never
considered by the Modern Library.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the mystery of art that trash of one sort can be
transformed into genius of another, and vice versa. Oblivious to
that mystery, the AFI and Modern Library lists have more than their
share of vice, but they sure don't have any versa.

`SUB DOWN' A CLUNKER; SAYLES'S `GUNS' ON TARGET

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Sub Down''  &LR; _ Way down. Alec Baldwin stars in
this clunker that drowns in techno-babble. This story of a nuclear
sub stuck in the Arctic originally aired on the USA network.
Directed by Alan Smithee (which means that the actual director was
so embarassed by the film he or she requested his or her name be
removed from the credits), it's a sinker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Men With Guns''  &LR; _ Writer-director John Sayles continues to
cut his way through the cinematic landscape with this story of
innocent Latin Americans caught in a violent political cross-fire.
While Sayles's films remain politically sophisticated, his
characters have become much more complex over his 30-year career.
And this is one of his best.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Four Little Girls'' &LR;  _ Spike Lee's documentary on the four
young girls who were murdered in the Baptist church bombing in
Alabama on Sept. 15, 1963, is a moving story that gives complexity
and life to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``North Shore Fish'' &LR;  _ This TV adaptation of Israel Horovitz's
Gloucester-based play loses its local flavor in the translation.
Aside from a fine performance from Mercedes Ruehl, it looks as if
everyone was in a hurry to finish when they should have been slowly
searching for nuances. Tony Danza, in the leading role, seems
utterly unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World''  &LR; _ This
direct-to-video sequel to ``Pocahontas'' has some amusing moments
as Pocahontas searches for love.

the words ``consumer opinion.'' You will find dozens of sites built
by ordinary people who want to denounce _ or occasionally praise _
a particular product. For fast food-phobics, there is the ``I Hate
McDonald's'' page. An angry airline passenger offers the ``Untied
Airlines'' page _ targeted at United Airlines. The boycott against
the Walt Disney Co.'s ``anti-Christian'' policies is backed by a
number of sites, while others support the company. And this does
not count another popular Internet service _ the Usenet, a system
of public bulletin boards or ``newsgroups'' devoted to thousands of
different topics. Usenet visitors routinely post messages slamming
companies that have left them unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the best-known consumer watchdog in cyberspace keeps
his eye on the &UR;  &LR; Internet's most powerful company, &UR;  &LR;  America Online.
</P>
<P>
   David Cassel, a 34-year-old freelance writer in Berkeley,
Calif., was amusing himself in an AOL chat room in 1994, when a
fellow chatter used a four-letter word. Shortly thereafter, the
offending chatter was electronically silenced by AOL.
</P>
<P>
   That casual act of censorship turned Cassel from an on-line
neophyte to a crusading avenger dedicated to exposing the evil of
AOL and all its works. He started AOL Watch, a Web site which,
according to Cassel, gets as many as 1,000 visitors a day. He also
claims 32,000 people receive regular AOL Watch newsletters via
electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that when Cassel speaks, people listen. He
reported last year that AOL planned to sell the phone numbers of
its 12 million users to outside firms for marketing purposes. The
story made headlines nationwide and forced the company to abandon
the plan. ``Who knows how much money they would have made off
that,'' Cassel said, ``and who knows how many people would have
suffered?''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of David Cassel has not been lost on corporations,
which is good news for James Alexander. The former television
production worker runs eWatch, a New York firm that keeps track of
what Internet users say about various businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Over 600 firms have employed eWatch. The company uses ``software
agents,'' software that automatically scans thousands of Web pages
and Usenet newsgroups in search of words and phrases related to the
client companies. All relevant material is then examined by
editors, who write up a daily report for the client.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not attempt to contact disgruntled consumers.
``We're just a listening post,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the gripes are actually planted by cunning
investors hoping to spread false information to depress the value
of a company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But when customers complain about real problems, eWatch reports
can provide client companies early warning about product
shortcomings that need fixing. Said Alexander: ``We are improving
customer service, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But most of the credit goes to angry consumers who
have begun using the Internet to broadcast their gripes.

YOUNG WIDOW NEEDS HELP WITH FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a recently (and very suddenly) widowed 34-year-old
woman, and I am pregnant with our first child. I am about to
receive a $500,000 life insurance payoff, and need help investing
it wisely. I have $32,000 in IRAs invested in mutual funds, plus
$60,000 in a taxable mutual fund account, plus $15,000 bank
savings. When the baby is born I will receive $700 a month in
Social Security benefits. I need $4,000 a month to pay the mortgage
and other bills.
</P>
<P>
   S.C., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Please accept my consolations for your loss. But at least you
should be able to develop a portfolio that will minimize financial
worries.
</P>
<P>
   If you consider your monthly requirement of $3,300 relative to
the insurance settlement, you would need a 7.92 percent return on
your portfolio to supply the cash without invading the principal.
In today's market, that's a pretty steep target. But if you add in
the $60,000 that's now in a taxable mutual fund, the required yield
falls to 7.07 percent, which is a more workable number.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you build a yield-oriented portfolio similar to what I
frequently suggest for retirees _ one dominated by Ginnie Mae
holdings, which will yield about 6.5 percent in the current market,
but with additional holdings at the further ends of the risk
spectrum: short-term bonds at the most conservative, and high-yield
(or junk) bonds at the most aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, if you put half of this money in a Ginnie Mae
fund, you could expect a yield of about 6.5 percent, bringing in
$18,200 a year. A 25 percent position in a short-term bond fund
would yield you about 5.8 percent in the current market, adding a
further $8,120. And a junk bond fund would yield you 8.4 percent,
bringing in $11,700 _ bringing you up to a total of $38,020 _
pretty close to the $39,600 you feel you need.
</P>
<P>
   If it's important that you not invade the principal, you might
tweak the formula a bit, putting a third into the junk bond fund
and only a sixth into short-term bonds. This would bring the
combined yield up to $40,292.
</P>
<P>
   There are two potential problems with this approach.
</P>
<P>
   First, since you would be drawing all of the yield, you could
not expect any growth in principal. That means you would be prey to
the effects of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a portfolio such as I have outlined tends to work well
over the long haul, but it also can be quite volatile over the
short haul. Therefore, if you expect that you are likely to need
more in emergency savings than the $15,000 you listed, you should
hold such an amount aside.
</P>
<P>
   The returns on a bond fund can be wrecked if you get into
circumstances that require a sale of shares at a time that
coincides with one of the periodic droops in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   This you should put no more into such a portfolio than you are
confident will remain there for a decade, and preferably longer.
</P>
<P>
   Most fund families offer funds in all of the categories I
suggested, but you should limit your research to those that charge
no sales loads _ fund families such as Fidelity and Vanguard, to
cite the largest. This isn't because I am dead set against load
funds in general, but because I am against them when it comes to
fixed-income funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to take the more cautious route I outlined above,
you'd might pay a sales charge of 4 percent _ and that would
represent more than half of the first year's anticipated yield.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't feel qualified to select funds, I suggest you seek
out a financial adviser, insisting that you will pay only a
one-time flat fee, and that the selection be limited to no-load
funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have $35,000. I'm 56 years old and want to retire soon.
Where can I put the money to keep it multiplying quickly and
safely?
</P>
<P>
   G.C., Massena, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, we have to start with the basic reality, which is this:
The greater the potential for quick growth in an investment, the
less safe the investment will be. But a second rule is this: The
longer your investment time frame is, the higher the risk you
should be willing to assume.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to retire within five years, and if you
expect to use the income this money can produce to augment other
funds in retirement, this is short-term money. It shouldn't be in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than seek high principal growth, you might instead
choose a more conservative path _ investing it now in the kind of
vehicle you'll be using once you actually retire.
</P>
<P>
   Although her situation is different from yours, you might adopt
a portfolio such as the one suggested for S.C. in the letter above
_ mostly GNMA funds, balanced at opposite ends of the risk spectrum
by short-term and high-yield bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to put your money in a portfolio such as this and
let it grow for five years, reinvesting all returns, the account
would reach $49,089 after 60 months, based on a projected 7 percent
return.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't expect to retire that soon, or if you believe you
can let this pool of money grow beyond your retirement date, you
might want to consider something a bit more aggressive, such as a
balanced fund. These are funds that divide their investments
between the stock and bond markets, typically with about 60 percent
of the portfolio in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Good examples are Vanguard Balanced Index fund and Fidelity
Puritan. But remember, in exchange for a higher potential for gain
there's also a higher risk of losses, and such investments would be
appropriate only if you are willing to leave the money alone for
eight to 10 years.

CONSUMERS HIT THE INTERNET FOR BARGAINS

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Vigneau knew exactly what he wanted: a 1998 Volkswagen
Passat with a V-6 engine, silver paint, and black leather interior.
It's a &UR;  &LR;  vehicle that is &UR;  &LR;  hard to find on this side of the
Atlantic. But the Massachusetts software consultant knew exactly
where to look &UR;  &LR; _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Using his laptop computer, Vigneau discovered how much a car
dealer pays the factory for a new Passat; the information is
available at no charge on line. He also read on-line auto magazines
and messages from Volkswagen owners in Europe to get opinions on
the car. And he began e-mailing Volkswagen dealers in search of the
best price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pounding the pavement, Vigneau did nearly all his
research while sitting at a keyboard. He ended up paying $1,000
below sticker price for a hard-to-get car. ``By having the amount
of information that I did, from car review sites, to people's
personal experiences ... I knew enough so I wouldn't be taken for a
ride,'' Vigneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with streams of product information available on the
Internet, Vigneau and millions of other on-line consumers are
rewriting the rules of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of electronic shopping, information is power.
Businesses, consumer groups, and individuals publish vast amounts
of data about thousands of products _ data that shoppers can obtain
at the click of a mouse. Information that was once the private
possession of industry insiders is at the fingertips of any
consumer who cares to look. The results include better deals,
greater convenience, and retailers scurrying to preserve their
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have always benefited from the ignorance of their
customers. Sellers can pad their earnings by concealing the true
cost of goods they sell. They can withhold information about the
quality of merchandise. And sellers can count on the consumer's
limited patience, his unwillingness to visit one more store or buy
one more consumer-education magazine. But Internet shoppers can
overcome these barriers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research &UR;  &LR; Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., 5
percent of North American households bought something on line last
year, spending $2.4 billion. The number of on-line shoppers is
expected to double this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dollars spent on line only hint at the importance of
Internet shopping. The surge of Internet shoppers is turning
retailing upside down. For example, Portland, Ore.-based Egghead
Inc. stunned the retail world in February when it closed its 40
stores. The company changed its name to Egghead.com Inc. and began
selling products exclusively over the Internet or by telephone
order.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers will not go away
entirely. Consider Joseph Vigneau and his new Volkswagen Passat.
While he shopped for his car on the Internet, he actually made the
purchase at a traditional auto dealer. With products like cars,
many consumers still will want to see and test the wares.
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers still are finding money-saving information on line.
In order to attract visitors to their retail Web sites, companies
like bookseller Amazon.com or travel agents like
Travelocity &UR;  &LR; publish huge amounts of information that is free to
all visitors, even if they don't make a purchase. In addition,
Internet access services like America Online or Yahoo provide free
consumer information to boost the number of visitors to their
advertiser-supported Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers have been among the first to feel the effects of
Internet shopping. Detailed information about cars is plentiful on
the World Wide Web. For example, Edmund Publications Corp. of
Beverly Hills, Calif., publishes its new- and used-car guides on
the Web with prices, product reviews, and comments from car owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resist the enlightened consumer, many car dealers
are joining organizations like Autobytel.com Inc., an on-line
buying system that helps direct customers to nearby &UR;  &LR;  dealerships
that have exactly the car they want.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the Autobytel site can type in exactly the car he
wants, starting with a base model and adding options. The system
provides the invoice price _ the cost of the car to the dealer _
and shows the consumer how to calculate additional factors like
destination charges and rebates. A visitor can get similar
information for hundreds of new and used cars. Once he makes a
choice, the buyer can type in his contact information and request a
bid from the nearest car dealer in the Autobytel network.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel president Mark Lorimer says that it is a good deal for
the seller as well as the buyer, because the system automates so
much of the selling process. Lorimer says it costs a dealer about
$1,260 to sell the average new car. Selling through Autobytel
lowers that cost to around $400. That means more savings for
consumers and higher profits for dealers. Lorimer estimates that
the nation's 2,700 Autobytel dealers sell between 20,000 and 25,000
cars a month using the on-line approach.
</P>
<P>
   But some auto dealers find they don't have to share their
profits with a firm like Autobytel in order to reach customers on
the Internet. Smith Volkswagen in East Providence, R.I., where
Vigneau bought his Passat, created its own Web site. And it's
working. The company gets 100 to 200 e-mail inquiries a day from
Web shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get Thailand, places in North Africa, Western Europe, South
America, pretty much everywhere,'' said Smith salesman Phil Teves.
The dealership gets so many long-distance queries because of its
reputation for being able to acquire hard-to-get models like the
silver Passat. Teves said 20 to 50 percent of the dealership's
monthly new-car sales come from Internet shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most visitors to retail Web sites buy nothing. But
many of them collect information &UR;  &LR;  for use at stores in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, the
electronic bookstore that is probably the Internet's best-known
retailer. ``One of the pieces of feedback we get is that for some
people, they find the book they want to buy, or the CD, and they
print it out on a sheet of paper and take it to the clerk'' at a
store, Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors write and apologize for not buying from Amazon.
Said Bezos, ``We send them back mail saying, `Don't worry about
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Amazon.com spent millions on its huge database of
books and music recordings to attract paying customers from around
the world. But it costs the company nothing extra when visitors
just browse. Those browsers could turn into buyers one day.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and organizations are jumping into the market for
on-line consumer information. Consumer Reports magazine has rolled
out a Web site that aims to build on the magazine's reputation for
reliable, honest product reviews. In keeping with the Consumer
Reports tradition, there is not a trace of advertising. That means
visitors must pay for the service, but the price is just $2.95 a
month or $24 a year. Thomas Falconer, manager of the site, said
140,000 people have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   There are also for-profit consumer information services on the
Internet, which support themselves through advertising. The most
interesting of these feature ``shopbots'' _ software that lets a
visitor search for a product at several Internet retailers. A
number of these shopbots are available through the major Internet
gateways &UR;  &LR;  _ sites like Yahoo or Lycos _ visited daily by millions
of users.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo search service has a section devoted to on-line
shopping. Visitors can locate hundreds of sources for a variety of
consumer goods, and compare prices and features. For instance, a
visitor looking for a computer priced between $1,000 and $2,000
gets 365 suggestions culled from several on-line electronics shops.
The user can order the products over the 'Net, or use the
information as a guide when shopping in a store.
</P>
<P>
   The Compare.Net service takes this concept even further. The
site includes product reviews, side-by-side comparisons, and links
to Usenet message boards where consumers discuss their experiences
with similar products.
</P>
<P>
   This last feature is one of the most significant changes the
Internet has brought to retailing. Until now, consumer
word-of-mouth usually traveled as far as the back fence or the
office water cooler. Today, many turn to the Usenet, a set of
thousands of electronic bulletin boards or ``newsgroups.'' There
are a couple of newsgroups for general consumer issues, but many
more that focus on specialized interests like cars, computers, home
electronics, and other topics. And people are not shy about
relating their experiences with the products they buy.
</P>
<P>
   David Dologite, 25, a Boston project manager, routinely visits
the Usenet before making major purchases, to see how others have
fared. ``I've found the newsgroups to be useful in getting a sense
of what the customer service is like for various companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The DejaNews search service maintains an archive of old Usenet
messages that can easily be searched using key words, such as the
name of a particular product.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers sign on to the Internet in search of
bargain-basement prices. Indeed, Amazon.com and other Internet
retailers have used the lure of sharply discounted prices to draw
customers. But on the whole, it is not clear that goods purchased
on line are much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   While much is made of cut-rate book prices, the discounts are
sharply reduced when shipping costs are added. And travelers
searching for cheap air fares can find them just as readily with a
phone call as they can on the Internet. &UR;  &LR; Many other products on the
Internet _ computers for instance _ cost about the same as at a
discount electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   But for many consumers, finding exactly the right product _ say,
a silver Volkswagen with black leather interior _ is more important
than getting the lowest price. For these people, the Internet is on
its way to becoming the first place to look.

FOR PATRIOTS RUNNING GAME, PAIN, FEW GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ When the Patriots wisely decided they couldn't
afford to match the New York Jets' $36 million offer to running
back Curtis Martin last winter they kept saying ``you can always
find a running back.''
</P>
<P>
   What they forgot to mention is that doesn't mean you can always
find a running game.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks to go before the regular season opens in Denver,
that search continues with barely a hint that there is any such
thing in Foxborough. Not since the pre-Martin days of Marion Butts
have the Patriots struggled as much to move the ball on the ground
as they have this summer and to say it is a concern would be to
understate the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much there, was there?'' Patriots coach Pete
Carroll conceded after his team needed 42 carries to produce 120
yards on the ground Saturday night against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sedrick (Shaw) made some plays for us and was trying to pound
it up in there for us. He was playing his heart out, but we wish we
knew a lot more about Robert (Edwards). Obviously, we're not there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Edwards's case he hasn't been there at all. The No. 1 draft
choice would have been noticed more often in Smithfield, R.I., if
he'd been in the witness protection program. A nagging groin injury
has limited him to six carries, all in the exhibition opener
against the 49ers. Since then Edwards has worn an assortment of
bandages and occasionally tried to practice, seldom lasting long.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, as the Redskins game approached, Carroll said it
would be Robert Edwards Week, but one aborted effort at practice
ended Robert Edwards Week with six days to go, which brings him to
Saturday's game with the Eagles. That final exhibition is supposed
to be Robert Edwards Night, a week perhaps being too much to ask of
him for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Fact of the matter is, if Edwards can come in and show some
signs that he can run the ball at a clip better than the present
2.8 yards a carry the team is averaging, no one will care what he
did the rest of the week. But there is an eerily familiar quality
to things this summer in Foxborough, both for Edwards and the
Patriots, and it is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   The former Georgia running back spent much of his college career
the way he has this summer ... in street clothes. One injury after
another (ankle, shoulder, knee, what else is left?) slowed him when
he was with the Bulldogs, although in those moments when they got
to hand him the ball he reminded many of Herschel Walker, which in
Georgia is quite a comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is in the pros and the pattern has been the same and
anyone who is honest with himself has to wonder if this is just the
way it's going to be. If that's the case, it means no one is going
to forget Martin any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Without Edwards, the Runners Shaw (Sedrick and Harold) have
carried the bulk of the load and frankly they haven't carried it
very far. Sedrick has rushed 52 times for 156 yards, averaging 3
yards a carry. He has run hard, without question. He just hasn't
run far.
</P>
<P>
   Harold, meanwhile, has carried 51 times for 131 yards, a
2.6-yard average. To refresh a memory Patriot fans rather would
forget, in the last year before Martin arrived Butts averaged 2.9
yards a carry and was run out of town on a rail.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Patriots organization have insisted that as long as
the running back position produces 1,200 yards all will be well.
Those people are wrong because with Butts in 1994 the Patriots
rushed for 1,332 yards and suffered dearly for their inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   Martin arrived the next season and ran for 1,487 yards and 15
touchdowns and averaged 4 yards a carry. In 1996, he ran for 1,152
yards, scored 14 touchdowns, and averaged 3.6 yards a carry. Last
season, an injury-plagued Martin produced 1,160 yards and averaged
4.2 yards a rush. What you need to understand is that the
difference between 2.8 yards and 4.2 yards is more than 1.4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It is the difference between making the playoffs and not making
the playoffs. It is the difference between keeping your quarterback
in one piece and having him throw so much he goes down under an
avalanche of pass rushers and gets up a different guy.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the post-Curtis Martin Era.
</P>
<P>
   Without Edwards, the running game has produced 375 yards on 134
carries this summer, an average of 2.8 yards a carry. Some
apologists for what has been going on have argued that the problems
have been primarily ones of blocking schemes and efforts to try an
assortment of things and an emphasis on getting the passing game
down first, but no one can dispute what the Patriots tried to do
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although Drew Bledsoe threw better than he had all season, the
Patriots tried to run the ball and they gained 120 yards on the
ground, which is the kind of number that can fool you.
</P>
<P>
   Taken at face value one could conclude the running game was
working with a number like that, but the fact is it took 42 tries
to gain that yardage. That's like saying you scored 20 points in a
basketball game without pointing out you needed 40 shots to do it.
That's too many tries for too little production.
</P>
<P>
   The last two games the talk has been that the running game was
improving, yet the facts are against Dallas the Patriots averaged
2.8 yards a carry on 36 runs and Saturday night it was 2.9 on 42.
Does the name Marion Butts ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot in all of this is that the Runners Shaw have
produced few of the negative yards Martin used to in his search for
longer gains. They have, almost without fail, managed to go forward
with the ball when handed it. If they could go, say, 2 yards
farther with it on average they'd be stars and the Patriots'
offense would have nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't and it is time to figure out why. Saturday
night it appeared the offensive line had supplied its backs with
several opportunities to break some long gains but they never got
through the hole. They got to the hole and got the minimum the play
should have produced but little more. Leonard Russell used to be
the master of that when he was running here. It's why he's not
running anywhere any more.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Edwards will change all that. Maybe he has the extra step
to get through those holes before they close. Maybe he has the
elusiveness to make tacklers miss, which the Runners Shaw
apparently do not, and the power to run over them if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps filling this hole will be as simple as getting Edwards
healthy, because those few who actually have seen him run when he's
healthy claim there's a distinct difference between him and New
England's other backs. Unfortunately, up to now the only difference
has been the other backs have been playing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the regular season opener only 14 days away, even the
ultimate optimist had to concede that the time has grown too short
for short runs and absent runners any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've said this before, but Robert's got to play this
week,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, let's hope he reminds you of Curtis Martin and not
Marion Butts.

WHY DO VOLCANOES ERUPT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do volcanoes erupt?
</P>
<P>
   L.W., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two kinds of volcanic eruptions: the ones that
peacefully go ``blurp'' and the ones that explosively go ``blam.''
First, an explanation of the quiet kind.
</P>
<P>
   Miles below Earth's surface, conditions are hot enough to get
rocks moving, however slowly _ in most places, less than an inch a
year. But down in the 1,700-mile-thick mantle layer, things are
definitely not standing still.
</P>
<P>
   The mantle rock is solid. Immense pressures from the weight of
the rock overhead keep everything from melting, the way pressure
keeps hot water from boiling and turning into steam.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Grove, a volcanologist at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, says hotter chunks of rock move upward. As they rise,
there is less and less rock overhead, and the pressure decreases.
When it becomes low enough, the rocks can finally melt into what is
called magma.
</P>
<P>
   Like oil in water, magma is less dense than the solid rock
surrounding it, so it starts to float to the surface. There aren't
any cracks down in the mantle, so it must travel along the
microscopic edges of the grains of minerals in the mantle rock,
kind of like water rising through a tightly-packed sponge.
</P>
<P>
   When it nears the Earth's surface, or crust (which is about 20
miles thick,) the magma pushes up and through cracks, oozing onto
the surface, where we call it lava. The result is the quieter
volcanic eruption, the kind often produced by undersea volcanoes,
which account for about 80 percent of the 200 or so volcanos
erupting on the Earth every day. It's how Kilauea and Mauna Loa
erupt in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another way that magma forms, Grove explains, which
explains why some volcanoes ooze and some explode.
</P>
<P>
   Earth's surface contains two kinds of crust: Continental crust
is the land that we live on, and oceanic crust is the seafloor. The
crust is broken into huge sections, called tectonic plates, that
are moving around. In some places, where the edge of the oceanic
crust hits the edge of the continental crust straight-on, it dives
under the continental crust, which is made of lighter rocks.
</P>
<P>
   As the oceanic crust moves deep into the mantle, it takes water
with it, embedded in the molecules of the rock. In the mantle, the
tremendous heat and pressure change the molecular structure of the
crust, which releases the water. It rises into the solid mantle
rock, lowering its melting temperature and causing the rock to
melt. Now, molten and less dense than the solid rock around it, the
magma starts to rise.
</P>
<P>
   But this type of magma is carrying molecules of water. At first,
the water molecules don't turn to vapor because of the pressure
they're under. But when the magma/water mix penetrates the crust
and nears the surface, the pressure is reduced. That lets the water
evaporate into steam bubbles, like the bubbles of gas in a soda
bottle that you don't see until you relieve the pressure by
removing the cap.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more gas is released from the magma, the pressure
underground builds; it's like shaking a bottle of soda with the cap
still on. Finally the pressure underground becomes greater than the
rocks can hold back, and KABOOM; You get a violent eruption with
huge clouds of ash and flying chunks of rock.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't these eruptions glow the way lava rivers do? The rocks
and ash are certainly hot, between 1,800 and 2,000 degrees
Fahrenheit. But because that material mixes with water and air as
it spews out, it's cooler than the red rivers of lava that pour out
of non-explosive volcanoes. Those flows glow because they're even
hotter, around 2,500 degrees.

EARTH'S CAVES MAY YIELD CLUES TO MARS LIFE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Some scientists hope to learn about the
possibility of life on Mars by studying a Martian meteorite; some
concentrate on plans for robotic missions to search for life on the
red planet itself.
</P>
<P>
   But biologist Penny Boston and others have been looking down
below to learn what's up above. They have been researching the
possibility of Martian life by crawling through the dank, slimy
passageways of caverns deep below the deserts of New Mexico and the
jungles of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It's gruelling work. Boston and her colleagues had to learn to
be spelunkers and technical climbers in order to explore some of
the most inhospitable cave environments known _ which may resemble
environments that could exist on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   In week-long treks through Lechuguilla Cave in Carlsbad, N.M, _
the deepest cave known in the United States _ Boston at times had
to inch along on her belly through passages that were far too small
even to crawl through. She was covered with slime and filth from
the microbes that coated the walls and floors of the cave, and
sweating profusely in the 100 percent humidity. She encountered
chambers where sulfuric acid dripped from above, concentrated
enough to cause severe skin burns. In a cave in Mexico called Villa
Luz, she contracted a severe eye infection from bacteria growing on
the wall, and had a close escape when the cave suddenly filled with
potentially lethal carbon monoxide gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's so much fun!'' she declares without a trace of irony.
The danger and the conditions, she says, are more than compensated
for by the beauty of underground chambers decorated by spectacular
crystalline formations and colorful deposits, and by the thrill of
discovery. ``I love this cave,'' she says of Lechuguilla. ``It
really is like being on another planet... There are places under
there that just bring tears to your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   What Boston and other cave researchers have discovered
underground is a host of previously unknown microbial species and
ecosystems that may play a vital role in humanity's quest to learn
about the possibility of life on Mars _ and, in the process, add to
the knowledge about life's origins and evolution on Earth. There
may possibly be tangible earthly benefits as well, including new
disease-fighting agents.
</P>
<P>
   Most biologists say the surface of Mars, bathed in lethal
ultraviolet radiation from the sun and with air thinner than in
most vacuum chambers on Earth, couldn't possibly support any kind
of life as we know it. But what about beneath the surface?
</P>
<P>
   Boston, who is scientific director of a Boulder-based company
called Complex Systems Research, said it was only after years of
studying the possibility of Martian life that she thought about
seeking life inside caves. ``Where you have a surface, you also
have a subsurface, and it may be very different,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Mars, that difference might be crucial: Under the surface,
creatures might find a habitat protected from radiation, meteorite
impacts, and freezing cold, and perhaps blessed with liquid water
that cannot exist on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think, as Boston did before she began her research,
that caves are relatively rare formations, and therefore not likely
to be found on other worlds or play a significant role in
supporting life there. Not so. On Earth, Boston said, caves are
ubiquitous, formed through a variety of processes _ most of which
almost certainly could have taken place on Mars as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to predict exactly what we may find someday on Mars,
she said, except that ``there will be cavities, and they will have
contents. And there may well be remnants of life, remnant
populations of microorganisms.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 percent of caves on Earth _ some estimate as many as
95 percent _ have no natural openings, and the vast majority remain
undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   Lechuguilla was one of these. A pit leading to its opening had
been blocked by a rockfall, sealing off its intricate labyrinth of
passageways from the outside _ possibly for millions of years. It
was not until 1986 that a group of explorers broke through the
rubble and entered the pristine cave for the first time. Since
then, they have mapped 95 miles of passageways _ and a comparable
amount may still remain unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Though they weren't obvious at first, the explorers found living
organisms _ none larger than microbes _ thriving in this
sealed-off, totally dark environment. Biologists have been
struggling ever since to figure out exactly where they came from
and what keeps them alive, in the absence of any trace of the
photosynthesis that lies at the base of all food chains on Earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is that allows these microscopic creatures to make a
living deep below the surface, they are likely to be among the very
few organisms on Earth that would be capable of living on Mars
today, despite that planet's harsh conditions. They are a perfect
test case for learning how to detect signs of life on our sister
planet.
</P>
<P>
   And geologists have been startled to learn, just in the last few
years, just how crucial microbial life can be in a variety of
geological processes, changing the shapes and even the mineralogy
of many formations that had been thought to have formed by chemical
reactions. Learning to recognize geological formations that can
form only in the presence of life could end up providing key tools
for detecting the past presence of life on other worlds, including
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are odd cave formations that have long been
known by cavers but are only now being identified as products of
living microbes. Stalactite-like formations with a rubbery
consistency, called ``snottites'' by the colorful cave
afficionados, sometimes form loops and complex woven-looking shapes
hanging from the cave ceiling. Boston and her colleagues, including
Diana Northup of the University of New Mexico, have found that
these formations contain rich communities of bacteria _ and
probably would never form without them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, beautiful arrays of ``cave pearls'' grow on many cave
floors. Like real pearls, these perfect spheres build up one layer
at a time as they naturally rotate in place, in this case created
by the dripping of mineral-rich water from above. But why don't
they just form the more typical towering stalagmites growing up
from the floor?
</P>
<P>
   Boston thinks it's because they become coated with a microbial
slime, which acts as a lubricant and allows the pearls to rotate
each time a droplet strikes, instead of remaining fixed in place
and simply growing upward. To test the theory, she has sterilized
some of the still-growing pearls, to see if the microbe-free ones
begin to grow differently from their neighbors. It's a long-term
test, because the pearls grow very slowly; it may take years to be
able to detect the results.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other questions the biologists have yet to answer
is how living organisms got inside the caves in the first place.
While Lechuguilla is believed to have been almost completely sealed
off from the outside world for millions of years, there apparently
have been occasional openings that have allowed small animals to
crawl inside. Boston's group, for example, found the skeleton of a
civet cat that apparently curled up in a crevice and died in the
cave about 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how the microbes that thrive in the cave got
there, Boston said. DNA analysis of some of the microbes shows that
they are so distantly related to any known organisms on Earth that
they must have been isolated from other living things for millions
of years, evolving underground to adapt to their exotic
environment. Within the cave, she found, pools just a few hundred
feet apart contain entirely different arrays of living organisms,
with no more than 20 percent in common from one to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Boston thinks it's likely the original population of microbes
that spawned the ecosystems found today may predate the caves
themselves. Now that researchers have discovered living microbes
inside the bedrock in deeply-drilled holes, that suggests a seed
population of microbial life may exist virtually everywhere in the
Earth's crust. As soon as a cavity opens up in the rock, as a
result of water eating its way through or earthquakes or impacts
opening up fissures, these microbes may begin to grow and evolve to
take advantage of the new environment.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that different ponds inside a cave have different
chemical conditions and support different organisms also makes them
ripe for experiments that could be relevant to searching for life
on Mars: What is the minimum size of an ecosystem that can function
and survive for long periods? If, as many scientists now suspect,
life may have gotten started on Mars during a brief period of
warmer, wetter conditions soon after the planet's formation, could
some living organisms have survived in small, isolated
micro-environments such as underground lakes or caves?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deeper questions here that the cave will help to
elucidate,'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, it may become possible to study a truly sealed-off cave
in pristine conditions, without bringing anything in or out while
doing the research. But that's not possible with present
technology. The research teams take as many precautions as they can
to minimize their impact on the cave: staying on narrow marked
trails whenever possible, laying out mylar groundsheets under their
campsites, eating over plastic bags to catch any crumbs, and
carrying back out everything they bring in _ including bagged and
bottled human wastes.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't help bringing in some outside organisms _
complicating the task of analyzing the cave's native life. The work
they've been doing for the last 10 years, Boston said, ``is really
just practice for someday doing a completely non-invasive study of
a cave that's completely sealed.''

BILL CLINTON AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've learned a lot about President Clinton this past week. We
now know he did something ``inappropriate'' with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. We know he says he regrets it _ but has a
hard time saying ``I'm sorry.'' And we know his wife says she
forgives him. But what we don't know is: Why did he do it? What
compelled a smart man _ and Clinton is described as one of the
smartest presidents in history _ to risk all for a fling with a
former intern not much older than his daughter?
</P>
<P>
   Focus writer Matthew Brelis talked last week to psychiatrists
and psychologists in an attempt to get some insight into Clinton's
motivations. Here is what he found.

</P>
<P>
   Stanley Renshon, a professor of political science and a
psychoanalyst at the City University of New York. Renshon is the
author of ``High Hopes: The Clinton Presidency and the Politics of
Ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a man who throughout his life has never wanted to
be bound by ordinary conventions that you and I adhere to. He wants
what he wants, when he wants, and feels entitled to get it. ... And
he is very smart, very able. He not only has a history of doing
anything he wants, but of getting away with it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``His charm is really a manipulative charm. It makes use of and
uses people. ... When you know he lied, the thing that stands out
is when the news first broke there was a Cabinet meeting going on
and he sent Madeleine Albright, Donna Shalala out there and asked
them to make statements to the press. He sent them out knowing they
would say things that were not true. Did he care? No. What was most
important was Bill Clinton.''

this fall in Leadership Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``After a systematic analysis of biographical materials, I
concluded that President Clinton's personality was an amalgam of
`asserting' and `outgoing' patterns. ... He may commit errors of
judgment stemming from a combination of strong ambition, a sense of
entitlement, and inflated self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The asserting-outgoing personality is highly ambitious and
self-promoting, driven by a need to achieve fame and public
recognition. A distinctive feature of this personality composite is
an erotic orientation. For these personalities, sexual prowess
serves to enhance self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   These individuals may have an indifferent conscience and
aloofness to the truth, which, if brought to their attention, is
likely to elicit nonchalant innocence. ... Although they may leave
a trail of broken promises and outrageous acts, including sexual
excesses, their disregard for the truth and their talent for
exploitation and deception are rarely hostile or malicious in
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although their sexual indiscretions may be purely
opportunistic, one may hypothesize, on theoretical grounds, that
these episodes are correlated with periods of uncertainty, deflated
self-confidence, or crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   (Asked about Clinton's address to the nation Monday, in which
the president was, by some accounts, too defiant and sufficiently
apologetic:)
</P>
<P>
   ``When their confidence is shaken, the feigned tranquillity and
cool imperturbability of these personalities may briefly give way
to self-bolstering rage or remorseful shame. In the case of
President Clinton, this dynamic may account for the perplexing
disjuncture between remorse and shame on the one hand, and
self-righteous indignation on the other.''

   ``One reason may be the compartmentalization that Clinton has
often engaged in over time, and the fight he has for himself to
keep down spontaneity and impulsiveness that is himself. One
worries about this compartmentalization. ... The question is, can
you separate two lives? Can you behave as a very intellecutual,
empathetic president who enjoys thinking about policies and
initiatives, but be very constrained, with people watching you all
the time? When does the spontaneity that is the individual really
come out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we have seen this growing phenomenon in the male
community of people around his age, and I wonder if Bill Clinton is
representative of the phenomenon of the male in a midlife crisis.
... He is going to be through with the presidency with a lot of
life left, and maybe he was seeking youth and the trophy wives in
our society. As he said, `When I was 16 I acted like I was 40.' And
now, he is acting like he is 16.''

completely incapable of being clear and honest for fear of
reprobation or abandonment. It is an adaptive mechanism created to
survive a difficult set of circumstances.''

   ``There are two possibilities. One is they do it because of the
risk, in a mechanism that is called counter-phobic. If you are
afraid of heights, you take up sky-diving. There is a need to prove
to everyone and to one's self that they are not afraid. But in a
sexual situation, I don't think that applies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other possibility is that they are heedless of the risk
because they are following a compulsion. In cases like that, you
tend to see more than one piece of behavior. You see previous
behavior that is similar. And even if they got into trouble, they
continue to do it. The reason for the compulsion? You really need
to know the individual, and it is often the coming together of very
complex matters. I have seen this in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have compulsions who act in a certain way
to satisfy an internal need. But I would not want to take a stab at
determining what that need is unless I met the person. If someone
is aware of the risks, they might choose to ignore them, or, in one
way or another, convince themselves that they will not get caught.
But all of that is after the fact if you are dealing with some
internal compulsion. Whether Bill Clinton fits that picture or not,
I don't know.''

A FEED BAG TO FUEL THE FAMILY CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Someday soon, you might be filling up your car with fuel made
in part from from paper-mill sludge, oat hulls, and corn stalks,
thanks to a Princeton University researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Research on the environmental advantages of the new alternative
fuel, which the US Energy Department is considering endorsing for
general use as soon as next month, is expected to be one of the
marquee projects presented this week as 14,000 members of the
American Chemical Society hold their semiannual national meeting in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not snake oil,'' said Stephen F. Paul, a top Princeton
plasma physicist who also researches nuclear fusion. He often fills
up the tank of his own Ford Taurus with batches of fuel he makes
from agricultural trash.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that contains carbohydrates _ corn cobs, wood,
newsprint, vegetables, grass _ can be turned into a fuel additive
through a high-pressure process that uses sulfuric or other acids
to create a key hydrocarbon component of the fuel, which is called
MTHF, or or methyltetrahydrofuran.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate product also includes ethanol, a type of alcohol,
and natural gas in liquid form. Paul, who has licensed his patented
fuel to Manhattan-based Pure Energy Corp., a startup company formed
to develop ``engineered'' motor fuels and additives, believes the
product can be made for 60 to 90 cents a gallon wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   At current prices, which have been unusually low for several
years and are expected to stay low barring a Mideast catastrophe,
that represents a 5 to 60 percent premium over conventional
gasoline. The national wholesale weighted average price &UR;  &LR; this month
was calculated at 59.4 cents per gallon by the Lundberg Survey
industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Energy Department's assistant secretary for
energy efficiency and renewable energy, Dan Reicher, said: ``With
our nation's increasing reliance on imported oil, it is important
that we develop and use clean, domestically abundant, renewable
alternative fuels, such as the P-series fuels,'' which get their
name from their Princeton birthplace (and which might invite a
``put a Princeton Tiger in your tank'' ad tagline).
</P>
<P>
   Reicher estimated that ``P-series fuels have the potential to
displace approximately 1 billion gallons of gasoline by 2005'' _
out of the estimated 120 billion gallons used by the United States
in a typical year.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, the department formally proposed adding Paul's
patented fuel to the list of approved alternative fuels, which
currently includes ethanol, methanol, compressed natural gas,
propane, and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Under recent federal and state rules, owners of large fleets of
cars _ such as taxi companies, utilities, and government agencies _
are being required over the next five years to buy increasing
numbers of vehicles that can use alternatives to gasoline. Some
officials predict that by 1999, five million ``alt fuel'' cars,
trucks, and buses will have to be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Gallon for gallon, Paul's fuel is estimated to be 92 percent as
powerful as gasoline, an imperceptible difference to most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Research he has prepared for the Chemical Society meeting
indicates it produces 4 percent less carbon dioxide per mile
travelled, up to 50 percent less unburned hydrocarbon (a key
component of eye-and lung-irritating smog), 20 percent less carbon
monoxide, and dramatically less toxic benzene.
</P>
<P>
   And Paul asserts that those numbers understate his fuel's
potential for reducing production of carbon dioxide, which many
scientists contend will or is already causing global temperatures
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   On average, it takes about five barrels of petroleum to extract,
produce, and distribute four barrels of gasoline. By using less
fuel and reclaiming carbon dioxide from organic materials that
would otherwise waft into the air, Paul asserts, his fuel could
produce up to 50 percent less ``greenhouse gas'' than gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   While Paul uses corn and oat byproducts in his blend, a
Waltham-based company called Biofine has worked out a process to
produce the key MTHF additive from paper mill sludge, newspapers or
even municipal trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, it's the only technology that's a
commercially viable product that can produce'' the additive,
company president Stephen Fitzpatrick said last week.
</P>
<P>
   From the cellulose in a ton of paper, Fitzpatrick's process can
generate about a quarter-ton of the key component in P-series fuel,
the MTHF, which can also be used separately as an additive in
gasoline-ethanol mixes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fuel has a sort of medicinal smell before it burns,
and emits an odor like a generously poured whiskey sour before a
car's catalytic converter kicks in, Paul says once a car is
running, ``You can put your nose up against the tailpipe, and it
smells just like a teapot bubbling. You can't smell a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its advantages, Paul is the first to acknowledge:
``It isn't that wonderful. It costs too much. I can't make it cheap
enough.'' With gas prices dipping below $1 a gallon in many places,
Paul said it would be a hard sell to offer his fuel for perhaps
$1.50 at retail _ even if some environmentally-minded drivers might
accept the cost premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had another oil crunch or Saddam started acting up again
or we had a really cold winter and not enough fuel around, it
might'' gain a market, Paul said. But ``it's not the answer to
everybody's wishes, because it's not really solving a problem that
exists. Today, there's plenty of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pure Energy president Merrick Andlinger said earlier this
year that ``we expect to be cost-competitive with gasoline'' even
without using available &UR;  &LR; tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters think P-series might gain a foothold in Europe,
where steep taxes drive up the cost of gasoline to $3 or $4 a
gallon and ``green'' sentiment is stronger than in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Trask, a senior regulatory analyst with the American
Petroleum Institute, the main industry lobby, said his group was
``still reviewing'' the proposal to list Paul's fuel as a
recognized alternative fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, it opposes any special tax deals or the many
existing mandates on fleets to buy cars that run on alternatives to
gasoline. ``As long as alternative fuels compete on a level playing
field, they will find their appropriate place in the market,''
Trask said.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is that only vehicles with ``flexible fuel''
engines _ which have sensors that determine the fuel being
introduced and adjust the air-to-fuel ratio _ can burn P-series
fuel. Chrysler and Ford have begun to make these engines standard
equipment on some models, including the Dodge Caravan and Ford
Ranger pickup, and options on several other &UR;  &LR; models.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, an estimated 250,000 flexible-fuel
vehicles that can burn gasoline, ethanol, methanol, or mixes are
expected to hit the road, Energy Department officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical Market Reporter, an industry publication, cited
predictions by engineers earlier this year that Paul's fuel ``could
capture just 2 or 3 percent'' of the gasoline market ``and make a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The society's president, Paul H. L. Walter, a 1956 Massachusetts
Institute of Technology graduate who spent seven years as a
Du &UR;  &LR; Pont Corp. researcher before a 29-year career as a Skidmore
University chemistry professor, said that ``even I am overwhelmed''
by the range of the 6,700 papers being presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we've seen in our last decade and a
half is the movement of chemistry away from the core areas to
having a lot more of the work done at the boundaries of chemistry
and biology or chemistry and physics,'' said Walter, a former
president of the American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Paul's, papers scheduled to be presented included
research on ways to improve the colon-cancer-preventing potential
of wheat bran, implantation of nerve growth factors to repair brain
cells, and use of chemicals that give citrus fruit their bitter
aftertaste to fight cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other important papers scheduled to come out later this week
include research on transmission of carcinogens by expectant
mothers who smoke to their fetuses, an engineered dietary fat
substitute, and use of a protein in snake venom to fight breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is chemistry today, but it would not have been chemistry
when I was at MIT,'' Walter said in an interview. ``What's happened
in the last decade or so has been a vast improvement in diagnostic
technology that's allowing us to solve problems we used to not even
know existed. We're able to do things we were never able to do
before.''

DESPITE NEW MEDICAL TOOLS, DIABETES RATES ARE SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 12-year-old Jake Dunigan's lab tests revealed a gene marker
for diabetes and evidence that his body was beginning to destroy
its ability to produce insulin, no one was surprised. Just
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes has been plaguing generations of Dunigans, striking
young and old in the Londonderry, N.H., family.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to save some of the insulin-producing beta cells in
Jake's pancreas, his father, Jay _ who also suffers from diabetes _
enrolled Jake in a clinical trial of a pioneering prevention
technique at Boston's Joslin Diabetes Center. Researchers hope that
massive doses of insulin given orally, or injections of small
amounts, will trick the bodies of high-risk individuals like Jake
into tolerating the cells that make insulin, the hormone the body
needs to metabolize sugar, which otherwise are attacked by the
body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But even as researchers at Joslin _ which is celebrating its
centennial as America's first diabetes center _ and elsewhere are
making inroads on this and other fronts, more and more Americans
are being stricken with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 years, the toll has risen six-fold, reaching 16 million in
1997, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Only about two thirds have actually been
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Another 21 million Americans with impaired blood sugar
metabolism have a 50-to-75 percent chance of developing diabetes.
The cost of treating the disease and its complications had soared
to $100 billion by 1997, up from $5 billion in 1975, according to
congressional reports.
</P>
<P>
   Type I, or juvenile-onset diabetes, the type that Jay and Jake
Dunigan have, affects fewer than than 10 percent of all diabetics,
or about 2 million Americans. For reasons that remain poorly
understood, their immune systems make antibodies that destroy the
cells that make insulin.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those afflicted, mainly adults and older
people, have type II diabetes. Their bodies gradually become
resistant to insulin, prompting cells in the pancreas to step up
production until they become exhausted and the insulin supply
dwindles, making them gradually dependent on outside sources.
</P>
<P>
   Americans 65 and older account for one quarter of the increase
of new type II cases since 1980, CDC reports show. And about 90
percent of all type IIs are obese. Because age and obesity increase
the risk, diabetes poses an enormous public health threat to an
America growing grayer and heavier each year.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes affects nearly every organ system. It's a leading cause
of blindness, fatal kidney disease, amputations, and disability.
It's a principal cause of birth defects and infant mortality. And
diabetics are at increased risk for stroke, heart disease, and
nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   While genetics plays the key role in rendering individuals
susceptible, it is lifestyle that actually triggers the vast
majority of type II cases.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show the rates of the disease in American men of white
European descent are about double those of their European
counterparts. These differences within the same racial group are
likely caused by the American lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   CDC studies also show that diabetes rates among American
minorities are two to three times higher than among American
whites. Native Americans have the highest rates, followed by
Hispanics, blacks, and Asians. These differences among racial
groups are likely the result of genetic differences in
susceptibility, researcheers say.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing study presented at the American Diabetes
Association meeting in Boston last year illustrates the intertwined
roles of genetics and environment.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists studied two tribes of Pima Indians who live on either
side of the border between Arizona and Mexico. They are genetically
related but dramatically separated by culture and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Pimas live on a reservation 30 miles south of Phoenix
with electricity, running water, televisions, and cars. Their diet
is heavy in fatty, processed food. Many are unemployed and most who
work have sedentary jobs. Most are obese. The rate of diabetes is
38.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Pimas live in the Sierra Madre mountains, without
running water or electricity and few modern conveniences. Their
jobs require heavy physical labor. Their traditional diet is very
low in fat and includes lots of beans, tortillas, and fresh salsa.
Few are overweight. The diabetes rate is 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results illustrate the importance of environmental factors
in preventing the development of both type II diabetes and obesity
in people who presumably carry a genetic susceptiblity to these
conditions,'' said study author Caroline Fox of the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers theorize that genes for diabetes once protected
against starvation. But in times of plenty, those genes cause
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter-gatherers were at nature's mercy 100,000 years ago. Dr.
Barry Sears, a biochemist and nutrition specialist, writes in his
book, ``The Zone,'' that our genes were well-suited to our
ancestors' diets: rich in the fresh fruits, nuts, seeds and lean
meat.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 years ago, the cultivation of milk and grains
began. Our bodies have done little to adapt to the changing diet,
however, and few populations can properly digest the new foods.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 75 percent of Americans cannot properly digest
carbohydrates such as grains, rice, breads, and pastas, reports Dr.
Gerald Reaven, a Stanford University endocrinologist. To metabolize
those foods, the body's insulin spikes to levels that stay high for
abnormally long periods. Over time, this can lead to obesity and
insulin resistance, which in turn are risk factors for diabetes and
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The American diet today is high in processed carbohydrates made
from grains, as well as refined sugar, and low in fresh fruits,
seeds, and vegetables. Alcohol also contributes to obesity and to
problems with liver function, which help trigger diabetes if
certain genes are present.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunigans carry genes for both types of diabetes. ``I suspect
it was just bad luck,'' said Dr. Gordon Weir, head of the beta cell
transplant unit. ``A type I family married into a type II family.''
</P>
<P>
   But progress is being made on several fronts. New research
spurred by patient advocacy groups and the Clinton administration's
commitment _ more than $2.4 billion over five years _ has produced
an array of alternative drugs, novel methods of insulin delivery,
new genetic maps and tantalizing clues that may someday point to a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, we will train cells to be pancreases,''
predicts Dr. Stanley Mirsky, a diabetologist at Mt. Sinai Hospital
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments at the Joslin, Weir is attempting to find ways to
improve the lives of patients by giving them transplants of healthy
insulin-producing cells. He has raised the proportion of those able
to be taken off insulin completely from 10 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the scarce supply of human pancreas donors, but
researchers think that may eventually be resolved with the use of
cells from fetal pigs. In addition, special coatings are being
developed to protect transplanted cells from attack by the immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Dr. Gary Ruvkin of Massachusetts General Hospital
suggests, a test will be able to reveal the exact genetic mutations
in a person, and there will be a precisely targeted drug to block
the effects of the defective gene that is causing the type of
diabetes that person has.
</P>
<P>
   To better treat today's patients, the National Institute of
Health is running a five-year trial of ways to permanently alter
patients' lifestyle and to measure the effect of drugs that help
regulate blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Success in managing the disease lies in tight control of blood
glucose levels, a strategy that has been shown to reduce
complications up to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That means testing eight to 12 times daily with a finger prick
and glucose meter, injecting insulin five times or more, sometimes
using both established and newer drugs _ all to hold blood sugar
close to normal levels. Managing the disease is a major part of a
diabetics's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my life,'' said Jay Dunigan, who was recently fitted
with an insulin pump the size of a beeper that continously releases
insulin and allows extra doses before meals at the push of a
button. ``And it's a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he thought of the changes already showing up in young
Jake Dunigan, his eyes misted over. ``It just blows me away that my
son might get it.''

A DEFT STROKE BY CLINTON

 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In at least one sense _ the best sense _ there was
indeed a link between last week's cruise missile attacks on Osama
bin Laden's terrorism infrastructure and President Clinton's
ability to hold on to his office amid scandal.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning _ while the rubble from the horrors in Kenya
and Tanzania was still smoldering _ the president's foreign policy
advisers put Congress's four top leaders in the loop of their
decision-making; Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, in short, were on
the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   That was wise politics on the merits, particularly because the
missile attacks represent an important change to a no-sanctuary,
antiterrorism policy that involves as many risks as potential
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also prescient and wise scandal politics.
</P>
<P>
   From the first intelligence information about the origin of the
embassy bombs on Aug. 7 through the first discussions of a military
response to the actual plans, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, kept the
tight circle _ including Democrats Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt _
up to date right up through the night before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Because they could see the plans evolving and the policy
changing, they were in position to not only support Clinton when
the attacks began, but to vouch for the legitimacy of his decisions
in the face of a few ugly, ad hominem but, under the circumstances,
inevitable questions from journalistic and political harpies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gingrich even saw to it that one of his political
associates, Rich Galen, sent a blast-fax to conservative talk radio
hosts urging them to lay off the president on the missile strikes,
and making sure they knew of Gingrich's strong support.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same Rich Galen, by the way, who is openly urging
Republican congressional candidates to try to take political
advantage of the president's sex scandal in their television
advertising this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Those Republican politicians who had the sense to check with
their leaders before reacting on Thursday were able to avoid
embarrassment _ Jesse Helms, for example, and especially Orrin
Hatch, whose endorsement bordered on the gushy and was all the more
interesting given his intense anger at the president's remarks
after his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't check and reacted in negative haste made fools
of themselves as they spent most of the following 12 hours walking
back from their initial statements _ notably the normally stable
Senator Dan Coats of Indiana and publicity hound Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that any of the fundamentals of scandal
politics have changed. It is a truism that there isn't a president
deservedly in a very tight spot who has ever derived anything more
than brief advantage from some policy move or emergency that serves
to remind people that he is still president. The fundamental things
always apply as time goes by.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the missile strikes came smack in the
middle of the national sorting out that commenced with Clinton's de
facto admission that he had lied to the public and to his family
and friends ever since January about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The effect has been to defuse at least some of the tension and
intense emotion of the initial reaction among partisans and the
media and to reinforce the less hotheaded and more supportive
feelings of the country at large.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term effect will also be to solidify the astonishing
disconnect between those in public life who like to think of
themselves as opinion leaders and the people who find this notion
of opinion leadership hilarious as well as pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important _ for those screaming prematurely for
resignation or impeachment _ the effect should be to remind one and
all that the removal of an elected president not only requires
clear and convincing proof of a serious crime but also a clear and
convincing mandate from the public before any formal proceedings
can have legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, another effect of the deft execution of an important
security policy change will provide some additional cover for the
delicate repair work Clinton and his family are engaged in on
Martha's Vineyard. Whatever happens next will begin with his
family's emergence from seclusion with its own judgment about how
to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   We can wait, believe it or not, and the military response to a
murderer named bin Laden has made it easier.

CLINTON'S TROUBLES STYMIE HIS PLANS FOR PUBLIC POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a policy blitz like none other, a rapid-fire
unveiling of initiatives on child-care expansion, school
reconstruction, a teacher-recruitment campaign, and Medicare reform
_ all designed to define the Clinton presidency in its second term.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the second week of January. For the past seven
months, since allegations were first raised about President
Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, the White House policy
agenda has sat dormant on Capitol Hill, the hidden victim,
according to some Democrats and analysts, of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Clinton's widely criticized confession and speech a
week ago, his policy fortunes before Congress are expected to
worsen, analysts said. And when independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr issues his report on the Lewinsky and Whitewater inquiries
this autumn, lawmakers will be consumed by Clinton's past and
future, not by his current domestic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he will get very little cooperation in the Congress from
Republicans, and less than before from the Democrats,'' said Erwin
Hargrove, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville. ``How can he ask people to stand behind him when they
lack a respect for him? It's an intangible, but it matters.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton's path to success in Congress would have
been difficult even without the Lewinsky affair, given that both
houses remain under Republican control. But in contrast, in 1996,
another election year, the White House and the Republican
congressional leadership compromised on welfare changes, a minimum
wage increase, and an expansion of health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   This year, stalled or lost on the Clinton agenda are a $21.7
billion proposal designed to make child care more affordable, a
$12.4 billion program to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class
sizes in lower grades to 18 students, and a $22 billion program to
repair decaying schools.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled, too, are Clinton's proposals to strengthen Social
Security and Medicare, and enact a plan to overhaul health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides blame not the president, but the Republican
leadership for what has been perhaps their most dismal legislative
year since Clinton was elected in 1992. Even Clinton chided
lawmakers for their abbreviated schedule this year, joking in a
comedy routine at the White House correspondents' dinner in April,
``This is a Congress with nothing to do and no time to do it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration advisers said the most conservative elements of
the Republican Party have prevented Clinton from achieving a goal
of bipartisanship that he touted in his 1997 inaugural address.
Those conservatives, advisers argued, have caused mainstream
Republicans to do little for the past year, hoping to avoid
negative attention before the 1998 midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a difficult year, but that has more to do with
the inner workings of a Republican caucus than with anything we
could do,'' said Ann Lewis, the White House communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single biggest disappointment of the year has been the
pace of the Congress and their apparent unwillingness to make any
policy decisions,'' Lewis said. ``I attribute that to the fact that
the decisions their right-wing members want to make would insult
everyone else, so they are trying to solve that by doing as little
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers and their top aides had hoped that the
Congress could return to questions of policy once Clinton testified
before the federal grand jury investigating the Lewinsky
allegations and addressed the public.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Clinton lashed back at Starr and offered no
explicit apology for his transgression and lies. Many Democrats at
the highest levels were left stunned and fearful of what else the
Starr report might contain. Some aides said they no longer are
focusing on Clinton's program, but on his viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that this has happened, there is a different aura,'' said
a senior aide to one Democratic congressional leader. ``It is more
heavy on the minds of the members that there is more there there,
and that the report could be more significant than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Democrats are frustrated that Clinton's actions _
his extramarital affair with Lewinsky and his seven-month denial of
the relationship _ have allowed Republicans to effectively avoid
developing a policy agenda of their own. The news media, and to
some extent the public, have been consumed by Clinton's actions and
have paid little attention to public-policy initiatives, the
members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many instances the Republican leadership would rather see
the focus on the president and is using this an an excuse,'' said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Republicans repeatedly criticized Clinton's
proposals as too costly, and have largely ignored them since. Some
key Republicans have offered scaled-down alternatives to such plans
as the teacher hirings, but even those have received little support
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation has been preoccupied by the president's personal
problems,'' said Tim Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Republican
National Committee. ``The Republicans have tried to move their own
agenda, but President Clinton continues to try to beat up on Ken
Starr and now the Congress has to turn its attention to the
president's legal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides, lawmakers, and analysts said it remains to be
seen how Clinton might regain an air of authority on public policy.
In the wake of last week's admissions, some fear a credibility gap
_ the term first used to describe President Johnson's predicament
when he espoused Vietnam War policies that many in the Congress and
the country did not believe to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility gap widened during President Nixon's second term
and the onslaught of Watergate, eventually crippling his
presidency. In Clinton's case, though, leading scholars have
questioned whether the public would envision such a gap over issues
of sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important, credibility,'' said Richard Neustadt, a
historian of the presidency from Harvard University. ``In some
issues, foreign and domestic, to believe the president is telling
it like it is is crucial for public morale, for faith, for
action.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neustadt added: ``Maybe this is just a different category,
where lying about sex is different, and you can't create a
credibility gap when you lie about sex. It is crummy, but it may
not be serious in the way the other things came to be serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides still are uncertain about his next steps to regain
a place of policy prominence. The missile strikes against suspected
terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan last week helped, aides
privately said, in that Clinton acted decisively in the public
realm and did not need congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Clinton will leave for a whirlwind tour through
Moscow, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland, providing
another opportunity to appear presidential while leaving some of
the controversy behind. After that, he and his aides probably will
have to address the findings in the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, he should lower his profile, spend time
with this family, reflect on where he is and how he wants to deal
with this,'' said David Gergen, Clinton's former White House
strategist. ``He has to deal with the national psychology as well
as the politics of this. That's a different challenge from what
he's dealt with in the past.''

 BOSTON: ... West Wing escalator.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rembrandt, it turns out, has been reclassified as an Early
Modernist. At least, he's in the small upstairs gallery usually
devoted to early 20th century work. Two years ago, European
paintings curator George Shackelford gave the Rembrandt ``Artist in
His Studio'' the star status it merits, moving it from an obscure
corridor wall to its own free-standing case plunked in the center
of the Sidney and Esther Rabb Gallery. You couldn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   To make way for ``Monet,'' ``Artist in His Studio'' has now been
moved again. So have other 17th-century Dutch paintings, including
``Old Man in Prayer,'' which was a Rembrandt when I was growing up
but was downgraded to ``pupil of'' some years ago. The other day
its label read ``Rembrandt'' once more. I was glad. I love this
exquisite painting whose theme is reflection _ reflected light,
reflected thoughts. It's a great painting no matter who did it, and
of course it shouldn't matter whether it's a Rembrandt or a John
Doe. But the concept of the individual artist-genius has so taken
hold that it does matter _ not only to the painting's monetary
value, but to its hold on our hearts. It turns out, though, that
the painting hadn't been reinstated at all: The MFA computers were
just temporarily incapable of printing out a label that said
``Rembrandt, Pupil of.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubism, meanwhile, has moved two rooms farther on: It's now in
the big Impressionist gallery that is probably the most popular
place in the whole museum. At the moment, it's also the most
startling place. Picasso meets Monet. The violently shattered
images of the former with the sweetly dissolving ones of the
latter. Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   New pairing of paintings affects how you see them, how each one
hits your eye. One new couple in the big gallery is Kirchner's
``Reclining Nude'' and Van Gogh's ``Lullaby: Madame Augustine
Roulin Rocking a Cradle.'' The skin of both ladies is citrusy.
``Madame Roulin always looked jaundiced,'' observes MFA research
assistant Deanna Griffin. ``But next to the Kirchner she's
especially yellow-green.''
</P>
<P>
   Picasso's ``Portrait of a Woman'' now hangs next to Matisse's
``Carmelina.'' The pairing encourages you to seek out the ``Woman''
who hovers in the background of the fractured planes of the
Picasso, and to notice how somber and sculptural the figure in the
Matisse is _ and how earthy its palette for a painter whose name is
synonymous with color that sings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Monets still ensconced in the room is ``La
Japonaise,'' the artist's 1876 portrait of his wife, set against a
wall of fans and giddily swirling around in a Japanese kimono
embroidered with a Samurai warrior who looks about to leap off the
skirt. It's Monet's comment on the obsession with things Japanese
among fashionable French of the time. As the label hints, it's also
comical. Camille Monet was really a brunette, but here she's a
blonde: Her husband had her wear a wig, perhaps to highlight the
silliness of a westerner playing at being Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Japonaise'' prompts thoughts of the intriguing
Monet-Japan-Boston triangle. Japanese collectors were right there
with Bostonians in buying Monets early on, when the paint was
virtually still wet. Bostonians also bought quantities of superb
Japanese Buddhist art. In April, Boston's MFA opens its
years-in-the-making Japanese branch, attached to a hotel in Nagoya,
and one of the first shows there will be French landscapes from the
MFA collections. The museum is currently holding Wednesday-evening
Japanese lessons, to prepare curators who'll be commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``La Japonaise,'' Millet's ``The Sower'' and Sargent's
``The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit'' are MFA signatures. Unlike
``La Japonaise,'' the Millet and Sargent are now off view, to the
disappointment of tourists who expect to see them on the MFA walls.
The Millet has gone to Paris to be in a show at the Musee d'Orsay.
The ``Boit Brats,'' as they're affectionately called, are preparing
to depart for London, where they'll be in a big Sargent
retrospective opening at the Tate in October.
</P>
<P>
   But don't book a ticket to Heathrow. The Sargent show comes to
the MFA next June. At the same time, the Gardner Museum mounts a
companion exhibition, ``Sargent: The Late Landscapes,'' which will
go in the museum's temporary exhibition space, currently serving a
more mercantile function. During the summer tourist season, it's an
extension of the gift shop. For a small museum that already charges
a big admission ($10 for adults) this encroachment of commerce on
curatorial turf is sad.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardner exhibition will show a side of Sargent less well
known than his famously flattering portraits of aristocrats, even a
Sargent influenced by Monet's late landscapes. If that's still not
enough Sargent for you, the MFA is currently restoring its great
mural cycle by the artist, a project scheduled for completion by
the opening of the show. There are also important Sargent murals at
Harvard and the Boston Public Library. After Monet Mania, we're in
for a Sargent Spring.

FLOATING ANOTHER TITANIC LOVE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two young, attractive people from different backgrounds find a
romance which blossoms in the shadow of an extraordinary luxury
liner. Their love _ so perfect, so pure _ is brutally interrupted
when the ship, on its madien voyage, meets a tragic end in the icy
waters of the North Atlantic in April 1912.
</P>
<P>
   This may all sound familiar, but this isn't ``Titanic,'' James
Cameron's Oscar-sweeping 1997 romantic epic. There's no Rose or
Jack, no fabulous jewel necklace, no band playing ``Nearer My God
to Thee,'' as doomed passengers clasp their hands in a final,
desperate prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The film is ``The Chambermaid,'' a dizzyingly romantic story
about a coal worker who has an affair with a maid the night before
she is set to sail on the ill-fated Titanic. It is, to be sure, a
love story, but it is also a tale of the blurred lines between
fantasy and reality, and how the shared recollections of one man
changes his life as well as the lives of those around him. The
film's original title, ``The Chambermaid on the Titanic,'' was
changed at the end of last week in time for its nationwide release
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think the word, `Titanic' is almost the property
of James Cameron,'' joked Aitana Sanchez Gijon, who portrays Marie,
the chambermaid, in the film. She was recently in Boston, along
with costar Oliver Martinez, and writer-director Bigas Luna to
promote the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know this is not the Titanic story or a
remake,'' she said. ``We have the Titanic as a context, but this is
a completely different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is less about the Titanic than the liberating and
fanciful nature of love. Horty (Martinez) wins a contest of
strength at the foundry where he works. His prize is a trip to
Southampton, England to watch the launch of the Titanic. Since
there is only one ticket, he makes the trip without his wife Zoe
(Romane Bohringer).
</P>
<P>
   After he checks into his hotel, he meets Marie (Gijon), a
beautiful maid with nowhere to stay. Although there's an instant
mutual attraction, Horty is at first reluctant to allow her to stay
in his room. He gives her his bed, but soon she invites him to
share it with her. By morning, Marie is gone. Left only with a
picture hastily snapped by a photographer, Horty is unsure whether
he and Marie spent a romantic night together, or if the passion
lived only in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Once he hears of the Titanic's demise, Horty tells his friends
about Marie. With each telling, the story becomes more elaborate
and passionate, with Horty and Marie making love within the opulent
rooms of the fabled ship.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins as Horty's revenge against Zoe, who Horty
believes is having an affair with his boss. But Horty's motivations
run far deeper, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is about various subjects like love, hatred and
lying. But it's also about the artistic dimension hidden within
everyone,'' he said. Born in France, he answered questions in his
native language through a translator, and in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea of a worker having cultural standards and
artistic standards within him,'' Martinez said. ``When he takes his
trip (to see the Titanic), he discovers another part of life, and
he becoms a different man. This was an initiation for Horty, and
going through this helps him figured out things within him.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel by Didier Decoin, Luna, who adapted the film
with Cuca Canals, said he identifies with Horty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a creator also, as Horty becomes a creator with his
story. I'm a storyteller, so I relate very well to Horty. It's a
movie which tells how creation starts, the mechanism of creation,
which is what happens to Horty,'' he said. ``It's something which
fascinates me, the limits between reality and imagination. The
Titanic is the symbol of a century, a particular life slipping
away. And after the ship goes down, after our reality disappers,
what we will have left and what we help us survive is imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, for me, as an artist,'' Luna said, ``the question becomes
which is more important _ what you think and how you live or what
you desire?''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the object of Horty's desire was a formidable task for
Gijon, a stunning Italian-born actress raised in Spain. Marie, she
said, had to be as a much flesh-and-blood woman as a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first read the script and I talked to Bigas, I told him
I loved the story, I loved the character, but I was worried because
it was challenge,'' she said ``The character could be just an
image, a symbol, and I didn't want that. She needed to be a real
woman. On one side she needs to be an ideal woman for Horty since
he's the one who tells the story, and we see her through his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the hand, she must be real,'' Gijon said. ``You should be
able to almost touch her. If not, the story has no soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's ending is open to interpretation, another aspect
which attracted Luna to the story. Whether Horty's story of passion
with a chambermaid is true is almost besides the point, Luna said.
Depending on personal experience, each audience member can draw
their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, it doesn't matter whether the story happened or
not,'' Gijon said. ``The point is sometimes fantasy and imagination
is better than reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Luna, ``In some ways, we're showing the mechanism of love
_ how love starts, how love is related to imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with the film, I arrived at the conclusion that love
is an intellectual creation, something we invent,'' he said. ``It's
one of the best inventions of human nature _ we have religion, we
have culture, and we have love.''

ANDRE PREVIN'S FIRST OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ Andre Previn waited until he was 69 to write his
first opera, ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The San Francisco Opera
will present the premiere of Previn's version of Tennessee
Williams's play next month. Soprano Renee Fleming has already
recorded one of Blanche Dubois's arias, ``I Want Magic!,'' with
James Levine on a London/Decca CD scheduled for release next month.
In the music you can hear the heat, the mugginess, Blanche's
desperation, and her special grace. Deutsche Grammophon plans to
record the opera live in San Francisco for release before the end
of the year, and ``Great Performances'' is taping it for
television.
</P>
<P>
   Previn is a late bloomer in opera, but his case is not unique;
at 89, Elliott Carter has just completed his own first opera.
Previn has composed music most of his life, starting out in films
(``Elmer Gantry'' may be his best original score); in 1969 he wrote
a Broadway show for Katharine Hepburn, ``Coco.'' But his first
famous concert work didn't arrive until 1976, ``Every Good Boy
Deserves Favour,'' a play for actors and orchestra that he wrote in
collaboration with Tom Stoppard. Since then Previn has composed a
piano concerto, which the Boston Symphony has programmed for next
season, and a large body of chamber music, vocal music, and works
for solo instruments. He has enjoyed the process of creating
``Streetcar'' so much that he's already at work planning the next
opera.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Previn took some time over tea near Tanglewood to talk
about ``Streetcar''; he had conducted a Boston Symphony concert the
night before and was about to start rehearsals for a concert with
the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Previn has admired Tennessee Williams's play for years, but
never particularly thought of it as a subject for an opera, or for
himself. ``I read the play when it came out in 1947, but I didn't
see it until a London production which must have been in the late
'50s sometime; Claire Bloom was Blanche, and she was
transcendentally wonderful. Of course, I saw the movie with Marlon
Brando and Vivian Leigh, and a Broadway revival with Jessica Lange.
I saw a TV version with Ann-Margret, and she wasn't bad. I think
`Streetcar' is one of the great American plays. It is intensely
touching, yet parts of it are also very funny. One of my theater
friends still says that the first production was the best-directed
new play ever.''
</P>
<P>
   How the opera came to him ``is not much of an anecdote,'' Previn
says. ``Lofi Mansouri, who runs the San Francisco Opera, called me
near the end of 1994, and asked me if I wanted to write an opera.
`Just abstractly?' I asked him. He said, `No _ would you like to
write ``A Streetcar Named Desire''?' I said `Yes.' I was instantly
crazy about the idea, and why shouldn't I be?''
</P>
<P>
   Some time went into making the appropriate arrangements with the
Williams estate and into finding an appropriate librettist. The
choice fell on Philip Littell, who had written the text for an
earlier opera premiered in San Francisco, Conrad Susa's ``Les
liaisons dangereuses.''

   ``I was also anxious to settle on a cast,'' Previn says. ``Like
Benjamin Britten, I have written all my music with specific
performers in mind. Renee Fleming was a given for Blanche.
Paradoxically, all three of the other principals I had first seen
in Britten operas: Rodney Gilfrey, who sings Stanley, I saw as
Billy Budd; Elizabeth Futral I saw in `A Midsummer Night's Dream';
and Anthony Dean Griffey, who will be Mitch, I saw in `Peter
Grimes' here at Tanglewood. Colin Graham, the director, of course
directed most of the premieres of the later Britten operas. Renee
did me a most unusually flattering favor when I told her I was
about to write `Streetcar.' `Would you be interested?' I asked her.
`I'll do it,'' she replied. `I've heard your music; just do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Littell's job was primarily one of condensing and cutting;
nearly every word in the libretto comes from the play. ``The play
is four hours long,'' Previn says. ``If I had tried to set all of
it, it would have been as long as Messiaen's `St. Francis of
Assisi'! Philip was way ahead of me. We talked in advance about
where the arias would come, and he was very accommodating, but I
didn't start until he was finished. Philip, Colin, and I had
conversations about our perceptions of Blanche. For me she is
totally sympathetic. Philip may not be quite so sympathetic; he
finds her morally censorable. I think the play is exclusively about
Blanche, and not really about Stanley so much; it took Brando to
make us think it was. Talk about a life _ Blanche's life was
preordained _ she is a sad, doomed, vulnerable woman; that's why
she's so riveting. Those are the qualities Claire Bloom brought out
so brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn admits he was concerned about the famous rape scene.
```What are you going to show?' I asked Colin. He told me the stage
would be completely blacked out, and that he wanted two minutes of
music. I said, `Colin, you can't rape Blanche in two minutes; give
me between four and five!'''
</P>
<P>
   Previn says he wasn't intimidated by the famous lines in
``Streetcar'' _ even people whose memory for details of the plot is
hazy remember lines like ``I have always depended on the kindness
of strangers,'' ``We've had this date with each other from the
beginning,'' ``I want magic!,'' and even ``Stell-lahhhh!'' This
last line is the only one Previn did not set to music. ``There is
no way to have that sung without getting a laugh. Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau himself, standing at the foot of those stairs,
couldn't control the audience. Philip wanted me to set it to music,
but I said, `It can't be done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Previn says the musical language in ``Streetcar'' is
``reasonably tough.'' ``This ain't `Susannah'; I don't think you
can be ingratiating all the time in this story. But I have always
been in favor of music with a tonal center, although I think some
of the composers today have turned the clock backwards too far. The
aria `I Want Magic!' is an exception. I thought at that point it
would be wise to retreat into something absolutely unreal in terms
of today's music.''
</P>
<P>
   The aria appears in the context of a duet between Blanche and
her mismatched suitor Mitch. ``He's lost for a set of different
reasons from hers, but both of them are so desperately lonely that
they keep hoping to find what they need in each other, although
both of them must know better _ he's completely wrong for her, this
sad and fragile mama's boy. Even when Tennessee Williams wrote
characters he was alienated from, he infused them with something
that makes you sorry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Previn has conducted an eclectic but limited
operatic repertory _ works of Mozart, Britten, Walton, Ravel,
Johann Strauss. ``Coming up there are quite a lot _ Korngold's `Die
tote Stadt,' Stravinsky's `The Rake's Progress,' Strauss's
`Daphne,' and Lehar's `The Merry Widow.''' He says his operatic
heroes in this century are Britten in England and Samuel Barber in
this country. ``I like that kind of musical vocabulary. In Ben's
work, I like the unfailing sense of drama, the sheer theatricality.
I think `The Turn of the Screw' is genuinely scary; it's the
scariest opera I know. In Barber, what I find so appealing is that
nonstop lyricism of his. Just when his music seems to be veering
towards the simplistic, he will throw a surprise at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn argues that his work for the movies and Broadway doesn't
really feed into ``Streetcar.'' ```Coco' was written for a great
personality, but she is not a singing personality. When Danielle
Darrieux came in to replace Katharine Hepburn, she sang like a
dream, and the show closed immediately, but Alan Jay Lerner and I
realized for the first time that we had written a musical. But
there's a difference between writing a musical and writing an opera
_ in a musical, almost nothing is developed; it's just a series of
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of musical references in Williams's play, and
Blanche sings ``Paper Moon'' in the bathtub. ``Music added a
dimension to what was essentially a nonmusical play. But those
specific references which worked so well in the play would set up
interference in the opera. I also made a conscious decision not to
use specific references to New Orleans jazz music for the same
reason that if I were writing an opera about Russia I wouldn't
necessarily want to introduce a balalaika. Of course, I've heard
and played a lot of jazz in my lifetime, so people are bound to say
that there is a jazz influence in the harmonies or the rhythmic
patterns. I like to quote Aaron Copland, who replied to questions
about jazz in his work by saying, `I didn't grow up in a vacuum.' I
didn't set out to write a jazz-influenced score, but I didn't set
out not to do it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn says he composed the score in order. ``I didn't have much
of a floor plan, although I marked the things that would obviously
be arias or duets. I also made the decision to stick very closely
to the speech patterns _ I don't like elongations and stretching of
syllables. Renee says her part is taxing, but that it was easy to
memorize because the rhythms of the music are the same as the
rhythms you would use if you were speaking the lines. All along the
way I had to stick by musical decisions I had made, decisions that
had long-lasting consequences. I knew when I was writing music that
I would need to use again in the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal of opera to me,'' Previn says, ``is the combination
of music and drama _ this is irresistible, the collaboration of
voice and orchestra. And opera is the one place left in the theater
where the composer has the last word! Luckily I've got a lot of
elaborate plans _ Lofti was nice enough to say, `You pick 'em and
we'll do 'em.' I'm trying to make up for lost time.''

THE LONG AND INFLUENTIAL LIFE OF THE ORIGINAL SPINMEISTER

THE FATHER OF SPIN 
Edward L. Bernays and the Birth of Public Relations 
By Larry Tye. Crown. 306 pp. Illustrated. $27.50 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Edward L. Bernays died in 1995 at age 103, he lost the
opportunity to manipulate to his own advantage one aspect of his
long and richly experienced life: his biography. His loss has now
become our gain. Those who are drawn to discover the man and assess
the work of this elfin giant of the business of public relations
are fortunate that the first biography of Bernays turns out to be a
fact-driven and fundamentally fair account written by Boston Globe
reporter Larry Tye.
</P>
<P>
   The task of separating the facts from the fictions surrounding
the life and work of ``Eddie'' Bernays is not easy, especially
considering that the fictions were often created and perpetuated by
Bernays himself. A hundred years is a long time to blow your own
horn. But Tye's well-researched effort in ``The Father of Spin''
lights a fire under the whole caldron of contradictions that make
Bernays a fascinating subject from his first birthday on a steamer
as a baby immigrant to his soap operatic last years in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Edward L. Bernays is not exactly a household name. Unless you
have connections with the public relations or advertising business
or belong to the Cambridge/Boston literati, you are probably
blissfully unaware that in 1923 this nephew of Sigmund Freud wrote
the seminal book on the fledgling business of public relations
(``Crystallizing Public Opinion''). Thereafter, he partly earned
and partly appropriated the tag line that may forever follow his
name, ``the father of public relations.'' Tye makes a concerted
effort to validate the merit of that paternal title, but in the end
we are left to make our own call.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking any trend to base biography on the revelations of
personal secrets, Tye opts instead for an issue-oriented approach
to Eddie Bernays. ``The Father of Spin'' offers a detailed analysis
of the sometimes flamboyantly funny and sometimes devilishly
devious public relations campaigns that bear the imprint of Bernays
during his prime. Tye dissects those campaigns under an ethical
microscope using today's lenses.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bernays's efforts to promote the use of tobacco,
especially among women during the 1920s and '30s, and his proactive
efforts on behalf of United Fruit Co. to overthrow the government
of Guatemala in the 1950s that most pointedly raise the ethical
sword over Bernays's reputation. There is potential injustice in
judging a human action out of the context of the time in which it
was taken. But the Nixonian question arises: What did Bernays know
about the harmful effect of his work and when did he know it? In
seeking an answer, Tye's research does not spare Bernays, who later
in life was torn between wanting to be the holy father of his craft
and facing some of the darker consequences of his acts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bernays's exploits, such as having debutantes step out
of churches along the route of the Easter Parade in Manhattan,
``puffing away'' on their Luckies, appear downright ludicrous to
our minds. But Bernays always based his methods on the fundamental
premise that attitude shapes action. Change the attitude and you
can change the behavior. ``Hired to sell a product of service, he
sold instead whole new ways of behaving, which appeared obscure but
over time reaped huge rewards for his clients and redefined the
very texture of American life,'' Tye writes.
</P>
<P>
   Tye cites Walter Lippman and Freud as Bernays's principal
mentors: ``He was as driven as his uncle to know what subconscious
forces motivated people, and he used Freud's writings to help him
understand.'' Identifying those forces without the aid of
sophisticated marketing research techniques was the mark of
Bernays's genius. He used sheer intuition in deciding what society
thought and what it could be made to want. And more often than not,
he was right.
</P>
<P>
   When Tye delves into the personal life of Eddie Bernays, he does
not attempt to apply pop psychology to this 5-foot-4-inch man who
thought so big. He allows Bernays's character to emerge through
interviews with family, former employees, and fellow PR folks. The
bottom line is that in public life Eddie was a stingy, tyrannical
boss who could carry a grudge for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In his family life, he failed to appreciate fully the greatest
human values in his life, his loyal and brilliant wife, Doris, and
his two daughters, Doris and Anne. He was a good husband and father
when he chose to play the role, but most of the time he was acting
in some other theater. His daughter Doris notes that ``he defined
himself entirely by his work.'' Anne, a novelist and writing
instructor, sounds a firmer judgment: ``I don't think he was meant
to be a father, really.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades in New York, Bernays moved his family to
Cambridge, seeking a conducive environment to write his memoirs.
The Victorian manse on Lowell Street buzzed with social affairs
where Eddie could hold court as the king of public relations he
believed himself to be. In 1980, he caringly nursed his wife in her
last days, after which Eddie Bernays slowly began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The final five years of Eddie's life are the stuff of soap
operas: a woman lover half his age who claims that sexually Eddie
``was not a man very easily sated'' even in his late 90s; lavish
expenditures draining away his wealth; charges of kidnapping;
lawsuits; a guardian ad litem; senile dementia; and a stubborn
resistance to death until Eddie Bernays just ``faded away'' in
1995. There was no funeral. Edward L. Bernays did not believe in
God or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Father of Spin'' is more than the tale of a completely
self-absorbed man. It raises important issues about the
presentation of information to the American public by the media in
1998 that affect us more than we realize. That Larry Tye has
condensed so much in so few pages is a tribute to his research and
writing talents. Better yet, it's a good read.

ZOMBIE'S ROCK REMAINS A HORROR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rob Zombie has this theory. It's sort of like ``everything you
really need to know you learned in kindergarten,'' but with a
twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything that you will later enjoy in life will
somehow form by the time you are about 6,'' says Zombie. ``Like big
sports fanatics who will mortgage their homes to go to baseball
games. That's obviously an obsession left over from being a kid.
The worst thing is the people who give them up. Then they just
wander around for the next 60 years and go `How come life seems so
boring?''' Of course, he notes, so-called normal people ``put a lot
of effort into trying to make you feel embarrassed for enjoying
your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Zombie's life is not boring, he thoroughly enjoys himself, and
he's proud to wear his childhood/adult obsessions on his sleeve.
And face. And all over the music he's created with his band White
Zombie and now on a solo CD called ``Hellbilly Deluxe,'' out
Tuesday. Zombie and his band _ guitarist Riggs, bassist Blasko, and
drummer Tempesta _ will begin a tour in October, with a probable
date at the Orpheum around Halloween. (Zombie was originally slated
to be part of the Korn-helmed Family Values tour, which kicks off
in Worcester, Mass. Sept. 23, but he pulled out in order to do his
own thing and a longer set.)
</P>
<P>
   Zombie's groove-centered, techno-hard rock remains a horror
show. Some of the song titles on the new album: ``Call of the
Zombie,'' ``Superbeast,'' ``Dragula'' ``Spookshow Baby,'' ``How to
Make a Monster,'' and ``Meet the Creeper.''
</P>
<P>
   You can guess how the young Zombie grew up. ```Creature Double
Feature' on Channel 56 (Boston)!'' he crows. (Yes, the Zombie
family _ though his parents use another surname _ grew up in these
environs. Rob's younger brother is Spider of Powerman 5000.)
Zombie's formative years were spent watching ``Frankenstein,''
``King Kong,'' ``Destroy All Monsters.'' He particularly dug the
creepy Hammer Films ``Dracula'' series starring Christopher Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Zombie isn't trying for horror movie effect in his music _
``not,'' he says, ``in the sense that I'm ever trying to do
something shocking per se. But if it comes off that way, it's fine.
But it's never the goal. You want to get across a vibe. I'm really
into the old Universal (films) where it's all about the atmosphere.
Nothing's actually happening, but you get the vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Zombie, who has had five Grammy nominations, has sold millions
of albums, but he had nothing to do with his band's most recent
accomplishment. Nevertheless, he takes pride in the fact that White
Zombie's ``Thunder Kiss '95'' was played continuously at maximum
volume on a loop outside the Barbra Streisand-James Brolin wedding
reception in order to drive the assembled press crazy and keep them
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I pulled that off; a lot of work went into that,'' he
deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Babs had really wanted to decimate the press
corps, she would have dug deeper into the White Zombie catalog. The
New York-based band began during the early 1980s and made a
godawful punk/art/noise racket, practically unlistenable to anyone
outside that circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was practically unlistenable to anyone's ears,''
offers Zombie. Our sound ``was just an evolution. We were a total
garage band, a bunch of people who started a band, who couldn't
play, or who knew how to play just enough. It wasn't ever like we
were trying to do one thing and then another. It was just that we
weren't good enough to be able to do what we wanted to do. So every
record is different in a more advanced way. I don't think bands
should just say `Oh this is what we do and we're going to do it
'til we drop dead.' You know, you can get better at something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a turning point, but I don't know what
the turning point was. For us, musically, I'm not sure. But for us
as a band in the industry, the turning point was when bands like
Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden were getting signed. I remember
those bands from the club level. And all of a sudden it was like
having a band, could be worth (something).''
</P>
<P>
   White Zombie made its major label debut with ``La Sexorcisto:
Devil Music Vol. 1'' in 1991. It went double platinum. Then came
``Astro-Creep: 2000.'' Also double platinum. Then came a bunch of
collaborations and soundtrack songs, and, most spectacularly, the
garish Beavis-goes-to-hell fantasy sequence in ``Beavis and
Butt-head Do America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hellbilly Deluxe'' bears Rob's name but has obvious
connections to the White Zombie sound. ``I don't know if it's
different at all from White Zombie,'' he says. ``White Zombie was
my band for 13 years. I think it may be different because it's
produced better and different musicians are playing that bring a
different flair to it.''
</P>
<P>
   So is White Zombie _ pardon the pun _ dead?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Zombie. ``We just kind of took a year off and in
that year I got bored. I wanted to keep working, and this project
started as a little time-killer that snowballed into a full-blown
thing. So it's not something I just walk away from. I have to see
it through to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Zombie has long been a fan of Alice Cooper and KISS,
shock-rockers from the '70s, who are now his friends and peers.
Cooper, of course, presented his Alice as character created by the
artist _ a separate entity and ego-monster. Zombie says, of his
rock self, ``I don't think of it as a character at all. It's just
me; it blows up your personality. I see it in rehearsal, when the
adrenaline starts pumping. It's like an athlete or something. It's
the same guy, he doesn't create a character, but when he gets on
the field he's pumped up. It's like a super version of your
off-stage personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage and off, Zombie is a man with an X in the middle of his
forehead, a fashion statement made famous by celebrity killer
madman Charles Manson. (Before there was Marilyn Manson, there was
Charles.) Is Manson cool?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think cool is the right word,'' says Zombie, who was
but 4 years old when Manson declared Helter Skelter on Sharon Tate,
the LaBianca family, and others in 1969. ``I do think he's very
interesting. People always go, `That's sick' but how can you deny
what a bizarre story that is? I mean, it's not funny to the
families. But it's like the O.J. thing. The media creates another
persona with this person and he becomes famous. Why are you seeing
him on TV? You forget it's because they murdered someone. Manson
starts to seem like some standup comic when you're watching him.
The media is to blame. They keep sticking him on TV and somehow
find a way to make him entertaining.''

RUSSIA'S ILLS SHAKE FAITH IN MARKET CURE-ALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moscow's recent financial upheaval has jolted its leaders and
people and sent tremors through global markets. It has also exposed
troubling questions about the extent to which Russia has made any
economic progress since the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, many economists and policy makers thought
Russia was well on its way to becoming a market economy, if not
already there. Some still do. But for others, Russia's latest
debacle has sparked a crisis of faith &UR;  &LR; in how to repair troubled
economies. From a belief in the transformative power of Western aid
to certainty that market laws can work as well in Novosibirsk as in
New York, a slew of cherished assumptions has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some economists increasingly see Russia's reforms as
illusory. And a new generation of analysts is confounded by what it
sees as a rift between iron-clad market laws and the reality of a
country that often seems to defy those laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Russia effectively devalued the ruble by 34 percent,
raising the specter &UR;  &LR; of political and social instability in the
former Communist giant. The tempest came after Asia's storm passed
over Moscow in October, pressuring the ruble, which had been
largely stable for four years, and scaring Asian and Western
investors out of the government debt market, a key source of state
funding. Moscow, strapped for cash, declared a temporary moratorium
on some debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The moves threaten to undermine years of positive
changes. &UR;  &LR; This time last year, more than 80 percent of state
property had been privatized, and Moscow seemed willing to let
market forces, not insider business cliques, dominate sales.
Foreigners poured into the stock market in 1996 and 1997 and bagged
triple-digit gains. Inflation, an official 1,353 percent in 1992,
was tamed to 14 percent in 1997. And last year Russia saw growth,
albeit slight, for the first time in eight years. Growth would more
than double to 1 percent this year, and top 5.9 percent in 1999,
according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The results, the conventional wisdom went, showed that giant
leaps forward had been taken over seven years and that the West
should keep pouring money and advice into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ugly problems remained. Corruption, the inability of most
enterprises and the state to pay workers and suppliers, weak tax
collection, and an opposition-dominated parliament unwilling to
pass laws all hampered progress. But the hurdles were not seen as
insurmountable. Tax reform, currency support, and government fiscal
austerity _ all standard IMF prescriptions _ would lead to
functioning companies and markets. Economists and international
lending institutions focused on fiscal policy as the key to getting
Russia back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are serious distortions, but I would still call Russia a
market economy,'' said Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, whose views echo the
conventional wisdom of US policy makers and international lenders.
``There's an understanding that radical, fast, simple reforms are
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, those assessments are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a new thesis that challenges sacred Western notions of what
the former Cold War foe needs to become a democratic market
economy, two American scholars call Russia a sickly and spectral
``virtual economy,'' neither capitalist nor planned, that the West
has unwittingly helped create.
</P>
<P>
   In a research paper that first appeared in June, Clifford G.
Gaddy, a Brookings Institution fellow, and Barry W. Ickes, an
economics professor at Penn State University, say tax reforms and
fiscal austerity measures will do little to aid the ailing
enterprises they see as the root of Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they say, Russia is nothing like a market economy, and
is instead a shell game, in which barter, not cash, drives the
system, workers are not paid on time, and taxes cannot be collected
from producers because customers, including the state, do not pay
on time, if ever. Scores of overstaffed factories still produce
goods at a loss. Any profits made are whisked to offshore accounts.
Most banks, insolvent, have invested in high-returning state debt
rather than domestic companies with world-class oil and metals
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Few dispute that description. But many economists see the
problems as imperfections _ admittedly serious _ rather than fatal
flaws. For most of this decade, economists working on Russia have
gone on the assumption that enacting tax reforms and laws requiring
companies to pay in cash will produce market-oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   That is a mistake, according to Gaddy and Ickes. ``It has almost
been an iron law that if you get the macro-economic side right,
you'll get positive results,'' said Gaddy. ``But there's this one
little exception called Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   As the latest entry in a burgeoning debate over Russia's chances
for revitalization, the ``virtual economy'' assessment highlights a
growing lack of consensus on why Russia has bounced from one crisis
to another this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, a version of which will be published in the September
issue of Foreign Affairs, began circulating last month in halls
ranging from the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Department
to the Russian Central Bank and Moscow brokerages, just as the IMF
approved another $11.2 billion loan to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Already it has raised hackles and alarms.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Millar, an economics professor at George Washington
University, takes odds with Gaddy's and Ickes dead-end view that
loss-making enterprises have no value and must be shut down _ a
move the government is unlikely to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that logic, New York should have ceased to exist long
ago,'' Millar said, referring to the city's debt crisis in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists stress the need for Russia to resolve its
structural problems. Unlike Gaddy and Ickes, who focus on Russia's
corporate crisis, most finger Moscow's fiscal crisis, the Asian
flu, and low world oil prices that have slashed Moscow's hard
currency earnings as the main culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's crisis has also reignited debate over the role of
international lending institutions in curing ailing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Against the IMF's failure to predict Asia's economic turmoil and
to stave off Russia's quandary, economists are once again
questioning the efficacy of Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF is an incompetent institution that hasn't ever known
what it's doing in Russia,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Harvard
economist who advised the Yeltsin government in the early 1990s but
quit in disgust at what he saw as a lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's crisis does not challenge the classical economic
tenets, Sachs said, successful reforms were not guaranteed. The
reason, he said, was that Russia's fate had as much to do with
things the West can control, such as timely international aid, as
with things it can't, such as Russia's sprawling land mass and
centuries-old history of authoritarian rule without private
property.
</P>
<P>
   Can the West influence a fourth factor key to reform _ Russia's
own policies? One assumption behind the $31.2 billion committed by
the IMF to Russia since 1992 is that it can, and the IMF now makes
passage of key policy measures by the Russian parliament a
condition of receiving money.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddy and Ickes assert that policies do not automatically create
markets and that foreign aid is a wishful conceit. Their solution
is for the West to throw in the towel, cut funding, and accept that
Russia cannot restructure inefficient enterprises and lay off
legions of workers without bringing the house to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West should accept that radical economic reform in Russia
is incompatible with social stability,'' Gaddy said.
</P>
<P>
   With an economy no larger than Canada's, Russia does not yet
affect world markets as Asia does _ temblors in global debt markets
and anxiety among big-lending German banks excepted. The Russian
stock market, down 79 percent so far this year and now with a
capitalization no bigger than that of a decent-sized US company,
has played a lesser role. Russian citizens, who prefer cash to
shares, could not care less, and the effect on US stocks has been
slight.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rumblings raise other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Burton G. Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton
University, wonders if Russia's latest crisis might be evidence
that flows of capital, ranging from international loans to capital
flight, make life tougher for struggling economies with little
leeway for maneuver, especially when debt payments come due. ``It's
clearly a downside to the free-market model and may imply a kind of
inherent instability in the free-market system that makes it
difficult for countries to cope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western economists and policy makers assumed successful
reforms in Eastern Europe in the post-Communist period could be
grafted onto Russia. Instead, Moscow's straits may suggest that
troubled and transitional economies are increasingly willing to
take riskier, iconclastic steps to try to save themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to restructure $40 billion in short-term debt, much
of it owned by foreigners, Russia crossed a line that could lock it
out of international capital markets for years. Moscow's opting to
delay debt payments, on the heels of Hong Kong's shock suggestion
last month that capital flows in the Asian free-market mecca be
controlled to stave off financial collapse, has shown that sick
economies are more willing to implement less conventional measures,
said Morris Goldstein of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the West has been telling Russia what to do. Now, a
new generation of economists suspects Russia might be telling the
West a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of an era of believing that markets would lead
to capitalism would lead to wealth,'' said Alastair P. M. Breach, a
junior economist at the Russian-European Center for Economic
Research in Moscow. ``Suddenly, you realize that with Russia,
you're dealing with something completely different.''

A DEFT STROKE BY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In at least one sense _ the best sense _ there was
indeed a link between last week's cruise missile attacks on Osama
bin Laden's terrorism infrastructure and President Clinton's
ability to hold on to his office amid scandal.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning _ while the rubble from the horrors in Kenya
and Tanzania was still smoldering _ the president's foreign policy
advisers put Congress's four top leaders in the loop of their
decision-making; Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, in short, were on
the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   That was wise politics on the merits, particularly because the
missile attacks represent an important change to a no-sanctuary,
antiterrorism policy that involves as many risks as potential
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also prescient and wise scandal politics.
</P>
<P>
   From the first intelligence information about the origin of the
embassy bombs on Aug. 7 through the first discussions of a military
response to the actual plans, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, kept the
tight circle _ including Democrats Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt _
up to date right up through the night before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Because they could see the plans evolving and the policy
changing, they were in position to not only support Clinton when
the attacks began, but to vouch for the legitimacy of his decisions
in the face of a few ugly, ad hominem but, under the circumstances,
inevitable questions from journalistic and political harpies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gingrich even saw to it that one of his political
associates, Rich Galen, sent a blast-fax to conservative talk radio
hosts urging them to lay off the president on the missile strikes,
and making sure they knew of Gingrich's strong support.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same Rich Galen, by the way, who is openly urging
Republican congressional candidates to try to take political
advantage of the president's sex scandal in their television
advertising this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Those Republican politicians who had the sense to check with
their leaders before reacting on Thursday were able to avoid
embarrassment _ Jesse Helms, for example, and especially Orrin
Hatch, whose endorsement bordered on the gushy and was all the more
interesting given his intense anger at the president's remarks
after his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't check and reacted in negative haste made fools
of themselves as they spent most of the following 12 hours walking
back from their initial statements _ notably the normally stable
Senator Dan Coats of Indiana and publicity hound Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that any of the fundamentals of scandal
politics have changed. It is a truism that there isn't a president
deservedly in a very tight spot who has ever derived anything more
than brief advantage from some policy move or emergency that serves
to remind people that he is still president. The fundamental things
always apply as time goes by.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the missile strikes came smack in the
middle of the national sorting out that commenced with Clinton's de
facto admission that he had lied to the public and to his family
and friends ever since January about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The effect has been to defuse at least some of the tension and
intense emotion of the initial reaction among partisans and the
media and to reinforce the less hotheaded and more supportive
feelings of the country at large.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term effect will also be to solidify the astonishing
disconnect between those in public life who like to think of
themselves as opinion leaders and the people who find this notion
of opinion leadership hilarious as well as pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important _ for those screaming prematurely for
resignation or impeachment _ the effect should be to remind one and
all that the removal of an elected president not only requires
clear and convincing proof of a serious crime but also a clear and
convincing mandate from the public before any formal proceedings
can have legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, another effect of the deft execution of an important
security policy change will provide some additional cover for the
delicate repair work Clinton and his family are engaged in on
Martha's Vineyard. Whatever happens next will begin with his
family's emergence from seclusion with its own judgment about how
to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   We can wait, believe it or not, and the military response to a
murderer named bin Laden has made it easier.

CLINTON'S MESSAGE TO STARR IS ALSO THE PEOPLE'S: ENOUGH! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton gave his brief address to the nation
Monday night, he knew exactly whom he was speaking to _ and they
listened with approval.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly wasn't speaking to Republicans, who bristled when
he defiantly criticized Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. And he
wasn't speaking to GOP or Democratic insiders _ those who would
later say he didn't offer sufficient apology for his inappropriate
relatioship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And he certainly wasn't speaking to the newspaper publishers and
editorialists, who have criticized his presidency and now call on
him to resign because of his sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   No, he was speaking to the millions of voters who twice elected
him, flaws and all, and who, throughout Starr's investigation,
continue to give him high approval ratings for his job performance.
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech resonated with these voters. They agreed
with his criticism of Starr and disagreed with the road Starr's
investigation had taken _ from Whitewater ``to my staff and
friends, then into my private life.'' They also agree with
Clinton's view that the investigation by the independent counsel
(he did not use Starr's name) ``has gone on too long, cost too
much, and hurt too many people.'' The polls, which represent the
bulk of the electorate, made it clear that they want this
investigation to end, not in the next few months but today.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the polls reflect, he connected with women voters when
he said that ``this matter is between me, the two people I love the
most _ my wife and my daughter _ and our God'' and that ``it's
nobody's business but ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dig at Starr, Clinton told his audience, ``It is time to
stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into
private lives and get on with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   As the polls reflect, most of the electorate share this view,
which explains why Clinton's job approval at week's end remained in
the 60 percent range, while Starr's remained below 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the majority approves of Clinton's
relationship with a White House intern. Rather, the electorate
feels that this is a private matter between Clinton and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's ratings continue to be abysmally low because the
majority of voters see him as a right-wing Republican partisan out
to destroy the president, even if it means prying into his private
life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a key reason why Clinton continues to have
high approval ratings even after he admitted that he lied when he
denied having a relationship with Lewisnky.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Clinton's continued good standing with voters is
the way Hillary Rodham Clinton has, for whatever reason, stood by
her husband through the thick and thin of this sordid Starr
inquisition. Traditional housewives who once scorned her now
support her for supporting her husband during his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   With the president's approval rating so high, and Starr's so
law, some lawyers and prosecutors familiar with grand jury
proceedings felt that Clinton never should have gone before that
jury at all. By doing so, they argued, he would likely fall into
the perjury trap that Starr has set for him. Starr, they further
argue, could use Clinton's own testimony to show that he originally
lied about having an affair with Lewisnky, suggesting he perjured
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton critics argue that if Clinton were president or
chairman of a private corporation and was found to have had an
affair with a young intern, he would probably be forced by his
board of directors to resign. But in Clinton's case, the
circumstances are different. He is an elected, not an appointed,
president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Congress is not an appointed board of directors,
but an assemblage of officials elected by a clear majority of
voters. Those voters say they do not want Clinton impeached, nor do
they want him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Congress is acutely aware of how hard it would be to
try to impeach a president with an approval rating as high as
Clinton's. Even with the a GOP-majority Congress, such a move would
likely fail. It is more likely that Congress could reprimand or
censure Clinton _ but even then members of Congress would have to
be careful not to infuriate the Clinton-backing public.
</P>
<P>
   To his backers, Clinton is the president who deserves some
credit for a strong economy, as well as his domestic and
international accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Some predicted that when details of Lewinsky's sexual affair
with Clinton was leaked to the media, the effect would be so
damaging that even the president's backers would demand that he
resign. However, it now seems that releasing such information could
backfire on Starr, given the public's clear wish not to know the
details of a private sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton told the nation Monday of the independent counsel's
excesses, his words were also meant as a message to Starr and the
GOP. It is the same message the nation's populace has been sending
to Starr and his GOP supporters for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that, before this sleazy investigation goes any
further, they finally get it.

THE AUTOMOBILE INSPECTION RIPOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who believe government is responsible for solving every
problem frequently believe as well that the ideal solution is one
that irritates the maximum number of people.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent undocumented immigrants from getting jobs, they
require (itals)every(unitals) employee to supply proof of
citizenship and (itals)every(unitals) employer to process the
paperwork _ even though the vast majority of US workers are US
citizens. To find drunk drivers, they set up roadblocks that force
(itals)every(unitals) driver to stop and be hassled _ even though
nearly all drivers are sober. To prevent felons from acquiring
guns, they impose waiting periods and background checks on
(itals)every(unitals) gun buyer _ even though all but a tiny
fraction of them have clean records and lawful intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is presumed guilty until he proves himself innocent _
that is the Big Brother mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to automobile emissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy wasting time and money while accomplishing next to
nothing, you must relish getting a new inspection sticker each
year. You find a service station that does emissions tests, you pay
the fee, a guy sticks a probe up your tailpipe, and a new sticker
goes on your window. Only a small minority of cars fail inspection,
because only a small minority of cars pollute. But this is how
government controllers operate: (itals)Every(unitals) vehicle owner
must be burdened so that a handful of dirty cars can be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Now that burden is to be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is forcing 23 states to adopt ``enhanced'' tailpipe
emissions tests that will prove even more annoying, expensive, and
time-consuming than the current ones. In some states, the enhanced
tests are already in effect _ Maryland began requiring them last
fall, California in June, and Georgia last month. Massachusetts is
scheduled to impose the new tests next May; Rhode Island begins in
January 2000. They are unpopular almost everywhere, and are being
implemented by state legislatures only under the threat of federal
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the new test is a dynamometer, a treadmill-like
device that simulates driving and enables auto exhaust to be
checked even more precisely for pollutants. Dynamometers cost
around $50,000 each, more than most garages can afford to spend. As
a result, far fewer stations can perform the new tests, and those
that do charge a lot more. In Massachusetts, the number of garages
where motorists will be able to get inspection stickers is likely
to drop from 2,200 to 1,200. The fee will jump from $15 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   If not more. ``The test may be $35 to $40,'' Peter Haggerty of
the Environment Protection Agency told the Boston Herald last week.
``That tends to be the range.''
</P>
<P>
   So: Tens of millions of car owners nationwide will be driving
farther to get their car inspected, spending more time undergoing
the test, and paying more for the privilege. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Auto emissions tests are supposed to be critical in the fight
against air pollution. In fact, they are little more than a revenue
scheme for the state and a lucrative perk for service stations.
</P>
<P>
   For the clean little secret of automobile exhaust is that it
isn't very dirty. Since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970,
tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide and hycrocarbons have dropped
by a stunning 98 percent. Most cars don't pollute. Annual
inspections catch so few cars violating emissions standards because
there are so few to catch: As much as 70 percent of
automobile-generated air pollution comes from 10 percent of the
cars. According to Mobile Source Report, a newsletter covering auto
emissions regulation and technology, California service station
owners are already complaining that even with the tough new tests,
only 2 to 3 percent of the fleet doesn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are being milked. They are forking over billions of
dollars to be told, in most cases, that their cars are just fine.
Those billions are not promoting pure air or cleansing the
environment. They are merely enriching state treasuries and
providing income to garages. If emissions tests weren't required by
law, they would be shut down for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory tailpipe inspections would be bad enough even if there
weren't a better way to catch polluting vehicles. But there is.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Denver, research chemists Donald Stedman
and Gary Bishop long ago perfected remote-sensing technology that
makes it possible to check emissions from cars driving along a
highway. In a nutshell: Cars moving past a sensor are scanned by an
infrared beam that instantly calculates the amount of pollution
they are generating. Those not in compliance with the law are
pulled over, and the driver is given 30 days to have the car
repaired and retested. Cars that are clean _ far and away the
majority _ never even have to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments in favor of remote sensing are overwhelming. It's
fast. It's accurate. It's cheater-proof. It's more than 100 times
as efficient as the current system. (A service station, working
very fast, can test eight cars per hour. On-road remote sensing can
test 1,000 cars in that same hour.) It's also far better for air
quality. Under the existing system, a car is free to spew pollution
year-round _ only when the owner brings it in for testing is he
required to get it fixed. With remote sensing, that car will be
stopped the first time it passes by.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is only one argument against on-road testing. It
leaves most people alone. Which is why goats will fly before the
existing system is abandoned. And why you'll keep paying, year
after year, for inspections stickers you don't need.

MICROSOFT, LOTUS STEP UP BATTLE FOR CORPORATE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fight between Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp. to
dominate the market for corporate electronic mail is starting to
get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus last week attacked Microsoft for making ``reckless and
inaccurate'' claims about its momentum in the fast-growing market
for messaging software.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo posted on its World Wide Web site, Lotus accused
Microsoft of playing ``PR games'' in pronouncing its Exchange
software as the ``leading messaging platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant
touted new market research that shows Exchange outsold Lotus' rival
product, Notes, for the second quarter in a row.
</P>
<P>
   According to an industry newsletter, Electronic Mail &AMP; Messaging
Systems, Microsoft sold 3.55 million licenses for Exchange in the
second quarter, while Lotus sold 3.1 million Notes licenses. In the
first quarter, Microsoft sold 3.05 million copies of Exchange,
compared with 2.7 million copies of Notes sold by Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too early in the game to declare victory, but what
this is telling us is that the playing field has shifted
dramatically, and we're the ones with the momentum,'' said Stan
Sorensen, lead product manager for Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But Lotus points out that the figures reported by the newsletter
are actually estimates provided by the vendors themselves, and
because Microsoft counts users differently, the data is skewered in
Microsoft's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mark Leavitt, an analyst who tracks the messaging
industry for International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass., said
the sales numbers both companies provide to the newsletter are
inflated by software licenses that are shipped to customers in a
bundle with other products but aren't necessarily used.
</P>
<P>
   IDC is still compiling market share data for the first half of
1998, but Leavitt said it's clear that after discounting for those
copies of Exchange and Notes that are sold in a bundle but aren't
actually used, the gap between the two rivals will be much smaller,
perhaps about 200,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   The tenacity both companies have displayed in their battle for
market share underscores the potential payoff in the booming market
for groupware _ software that lets distant employees not only send
e-mail but also collaborate on a single project or document.
Analysts predict it will be a $20 billion industry by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., created the market nine years
ago with its introduction of Notes and has seen its sales zoom
since the company was acquired in 1995 by deep-pocketed
International Business Machines Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus still has a commanding lead, but after just two years on
the market, Microsoft Exchange is gaining fast. It has about 16.6
million users, compared with about 25.1 million Notes users, said
Eric Arnum, editor of Electronic Mail &AMP; Messaging Systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnum said that some of Microsoft's recent sales momentum
may be due to the fact that Exchange is at the peak of its product
cycle, while the current version of Lotus Notes is about to be
replaced. He said Lotus will probably pick up momentum later in the
year after the next generation of Notes software debuts.

DENSON PUSHING HIS WAY TO THE FRONT OF THE PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ It may be too soon to tell just how good Damon
Denson, the Patriots' left offensive guard from Michigan, is, but
in almost three quarters Saturday night against the Redskins,
Denson may have made a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damon played very well, really holding his own and then some
out there,'' said coach Pete Carroll after New England's 20-17
exhibition victory at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Denson, a fourth-round 1997 draft pick and one of the
compensation picks the Patriots received from the Jets in the Bill
Parcells matter, has made some progress but has been bothered by
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the Patriots put him into the fire against two
of the best interior linemen in the NFL _ Dana Stubblefield and Dan
Wilkinson _ and Denson not only protected quarterback Drew Bledsoe
well, but he moved Stubblefield and Wilkinson off the line well,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tough, but I think I held my own,'' said Denson.
</P>
<P>
   Denson, who is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 300 pounds, has huge
legs. The Patriots worked with him in the offseason on improving
his mobility and quickness, and that work seems to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Denson entered the game with about eight minutes remaining in
the second quarter in place of Max Lane and played next to Bruce
Armstrong for a while. But Armstrong then was replaced at left
tackle by Lane, who wound up playing a lot there, a sign the
Patriots are making contingency plans in case Armstrong's leg,
which has a stress fracture, sidelines him.
</P>
<P>
   If last night was a preview of life without Armstrong, the
Patriots came out of it all right, because Denson performed well
and Lane also did a credible job. Denson made some nice blocks near
the goal line, although he was called for holding once.
</P>
<P>
   There were some other interesting developments in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran free agent Brian Stablein hasn't been involved much in
the offense throughout the exhibition season. Saturday night he got
very little action as a wide receiver. While it appears Stablein
will make the team based on the $500,000 signing bonus he received
on a three-year, $3 million deal, the Patriots sure are acting like
they may keep Anthony Ladd, a second-year free agent from the
University of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the coaching staff will keep six receivers, with
Stablein No. 6, but over the past few weeks, Carroll and others
have been praising Ladd, who had three catches for 23 yards against
the Redskins. Ladd has superb speed and is a deep threat, while
Stablein is considered more of a possession receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Stablein was signed over Indianapolis teammate Sean Dawkins as
insurance in case the team found a taker for Vincent Brisby. That
didn't happen, and the Patriots began camp with both.
</P>
<P>
   Old reliable Troy Brown continues to make big plays, his 37-yard
catch over the middle during the Patriots' 99-yard scoring drive in
the third quarter a perfect example, so he's not about to
relinquish his role.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Stablein hasn't seen much action because the team
already knows what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' running backs got the tough yardage they weren't
gaining in the regular season a year ago. Sedrick and Harold Shaw
did nice jobs. But what was lacking is the big gain that Curtis
Martin was so good at. Sedrick Shaw ran hard all night but still
hasn't been able to break into the open field.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll plans on giving the ball to Robert Edwards Saturday
night against Philadelphia, providing the No. 1 pick's groin is
better. Even if Edwards has a big game, the Patriots will start the
season with a running back-by-committee situation until someone
establishes himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit and dwell on the situation,'' said
Sedrick Shaw. ``I'm just trying to get better every time out. I
play football, and I think I'll be playing football somewhere. This
career doesn't last very long so you go out and give it everything
every week. That's been my approach.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one breakdown in the defensive secondary, when Kato
Serwanga and Lawyer Milloy seemed confused on coverage of Leslie
Shepherd in the third quarter. The play went for a 48-yard
touchdown, Washington's first score of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said it was a mistake the team could learn from, but it
also pointed out a possible problem with depth. Serwanga was the
nickel back on the play, a spot that usually would go to a veteran
like Steve Israel (knee) or Steve Lofton (shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   As Carroll will utilize Edwards Saturday night, it also should
be the Tebucky Jones Show at right cornerback. Jones has missed the
last two games with a sore toe, and although the rookie from
Syracuse wanted to play Saturday night, he hadn't practiced during
the week and Carroll held him back.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there has never been a cheaper shot than the punch to
the groin Redskins tight end Stephen Alexander laid on Patriots
rookie defensive end Greg Spires in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and Spires had been battling hard, and Spires had been
getting the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   Spires had a sack at the end of the game, got close to the
quarterback several other times, and forced several bad throws.
</P>
<P>
   He was used as a third-down pass rusher with the first team, and
that will continue to be his role.

ACUPUNCTURE GAINS WIDER ACCEPTANCE AS A TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC
DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A patch on Art Soto's abdomen continuously
releases a morphine-like drug into his system to lessen the
discomfort from his long battle with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But once a week, Soto also avails himself of a much different
painkiller: acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   As the needles are gently inserted and twisted into his legs,
Soto says he feels more energized, and the throbbing and numbing
begins to subside.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, especially for pain management, is becoming more
common. Health maintenance organizations are starting to pay for
the ancient Chinese therapy, and last week the California
Legislature sent the governor a bill requiring workers'
compensation policies to cover it. Many already do.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, doctors are seeing more patients whose regimens
include treatments such as acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which
Soto also takes. The issue has become more pressing for mainstream
medicine since the National Institutes of Health last year gave
acupuncture a qualified endorsement for treating post-operative and
dental pain, nausea from chemotherapy, and morning sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Sterling, who is Soto's acupuncturist, said the walls
between western and alternative medicine are starting to come down.
She now talks with the doctors of some of her patients about their
care. And the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine,
where she is a dean, is in the midst of discussions with the Kaiser
Permanente health maintenance organization and the University of
California at San Francisco about joint efforts that could bring
the two approaches closer together, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, medical centers and senior centers are also seeking
to explore possible relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is definitely going to this _ quote _ integrative
care,'' Sterling said. ``It means more patients and more revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser spokeswoman Lila Petersen said the HMO does offer
acupuncture in its chronic pain management program to patients
referred by their primary care physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, our patients are asking for alternative health
care methods, so we are working to provide those services,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the treatments are controversial in some quarters, and
its underlying mechanisms remain a mystery to western medicine.
Sterling said the therapies work by manipulating the patient's life
energy, or ``qi'' (pronounced ``chi'').
</P>
<P>
   In an exam room at the American College of Traditional Chinese
Medicine's Potrero Hill clinic, Sterling begins Soto's treatment by
asking about his health during the past week. He undresses, and
Sterling runs her hands down his legs, where Soto has complained of
pain. When he responds to her touch, she calls out ``Liver 8'' or
``Spleen 1'' _ points on his ``channels'' that are blocked.
</P>
<P>
   She explains that the channels lose their ``moisture'' because
of the HIV infection and as a result the energy is obstructed,
causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sterling and an assistant insert and twirl half a
dozen needles into specific locations on Soto's legs and feet.
Sterling says she can feel the needle interact with the qi, ``like
a fish on a hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the needles are then attached to a device that sends out
an electrical current. A few minutes later, Sterling uses an
acupressure technique on Soto's chest and forehead, and then a
cigar-like stick of herbs is lighted and passed back and forth over
his abdomen, which is supposed to help ease his stomach problems,
caused by taking more than 30 pills a day to control AIDS. All of
this happens while gentle guitar music overlaid on the sounds of
the ocean play on a cassette player nearby.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the theory and the practice seem fuzzy, and skeptics
chalk up the many patient testimonials to the placebo effect. The
National Council Against Health Fraud's position paper on
acupuncture says it remains unproven and its ``theory and practice
are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease
that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some studies have shown that there are physiological
changes _ including the release of the body's own natural
painkillers, endorphins _ during treatment, suggesting there may be
something more at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more insurance companies are saying, `Gee, there
might be some literature to support this, so let's have it as a
covered benefit,''' said Ellen Hughes, interim director of the
Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The university has begun a research study with breast cancer
patients to look at the benefits of acupuncture in treating the
side effects of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful scientific minds are looking at the data, and there's
more of it,'' Hughes said. ``It's going to be more mainstream.''

RUSSIA'S ILLS SHAKE FAITH IN MARKET CURE-ALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moscow's recent financial upheaval has jolted its leaders and
people and sent tremors through global markets. It has also exposed
troubling questions about the extent to which Russia has made any
economic progress since the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, many economists and policy makers thought
Russia was well on its way to becoming a market economy, if not
already there. Some still do. But for others, Russia's latest
debacle has sparked a crisis of faith &UR;  &LR; in how to repair troubled
economies. From a belief in the transformative power of Western aid
to certainty that market laws can work as well in Novosibirsk as in
New York, a slew of cherished assumptions has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some economists increasingly see Russia's reforms as
illusory. And a new generation of analysts is confounded by what it
sees as a rift between iron-clad market laws and the reality of a
country that often seems to defy those laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Russia effectively devalued the ruble by 34 percent,
raising the specter &UR;  &LR; of political and social instability in the
former Communist giant. The tempest came after Asia's storm passed
over Moscow in October, pressuring the ruble, which had been
largely stable for four years, and scaring Asian and Western
investors out of the government debt market, a key source of state
funding. Moscow, strapped for cash, declared a temporary moratorium
on some debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The moves threaten to undermine years of positive
changes. &UR;  &LR; This time last year, more than 80 percent of state
property had been privatized, and Moscow seemed willing to let
market forces, not insider business cliques, dominate sales.
Foreigners poured into the stock market in 1996 and 1997 and bagged
triple-digit gains. Inflation, an official 1,353 percent in 1992,
was tamed to 14 percent in 1997. And last year Russia saw growth,
albeit slight, for the first time in eight years. Growth would more
than double to 1 percent this year, and top 5.9 percent in 1999,
according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The results, the conventional wisdom went, showed that giant
leaps forward had been taken over seven years and that the West
should keep pouring money and advice into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ugly problems remained. Corruption, the inability of most
enterprises and the state to pay workers and suppliers, weak tax
collection, and an opposition-dominated parliament unwilling to
pass laws all hampered progress. But the hurdles were not seen as
insurmountable. Tax reform, currency support, and government fiscal
austerity _ all standard IMF prescriptions _ would lead to
functioning companies and markets. Economists and international
lending institutions focused on fiscal policy as the key to getting
Russia back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are serious distortions, but I would still call Russia a
market economy,'' said Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, whose views echo the
conventional wisdom of US policy makers and international lenders.
``There's an understanding that radical, fast, simple reforms are
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, those assessments are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a new thesis that challenges sacred Western notions of what
the former Cold War foe needs to become a democratic market
economy, two American scholars call Russia a sickly and spectral
``virtual economy,'' neither capitalist nor planned, that the West
has unwittingly helped create.
</P>
<P>
   In a research paper that first appeared in June, Clifford G.
Gaddy, a Brookings Institution fellow, and Barry W. Ickes, an
economics professor at Penn State University, say tax reforms and
fiscal austerity measures will do little to aid the ailing
enterprises they see as the root of Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they say, Russia is nothing like a market economy, and
is instead a shell game, in which barter, not cash, drives the
system, workers are not paid on time, and taxes cannot be collected
from producers because customers, including the state, do not pay
on time, if ever. Scores of overstaffed factories still produce
goods at a loss. Any profits made are whisked to offshore accounts.
Most banks, insolvent, have invested in high-returning state debt
rather than domestic companies with world-class oil and metals
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Few dispute that description. But many economists see the
problems as imperfections _ admittedly serious _ rather than fatal
flaws. For most of this decade, economists working on Russia have
gone on the assumption that enacting tax reforms and laws requiring
companies to pay in cash will produce market-oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   That is a mistake, according to Gaddy and Ickes. ``It has almost
been an iron law that if you get the macro-economic side right,
you'll get positive results,'' said Gaddy. ``But there's this one
little exception called Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   As the latest entry in a burgeoning debate over Russia's chances
for revitalization, the ``virtual economy'' assessment highlights a
growing lack of consensus on why Russia has bounced from one crisis
to another this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, a version of which will be published in the September
issue of Foreign Affairs, began circulating last month in halls
ranging from the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Department
to the Russian Central Bank and Moscow brokerages, just as the IMF
approved another $11.2 billion loan to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Already it has raised hackles and alarms.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Millar, an economics professor at George Washington
University, takes odds with Gaddy's and Ickes dead-end view that
loss-making enterprises have no value and must be shut down _ a
move the government is unlikely to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that logic, New York should have ceased to exist long
ago,'' Millar said, referring to the city's debt crisis in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists stress the need for Russia to resolve its
structural problems. Unlike Gaddy and Ickes, who focus on Russia's
corporate crisis, most finger Moscow's fiscal crisis, the Asian
flu, and low world oil prices that have slashed Moscow's hard
currency earnings as the main culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's crisis has also reignited debate over the role of
international lending institutions in curing ailing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Against the IMF's failure to predict Asia's economic turmoil and
to stave off Russia's quandary, economists are once again
questioning the efficacy of Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF is an incompetent institution that hasn't ever known
what it's doing in Russia,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Harvard
economist who advised the Yeltsin government in the early 1990s but
quit in disgust at what he saw as a lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's crisis does not challenge the classical economic
tenets, Sachs said, successful reforms were not guaranteed. The
reason, he said, was that Russia's fate had as much to do with
things the West can control, such as timely international aid, as
with things it can't, such as Russia's sprawling land mass and
centuries-old history of authoritarian rule without private
property.
</P>
<P>
   Can the West influence a fourth factor key to reform _ Russia's
own policies? One assumption behind the $31.2 billion committed by
the IMF to Russia since 1992 is that it can, and the IMF now makes
passage of key policy measures by the Russian parliament a
condition of receiving money.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddy and Ickes assert that policies do not automatically create
markets and that foreign aid is a wishful conceit. Their solution
is for the West to throw in the towel, cut funding, and accept that
Russia cannot restructure inefficient enterprises and lay off
legions of workers without bringing the house to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West should accept that radical economic reform in Russia
is incompatible with social stability,'' Gaddy said.
</P>
<P>
   With an economy no larger than Canada's, Russia does not yet
affect world markets as Asia does _ temblors in global debt markets
and anxiety among big-lending German banks excepted. The Russian
stock market, down 79 percent so far this year and now with a
capitalization no bigger than that of a decent-sized US company,
has played a lesser role. Russian citizens, who prefer cash to
shares, could not care less, and the effect on US stocks has been
slight.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rumblings raise other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Burton G. Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton
University, wonders if Russia's latest crisis might be evidence
that flows of capital, ranging from international loans to capital
flight, make life tougher for struggling economies with little
leeway for maneuver, especially when debt payments come due. ``It's
clearly a downside to the free-market model and may imply a kind of
inherent instability in the free-market system that makes it
difficult for countries to cope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western economists and policy makers assumed successful
reforms in Eastern Europe in the post-Communist period could be
grafted onto Russia. Instead, Moscow's straits may suggest that
troubled and transitional economies are increasingly willing to
take riskier, iconclastic steps to try to save themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to restructure $40 billion in short-term debt, much
of it owned by foreigners, Russia crossed a line that could lock it
out of international capital markets for years. Moscow's opting to
delay debt payments, on the heels of Hong Kong's shock suggestion
last month that capital flows in the Asian free-market mecca be
controlled to stave off financial collapse, has shown that sick
economies are more willing to implement less conventional measures,
said Morris Goldstein of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the West has been telling Russia what to do. Now, a
new generation of economists suspects Russia might be telling the
West a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of an era of believing that markets would lead
to capitalism would lead to wealth,'' said Alastair P. M. Breach, a
junior economist at the Russian-European Center for Economic
Research in Moscow. ``Suddenly, you realize that with Russia,
you're dealing with something completely different.''

DION IS A DREAM IN WORLD-TOUR LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Call it the coronation of Celine _ and who would argue
after Friday's spectacular performance at the FleetCenter? Celine
Dion, better known as just Celine to the millions of fans who
scooped up the ``Titanic'' soundtrack, opened her world tour with a
high-tech, in-the-round show (on a heart-shaped stage, no less)
that sent a sold-out crowd of 18,300 fans into complete rapture.
</P>
<P>
   It was glitzy but glitch-free. She had told the crowd there
might be ``mistakes,'' but none were visible. And Dion stayed
genuine even amid a lighting grid the size of a spaceship and a
series of video duets with Barbra Streisand and the Bee Gees that
threatened to get hokey. OK, maybe they did, but were still saved
by her utter sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``New shoes, new clothes, new hair!'' exclaimed Dion, whose
long, tangly hair weave nearly went to her waist, though she pulled
it back Kate Winslet-like for a thrilling encore of ``Titanic'' hit
``My Heart Will Go On,'' for which she also wore an Edwardian ball
gown and sang from a white railing as though she were on the
Titanic's bow. No sentimentality was spared, but it was an
effective moment of pop theater and the crowd loved it. She kept
the crowd waiting until the end to hear it, but it sent everyone
home in a state of smiling grace.
</P>
<P>
   This was an upbeat, entertaining show that focused on Dion's
last album, ``Let's Talk About Love,'' and was enhanced by some
personal (and unrecorded) favorites that allowed her personality to
rise above the show-biz effects.
</P>
<P>
   These favorites came via an acoustic medley in which she
gathered her musicians around her at the center of the stage, as
she sat on a hydraulically lifted swivel chair. She mesmerized with
delicate rendering of Roberta Flack's ``The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face,'' soothed with the Beatles' ``Because,'' touched hearts
with Eric Clapton's ``Tears in Heaven,'' and woke up the romantics
in the house with Frank Sinatra's ``All the Way,'' describing it as
the favorite ``couple'' song between her and her husband/manager
Rene Angelil, who watched nervously from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nerves, Dion said, ``I'm so nervous tonight because
this is the first show.'' She had reason to worry, as camera crews
from all over the US and Canada filmed her every move on the first
couple of songs, before being ushered away. Those first two songs
were the album title track ``Let's Talk About Love'' (augmented by
a talented chorus from the W.H. Lincoln School in Brookline) and
``Declaration of Love.'' Yes, the word love was in both titles,
hinting at the direction to come.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese violinist Taro Hasake came out for a bravura ``To Love
You More'' (there's that word again), followed shortly by Dion
singing ``Tell Him'' with a video image of Streisand. Then came two
French songs (led by ``S'il Suffisait Qu'on S'Aime,'' translated
``If It Were Enough that We Love Each Other,'' she said), before
she improvised beautifully on Eric Carmen's ``All by Myself.'' She
joked that she was hardly by herself, because 50 people were
working under the in-the-round stage.
</P>
<P>
   The overwrought portion of the show came on a Bee Gees medley of
``Staying Alive/You Should Be Dancing,'' with Dion, in only her
first costume change (Diana Ross would have had eight by then),
prancing in a creamy white suit like John Travolta. It was fun, but
it would have been nice to hear some of Dion's earlier hits (where
was ``The Power of Love'' and ``If You Asked Me To''?) instead of
these cover tunes.
</P>
<P>
   For pure entertainment, however, this was a volcanic triumph.
Dion thanked Boston fans for ``being lucky charm people''; this was
the third time she's opened a world tour here. This was the
biggest, for Queen Celine now reigns.

INSTEAD OF PITCHING, THINK COMPOSTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mail brought questions about compost this week. How is it
beneficial, and how can we make this special material in our home
gardens?
</P>
<P>
   Compost is an excellent form of organic matter to add to the
soil in your garden. You can buy bags of compost from your garden
center, or build a simple compost bin or pile in your back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Compost is a mixture of organic matter such as grass clippings,
leaves, pine needles, bark and kitchen scraps (including eggshells,
coffee grounds and vegetables, but excluding meats). All these are
readily available around many households. When the circus comes to
town, my husband likes to bring home elephant poop in large,
extra-heavy plastic bags. He then works the manure into his compost
system. It's good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   We try to use a good mix of greens and browns in making compost.
Greens _ fresh plant parts and kitchen scraps _ are sources of
nitrogen and protein. Browns _ straw and fallen leaves _ are carbon
sources. Manure is a great source of protein. The end result when
these several ingredients break down is a crumbly, dark material
that is loaded with macro- and micronutrients. We spread this
around beds like a mulch. We work it into soil in new beds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IDEAL SOIL AMENDMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compost is the ideal soil amendment _ it not only increases
nutrients, it also improves the soil texture. It loosens tight,
heavy clays, allowing greater movement of water, air and roots. It
tightens loose, sandy soils so that roots will have a better chance
to absorb water and nutrients. Compost encourages beneficial soil
organisms that in turn wage war on disease organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Our compost system is in a rear corner of our garden, accessible
but camouflaged by large shrubs such as eleagnus and azaleas and
near a water spigot. It is a system of three bins _ one to collect
organic ingredients, another for cooking compost, the third
containing finished compost. Our rectangular bins are low, about
thigh-high, and made of landscape timbers. Side timbers are laid on
top of end timbers to allow maximum air circulation. The timbers
were our only costs. All the materials used in making the compost
are free _ even the elephant poop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pushing food scraps down a disposal, we put coffee
grounds, eggshells and vegetable leftovers in a plastic bucket with
a lid, then transfer this goop to the pile every day or two.
Leaves, grass clippings and other plant parts are mixed in. By
recycling garden wastes, we avoid sending useful materials to the
landfill and we use a lot fewer plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   Once your bin is built (you can buy compost bins or tumblers),
pile alternate layers of organic matter and soil in the receptacle.
Start with about six inches of organic matter, then add an inch of
soil. The soil is beneficial because it contains microorganisms
that help break down the organic matter. Continue this layering,
watering each layer until the pile is about four feet high. Create
a bowl in the center of the pile and add water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COOK AND TURN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As decomposition takes place, the center will heat up and kill
any traces of disease. Turn the compost pile with a fork or shovel,
shifting undecayed matter to the center so that it can cook. The
compost is finished when the pile no longer generates heat.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the compost at least once a week and you may have a
finished product in a month. If you turn it only once a month,
you'll have to wait about three months. If you find the pile is
cooking too slowly, add nitrogen in the form of grass clippings,
kitchen scraps, manure, blood meal, cottonseed meal and/or alfalfa
meal.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need an elaborate system to compost. You can use a
plastic garbage can with holes drilled in the bottom and sides for
aeration. Elevate the can on bricks or some stable base to ensure
good aeration. Garbage-can composting is handy if you have small
amounts of material to compost. Just layer organic matter and soil,
and add a little water. Stir from time to time and you'll
eventually have compost.
</P>
<P>
   One reader asked about composting in a large plastic bag. This
easy method is anaerobic _ oxygen-deprived _ and you'll notice an
odor if you open the bag before the ingredients are decomposed.
Collect kitchen and garden scraps in a bag, add a couple of quarts
of water, shake to moisten the ingredients, seal and you'll have
compost in a few months. Roll the bag around from time to time to
encourage quicker decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   You can make great leaf mold, nature's compost, by simply
bagging leaves, adding a little water and waiting.
</P>

CORRESPONDENCE AT BOILING POINT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ During my years as a baseball writer, August was often
referred to as the ``dog days'' of a long, arduous season.
</P>
<P>
   Seems sports and travel have much in common. Except in this
instance, some folks are urging my banishment to the doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of heated correspondence always increases this time
of year. It's understandable: We've sweated through too many
100-degree afternoons; we're weary from getting the kids off to
school; and our much-anticipated vacation is history, with the only
reminders a photograph album and a hefty stack of credit-card
bills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BRISTLING ABOUT B&AMP;BS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several readers, including a few Texas bed-and-breakfast
operators, are especially hot under the collar _ not from the
weather but from my recent suggestion that a first-rate B&AMP;B owes
its guests a full, freshly prepared breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   One traveler labeled me an elitist who doesn't appreciate small,
hospitable lodgings that offer tiny cereal boxes and a carton of
milk, available to suit the guest's schedule _ not the agenda of
the host and cook.
</P>
<P>
   Another correspondent, Cynthia Smith, owner of Smith's Tin House
B&AMP;B in Johnson City, was kinder but equally pointed in her
constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wrote: ``All bed-and-breakfasts are not `owner-on-premise'
and traditional. I was very disappointed in your view of Hill
Country bed-and-breakfasts that were not in a position to serve a
hot breakfast. How in Sam Hill do you figure that we, in a private
guest house, aka bed-and-breakfast establishment, could host a
steaming hot gourmet breakfast when most of us don't even have a
working stove in the kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we do leave a handwritten note. And yes, breakfast does
get nuked or zapped in the microwave. But I assure that what is
getting nuked is homemade and wonderful. We even inquire if our
guests have special dietary wishes. (We provide) fresh fruit,
sometimes wine and snacks. Our home-cooked goods, albeit
`yesterday's,' is something we pride ourselves on in our group of
owners in Johnson City.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me say that I also heard from more than a handful of
readers _ and B&AMP;B owners _ who applauded my position. One
Fredericksburg innkeeper corresponded, too, to say that she _ like
several peers _ now offers guests the option of a hot breakfast
served formally at an established time or a pre-prepared meal
available in the room at any hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five percent choose the hot meal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I respect that every traveler has individual likes and
dislikes. I'll concede, too, that one innkeeper's ``pre-prepared''
breakfast _ not the day-old goodies I microwaved, though _ may
prove tastier than another's hot-off-the-stove concoction. Given
her obvious passion, I'll wager that Cynthia Smith's Tin House B&AMP;B
serves up a scrumptious feast. And I've visited some idyllic one-
and two-room hideaways in the Hill Country where raiding the
refrigerator for sweet rolls, fruit and juice serves as the perfect
morning pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Donna Mittel, proprietor of Gstehaus Schmidt
reservations service in Fredericksburg, suggests that one of that
area's prime assets involves the wide range of lodging choices
offered visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone calls for a reservation and has never stayed with
us before, we ask, `Are you wanting to stay in a traditional
bed-and-breakfast or a guest house?''' Mittel wrote. ``If they do
not know the difference, we educate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our guests actually prefer a guest house, because a
guest house offers complete privacy, rest and relaxation,'' Mittel
continued. ``If they want to get out of bed at 10 o'clock, drink
coffee in their pajamas and enjoy breakfast on the front porch,
they are able to do this without another thought or call from their
hosts. In our business, there is an option for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Well said. And I know Gstehaus Schmidt as a dedicated
professional service that helps each individual match his or her
tastes to just the right property. My concern isn't with the
guest-house concept to which Mittel refers. I just question if all
travelers _ and dare I say some innkeepers? _ easily connote
fine-line differences in industry-applied terminology such as
``traditional B&AMP;B,'' ``guest house,'' ``country inn'' and
``historical home.'' I'm still shaking my head over a call from a
well-intentioned woman whose son had just departed for college and
who asked, ``What do I need to do to turn his room into a B&AMP;B?''
</P>
<P>
   Guests have a right to know what they are getting in return for
their hard-earned money. And if they want, and expect, to feast on
a box of cereal and carton of milk in their jammies, that's fine
with me. Been there. Done that.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well, I'll soon be out of the pen. Dog days are almost over.

A YEAR LATER, DIANA'S STORY STILL SURPRISES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``The Day Diana Died''; By Christopher Andersen; (Morrow, $27) 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dearth of new information hasn't stopped a flood of new books
coinciding with the first anniversary of the car accident that
killed the Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The one that is likely to get the most attention is this
meticulous account by Christopher Andersen, a former senior editor
for People magazine and the author of such celebrity tomes as
``Jackie After Jack'' and ``Madonna Unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Day Diana Died,'' which reads like a long People article,
covers familiar ground in tracing the princess' final days leading
up to the Aug. 31, 1997, automobile crash in a Paris tunnel that
also killed her companion, Dodi Fayed, and driver, Henri Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen concludes that the crash was caused by Paul, who was
drunk, and that Diana most likely would have survived if she'd been
wearing her seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   But he adds to such familiar information a number of gossipy
revelations in which Diana lovers will revel.
</P>
<P>
   If his disclosures are to be believed, Queen Elizabeth II was a
coldhearted monarch who remained clueless about how deeply moved
her subjects were by the death of her former daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Upon receiving word of Diana's death, the queen demanded that
any royal jewels in the princess' possession be returned
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   She also insisted that her grandsons, William and Harry, attend
a church service just four hours after learning of their mother's
death. When, at the queen's orders, no mention of Diana's death was
made at the service, Harry turned to Prince Charles and whispered,
``Are you sure Mummy is dead?''
</P>
<P>
   The queen relented and addressed the nation several days later
after Charles had issued an ultimatum: If she didn't, he would
publicly apologize for her callous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While the queen comes across as a villain, Charles is portrayed
as a hero. According to Andersen, Charles seemed truly stunned by
Diana's death and wept openly when he heard the news. He
immediately sent her favorite flowers _ white lilies _ to the
hospital room and called to request that her gold earrings be put
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana always likes to wear her earrings in public,'' he said,
still speaking of his ex-wife in the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   Against his mother's wishes, he flew to Paris with Diana's
sisters to accompany her body to England, and he spent much of the
following week circumventing the queen in order to present a public
funeral that would pay proper tribute to his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Diana's death, no item is too trivial or
ghoulish to report. Andersen reveals that her coffin featured a
window above her face and that her body was returned to England in
a dress borrowed from the wife of the British ambassador to France
because Mohammed Fayed, the father of her lover, had already had
her belongings in Paris packed and shipped out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A large chunk of Andersen's breezy 270-page book is a rehash of
Diana's life before that fateful day. Those looking for new
information can browse the 21-page first chapter for details that
are then amplified toward the end of the book.

`STINKY CHEESE' MEN TRY THEIR HAND AT CLEVER, WISE FABLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A grasshopper conveniently forgets hoework. A gullible frog
buys skateboard shoes advertised on television. A duckbilled
platypus and a BeefSmakStik argue about attributes.
</P>
<P>
   You know these characters. Maybe they sit next to you at work.
Or live in your house. Or squat in the branches of your family
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, the dynamic duo that produced
``Math Curse'' and ``The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid
Tales,'' have moved on to fables with ``Squids Will Be Squids,
Fresh Morals, Beastly Fables'' (Viking, $17.99).
</P>
<P>
   Fables, they say, are merely rude gossip and bad jokes about
``bossy, sneaky, funny, annoying, dim-bulb people.'' Except change
the people to animals and add a moral to make the jokes and gossip
socially redeeming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stinky Cheese Man'' is a kids book. Kids love it. They get it.
Parents don't. ``I'm so tired of reading that book over and over
and over,'' more that one parent has said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultraclever and sneaky ``Math Curse'' makes any other book
or game that declares ``math is fun and important'' seem drier than
a Texas pasture in August.
</P>
<P>
   The big question: Could the dynamic duo outdo themselves again?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Yes. YEs. YES.
</P>
<P>
   The new book presents 18 fables for ages 49-630 (in dog years).
These are read-aloud stories, mostly because they are so funny you
can't keep them to yourself. And you can't read just one.
</P>
<P>
   Scieszka writes for children, but there is a fable for President
Clinton (``Little Walrus''), another for a brother, although of
course it has nothing to do with him. This is more Dilbert than
Dilbert. More Thurber than Thurber. Monty Python with a heart for
children. Real chicken soup for what's ailing, whether a timid soul
or a grouchy grimace.
</P>
<P>
   This guy knows kids. In fact, he's probably a kid himself. Could
an adult brain really come up with Spanking Head? Or a talking
larva? Or an argument between Toast and Froot Loops? Or a moral
like, ``Everyone knows frogs can't skateboard, but it's kind of sad
that they believe everything they see on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Scieszka's words are masterful in their cleverness and wisdom,
rich and thick like swimming in fudge.
</P>
<P>
   Is Scieszka really this funny and clever and awesomely
entertaining?
</P>
<P>
   We asked his 14-year-daughter, Casey. Fourteen-year-old
daughters know the truth about parents. And they tell.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Casey from her home in Brooklyn, N.Y. Her father is
indeed funny.
</P>
<P>
   No, he doesn't embarrass her in front of friends. Pause. ``Maybe
it's that I don't find what he does embarrassing,'' she said. ``My
friends don't mind being around him.''
</P>
<P>
   She likes her dad's new book. ``Straw and Matches'' is her
favorite fable.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Smith draws Casey's favorite and the other sparse tales _
the squid and the self-centered slug, the termite and the
misunderstood wasp _ with the gusts of eccentricity equal to
Scieszka's. This is craziness with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Leach gets a small-type credit as the book's designer. She
is likely the one who makes it soup. She's also married to Lane
Smith. She must be patient as well as talented.
</P>
<P>
   These fables are all about truth, selfishness, thoughtfulness,
vanity and more. Kids will get them. Some adults will too. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Squids'' is a lesson in social behavior, ``Home Run'' is a
lesson on an American icon. Aug. 16 was the 50th anniversary of
Babe Ruth's death. ``Home Run: The Story of Babe Ruth'' (Harcourt
Brace, $16) celebrates the man and the game of baseball with
simplicity and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burleigh's words are poetic _ ``He is the Babe. He has
always loved this game. This baseball. But what he does not know
yet is this: He will change the game he loves. Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful. Burleigh lovingly smashes one into the stands with
this book.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wimmer's illustrations _ joyful, Norman Rockwell-like and
full of compassion and power _ are oil on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Details and facts of George Herman Ruth's life and career don't
clutter the narrative. They are told, one on each page, via
vintage-style baseball cards. One explains how Ruth got the
nickname, another how he was famous for leaving $100 tips when he
was on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   Recommended age is 6-10. Or anybody who loves baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Queens, Portraits of Women of Power'' (Dutton, $24.99) is
a beautifully produced 134-page book that shows how powerful women
pushed civility on civilization from the 5th century B.C. to the
18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits are a mixture of women known mostly through folk
legends, and some who are unfamiliar. Author Milton Meltzer
explained how he chose the women: ``These are not women who were
called queens because they happened to marry a king and had little
or nothing to say about ruling the country. ... Most ruled in their
own right. ... Or if they sat on thrones beside kings, they had as
much or more to say about governing than their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   He also explained the difficulty of writing stories about people
who lived thousands of years ago. He had to rely on archaeological
evidence and sources like shrines and coins as he shifted through
legends.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are told clearly and are filled with interesting
details, a history textbook better told. None of the 10 women lived
in peaceful, untroubled times.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, by Bethanne Andersen. are beautiful and give an
aura of storybook instead of history book.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 queens are: Esther, Cleopatra, Boudicca, Zenobia, Eleanor
of Aquitaine, Isabel of Spain, Elizabeth I, Christina of Sweden,
Maria Theresa and Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Queens'' is an inspired idea that should help equalize the
telling of history, which is usually done from the male point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   While these are three distinctly different books, each is a
stepladder for a child to be a bit stronger and a bit braver. And,
in the case of ``Squids,'' giggling all the way.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The problem with superpowers
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's such a bother being a great power and leader of the free
world sometimes you wonder if it's worth it. Terrorists bomb two of
our embassies, killing hundreds. We retaliate. The administration
swears we nailed a chemical weapons plant in Sudan and a terrorist
camp in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner does the last piece of shrapnel fall and most
Americans are feeling better about being a great power than a few
politicians say it's ``Wag the Dog'' all over again. The whole
thing, they say, has the odor of a counter-Lewinsky love triangle.
Then they say maybe it doesn't, but Bill Clinton made us think it
did.
</P>
<P>
   They demonstrate something fierce in the streets of Kabul. The
Sudanese say we hit the only darned pharmaceutical plant in the
whole country. For both notoriously oppressive governments, getting
bombed is the most popular thing they've ever done. Television
crews, not knowing what to believe, stumble through the rubble and
take pictures of whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we're keeping mum, presumably protecting secrets.
This is the problem of being a superpower. It makes you act and
sound like one, sending in cruise missiles, making enigmatic
statements that sound funny both here and abroad. Terrorism is at
least by half a propaganda war. We should know that by now and
should have a few skills.

PRICE OF PUBLIC OFFICE IS LOSS OF SOME PRIVACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Let's face it, folks. We have a boring governor.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about his college days, but most of the headlines
that George W. Bush has been producing out of Austin have been real
snoozers, compared to what we have been reading from Washington
about another prominent leader.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to mid-life hanky-panky, Gov. Bush is no President
Clinton, and Texans of all political persuasions can be thankful
for that.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton was simmering in the Monica Lewinsky scandal last
week, Bush was promoting the character issue back in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated some of his favorite themes _ abstinence before
marriage for young people and personal responsibility for all. And
he said the president's ``not appropriate'' relationship with a
White House intern and Clinton's lies about it had helped solidify
character as a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is right. Character is a legitimate political
concern. Although public officials, even presidents, are entitled
to some privacy, their constituents also are entitled to expect
those lives to be guided by a moral compass that doesn't seem to be
in need of constant repair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said it was ``up to the American people to determine''
where to draw the line between a candidate's public and private
life.
</P>
<P>
   Again, his statement is correct. Although the media are
frequently accused of excess in reporting on the personal lives of
public figures _ and sometimes the complaints are legitimate _ it
ultimately is up to readers and viewers _ the public _ to determine
what is important or relevant and what is not.
</P>
<P>
   Many elected officials and people seeking elected office are
quick to accuse the media of being intrusive, but they would have
us forget that they are also attempting to intrude on our lives
when they offer themselves for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up a lot of their privacy is a price they must pay for
public service because the quality of that service can be affected
to a large extent by their personal views and experiences, family
backgrounds and business connections.
</P>
<P>
   As the son of a former president, Bush should know this better
than most people. But he sometimes displays a touchiness that makes
one wonder how much confidence he really has in the voters' ability
to decide what information is important about a public figure.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was noticeably unhappy as Houston Chronicle
reporter R.G. Ratcliffe was completing a story, published last
week, about profitable dealings that some of Bush's former business
associates have had with state government.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence, as the article pointed out, that Bush had
intervened on his friends' behalf or that he even knew they were
doing business with the state. But Bush apparently feared that the
article would suggest unseemly insider dealings or paint him
guilty, by association, of using government to help his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's detractors will pounce on any opportunity to
criticize him, and the story's headline may find its way into a
campaign ad for Garry Mauro, the governor's Democratic re-election
challenger. But that kind of reaction to publicity comes with the
territory for an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers probably didn't consider the business dealings
unethical, and there wasn't any evidence of illegal activity. But
the deals certainly were interesting, and that's why they were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The state's teacher retirement system, for example, sold three
office buildings to a real estate company owned by a wealthy,
former business partner and major financial contributor to the
governor, losing $44 million on one of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   And the state's education trust funds have invested almost $20
million in the same real estate company since Bush became governor.
</P>
<P>
   Does the public have an interest in knowing how the governor's
friends are faring in their business dealings with state
government? You bet they do.
</P>
<P>
   An even truer test of Bush's willingness to let the public be
the judge will come if he, as expected, wins re-election and wages
his own campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Every aspect of his life _ including the ``young and
irresponsible'' days that he admits to in his younger years _ will
be examined and re-examined by thousands of reporters, whose
standard for what constitutes news may not match his own.
</P>
<P>
   Buckle up, governor.

CARRIAGE LIGHTS ADD A TOUCH OF YESTERYEAR TO THE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Carriage lamps or lanterns add the feeling of an
earlier time to a home.
</P>
<P>
   These sturdy lanterns were originally used on road coaches and
carriages of the 18th and 19th centuries to provide safety and
illumination, just as car headlights do today.
</P>
<P>
   Early carriage lamps were illuminated by lighted candles. The
lamps of a road coach always stayed in place whether lighted or
not. Some coaches were equipped with five lamps: one at the
foot-board for boarding and disembarking and two on each side of
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   A red lamp also was hung below the boot to the rear of the coach
for driving on roads at night anywhere there was motor traffic.
Some lamps featured only a round piece of red glass centered in the
pane of clear glass.
</P>
<P>
   In later years carriage lamps that were used for house
decoration were illuminated with oil or gas. Today they are all
electrified.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't fortunate enough to find an antique set of
lanterns to wire, there are many new models in electrical stores to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Today's carriage lamps or lanterns for the home come in a
variety of shapes and sizes. Depending on the decor and period of
your home, finishes include polished brass, antique brass, glossy
black, brown or white enamel and verdigris (antique green patina,
such as aged copper).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to brass, new lamps are constructed of either cast
aluminum, which doesn't tarnish, or aluminum, which will pit and
rust.
</P>
<P>
   Pole lamps are an easy way to illuminate a dark corner on your
property, such as a garden area with a bench or attractive shrubs
or trees. However, they are more commonly used to define the
entrance to a walk or driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The light bulb for a carriage lamp is usually not as bright as
ones used for a spotlight or at the rear or main entrance of your
home. They are usually 25 to 100 watts.
</P>
<P>
   Bulb styles vary, from a traditional-shaped bulb to a
flame-shaped bulb that is either frosted or clear with a filament
that flickers like a flame.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to vary the wattage of various exterior lighting
fixtures to create different moods, from functional to romantic
ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Wall-mounted carriage lamps start at approximately $50 for a 13
1/2-inch-by-6-inch size to $150 for a large 25-inch by 8 1/2-inch
post carriage lamp.

   MARRAKESH, Morocco _ Not long ago the imam at the Casbah mosque
agreed to show me his ancient minbar _ Minbars are decorated wooden
staircases on wheels from which the imam addresses the congregation
during Friday worship. The idea was to compare it to the
12th-century minbar from the Kutubiyya mosque here, which
conservators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art have lately
restored and installed to justified local fanfare, in the remains
of the city's immense Badi Palace. The smaller Casbah minbar is
great, too _ though a wreck _ and is still in use. So however they
compare esthetically, the two minbars have now become fundamentally
different kinds of objects and reflect different approaches to
treasured objects from the past. By Michael Kimmelman.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ Russia's political and economic chaos
marks the beginning of the end for Boris Yeltsin, analysts said
Monday. The Russian president also said as much in televised
remarks Monday when he suggested that acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin may be the best candidate to succeed him when his
presidential term expires in 2000. Yeltsin's political obituary has
been written and erased before. But Yeltsin's abrupt firing of the
government Sunday was widely viewed here as capitulation to forces
beyond the wily president's control. An analysis. (Holmes, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-STREETS _ MOSCOW _ Most Russians are insulated from the
economic crisis by their own poverty. Most also are dubious that
Sunday's government overhaul will improve their lives, coming as it
did from a president they stopped trusting long ago. A look at how
average Russians are coping with their country's latest upheaval.

   BONNIE _ Hurricane Bonnie ambled toward the Southeast coast
today, prompting residents from Florida to North Carolina to stock
up on emergency supplies and tune in to weather reports. PBP
tracking map shows Bonnie making a direct hit on Wrightsville
Beach, N.C., at 6 a.m. Wednesday. (Manuel/Burritt, Atlanta

<P>
   BONNIE-RIPTIDES _ Rip tides and heavy surf driven by Hurricane
Bonnie churned the Atlantic from Florida to New Jersey, claiming
the lives of at least two swimmers and leaving scores more turning
to lifeguards to make it safely to the beach. Rip tides were blamed
for the deaths Sunday of a 25-year-old man in South Carolina and a
24-year-old man in Delaware. Thirty people were rescued in Carolina
Beach, N.C., and 100 were saved in Atlantic City, N.J. A look at

   DUCK _ ATLANTA _ Carolyn Wallace of Atlanta has a pet duck named
Ethel. She says he's very affectionate and they snuggle together
and watch TV. She even takes him with her in the car. ``He sits in
my lap and looks out the window and people point and say, 'Is that
a duck?''' Well, you know the saying: if it walks like a duck,
quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Brite. (Atlanta

GOOD INVESTMENTS START AT THE TOP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you're picking stocks it's easy to get the numbers on the
company's revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   What's hard is evaluating whether the executives running the
company are any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of management is a very important fundamental
factor in the success of any company,'' said Lynn Bernard Jr.,
executive vice president of global investment strategies at
Pinnacle Management &AMP; Trust Co. in Houston, a money management
firm. ``Sometimes, that can be a deciding factor to invest in that
particular company vs. its competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you want leaders who can deliver results and make
money for the company. The key is how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   If you know employees of a company you're considering investing
in, talk to them about how the company treats its most important
asset _ its workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management is two simple pieces: You have to make money and
you have to keep people motivated,'' said Greg Nakanishi, managing
partner of GN Resources in Kingwood, a management consulting firm.
``If you are just a slave driver and not treating people with
respect, people will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, sound the warning bells if you see a management that's
giving too many excuses for why it consistently misses earnings
targets. After all, how many times can you blame El Nio for losses?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they keep giving excuses, then as an investor, you really
have to question the investment attractiveness of a company that
does that,'' Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of signs that point to weak management from
Nakanishi and other observers who regularly evaluate companies as a
potential investment:
</P>
<P>
   The company isn't consistently making money.
</P>
<P>
   That may suggest a team that's not focused on what it takes to
produce steady results. If the management team is new to a company,
study the managers' track records.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much movement today in management, you want to make
sure that the people coming in to key management positions have a
good track record where they have been,'' Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   The key executives can't solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   Look for managers who have been able to take a product that was
limping along and improve it by adjusting the price or the way it's
made or fix a flaw that has hurt sales, said Claude Cody, a senior
portfolio manager at Aim Management Group in Houston, a mutual fund
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The top executives don't know where they want to take the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they created a vision for what they're trying to create
for the organization, like, `We want to become the most admired
company in the industry,' '' Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a blurred sense of the corporate culture it
wants to create.
</P>
<P>
   Do its managers say they want to foster an innovative atmosphere
that encourages creativity or do they want to be purely
results-oriented?
</P>
<P>
   The management is so focused on making money that it kills
employee incentive.
</P>
<P>
   A focus on the numbers isn't bad. However, with poor managers,
``they focus on those almost exclusively to the detriment of
building the kind of organization where people want to contribute
their time, their expertise, their talent,'' Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   The people at the top aren't well-grounded in their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people don't have an understanding of the industry, it
sometimes is difficult to build credibility in the organization,''
Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's leaders have frayed relationships with crucial
players in its industry.
</P>
<P>
   You want a management team that avoids regular public disputes
with bankers, customers, suppliers and regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The head honchos haven't set financial boundaries, such as how
much debt the company will shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have well-stated para- &QL; 
meters around their financial structure, so you're financially
prudent,'' Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   The management doesn't listen to different points of view.
</P>
<P>
   This is a key skill at the upper echelons of management. You
want managers who are able to pull together different ideas to
create a sound strategy for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you want to see top managers who work well together,
solving the turf wars that exist in any organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a cohesive management team at the top or do you
have fragmented management?'' Bernard asked.
</P>

   MOROCCO-MINBARS (Marrakesh, Morocco) _ Not long ago the imam at
the Casbah mosque agreed to show me his ancient minbar _ minbars
are decorated wooden staircases on wheels from which the imam
addresses the congregation during Friday worship. The idea was to
compare it to the 12th-century minbar from the Kutubiyya mosque
here, which conservators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art have
lately restored and installed to justified local fanfare, in the
remains of the city's immense Badi Palace. The smaller Casbah
minbar is great, too _ though a wreck _ and is still in use. So
however they compare esthetically, the two minbars have now become
fundamentally different kinds of objects and reflect different
approaches to treasured objects from the past. By Michael
Kimmelman.

Mouse House taps geniuses for ideas 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Danny Hillis once invented a computer a thousand
times faster than anything on the planet. Alan Kay created the
world's first notebook computer back when most of the machines
still filled a room.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Minsky has been a seminal figure in artificial
intelligence research, trying to teach computers how to think. And
Seymour Papert, another AI pioneer, has done groundbreaking work
understanding how children learn.
</P>
<P>
   They're hall of famers in the world of computers, big-science
big-timers that any high-tech company would love to have on its
team.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, these brains work for the Big Mouse,
brainstorming for one of the world's largest media companies,
fortifying Walt Disney's already formidable Imagineers with an
extra dose of IQ as they create new theme-park attractions, movies,
television shows, computer titles and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   They're Disney Fellows, part of a program started three years
ago with the hiring of Hillis, whose astonishing breadth of
interests and accomplishments by age 40 would be really annoying if
he weren't so damned nice.
</P>
<P>
   Kay, who built the Dynabook computer in the early '70s while
still at Xerox's groundbreaking Palo Alto Research Center, came
after spending 13 years as a fellow at Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Papert and Minsky, two Massachusetts Institute of
Technology powerhouses whose work has shaped our understanding of
how humans learn and how computers can be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a media giant instead of a computer king has been a
radical change of corporate culture, something Hillis said he was
ready to do after years working in the more empirical, linear world
of engineers and programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge change _ in a lot of dimensions,'' Hillis said.
``But I'm very glad I did it. I wanted to learn new stuff, and I've
done that in spades here. I've gone from trying to understand
reality to trying to escape reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hillis, Kay is glad to have made the jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different kind of environment than a Silicon
Valley computer company,'' said Kay. ``Computer companies just
don't get that it's all about media. Disney is now a media company,
and a lot of its destiny has to do with computer(-based)
representations.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the entertainment world is much more interesting,
Hillis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, people are very into aesthetic perception, storytelling,
emotion,'' Hillis said. ``There's much more initiative, more gut
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of engineering, he added, ``Emotion never gets
talked about, except as a weird sort of behavioral anomaly. When I
first came here, it confused me. I could not figure out how you
could be successful with such sloppy thinking. Now I'm getting that
new perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Hillis said, he understands that it's not sloppy thinking.
Very different from what he knew, but not sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the ``science'' of entertainment is a series of highly
educated guesses about what works for people. And understanding
that science has been undergirding his work the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Fellows said the great part about working at
Disney is they get to think hard about how people will play in the
future, and they help make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little bit like Edison's lab; we're playing around
with what you could do,'' Hillis said. ``But the real analogy is
when Disney was creating animation and they discovered the rules of
physics don't apply: `Hey, the body can squish.' But the stuff
we're doing now will look very quaint three years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Minsky likens the Disney R&AMP;D work to the way MIT's famous Media
Lab and Artificial Intelligence Lab work. The feeling of
exploration, of serious play and playful work, are keys to powerful
creativity, he said, but aren't often available to researchers
around the world these days.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for
Public Policy, said the Fellows program is an example of the larger
media and technology convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of scholar-in-residence program is very smart,''
Kotkin said. ``Long-term thinking in Hollywood is not common. But
Disney is so much more than just a film company.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay and Hillis are based in the Disney R&AMP;D skunk works sprawling
across a west Glendale industrial park, while Papert and Minsky
remain at MIT as Disney ``associate fellows.'' When needed, the
associate fellows come to Disney's Southern California operations
to advise on specific projects, Minsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go there whenever somebody has an interesting problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fellows laud the major resources they have available at
Disney, starting with the many great, if anonymous minds that
support them in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   While they are easily the best-known people in Disney's
long-secretive R&AMP;D hierarchy, the Fellows work collegially with
each other, their own teams of researchers and other groups
throughout the company, often to help tweak particularly
troublesome details.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to be modest about their own contributions as well.
For instance, in talking about a recent theme-park ride that he
worked on, Minsky said he helped on 1 percent of the project. The
everyday brilliance of Disney's Imagineers did the rest, and they
should get the credit, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Papert and Minsky as associate fellows is ``brilliant,''
said Aaron Goldberg, executive vice president of Ziff-Davis Market
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there's no way in a million years that Disney could hire
away someone like Minsky or Papert,'' Goldberg said. ``Who's going
to leave (jobs like they have at) MIT? But this lets them tap into
what those minds are working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Minsky likens the atmosphere at Disney's R&AMP;D operations to what
MIT used to be ``before all the students grew up and became
professors. You can get an idea and do something with it in a
weekend. It's both a different environment and a flashback to those
golden days in the 1960s when nothing seemed impossible and no one
cared what you did.''
</P>
<P>
   The ringmaster of this particularly lively circus is Bran
Ferren, Disney's executive vice president for creative technology
and research and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my jobs at the company is to think about the future of
the entertainment business and Disney's place in it,'' said Ferren,
whose Easthampton, N.Y., research lab was absorbed by Disney a few
years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion is the business of storytelling and creating
characters is going to be moving more and more in the direction
where technology will have a significant effect,'' said Ferren.
``At the highest level, we want to be able to identify and bring
into the company the best of the best, the most creative minds out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferren is a strapping man of imposing girth, twinkling eyes and
a graying red beard. Altogether, he reminds one of Santa Claus in
his salad days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bran Ferren is just this great, insane toymaker,'' said Paul
Saffo, executive director of the Institute for the Future, a
Silicon Valley think tank. ``He's brilliant. He's always moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ferren and the Fellows routinely zap back and forth
between the two coasts and Disney's five R&AMP;D facilities. They're
like electrons, zooming about the continent in a haze of energy and
ideas, difficult to pin down in one spot, their own private
metaphor for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
</P>
<P>
   And like electrons zooming around a nucleus of big ideas, the
Fellows have been flying around each other since the 1960s, thanks
to MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Papert and Minsky have been at the school for decades and have
known Hillis since he was an undergraduate there. Papert's work
helped inspire Kay's explorations of new computing systems. And
when Kay was briefly an MIT professor, he hired a teen-age Hillis
to work in his lab.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the four work with the rest of Disney's 140-person research
and development unit to help create a variety of projects. But
revealing details is something the ever-secretive Disney executives
can only partially allow for fear of giving away not-quite-ready
ideas to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis will allow &UR;  &LR; that he's working on a ``dinosaur-related''
project, along with numerous Internet and computing-related
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic, top-level notion is there's a fundamental change in
the medium going into the home: Now you can talk back to it,''
Hillis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay _ stumpy, shaggy and still vigorously youthful at 58 _ has
spent his time creating educational computer titles based on a
powerful new object-oriented programming language he helped create
called Squeak.
</P>
<P>
   Kay shows some of his team's Squeak-based ``children's authoring
system'' that will soon be on Disney's Internet site for kids.
</P>
<P>
   With it, students can create simple software ``machines''
illustrating gas pressure, gravity and epidemiology. A nimble
``paint'' program creates objects that can be manipulated,
animated, even linked to each other with a powerful, simple
programming system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is doing a lot of thinking about education,'' Kay said.
``What is an interesting route toward something that is good for
kids, and what would it be like if you put the Disney brand on it?
What I want to do is help kids think better than adults do today.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also is using Papert's work to answer questions
about education, said Ferren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papert is thinking about how to weave the educational process
into what we do,'' Ferren said. ``How do you teach? How do you make
richer educational experiences?''
</P>
<P>
   Imagineering president Kenneth Wong calls the Fellows program an
experiment for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the most unique minds in fields that are
very interesting to us,'' Wong said. ``But they're free-roaming. We
bring them in and let them match up with their interests. These are
great fertilizer, great provocateurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Disney is to take the Fellows' ideas and make
them into moneymaking ventures. All of them work on projects that
have a chance of becoming real in the next decade, Wong said,
though not without a lot of effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these guys generally propose (is) very hard, not
intellectually but technically,'' Wong said. ``Anything that
doesn't seem impossible is sort of boring to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The other challenge, Wong said, is the prodigious and
wide-ranging nature of the Fellows' brains and interests,
particularly as the company considers whether to expand the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis, for instance, edits a math journal in his spare time,
owns his own firetruck and closely follows evolutionary biology
theory, in part because of its potential impacts on creating
computer code that evolves and improves itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power and thinking of these individuals is pretty
prodigious and has a vastly disproportionate mindshare, if you
will,'' Wong said. ``It's more a question of balancing the
intellectual firepower with the ability of the organization to
contextualize these days. These are a very special breed of
thoroughbreds.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ Latin is no longer their language of choice, but
freethinkers still are debating the great issues of the day, just
as their forefathers did 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk politics. We talk religion. We talk about whatever's
on our minds,'' said Julie Fisher of the Texas Hill Country
Freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``The Latin Colonies'' for the community forums
conducted in Latin, the original frontier freethinkers advocated
equal rights for all people, secular education and the abolition of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen members recently indulged themselves on a smorgasbord of
topics, including quantum mechanics, famous composers, tax
abatements and poisonous snakes.
</P>
<P>
   And what discussion of current events could overlook President
Clinton's love life?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what happens to Clinton,'' said Bob Ellis,
75, a resident of this town north of San Antonio. ``His life is
going to be miserable with Hillary anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Freethinkers pride themselves on the frank exchange of
considered opinions that are based on critical analysis and
rational thought.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy brought both notoriety and persecution to the
original freethinkers, atheist intellectuals from Germany who
settled in the hills outside San Antonio in the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping political repression and religious autocracy in their
homeland, they took up farming in southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were much different than the 30,000 German peasant
farmers who came to Texas for economic reasons,'' Ed Scharf of
Helotes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intellectuals came over for the freedoms of speech,
assembly and freedom from religion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Scharf and others, the Texas Historical
Commission has agreed to place a large limestone marker in Boerne
commemorating the frontier freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking notice all over the country,'' said Catherine
Fahringer, 75, of San Antonio. ``We've never had anything like it
to honor freethinkers as freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freethinkers are largely ignored, unless they do something
famous in the mainstream,'' she said, noting that ``it's not
popular not to believe in God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They worshipped no deities, accepted no religious dogma, and
built no churches,'' said Scharf, 63.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1850s, Comfort had become the largest freethinker
colony in Texas, with more than 500 residents.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, they clashed with Confederates over their
anti-slavery and anti-secession positions.
</P>
<P>
   In a fit of bloodletting that led many freethinkers to abandon
the hills outside San Antonio, 36 were killed in battles with
Confederate troops in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them would have preferred to stay here and stay
neutral, but they were forced to either leave or join the
Confederate service,'' said Greg Krauter, 48, of Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who left were attacked as they fled to Mexico,'' Krauter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1866, a Tru Der Union (True to the Union) monument was
erected in Comfort to memorialize the fallen freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer and others decided a separate remembrance was merited
after hearing prayers said at rededication ceremonies for the
restored monument in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mention of their free thought, that they were
non-believers in God,'' Fahringer said, ``so we decided it's time
to come out of the closet and say who we are and honor the
freethinkers who went before us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new monument will be a daily reminder of Comfort's roots for
residents of the town that now has six churches.

MIND OVER CANCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEESUN WEE 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Chad Warrick of Canyon Country knew his
girlfriend had a doctor's appointment that morning four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The couple downplayed the visit. Probably nothing major.
Routine. Heather Clelland was, after all, only 24.
</P>
<P>
   But when Chad checked his voice mail during his lunch break, he
went into shock. Test results positive. Breast cancer. He
understood that much, despite Heather's crying.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned the Lego pirates display he had been assembling
inside a toy store, hopped into his car and rushed to Heather's
Canyon Country home.
</P>
<P>
   As the speedometer hovered over 80 miles per hour, he thought,
``We're just starting our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather was still crying when Chad rushed inside and hugged her.
``We've got to go on a drive. We've just got to get away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So they drove. Where they went, they don't remember. It didn't
matter. The point was they were escaping, if only for a bit, by
moving, going _ going anywhere. As the road rolled underneath them,
he consoled his future wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going to be OK. We're not going to let this
thing get us. We're going to get through this together.'' He
sounded more confident than he actually was, he would confess
later.
</P>
<P>
   In the unfinished story of breast cancer, the young couple
represent a mere blip _ if that. Heather is among an estimated
180,000 American women who are diagnosed with breast cancer
annually.
</P>
<P>
   But Heather's experience is difficult to ignore. She found a
grape-sized lump in her right breast when she was young and
healthy. And she's a woman with no family history of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, her physicians have no definitive explanations for
why Heather developed cancer. ``Believe me, I asked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her test results serve as a stark reminder that this disease
knows no boundaries. And despite ongoing research on inherited
breast cancer, chemotherapy before surgery, experimental drugs and
machines claiming to more accurately detect the disease, Heather
reminds women that cancer remains unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of worrying about cancer, worry about finding it
early,'' Heather says. ``If you're a woman, you're at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Heather is self-assured and well-spoken.
Her poise and good looks would make a beauty queen envious. She
even looked cute when chemotherapy made her hair fall out and her
scalp was reduced to a peachlike fuzz. But Heather hasn't always
been so poised and articulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, she always thought of herself not as good as other
people,'' Chad said. It took fighting breast cancer and educating
others about it to push her out of her shell.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1994 diagnosis, Heather has undergone a lumpectomy and
within the past month a mastectomy. It has been difficult for the
self-described control freak.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if it comes back?'' she wondered aloud to Chad. They
thought about the children they eventually want to have and
Heather's family members who may be at risk for cancer, too _
especially Heather's twin sister.
</P>
<P>
   An identical twin has roughly double the risk of getting breast
cancer, said Thomas Mack, director of the Division of Epidemiology
at the University of Southern California School of Medicine. He
also leads the California Twin Program that studies diseases among
twins.
</P>
<P>
   For now, her sister, Dawn Poirier, has shown no evidence of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Heather and Chad endured the dark times. As Heather puts it, she
lives hopefully, not hopelessly. Family support and humor help too.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Heather's mastectomy in July, her mother and sister
scrawled ``Hasta La Vista, Boobie!'' above her chest. Heather's
family teases her when she complains of fatigue. ``Cancer,
schmancer,'' her sister jokes. Earlier this month, they threw
Heather a recovery party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's your time to go, it's your time to go,'' Heather said.
``You can't live life wondering and waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long after Heather and Chad, now both 29, fell in love
that their medical roller coaster began. Ironically, the first turn
centered on Chad _ not Heather.
</P>
<P>
   When the two first began dating, Chad, a fly-fishing fan, seemed
to adore the outdoors. ``Let's go sit out on the patio. It's so
beautiful out,'' he suggested. ``How romantic,'' Heather thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all actuality, I couldn't breathe,'' said Chad, who has
been battling asthma since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Chad's asthma, which had been dormant for years,
flared into a life-threatening condition. The episode landed him in
a hospital for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Heather leaned toward Chad and said, ``You've got to take care
of yourself because I want you to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   The following year around Easter, it was Heather's turn.
</P>
<P>
   She was taking a shower, getting ready for a date with Chad,
when she felt the lump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The instant I felt it, all the air was sucked out of me and
down the drain. It took my breath away,'' Heather recalled. ``My
first thought was, `Oh my God. This feels bad'.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heather let her age dissuade her from seeking a physician
immediately _ something she now lectures women against as a
volunteer for the American Cancer Society in the Santa Clarita
Valley. She chastised herself for thinking she could even have
breast cancer so young. Statistics seemed to support her doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 180,000 breast cancer cases recorded annually,
about 600 involve women age 30 and under, said Diane Blum,
executive director of Cancer Care Inc., a New York-based nonprofit
organization offering education and support.
</P>
<P>
   Heather felt uncomfortable investigating the lump. ``I convinced
myself it was nothing,'' she said. Her mother eventually ordered
her to visit a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The physician initially thought Heather had a fibroid tumor. No
big deal. But test results two weeks later confirmed otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked stunned. He said, `I have a bit of bad news.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he proceeded to tell me what happens next, choices I
needed to make. ... I wasn't listening. I was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked out of the office to a nearby pay phone. She called
her mother, sister and Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, Heather had a lumpectomy. Chemotherapy followed.
</P>
<P>
   It was during her recovery, those days she spent clad in
pajamas, sometimes suffering from extreme nausea, that Chad came
over bearing roses _ and a velvet ring box shaped like a rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking like utter crap,'' she recalled. They married
two years later, in March 1996 _ enough time for Heather's hair to
grow back.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this year, a routine checkup revealed cancer had
returned to the same spot. The first diagnosis had been shocking.
This time, they were mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is some good stuff going to happen to us?'' Chad
wondered. ``We're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   But anger gave way to the reality of Heather's condition.
Positive thoughts in mind, they proceeded with a mastectomy
followed by reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Heather returned to work at a podiatrist's
office. She'll continue speaking publicly about breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Heather urges women not to assume youth or no family history of
the disease means immunity. About 80 percent of all breast cancer
diagnoses have no track record. She lectures women to perform
breast self-exams _ not rely on finding a lump accidentally as she
did. ``I didn't know what a breast exam was.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Heather pauses at her past lack of insight, she doesn't
regret passing on the mastectomy first. The lumpectomy was the
right decision then, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Heather and Chad focus on the future. Although she
won't know for years if she has been cured, for now, she's
cancer-free. Sure the couple worries about a recurrence. But they
push thoughts of ``what if'' aside. ``Mastery of fear but not
absence of fear,'' Heather says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be healthy, have a house and some kids. I'm a
pretty simple person, and I know Heather is, too,'' Chad said. ``We
just want a normal life.''

IN THIS, AT LEAST, COMMANDER IN CHIEF MERITS OUR SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You won't hear me criticizing President Clinton's decision to
order missile attacks against terrorist facilities in retaliation
for the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa. I've been
screaming for years that he should do something like this.
</P>
<P>
   But I can see where some people might be skeptical. I can see
where some might suspect Clinton of a ``Wag the Dog'' scenario.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen this ``Wag the Dog'' movie, but they say it's
about a president who diverts public attention from a White House
sex scandal by staging a phony war against Albania. Inquiring minds
want to know: Did Clinton order military action Thursday just to
distract us from Monica Lewinsky and lurid tales of sex in the Oval
Office?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton-backers called such suggestions ``silly'' _ among other
things. The language used by Democratic Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware
wasn't the worst you'll hear from a member of Congress, but I won't
repeat it in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that the commander in chief who ordered the
missile strikes has little or no credibility after admitting to
seven months of baldfaced lies about his relationship with
Lewinsky. Who can believe anything he says about anything?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, is it really so silly to suspect a ``Wag the Dog'' con
job by a president who brought in a Hollywood producer to coach him
for his infamous wag-the-finger scam: ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman ...''?
</P>
<P>
   When a president sets fire to his own credibility, he has to
live with the mistrust that ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't give the ``Wag the Dog'' theory much
credence. I'd be more inclined to believe that Clinton dreamed up
the missile attacks as an excuse to interrupt that family vacation
he's been on with his wife and daughter. I'd rather confront
wild-eyed terrorists any day than do battle with an angry Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   All skepticism aside, it doesn't matter what motivated the
president to strike the terrorists. It was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The United States too often endures attacks by terrorists and
does nothing to retaliate. In this case, the missile strikes were
said to be both retaliatory and preemptive because the United
States had reason to believe that the terrorists involved were
planning future attacks against America.
</P>
<P>
   The world's lone remaining superpower _ and the favorite target
of international terrorists _ must take the lead in combating
terrorism. If that means periodically launching military strikes
against nations or groups that harbor and sponsor terrorists, so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   And the president of the United States has the authority to
initiate such military action _ whenever and wherever it is needed.
It's a responsibility he had shirked for too long before Thursday's
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal or no scandal, the American people should hope that
Clinton's decision signaled a new willingness to act boldly in the
face of provocation by terrorists. These are vile, ruthless killers
who are emboldened by the perception that their mortal enemy, the
United States, is cowering in fear and is helpless in the face of
their vicious atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists feed on the fear that their brutality engenders in
its victims. It inspires them to ever-escalating acts of murder and
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Firm and expeditious U.S. action is the only thing these killers
understand. That Clinton was willing and able to take such action
despite his predicament conveys an important message to terrorists
around the world: Do not assume that political turmoil will prevent
this country from doing what it must to maintain its security.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt that Clinton's penchant for deception has
created a serious gulf of distrust between him and large numbers of
Americans. As long as it exists _ and that may be for as long as he
is president _ this distrust will prompt questions about his
motives when he exercises his responsibilities as commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   But he is still the president. He deserves our support when he
lives up to the title.

   SEATTLE _ How do you cope when you're a motherless teenage girl
in full-bore puberty and you're cursed with a poor, dysfunctional,
male-dominant family that is lacking in sympathy and nurturing
skills?
</P>
<P>
   Especially when that family is more focused on dodging the
landlord in the middle of the night _ all just within the city
limits of that exclusive, rich, movie-star fairy-tale turf called
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   You avenge your childhood demons by making a movie, of course.

   At least that's what Tamara Jenkins did.

   She's the thirtysomething writer and director of ``Slums of
Beverly Hills,'' which opens Friday at several Seattle area
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Guggenheim grant and funding from the Sundance Institute
and Fox Searchlight Pictures, she spent a year purging her soul by
writing a script. It evolved into a dramatic diary about growing up
``in the '70s without a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is unusual in its frank and humorous portrayal of how
its adolescent protagonist, Vivian, played by a suitably
``unfinished and gawky'' Natasha Lyonne, deals with her budding
body.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says she had ``no guidance through the minefield of
adolescence, nor do I have an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The director settles into a chair at Seattle's Hotel Monaco
looking very comfortable with her adult body. She's chic,
well-dressed and funny and sucks on an iced coffee, complaining
about the chill from the hotel air-conditioning on a rare Seattle
summer day that promises to hit 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in telling a story I'd be interested in
seeing, mainly,'' she says. ``The representation of adolescent
girls is always something that gets on my nerves in movies.
Especially those issues of physicality and coming of physical age
and dealing with the equipment one gets in life. I wanted to deal
with that material in a non-fetishy, non-sexualized way and I hoped
there would be other people interested in putting themselves in
those shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there were. ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' stars, besides
newcomer Lyonne, film veterans Alan Arkin, Rita Moreno, Carl Reiner
and Jessica Walter, as well as younger actors Marisa Tomei and
Kevin Corrigan. It's about a white-trash family that slinks from
apartment to apartment on the outskirts of Beverly Hills, looking
for the big score and eating at Sizzler when the chips finally come
in.
</P>
<P>
   The R-rated movie features a few wild moments _ most notably a
dance with a vibrator _ and more references to the mystery of
female anatomy and biology than any other recent film.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says she purposefully made her movie with these
anatomical wonders in mind because ``the whole world is a male
dominant place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we make movies is male dominant; our producers were men,
as were the crew. It was a little microcosm of the real world and
most of them were really great. I ended up having a brotherly
relationship with many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she's had a few ``weird reactions'' to the flagrant
budding female sexuality in the film. Someone felt repelled and
said, ``oooh, all that female grossness.'' She says she also got
hit with an ``oh, you're only interested in breaking taboos''
speech.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if that's true, Jenkins pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those reactions frighten me,'' she says. ``As women, we put
ourselves in the shoes of male protagonists everyday. We
transgender no matter what fiction ride we're taking _ movies,
books, plays _ and engage ourselves in things like Hamlet's
dilemma. So I think it would be very painful to believe men
couldn't develop those same muscles and allow themselves to go on a
ride in the shoes of a female, teenage protagonist.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insists she's not intentionally trying to foment a
screen revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason `Slums of Beverly Hills' might be
taboo-breaking is because it's unusual to see movies that deal with
a woman's body in this sort of way. I'm not on a feminist mission,
I just want to explore the female condition. I'm a woman, my
point-of-view is specific and I think it will inform everything I
do as a filmmaker. Even if I write a story with a male lead, it
will be informed by my female experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies are the other peripheral character in her film. There
are nods to the out-of-reach glamour of Rodeo Drive and musicals
like ``Guys and Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins says the only films she remembers were TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had money for the cinema. But I remember bad, raunchy
TV fare. I worshiped `Born Innocent' with Linda Blair. I was
perversely fascinated with it and later, `The Exorcist.' I liked
girls-gone-bad themes, which I'm still intrigued by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't see great cinema until I was an adult and I
educated myself.'' She sighs. ``I was a weird girl. I was an
outcast but managed to weasel my way in. Like the character in the
film, I lived in an environment where I didn't really belong. Now,
I can wiggle through different scenes, and I'm OK with being
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Her unusual approach obviously made no difference to her strong
cast. The combination of old and new actors ``only enhanced the
film,'' though, she gushes, ``Alan Arkin was a little intimidating
because of his veteran status as well as the fact that he was
playing a variation on my father. My anxiety would swell up like a
virus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was so grateful he agreed to do the movie. And I think
his relationship with Natasha was compelling and exciting.
Sometimes, as a filmmaker, you wind up being a chemist or
matchmaker, imagining how your actors will mix, because you never
see them together until you've cast the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Alan and Natasha, they had a great rapport and they
worked together really well. I think he responded to her and it
became the perfect father/daughter relationship. He was a mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   So where did Jenkins find Lyonne, her screen self-image?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I auditioned a bunch of girls for the role in New York and
Los Angeles,'' she notes. ``But 90 percent of the young actresses
who walked through the door looked finished. They weren't
adolescent even though they were only between 16 and 20. I needed
the role to be inhabited by someone in an unfinished state. I could
have never imagined being as poised and ladylike as a teenager as
the actresses I saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natasha was feral and had a sense of humor about herself,
which most people don't have at a young age. She's real and manic
and gawky. She's also beautiful with an animal instinct. She throws
herself around. She's not a finished person in the best sense of
the word.''
</P>
<P>
   And how did Jenkins find the experience of purging the past on a
big screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she says with a smile. ``A film becomes a weird thing
unto itself. When you're mining personal experience and
transforming it into fiction, there's a weird mutation process that
occurs. You have to let go of fact and allow the fiction to simply
be. It's a weird chemical thing. You let go of something you know
and it becomes its own entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a film is a strange act of trying to control and
surrender at the same time. But I think anyone who makes a movie
feels that way. Right afterward everyone feels stressed and
horrified and says, `I'm never doing that again!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But, then we start getting itchy and weird and want to go out
and fix all the mistakes we made the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else says they never want to do it again,'' she
sighs, ``but I do.''

NINA SIMONE BRINGS ELEGANCE AND ANGER TO HER PERFORMANE

   SEATTLE _ It is a rare sight in the '90s, a 65-year-old woman
dressed in a glittering evening gown with her fist raised in the
black-power salute. Few people could pull off such a seemingly
mixed statement before a crowd of 3,000 and not be laughed off the
stage. But singer and pianist Nina Simone did it and not only
commanded respect, but also received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   That picture of sparkling-clad Simone with her fist in the air
before the roaring applause of the Friday night crowd at the
Seattle Pier reveals her essence as a blend of elegance and anger,
upper-class sophistication and working-class political
consciousness. She has been the High Priestess of Soul to '60s
jet-setters and intellectuals, and now their offspring, and used
this status to make demands for equality and justice.
</P>
<P>
   The price Simone has paid for balancing revolution with standing
ovations has been bouts with mental illness, a suicide attempt and,
at times, poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Simone began her hour-and-40-minute set with several gospel
tunes, shouting like the preacher's daughter that she is. Some were
delivered seated at the piano, accompanied by longtime band leader
and multi-instrumentalist Al Schackman, percussionist Leopoldo
Fleming and drummer Paul Robinson. Others were done a cappella with
band members singing harmony. At first Simone's voice sounded
ragged, gruff, but it was coming from her soul.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she hit ``Sinnerman,'' Simone's voice was gaining
elasticity, and she started to expand her repertory by covering the
Beatles' ``Here Comes the Sun.'' On the sexy Afro blues of ``See
Line Woman,'' Simone danced sensuously with only percussion
accompanying her tale of seductive women.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional roller coaster of ``I Loves You, Porgy,''
(Simone's first single and first chart maker) was followed by the
swinging standard ``Exactly Like You,'' and then her best-known
tune, ``Sugar in My Bowl,'' which she delivered as a sultry
come-on. After a few puffs from a cigarette Simone had her
attendant bring on stage, she asked the crowd if they wanted to
hear her now-classic '60s protest song ``Mississippi Goddam!''
which she said she had sung at the birthday of the ``finest man on
the planet,'' Nelson Mandela. As it was a house full of High
Priestess worshipers who had come from as far away as Switzerland
to see her only North America appearance, they not only wanted to
hear her shout about racism, they joined in the refrain.
</P>
<P>
   The ferocity of ``Mississippi Goddam'' gave way to the soft
vulnerability in Jacques Brel's ``Ne Me Quitte Pas.'' Simone ended
the set with a vengeance, giving the Brecht/Weil-penned ``Pirate
Jenny'' the hardness inherent in the lyrics, but seldom is it sung
with such frightening glee. For an encore, she did ``My Baby Just
Cares for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the dark velvet voice that Simone used to wrap around a
song in the '50s and '60s has been taken by age, it has been
replaced with a Kinte cloth that swaddles her singing in the
history and spiritualism of African American culture. It is a
one-of-a-kind voice, and most of those who saw Simone's show at the
Pier will not quickly forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The opening set of free jazz by the Art Ensemble of Chicago was
not well-received, used as background for socializing by the crowd.

SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS TRANSCEND EVEN DELIVERY BY SITCOM STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   That's what first came to mind when it was announced that
Oscar-winner Helen Hunt (``As Good As It Gets'') would star in
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night, or What You Will'' at the Vivian
Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett's
disappointing performances in ``Macbeth,'' at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater in March, Hunt's planned portrayal of Viola set
critical teeth on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Could the sitcom star turned lauded film actor continue
ascending professional heights? Or would the elevated language of
Stratford's Bard prove too tough a task? For many years, American
actors have taken an oft-deserved rap for being unable to ``speak
the speech'' and still make the plays come to life.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Twelfth Night,'' which runs through next weekend, Hunt and
her British director, Nicholas Hytner, have the advantage of
working on one of the theater's finest comedies. A tale of
emotional loss and romantic love, the play hinges on confusion
caused when the shipwrecked Viola assumes a man's identity.
</P>
<P>
   After befriending the passionate Duke Orsino (Paul Rudd), the
disguised Viola is asked to carry the duke's message of love to
Olivia (Kyra Sedgwick). Mourning her late brother, Olivia spurns
the advances of the duke but takes a fancy to Viola. To complicate
matters further, Viola herself begins to fall in love with the
duke.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with this intricate love triangle are delightful
comic scenes between the play's clowns, Sir Toby Belch (Brian
Murray) and Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Max Wright). Murray and Wright's
exquisite characterizations often reduce the audience to extended
fits of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Exotically designed by Bob Crowley (sets), Catherine Zuber
(costumes) and Natasha Katz (lighting), this ``Twelfth Night'' is a
warming pleasure from start to finish _ including when the actors
splash in the onstage pool. Hytner's production accentuates the
strengths of the actors while (mostly) disguising the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt manages her role nicely. Jamie Buchman _ Hunt's character
on television's ``Mad About You'' _ occasionally peeks through but
those moments are few and her emotional honesty is admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leads, only Rudd fails to match his character's drive.
It's as if he is performing in a different version of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's summer in New York City, ``Twelfth Night''
isn't the only of the Bard's works on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   As it has since 1962, the New York Shakespeare Festival has made
the outdoor Delacorte Theater in Central Park its summer home. This
year's Shakespeare offering is the little-seen ``Cymbeline.''
Little-seen, that is, except for this year when the Royal
Shakespeare Company also staged a version at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music.
</P>
<P>
   In director Andrei Serban's Central Park production (through
Aug. 30), a storyteller (George Morfogen) reads a tale to a child
(Jacob Smith) that weaves a complex account of King Cymbeline in
the time of the Romans. As darkness falls in the park, the
storyteller's words bring the characters to life and the banishment
of Imogen's (Stephanie Roth Haberle) husband, Posthumus (Michael
Hall), begins the romantic saga.
</P>
<P>
   Serban keeps the child involved with the intricate action - here
he peers through the trees, there he prompts a character - to
remind us that this story is a fantasia from a fertile imagination.
And it's just as well, ``Cymbeline'' is filled with classic
fairy-tale devices such as an orphaned child, an evil stepmother,
kidnapped children, powerful potions and long-lost siblings. It is
a story of a world locked in chaos and of how order may arise from
the dispensation of mercy, if not of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Set designer Mark Wendland's grassy knoll surrounded by a moat
features an elegant stand of trees and a small circle of fine sand,
which tie the setting to the park's bucolic natural backdrop even
as it makes us think of exotic places. Marina Draghici's costumes
evoke Arabian nights with her modified turbans and shoes with
pointy-toes curling skyward.
</P>
<P>
   In the Royal Shakespeare Company's production, director Adrian
Noble and his designers gave ``Cymbeline'' a decidedly Asian feel
that stylistically landed somewhere between Japan and China. Noble,
too, began with a storyteller - in the text one gentleman tells
another of the Cymbeline story and Posthumus' banishment. But the
opening scene was more ritualized with hooded actors hunkered
around the storyteller's fire. As each character was introduced,
the actor stood and whisked off his or her cape.
</P>
<P>
   Where Serban has mined the open-hearted humor of the fantastic
``Cymbeline'' plot, Noble's production possessed a coolness
enhanced by the dark palette of color and Anthony Ward's abstractly
formal scene design.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the actors? How do the Americans fare when compared
with their British counterparts? Pretty well, in this instance.
However, Stephanie Roth Haberle, who is an imposing presence as
Imogen in Serban's park version, might have been an interesting
alternative to diminutive Joanne Pearce in the RSC production.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central Park production, Liev Schreiber is a
fascinatingly sympathetic villain as Iachimo. Even as he lurks
about the sleeping Imogen's bed, trying to gather information that
will falsely convince her husband of her infidelity, Schreiber's
innate warmth is oddly seductive. As a result, Imogen's resistance
of Iachimo's wiles is all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Cymbeline,'' the story is all and the actors are merely
servants to telling it clearly. Although both directors highlighted
comedic aspects of the play, Serban's production in Central Park is
superior for the way that the entire creative team manages to tell
the tale in an engaging and entertaining way.
</P>
<P>
   More successful than Noble's ``Cymbeline'' were the other two
Shakespeare plays produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company during
its residency in Brooklyn. ``Hamlet'' and ``Henry VIII'' provided
keen insights to disparate works by the man from Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   Director Matthew Warchus skipped the politics in ``Hamlet'' and
went straight for the Oedipal jugular. His production opened with a
brief black and white film that plays young Hamlet's memories of a
snow-filled winter romp with his father and his dog. As the film
rolled, Hamlet (Alex Jennings) mournfully emptied an urn filled
with ashes. All of the Shakespearean intrigues dealing with
Fortinbras and Norway were stripped away, laying bare the troubling
story of murder and incestuous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The wiry Jennings was a bundle of raw nerves as he hurtled from
one emotional explosion to the next. Was the character mad, or
merely feigning madness? Probably a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Susannah York as Gertrude, David Ryall as Polonius and Derbhle
Crotty as the mad, onanistic Ophelia all made solid contributions
to Warchus' plan. Unfortunately, the concept was undermined by key
performers who seemed unable to release themselves completely to
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was jarring to attend ``Henry VIII'' in the week following
verbal attacks and threats of violence aimed at playwright Terrence
McNally for his coming play, ``Corpus Christi.'' Shakespeare's
duplicitous Cardinal Wolsey drank heavily, fondled young women and
encouraged general debauchery among revelers at a party in his
home. The cardinal later repented. But it was tantalizing to think
of how this Catholic libertinism might be received these days by
certain watchdogs of morality. Wolsey was human and had human
failings. The author of ``Henry VIII'' made the cardinal a genuine
and ultimately sympathetic character - even if some of the
``facts'' are inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Could this type of work be staged as a new play today? Perhaps,
if it managed to hew to the dominant political culture - as this
play did when it was written.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that continues to draw artists and audiences to
Shakespeare after nearly 400 years? Lovely poetry spoken
exceedingly well doesn't hurt his appeal. But it isn't simply
euphonious combinations of words that keep us coming back.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stories. Brimming with blind passions, grand desires,
humiliating retributions and occasional happy endings, Shakespeare
is eternally here and now.

DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ How do you cope when you're a motherless teenage girl
in full-bore puberty and you're cursed with a poor, dysfunctional,
male-dominant family that is lacking in sympathy and nurturing
skills?
</P>
<P>
   Especially when that family is more focused on dodging the
landlord in the middle of the night _ all just within the city
limits of that exclusive, rich, movie-star fairy-tale turf called
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   You avenge your childhood demons by making a movie, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Tamara Jenkins did.
</P>
<P>
   She's the thirtysomething writer and director of ``Slums of
Beverly Hills,'' which opens Friday at several Seattle area
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Guggenheim grant and funding from the Sundance Institute
and Fox Searchlight Pictures, she spent a year purging her soul by
writing a script. It evolved into a dramatic diary about growing up
``in the '70s without a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is unusual in its frank and humorous portrayal of how
its adolescent protagonist, Vivian, played by a suitably
``unfinished and gawky'' Natasha Lyonne, deals with her budding
body.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says she had ``no guidance through the minefield of
adolescence, nor do I have an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The director settles into a chair at Seattle's Hotel Monaco
looking very comfortable with her adult body. She's chic,
well-dressed and funny and sucks on an iced coffee, complaining
about the chill from the hotel air-conditioning on a rare Seattle
summer day that promises to hit 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in telling a story I'd be interested in
seeing, mainly,'' she says. ``The representation of adolescent
girls is always something that gets on my nerves in movies.
Especially those issues of physicality and coming of physical age
and dealing with the equipment one gets in life. I wanted to deal
with that material in a non-fetishy, non-sexualized way and I hoped
there would be other people interested in putting themselves in
those shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there were. ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' stars, besides
newcomer Lyonne, film veterans Alan Arkin, Rita Moreno, Carl Reiner
and Jessica Walter, as well as younger actors Marisa Tomei and
Kevin Corrigan. It's about a white-trash family that slinks from
apartment to apartment on the outskirts of Beverly Hills, looking
for the big score and eating at Sizzler when the chips finally come
in.
</P>
<P>
   The R-rated movie features a few wild moments _ most notably a
dance with a vibrator _ and more references to the mystery of
female anatomy and biology than any other recent film.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says she purposefully made her movie with these
anatomical wonders in mind because ``the whole world is a male
dominant place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we make movies is male dominant; our producers were men,
as were the crew. It was a little microcosm of the real world and
most of them were really great. I ended up having a brotherly
relationship with many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she's had a few ``weird reactions'' to the flagrant
budding female sexuality in the film. Someone felt repelled and
said, ``oooh, all that female grossness.'' She says she also got
hit with an ``oh, you're only interested in breaking taboos''
speech.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if that's true, Jenkins pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those reactions frighten me,'' she says. ``As women, we put
ourselves in the shoes of male protagonists everyday. We
transgender no matter what fiction ride we're taking _ movies,
books, plays _ and engage ourselves in things like Hamlet's
dilemma. So I think it would be very painful to believe men
couldn't develop those same muscles and allow themselves to go on a
ride in the shoes of a female, teenage protagonist.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insists she's not intentionally trying to foment a
screen revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason `Slums of Beverly Hills' might be
taboo-breaking is because it's unusual to see movies that deal with
a woman's body in this sort of way. I'm not on a feminist mission,
I just want to explore the female condition. I'm a woman, my
point-of-view is specific and I think it will inform everything I
do as a filmmaker. Even if I write a story with a male lead, it
will be informed by my female experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies are the other peripheral character in her film. There
are nods to the out-of-reach glamour of Rodeo Drive and musicals
like ``Guys and Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins says the only films she remembers were TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had money for the cinema. But I remember bad, raunchy
TV fare. I worshiped `Born Innocent' with Linda Blair. I was
perversely fascinated with it and later, `The Exorcist.' I liked
girls-gone-bad themes, which I'm still intrigued by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't see great cinema until I was an adult and I
educated myself.'' She sighs. ``I was a weird girl. I was an
outcast but managed to weasel my way in. Like the character in the
film, I lived in an environment where I didn't really belong. Now,
I can wiggle through different scenes, and I'm OK with being
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Her unusual approach obviously made no difference to her strong
cast. The combination of old and new actors ``only enhanced the
film,'' though, she gushes, ``Alan Arkin was a little intimidating
because of his veteran status as well as the fact that he was
playing a variation on my father. My anxiety would swell up like a
virus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was so grateful he agreed to do the movie. And I think
his relationship with Natasha was compelling and exciting.
Sometimes, as a filmmaker, you wind up being a chemist or
matchmaker, imagining how your actors will mix, because you never
see them together until you've cast the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Alan and Natasha, they had a great rapport and they
worked together really well. I think he responded to her and it
became the perfect father/daughter relationship. He was a mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   So where did Jenkins find Lyonne, her screen self-image?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I auditioned a bunch of girls for the role in New York and
Los Angeles,'' she notes. ``But 90 percent of the young actresses
who walked through the door looked finished. They weren't
adolescent even though they were only between 16 and 20. I needed
the role to be inhabited by someone in an unfinished state. I could
have never imagined being as poised and ladylike as a teenager as
the actresses I saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natasha was feral and had a sense of humor about herself,
which most people don't have at a young age. She's real and manic
and gawky. She's also beautiful with an animal instinct. She throws
herself around. She's not a finished person in the best sense of
the word.''
</P>
<P>
   And how did Jenkins find the experience of purging the past on a
big screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she says with a smile. ``A film becomes a weird thing
unto itself. When you're mining personal experience and
transforming it into fiction, there's a weird mutation process that
occurs. You have to let go of fact and allow the fiction to simply
be. It's a weird chemical thing. You let go of something you know
and it becomes its own entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a film is a strange act of trying to control and
surrender at the same time. But I think anyone who makes a movie
feels that way. Right afterward everyone feels stressed and
horrified and says, `I'm never doing that again!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But, then we start getting itchy and weird and want to go out
and fix all the mistakes we made the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else says they never want to do it again,'' she
sighs, ``but I do.''

central Mexico, monarch butterflies arrive by the millions each
winter to take refuge, their black and orange wings festooning
stands of towering fir trees. But conservationists have grown
increasingly concerned about these butterflies as these small
patches of forest, some of which were set aside as preserves,
compete with the needs of the residents around them. Now
conservationists are trying to help the butterflies by helping the

SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS TRANSCEND EVEN DELIVERY BY SITCOM STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   That's what first came to mind when it was announced that
Oscar-winner Helen Hunt (``As Good As It Gets'') would star in
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night, or What You Will'' at the Vivian
Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett's
disappointing performances in ``Macbeth,'' at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater in March, Hunt's planned portrayal of Viola set
critical teeth on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Could the sitcom star turned lauded film actor continue
ascending professional heights? Or would the elevated language of
Stratford's Bard prove too tough a task? For many years, American
actors have taken an oft-deserved rap for being unable to ``speak
the speech'' and still make the plays come to life.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Twelfth Night,'' which runs through next weekend, Hunt and
her British director, Nicholas Hytner, have the advantage of
working on one of the theater's finest comedies. A tale of
emotional loss and romantic love, the play hinges on confusion
caused when the shipwrecked Viola assumes a man's identity.
</P>
<P>
   After befriending the passionate Duke Orsino (Paul Rudd), the
disguised Viola is asked to carry the duke's message of love to
Olivia (Kyra Sedgwick). Mourning her late brother, Olivia spurns
the advances of the duke but takes a fancy to Viola. To complicate
matters further, Viola herself begins to fall in love with the
duke.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with this intricate love triangle are delightful
comic scenes between the play's clowns, Sir Toby Belch (Brian
Murray) and Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Max Wright). Murray and Wright's
exquisite characterizations often reduce the audience to extended
fits of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Exotically designed by Bob Crowley (sets), Catherine Zuber
(costumes) and Natasha Katz (lighting), this ``Twelfth Night'' is a
warming pleasure from start to finish _ including when the actors
splash in the onstage pool. Hytner's production accentuates the
strengths of the actors while (mostly) disguising the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt manages her role nicely. Jamie Buchman _ Hunt's character
on television's ``Mad About You'' _ occasionally peeks through but
those moments are few and her emotional honesty is admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leads, only Rudd fails to match his character's drive.
It's as if he is performing in a different version of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's summer in New York City, ``Twelfth Night''
isn't the only of the Bard's works on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   As it has since 1962, the New York Shakespeare Festival has made
the outdoor Delacorte Theater in Central Park its summer home. This
year's Shakespeare offering is the little-seen ``Cymbeline.''
Little-seen, that is, except for this year when the Royal
Shakespeare Company also staged a version at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music.
</P>
<P>
   In director Andrei Serban's Central Park production (through
Aug. 30), a storyteller (George Morfogen) reads a tale to a child
(Jacob Smith) that weaves a complex account of King Cymbeline in
the time of the Romans. As darkness falls in the park, the
storyteller's words bring the characters to life and the banishment
of Imogen's (Stephanie Roth Haberle) husband, Posthumus (Michael
Hall), begins the romantic saga.
</P>
<P>
   Serban keeps the child involved with the intricate action - here
he peers through the trees, there he prompts a character - to
remind us that this story is a fantasia from a fertile imagination.
And it's just as well, ``Cymbeline'' is filled with classic
fairy-tale devices such as an orphaned child, an evil stepmother,
kidnapped children, powerful potions and long-lost siblings. It is
a story of a world locked in chaos and of how order may arise from
the dispensation of mercy, if not of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Set designer Mark Wendland's grassy knoll surrounded by a moat
features an elegant stand of trees and a small circle of fine sand,
which tie the setting to the park's bucolic natural backdrop even
as it makes us think of exotic places. Marina Draghici's costumes
evoke Arabian nights with her modified turbans and shoes with
pointy-toes curling skyward.
</P>
<P>
   In the Royal Shakespeare Company's production, director Adrian
Noble and his designers gave ``Cymbeline'' a decidedly Asian feel
that stylistically landed somewhere between Japan and China. Noble,
too, began with a storyteller - in the text one gentleman tells
another of the Cymbeline story and Posthumus' banishment. But the
opening scene was more ritualized with hooded actors hunkered
around the storyteller's fire. As each character was introduced,
the actor stood and whisked off his or her cape.
</P>
<P>
   Where Serban has mined the open-hearted humor of the fantastic
``Cymbeline'' plot, Noble's production possessed a coolness
enhanced by the dark palette of color and Anthony Ward's abstractly
formal scene design.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the actors? How do the Americans fare when compared
with their British counterparts? Pretty well, in this instance.
However, Stephanie Roth Haberle, who is an imposing presence as
Imogen in Serban's park version, might have been an interesting
alternative to diminutive Joanne Pearce in the RSC production.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central Park production, Liev Schreiber is a
fascinatingly sympathetic villain as Iachimo. Even as he lurks
about the sleeping Imogen's bed, trying to gather information that
will falsely convince her husband of her infidelity, Schreiber's
innate warmth is oddly seductive. As a result, Imogen's resistance
of Iachimo's wiles is all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Cymbeline,'' the story is all and the actors are merely
servants to telling it clearly. Although both directors highlighted
comedic aspects of the play, Serban's production in Central Park is
superior for the way that the entire creative team manages to tell
the tale in an engaging and entertaining way.
</P>
<P>
   More successful than Noble's ``Cymbeline'' were the other two
Shakespeare plays produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company during
its residency in Brooklyn. ``Hamlet'' and ``Henry VIII'' provided
keen insights to disparate works by the man from Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   Director Matthew Warchus skipped the politics in ``Hamlet'' and
went straight for the Oedipal jugular. His production opened with a
brief black and white film that plays young Hamlet's memories of a
snow-filled winter romp with his father and his dog. As the film
rolled, Hamlet (Alex Jennings) mournfully emptied an urn filled
with ashes. All of the Shakespearean intrigues dealing with
Fortinbras and Norway were stripped away, laying bare the troubling
story of murder and incestuous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The wiry Jennings was a bundle of raw nerves as he hurtled from
one emotional explosion to the next. Was the character mad, or
merely feigning madness? Probably a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Susannah York as Gertrude, David Ryall as Polonius and Derbhle
Crotty as the mad, onanistic Ophelia all made solid contributions
to Warchus' plan. Unfortunately, the concept was undermined by key
performers who seemed unable to release themselves completely to
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was jarring to attend ``Henry VIII'' in the week following
verbal attacks and threats of violence aimed at playwright Terrence
McNally for his coming play, ``Corpus Christi.'' Shakespeare's
duplicitous Cardinal Wolsey drank heavily, fondled young women and
encouraged general debauchery among revelers at a party in his
home. The cardinal later repented. But it was tantalizing to think
of how this Catholic libertinism might be received these days by
certain watchdogs of morality. Wolsey was human and had human
failings. The author of ``Henry VIII'' made the cardinal a genuine
and ultimately sympathetic character - even if some of the
``facts'' are inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Could this type of work be staged as a new play today? Perhaps,
if it managed to hew to the dominant political culture - as this
play did when it was written.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that continues to draw artists and audiences to
Shakespeare after nearly 400 years? Lovely poetry spoken
exceedingly well doesn't hurt his appeal. But it isn't simply
euphonious combinations of words that keep us coming back.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stories. Brimming with blind passions, grand desires,
humiliating retributions and occasional happy endings, Shakespeare
is eternally here and now.

   Ranan Lurie, who is now known internationally as a political
cartoonist and analyst, was a celebrated Israeli army combat major
in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   To him it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action to bring
down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles at a
training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Lurie addresses the strategy chosen by the
United States to enter into what President Clinton is now calling
``a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between
the rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them. President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now
a very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing
for the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian
Gulf War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the
last war. What I am trying to say is that every terrorist
organization today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S.
retaliation will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States
has established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as
much as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. We
don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Let us remember when
President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran in 1980.
He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment failures and a
crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the mission was aborted.
It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who came out looking like a
very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... and as for the men, once you volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend, or to be higher paid. They would like to
serve, because that is what made them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such a mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid by the Israelis.
(In 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport in Entebbe, Uganda
and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of French tourists
returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew very little
about the whole situation in Entebbe because the hijacking and
hostage-taking happened out of thin air. So there was a tremendous
disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in comparison to the U.S.
advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama bin Laden. We have
known for years that bin Laden is organizing something massive for
terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on many occasions. So I
should assume this would make him one of the prime intelligence
targets the United States has in the world today. A person like
this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence operation: the
CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani interest to know what
is happening with him, so their agencies are probably working on
it. And all this intelligence would certainly serve our special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained as well.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the goal had to be destroying the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, I believe about
600,000, on a thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in
the end achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is
correct, but it was like taking candy from a baby, and we did it
with such drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we
had to bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why,
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Apparently his followers view bin Laden as a spiritual
leader, a very principled man, with a belief system that is
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and should be
burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what bin Laden
also thinks: that America is Satan, and therefore we are condemned.
He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and jeers at our
soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor terrorism on
American soil, without any moral hesitation, and establish himself
as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the extremist world. We have
to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20 or 30 very
good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the loss of
millions in a city of the United States.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ranan Lurie, who is now known internationally as a political
cartoonist and analyst, was a celebrated Israeli army combat major
in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   To him it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action to bring
down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles at a
training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Lurie addresses the strategy chosen by the
United States to enter into what President Clinton is now calling
``a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between
the rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them. President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now
a very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing
for the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian
Gulf War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the
last war. What I am trying to say is that every terrorist
organization today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S.
retaliation will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States
has established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as
much as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. We
don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Let us remember when
President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran in 1980.
He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment failures and a
crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the mission was aborted.
It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who came out looking like a
very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... and as for the men, once you volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend, or to be higher paid. They would like to
serve, because that is what made them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such a mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid by the Israelis.

and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of French tourists

military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'

terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not

   SCI-MONARCH-BUTTERFLIES (Undate) _ High in the mountains of

stands of towering fir trees. But conservationists have grown
increasingly concerned about these butterflies as these small
patches of forest, some of which were set aside as preserves,
compete with the needs of the residents around them. Now
conservationists are trying to help the butterflies by helping the
residents. Last month, 40,000 trees were planted in an effort to
save the fragile habitat where monarchs congregate after their long
flight south from the eastern United States and Canada. By Carol
Yoon. (600 words)

   SCI-GENDER-BIAS (New York) _ Virginia Valian, a professor of
psychology and linguistics at Hunter College, normally studies how

may even kill their intended victims or anyone else deemed to be in
the way of a stalker's desired goal. The extent of the stalking
problem and its potential for growth through computer networks has
astonished even the most astute researchers in the field and
prompted a strident call for stronger laws. By Jane E. Brody. (2000

   MOROCCO-MINBAR (Marrakesh, Morocco) _ Not long ago the imam at
the Casbah mosque agreed to show me his ancient minbar _ minbars
are decorated wooden staircases on wheels from which the imam
addresses the congregation during Friday worship. The idea was to
compare it to the 12th-century minbar from the Kutubiyya mosque
here, which conservators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art have
lately restored and installed to justified local fanfare, in the
remains of the city's immense Badi Palace. The smaller Casbah
minbar is great, too _ though a wreck _ and is still in use. So
however they compare esthetically, the two minbars have now become
fundamentally different kinds of objects and reflect different

MODERN WORLD RELISHES EGYPTIAN RELICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. - The Nile used to flood Egypt every year. Egypt
itself will flood Phoenix this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Splendors of Ancient Egypt'' is an immense exhibit coming
to the Phoenix Art Museum for an Oct. 4-March 28 run. The traveling
show of about 200 pieces of ancient art has visited St. Petersburg,
Fla.; Houston; Detroit; and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, where the show ended last week, to be packed up and
trucked to Phoenix, it took over the museum and washed into every
corner and closet, filling them up with mummy cases, bas-reliefs
and canopic jars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little of our own collection up right now,''
explained Asian-art curator Donald Jenkins, the on-site coordinator
for the show in Portland. ``To show this exhibition, we had to take
things down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Art Museum is the oldest in the Northwest and one
of the oldest in the West. Founded in 1892, the museum now inhabits
a stately stone building that looks something like a miniature
National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Its atrium served both as an introduction to Egypt and as a
giant waiting room, where crowds of people stood in line to get
individual cassette recorders with an ``accoustiguide'' tour
narrated by Kathleen Turner.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowds have been huge.
</P>
<P>
   A final count has not yet been completed, but Jenkins predicted
it would wind up in the 350,000-370,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   It will prove to be the second most popular in the museum's
history, after ``The Imperial Tombs of China,'' which attracted
450,000 visitors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that he wondered, as many have, why Egyptian art is
so popular. The world it lived in is 5,000 years old, and you might
think the interest in the objects would be archaeological rather
than aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the humanity of it,'' Jenkins said. ``That was
eye-opening for me in this exhibition. I always thought, like most
people, of the very rigid sculptures, the impassive faces, that
there was not much individuality. But when you actually go through
this exhibition, time and time again, you really see something that
strikes home and that underscores the humanity of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins singles out such pieces as the fragment of a head of
Senwesret III, from about 1850 B.C. There is not much remaining but
the eyes and brow under a headdress. Yet, despite our expectation
that all Egyptian figures are pretty much interchangeable,
Senwesret expresses personality. There is care, worry, even a
little fatigue showing on the finely modeled forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so telling,'' Jenkins said. ``And it's only that one
little part of the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The public can relate to the art because they see people doing
very human things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are mysterious,'' Jenkins said. ``There are
lion-headed goddesses and all that hieroglyphic writing. And that
has its own fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``But intermingled with that is this very human kind of thing:
those wooden models of people in the granary or plowing the field,
or the wife who puts her arm around her husband's shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the limestone relief of the deified King
Tuthmosis I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we feel the humans are stylized because of the
curious stance, head-on view of the shoulders, but the face in
profile, with the eyes twisted straight. But if you come close to
it, and look at it in detail, the sensitivity of the rendering
around the nose and eyes, and it is hard to believe it is carved.
It almost looks like it is impressed in clay, it is so refined.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the King Tut show in 1976 _ the first blockbuster of the
new era of museum exhibits _ that reawakened America's fascination
with Egyptian history and art. Since then, all shows of Egyptian
artifacts have been compared to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have asked, `How does this compare with King
Tut?','' Jenkins said, ``we tell them you can hardly compare them.
King Tut was an extraordinary set of objects, but all from one
tomb, and a tomb that had never been broken into, whereas most
Egyptian art comes from tombs that have been ransacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, this exhibition has a scope that is
phenomenal and that Tut couldn't match. It contains pieces from
Predynastic Egypt right down to Roman and Coptic times, and in the
midst are masterpieces by anyone's standards.'' &QL;

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Vigneau knew exactly what he wanted: a 1998 Volkswagen
Passat with a V-6 engine, silver paint, and black leather interior.
It's a &UR;  &LR;  vehicle that is &UR;  &LR;  hard to find on this side of the
Atlantic. But the Massachusetts software consultant knew exactly
where to look &UR;  &LR; _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Using his laptop computer, Vigneau discovered how much a car
dealer pays the factory for a new Passat; the information is
available at no charge on line. He also read on-line auto magazines
and messages from Volkswagen owners in Europe to get opinions on
the car. And he began e-mailing Volkswagen dealers in search of the
best price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pounding the pavement, Vigneau did nearly all his
research while sitting at a keyboard. He ended up paying $1,000
below sticker price for a hard-to-get car. ``By having the amount
of information that I did, from car review sites, to people's
personal experiences ... I knew enough so I wouldn't be taken for a
ride,'' Vigneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with streams of product information available on the
Internet, Vigneau and millions of other on-line consumers are
rewriting the rules of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of electronic shopping, information is power.
Businesses, consumer groups, and individuals publish vast amounts
of data about thousands of products _ data that shoppers can obtain
at the click of a mouse. Information that was once the private
possession of industry insiders is at the fingertips of any
consumer who cares to look. The results include better deals,
greater convenience, and retailers scurrying to preserve their
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have always benefited from the ignorance of their
customers. Sellers can pad their earnings by concealing the true
cost of goods they sell. They can withhold information about the
quality of merchandise. And sellers can count on the consumer's
limited patience, his unwillingness to visit one more store or buy
one more consumer-education magazine. But Internet shoppers can
overcome these barriers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research &UR;  &LR; Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., 5
percent of North American households bought something on line last
year, spending $2.4 billion. The number of on-line shoppers is
expected to double this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dollars spent on line only hint at the importance of
Internet shopping. The surge of Internet shoppers is turning
retailing upside down. For example, Portland, Ore.-based Egghead
Inc. stunned the retail world in February when it closed its 40
stores. The company changed its name to Egghead.com Inc. and began
selling products exclusively over the Internet or by telephone
order.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers will not go away
entirely. Consider Joseph Vigneau and his new Volkswagen Passat.
While he shopped for his car on the Internet, he actually made the
purchase at a traditional auto dealer. With products like cars,
many consumers still will want to see and test the wares.
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers still are finding money-saving information on line.
In order to attract visitors to their retail Web sites, companies
like bookseller Amazon.com or travel agents like
Travelocity &UR;  &LR; publish huge amounts of information that is free to
all visitors, even if they don't make a purchase. In addition,
Internet access services like America Online or Yahoo provide free
consumer information to boost the number of visitors to their
advertiser-supported Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers have been among the first to feel the effects of
Internet shopping. Detailed information about cars is plentiful on
the World Wide Web. For example, Edmund Publications Corp. of
Beverly Hills, Calif., publishes its new- and used-car guides on
the Web with prices, product reviews, and comments from car owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resist the enlightened consumer, many car dealers
are joining organizations like Autobytel.com Inc., an on-line
buying system that helps direct customers to nearby &UR;  &LR;  dealerships
that have exactly the car they want.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the Autobytel site can type in exactly the car he
wants, starting with a base model and adding options. The system
provides the invoice price _ the cost of the car to the dealer _
and shows the consumer how to calculate additional factors like
destination charges and rebates. A visitor can get similar
information for hundreds of new and used cars. Once he makes a
choice, the buyer can type in his contact information and request a
bid from the nearest car dealer in the Autobytel network.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel president Mark Lorimer says that it is a good deal for
the seller as well as the buyer, because the system automates so
much of the selling process. Lorimer says it costs a dealer about
$1,260 to sell the average new car. Selling through Autobytel
lowers that cost to around $400. That means more savings for
consumers and higher profits for dealers. Lorimer estimates that
the nation's 2,700 Autobytel dealers sell between 20,000 and 25,000
cars a month using the on-line approach.
</P>
<P>
   But some auto dealers find they don't have to share their
profits with a firm like Autobytel in order to reach customers on
the Internet. Smith Volkswagen in East Providence, R.I., where
Vigneau bought his Passat, created its own Web site. And it's
working. The company gets 100 to 200 e-mail inquiries a day from
Web shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get Thailand, places in North Africa, Western Europe, South
America, pretty much everywhere,'' said Smith salesman Phil Teves.
The dealership gets so many long-distance queries because of its
reputation for being able to acquire hard-to-get models like the
silver Passat. Teves said 20 to 50 percent of the dealership's
monthly new-car sales come from Internet shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most visitors to retail Web sites buy nothing. But
many of them collect information &UR;  &LR;  for use at stores in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, the
electronic bookstore that is probably the Internet's best-known
retailer. ``One of the pieces of feedback we get is that for some
people, they find the book they want to buy, or the CD, and they
print it out on a sheet of paper and take it to the clerk'' at a
store, Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors write and apologize for not buying from Amazon.
Said Bezos, ``We send them back mail saying, `Don't worry about
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Amazon.com spent millions on its huge database of
books and music recordings to attract paying customers from around
the world. But it costs the company nothing extra when visitors
just browse. Those browsers could turn into buyers one day.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and organizations are jumping into the market for
on-line consumer information. Consumer Reports magazine has rolled
out a Web site that aims to build on the magazine's reputation for
reliable, honest product reviews. In keeping with the Consumer
Reports tradition, there is not a trace of advertising. That means
visitors must pay for the service, but the price is just $2.95 a
month or $24 a year. Thomas Falconer, manager of the site, said
140,000 people have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   There are also for-profit consumer information services on the
Internet, which support themselves through advertising. The most
interesting of these feature ``shopbots'' _ software that lets a
visitor search for a product at several Internet retailers. A
number of these shopbots are available through the major Internet
gateways &UR;  &LR;  _ sites like Yahoo or Lycos _ visited daily by millions
of users.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo search service has a section devoted to on-line
shopping. Visitors can locate hundreds of sources for a variety of
consumer goods, and compare prices and features. For instance, a
visitor looking for a computer priced between $1,000 and $2,000
gets 365 suggestions culled from several on-line electronics shops.
The user can order the products over the 'Net, or use the
information as a guide when shopping in a store.
</P>
<P>
   The Compare.Net service takes this concept even further. The
site includes product reviews, side-by-side comparisons, and links
to Usenet message boards where consumers discuss their experiences
with similar products.
</P>
<P>
   This last feature is one of the most significant changes the
Internet has brought to retailing. Until now, consumer
word-of-mouth usually traveled as far as the back fence or the
office water cooler. Today, many turn to the Usenet, a set of
thousands of electronic bulletin boards or ``newsgroups.'' There
are a couple of newsgroups for general consumer issues, but many
more that focus on specialized interests like cars, computers, home
electronics, and other topics. And people are not shy about
relating their experiences with the products they buy.
</P>
<P>
   David Dologite, 25, a Boston project manager, routinely visits
the Usenet before making major purchases, to see how others have
fared. ``I've found the newsgroups to be useful in getting a sense
of what the customer service is like for various companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The DejaNews search service maintains an archive of old Usenet
messages that can easily be searched using key words, such as the
name of a particular product.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers sign on to the Internet in search of
bargain-basement prices. Indeed, Amazon.com and other Internet
retailers have used the lure of sharply discounted prices to draw
customers. But on the whole, it is not clear that goods purchased
on line are much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   While much is made of cut-rate book prices, the discounts are
sharply reduced when shipping costs are added. And travelers
searching for cheap air fares can find them just as readily with a
phone call as they can on the Internet. &UR;  &LR; Many other products on the
Internet _ computers for instance _ cost about the same as at a
discount electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   But for many consumers, finding exactly the right product _ say,
a silver Volkswagen with black leather interior _ is more important
than getting the lowest price. For these people, the Internet is on
its way to becoming the first place to look.

IN THE TEXAS HILLS, FREETHINKERS CONTINUE A FRONTIER TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 12thgraf, At the urging, to correct that park is in
Comfort sted Boerne)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ Latin is no longer their language of choice, but
freethinkers still are debating the great issues of the day, just
as their forefathers did 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk politics. We talk religion. We talk about whatever's
on our minds,'' said Julie Fisher of the Texas Hill Country
Freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``The Latin Colonies'' for the community forums
conducted in Latin, the original frontier freethinkers advocated
equal rights for all people, secular education and the abolition of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen members recently indulged themselves on a smorgasbord of
topics, including quantum mechanics, famous composers, tax
abatements and poisonous snakes.
</P>
<P>
   And what discussion of current events could overlook President
Clinton's love life?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what happens to Clinton,'' said Bob Ellis,
75, a resident of this town north of San Antonio. ``His life is
going to be miserable with Hillary anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Freethinkers pride themselves on the frank exchange of
considered opinions that are based on critical analysis and
rational thought.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy brought both notoriety and persecution to the
original freethinkers, atheist intellectuals from Germany who
settled in the hills outside San Antonio in the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping political repression and religious autocracy in their
homeland, they took up farming in southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were much different than the 30,000 German peasant
farmers who came to Texas for economic reasons,'' Ed Scharf of
Helotes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intellectuals came over for the freedoms of speech,
assembly and freedom from religion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Scharf and others, the Texas Historical
Commission has agreed to place a large limestone marker in Comfort
commemorating the frontier freethinkers. Comfort is about 15
northwest of Boerne.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking notice all over the country,'' said Catherine
Fahringer, 75, of San Antonio. ``We've never had anything like it
to honor freethinkers as freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freethinkers are largely ignored, unless they do something
famous in the mainstream,'' she said, noting that ``it's not
popular not to believe in God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They worshipped no deities, accepted no religious dogma, and
built no churches,'' said Scharf, 63.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1850s, Comfort had become the largest freethinker
colony in Texas, with more than 500 residents.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, they clashed with Confederates over their
anti-slavery and anti-secession positions.
</P>
<P>
   In a fit of bloodletting that led many freethinkers to abandon
the hills outside San Antonio, 36 were killed in battles with
Confederate troops in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them would have preferred to stay here and stay
neutral, but they were forced to either leave or join the
Confederate service,'' said Greg Krauter, 48, of Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who left were attacked as they fled to Mexico,'' Krauter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1866, a Tru Der Union (True to the Union) monument was
erected in Comfort to memorialize the fallen freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer and others decided a separate remembrance was merited
after hearing prayers said at rededication ceremonies for the
restored monument in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mention of their free thought, that they were
non-believers in God,'' Fahringer said, ``so we decided it's time
to come out of the closet and say who we are and honor the
freethinkers who went before us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new monument will be a daily reminder of Comfort's roots for
residents of the town that now has six churches.

BLESSING: GOD HAD NO PC FOR CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Wed be in a world o' hurt if God had used a PC for
creation!
</P>
<P>
   That's all I can conclude after collecting entries for the past
couple of weeks in our latest contest. Readers were asked to send
in examples of how things would be if God had used a PC to create
things.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the top three entries:
</P>
<P>
   Our second runner up was Bob Lind, who wrote that creation
``would have taken a lot longer than seven days. You'd have to
allow for the time He'd spend on hold for tech support!''
</P>
<P>
   Our first runner up was Doyle Holcomb, who wrote, ``God did
consider using a computer to create the universe, but he was unable
to come to an agreement with Bill Gates on the software to run it.
Talks broke off when Gates refused to use the word ``apple'' in a
program about two people in the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   First place went to Steve Hrovat, who sent in several great
examples of how things would be if God had used a PC for creation.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite was: ``Having a baby is considered a slow, painful
process by many. This was done out of God's frustration at having
to download an entire universe on a 2400-baud modem. It was a slow,
painful process. He figured he'd make `downloading' a baby an
equally painful process so people realize what he went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another gem from Hrovat: ``All humans are expected to go
to school at least 12 years to have any chance of success. This is
a throwback to the days of MS-DOS, which took God about 12 years to
figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``The Ten Commandments were done on a clay tablet
because God's printer driver had some type of bug in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was fun, eh? Thanks to everybody who sent in an
entry!
</P>
<P>
   We'd better stop now, though, or we'll all get struck by
lightning! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Passwords to success &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple weeks ago I wrote about the growing problem of
passwords. These days, most people are walking around with one or
two in their heads. And it's not unusual to have five, 10 or more
passwords to remember, thanks to things like ATM machines and
Internet access accounts.
</P>
<P>
   I asked for your suggestions on good ways to remember passwords.
Here's what you said:
</P>
<P>
   - Several readers suggested using a single password for
everything. (This might work for some people, but there's got to be
something better you can do.)
</P>
<P>
   - Here's a variation on that theme from a reader named Eric:
Think of a person or pet in your life and use it to create slightly
unique passwords everywhere. Say your dog is named ``Fido.'' Your
password to log on to your computer could be ``fidocomp001.'' To
check your e-mail, the password could be ``fidoemail002'' and so
forth. (Not a bad idea.)
</P>
<P>
   - One reader said he put all his passwords in a computer file
and gave the file a mysterious name. That way he can open the file
any time he's online and needs a password quickly. (Interesting
idea, but not very secure.)
</P>
<P>
   - One guy proposed creating passwords based on your favorite
things _ you favorite fruit, favorite sports team, etc. Use the
first letter from each to make up the password. (An idea with some
merit.)
</P>
<P>
   - A reader said he maintains a free e-mail account and uses it
only to keep e-mails he sends himself that contain passwords and
other account information for accounts he sets up. ``Risky?'' he
asked. ``Sure, but what isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   - Here's a good one: A reader named Rozanne suggested thinking
up a sentence that has personal meaning. Then, use the first letter
from each word to create the password. Example: ``My father was
born on 3/7/22'' would create the password ``mfwbo3722.''
</P>
<P>
   - A Phoenix area company called Micro System Designs makes a
program called ``WebPassKey.'' It watches where you browse the Net
and remembers passwords and login names automatically. On your next
visit, it automatically enters the info for you. The software also
can be used to store passwords for other applications. Interested?
Call (602) 788-6000, or visit their Web site at www.maxlock.com.
</P>
<P>
   - A reader named Antoniu suggests keeping passwords in a single
file, then encrypting the file with a program such as PGP.
</P>
<P>
   - John recommends using Password Safe, a free program you can
download from www.zdnet.com. ``It's like having a little safe to
keep all of your passwords in,'' he wrote. ``Only one catch: You
need a password to get into Password Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   - Juergen says he uses his Palm Pilot to keep his passwords
safe. He puts them all in a single file, then uses a Palm Pilot
program called Secret to scramble the contents. Of course, you need
a password to read the file later.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there you have it. I hope some of those suggestions help
you out. I know I'm going to try a couple! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Just another hoax
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet users have been passing around an e-mail lately that
refers to ``Time'' magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, the article states that two engineers at Intel
somehow managed to write the words ``Bill Sux'' on the surface of a
Pentium microchip. The graffiti is supposedly visible under a
powerful electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail points out that the reference to ``Bill'' is aimed at
Bill Gates, the billionaire head of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's fun to think that this actually happened. But, it
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   An Intel spokesman confirmed that the e-mail claim is somebody's
idea of a joke.
</P>

``chip,'' visit snopes.simplenet.com/spoons &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though stalking is often glamorized in movies and sitcoms, in
real life it is anything but. For most victims, it is a waking
nightmare characterized by constant fear and hypervigilance that
triggers lasting emotional distress and sometimes results in bodily
injury or even death.
</P>
<P>
   Since one in 20 women can expect to be stalked at some time
during their lives, usually by a man she once dated or married, it
pays to know what to do if it should happen to you. Sometimes, men
who have been rejected by women stalk to get revenge. These men,
along with those who think ``if I can't have her, no one else
will,'' can be especially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   BE FIRM: Experts say that in an effort to be kind and gentle,
too many women give their stalkers mixed signals, leaving them with
the belief that if they keep at it they will eventually win the
women they desire.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Gift of Fear'' (Little, Brown, $22.95,
paperback), Gavin de Becker says that ``a rejection based on any
condition, say, that she wants to move to another city, just gives
him something to challenge.'' He suggests that women should ``never
explain why they don't want a relationship, but simply make clear
that they have thought it over, that this is their decision and
that they expect the man to respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Doris M. Hall, who questioned 145 victims of stalkers (83
percent of them women), also recommends firmness: ``Once and only
once, tell the person you want nothing to do with him. Don't try to
be nice; it can only work against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hall, an expert on criminology at California State
University at Bakersfield, emphasizes the importance of taking any
stalking behavior seriously and dealing with it aggressively from
the very outset. ``If someone's behavior seems out of line, if it
is making you uncomfortable, something's up,'' she said. ``You have
a better chance of putting a stop to it if you don't give it a
chance to accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   CUT OFF ALL CONTACT: Dr. Hall compared stalkers to ``naughty
third graders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care what kind of attention they get,'' she said,
``as long as it's attention.'' Any kind of response on the part of
the victim, no matter how negative, can be construed by the stalker
as a sign that she is really interested and is trying to keep a
relationship going.
</P>
<P>
   De Becker, an expert on predicting violent behavior who advises
stalking victims, wrote, ``When a woman communicates again with
someone she has explicitly rejected, her actions don't match her
words.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when an unwanted pursuer starts making persistent
phone calls, sending messages, showing up uninvited at a woman's
job, school or home, following her or trying to get her friends or
family to help his cause, ``it is very important that no further
detectable response be given.''
</P>
<P>
   De Becker added: ``He views any response as progress. If you
call the pursuer back, or agree to meet, or send him a note or have
somebody warn him off, you buy another six weeks of his unwanted
pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hall warns stalking victims to ``never, ever meet with a
stalker,'' even if he says it is only to say a final goodbye or to
return the victim's belongings. It is most likely a lie and may
escalate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is sending the police to warn him off likely to do any good,
de Becker says. Unless the pursuer has committed a crime that
warrants his arrest, the police can do little more than talk, which
may further embolden the stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Even obtaining a restraining order can sometimes backfire. Court
actions infuriate some stalkers and may provoke violent behavior.
De Becker has found that court orders that are introduced early
carry less risk than those introduced after the stalker has made a
significant emotional investment or introduced threats and other
sinister behavior. ``A stalker who has been at it for years and who
has already ignored warnings and interventions'' is not likely to
be deterred by a court order, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECT YOURSELF: Under the auspices of the University of
California at San Diego, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has
developed a list of tips for self-protection against stalkers.
While specific legal advice is likely to vary from state to state,
the clearinghouse's practical advice can apply anywhere. Among the
most important tips are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your address private. Use a postal box (obtained through
a mail box service or the post office) instead of a residential
address on everything, including your driver's license and
government documents. File a change-of-address card with the post
office. Give your street address only to your most trusted friends
and tell them not to give it to anyone else. Do not have anything
mailed or shipped to your home address. Have your name removed from
any ``reverse'' directories that list people numerically by phone
number or address.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not give out your telephone number. Get an unpublished and
unlisted phone number. Never print your number on checks. If asked
for a phone number, give your work number. Get an answering machine
that records messages on a microcassette and allows you to screen
all calls. If your state has caller ID, order complete blocking on
your number. If you are bothered by harassing calls, put a beep
tone on your line to make callers think you are taping the call.
You might even add a warning on your outgoing message, telling
callers they may be taped. Also, consider getting a cellular phone
and keeping it with you at all times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guard your e-mail. If you are at risk of being cyber-stalked,
change your e-mail address to something that is hard to guess and
do not enter any personal information into online directories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a diary. Record every stalking incident and the names,
dates and times of every contact with the authorities. Save the
tapes of phone messages and anything sent by the stalker in the
mail or left at your home or workplace. Do not accept packages you
did not order.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secure your home. Trim the bushes around your house. Install a
loud exterior alarm and motion-sensitive lights high enough so they
cannot be removed by a person standing on the ground. Always lock
your doors with dead-bolt locks. Also use window locks on basement
and ground-floor windows. If you have sliding glass doors or
windows, secure them with a safety bar. Put locks on your fuse or
circuit breaker box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secure your car, van or truck. Always keep your garage door
and car doors locked and look carefully inside before entering the
car. Do not use parking lots where you must surrender the keys; if
you must, leave only the ignition key. Get a locking gas cap and a
hood-locking device that is controlled from inside. Know the
locations of the police and fire departments and busy shopping
centers; if you think you are being followed, head directly to one
of these. When you arrive, stay in the car and blow the horn to
attract attention. When traveling to and from work, vary your
schedule and your route. Never stop to help a motorist in distress
_ phone for help.

&HT;        MARTHA'S VINEYARD LEADERS: PRESIDENT CLINTON CAN YOU HELP US
WITH ...
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 -- If Martha's Vineyard lawmakers could meet
with President Clinton, they would tell him they need Washington's
help with a number of issues ranging from an inadequate
transportation system to overly stringent fishing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole menu of ideas and items that we could use on
Martha's Vineyard,'' said U.S. Rep. William Delahunt, D-Quincy, who
represents the island.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said he wants people to know Martha's Vineyard is more
than a ``wealthy playground for the rich and famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I represent are the hard-working people trying to
eke out a living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems Martha's Vineyard faces is that the
federal government allocates its money without factoring into the
equation the island's part-time residents for such things as
highway construction, said Charles Clifford, executive director of
the Martha's Vineyard Commission, the island's regional planning
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes County, which encompasses Martha's Vineyard, has only
about 14,000 permanent residents. But with the likes of Clinton,
Hollywood stars and sun-starved tourists, the summer population
balloons to about 102,000, a spokesman for the Martha's Vineyard
Chamber of Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, Dukes County received $53.7 million from
the federal government, the lion's share coming in the form of
Social Security and other pension benefits paid to residents. By
contrast, Franklin County in western Massachusetts, with a
population of 71,000, took in $272.7 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's affection for the island -- this is the fourth
summer holiday he has vacationed with his family on Martha's
Vineyard -- Clifford said the president has ``done nothing to
understand its needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably count on one hand and have four fingers
left over how much in federal dollars we have received since
(Clinton) has been coming here,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman said President Clinton, too, shares
their concerns about these and other issues that are affecting
communities across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal dollars that Martha's Vineyard, as well as other
communities across the country, seek are overseen more by Congress
than the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is expected to hobnob with Hollywood celebrities
and the nation's elite over the next two weeks, local leaders said
they have no plans to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   But if local lawmakers did meet with Clinton, most said they
would ask for his assistance in obtaining federal money to improve
the island's transportation system. State Rep. Steve Turkington,
D-Falmouth, describes Martha's Vineyard's roads during the summer
months as ``parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many other places that have worse traffic in the
summer,'' Turkington said. ``Just try driving into Edgartown,
Vineyard Haven or Oak Bluffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rappaport, a local attorney and chairman of the Woods Hole,
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority -- which
oversees the operation of the ferries between the islands and the
mainland -- said the traffic congestion on Martha's Vineyard has
gotten increasingly worse over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a major expansion of the public transit system,''
Rappaport said, adding that the current public and private bus
systems are not meeting the demands of visiting tourists during the
summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport said he would like to see the federal government fund
a program that would allow Martha's Vineyard to use a fleet of
buses during the peak summer months. During the winter months,
those same buses could be used by a ski resort community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many island leaders are also concerned that future budget cuts
could close the Menemsha Coast Guard Station, although Delahunt
said there are no plans to shut it down this year. But he warned
that a shrinking Coast Guard budget puts the station at risk in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Goff, chairman of the Chilmark Board of Selectmen, said
the federal government needs to change how it regulates the
commercial fishing industry because current policies are hurting
local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reform and make better the fishing regulations,''
she said. ``I think the fishermen are looking for a little more
understanding so they can make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Morgan, a 74-year-old semi-retired Menemsha fisherman,
said the federal government needs to relax its catch quotas this
year on summer flounder and striped bass. Morgan also said that if
the U.S. is going to allow Canadian-caught swordfish to be sold on
Cape Cod, then our northern neighbors ``should allow us to fish in
the eastern part of the Georgia Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martha's Vineyard copes with the increasing growth boom that
is eating up its remaining landscape, island leaders are attempting
to preserve as much open space for future generations. In fact,
Rappaport said that 2 percent of every real estate transaction is
set aside in a land bank.
</P>
<P>
   A land bank is a designated fund designed for the sole purpose
of helping communities purchase land for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Turkington said he would like to see the federal government
``step up'' with some money and help the state and local
governments pay for preserving the island's open space.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Martha's Vineyard residents are looking for federal
money allocations earmarked specifically for the island. Chris
Burns, a well-known media consultant and former Washington Post
executive, said the best thing Clinton can do to help the island is
to make the federal government more responsive and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should walk on the beach, take a deep breath and figure
out how to give us a better federal government,'' Burns said would
be his advice to the president. ``A government that is more
reasonable, more civilized and more focused on what the country
needs.''

all calls. If your state has caller ID, order complete blocking on
your number. If you are bothered by harassing calls, put a beep
tone on your line to make callers think you are taping the call.
You might even add a warning on your outgoing message, telling
callers they may be taped. Also, consider getting a cellular phone
and keeping it with you at all times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guard your e-mail. If you are at risk of being cyber-stalked,
change your e-mail address to something that is hard to guess and
do not enter any personal information into online directories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a diary. Record every stalking incident and the names,
dates and times of every contact with the authorities. Save the
tapes of phone messages and anything sent by the stalker in the
mail or left at your home or workplace. Do not accept packages you
did not order.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secure your home. Trim the bushes around your house. Install a
loud exterior alarm and motion-sensitive lights high enough so they
cannot be removed by a person standing on the ground. Always lock
your doors with dead-bolt locks. Also use window locks on basement
and ground-floor windows. If you have sliding glass doors or
windows, secure them with a safety bar. Put locks on your fuse or
circuit breaker box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secure your car, van or truck. Always keep your garage door
and car doors locked and look carefully inside before entering the
car. Do not use parking lots where you must surrender the keys; if
you must, leave only the ignition key. Get a locking gas cap and a
hood-locking device that is controlled from inside. Know the
locations of the police and fire departments and busy shopping
centers; if you think you are being followed, head directly to one
of these. When you arrive, stay in the car and blow the horn to
attract attention. When traveling to and from work, vary your
schedule and your route. Never stop to help a motorist in distress
_ phone for help.

ZAP! ZEKE II BECOMES A MODEL CANINE CITIZEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Looking back, shock was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this Airedale pup had been a jolt: the barking,
the jumping, the biting, the nasty little things he did with his
snout.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke II was 7 weeks old when I purchased him from a private
breeder in Glendale. Soon came the smash-mouth realization that I
had bought Damian's hound from hell. Every moment of every day, the
new dog tested us. If he wasn't eating my guitar strap, he was
running laps around the kitchen with dish towels stuck between his
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke II was a dog from ``Seinfeld's'' bizarro world. ``No''
meant ``yes.'' ``Down'' meant ``up.'' ``Come'' meant ``catch me if
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The cats were so nervous they refused to walk on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When Zeke II was 6 months old, I sent him off to doggy boot camp
for serious obedience training. Five weeks later, he returned with
the trainer's trenchant observation: He's a real handful, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   After a second stint at doggy boot camp with little improvement,
I came to the sad realization that Zeke II's options were running
out. I kept telling myself he was just a pup and deserving of some
slack. But he was a pup expanding ominously. Every day, he grew
larger and stronger and more obstreperous.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne was no longer able to control him. I had slightly better
success.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, I purchased a shock collar. Let me make it
clear to all you animal lovers (like myself) that this WAS a last
resort. I didn't know much about shock collars, other than that
they sounded barbaric and I never imagined using one.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I never imagined a dog like Zeke II.
</P>
<P>
   Shock collars, also known as remote trainers, usually consist of
a simple snap-on nylon collar with a receiver in the middle that
resembles a pager. The other part, the transmitter, looks like a TV
remote. Both transmitter and receiver operate on a 9-volt battery.
</P>
<P>
   My transmitter came with three buttons: one for programming the
severity of shock (ranging from 1 to 8), a warning button and a
shock button. The warning button delivers an audio signal when the
dog commits a heinous act, such as chewing on the cat. If he
continues the heinous act, the negative behavior is corrected with
a quick, low-level shock, which also emits the same audio signal up
to a range of 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   (The manufacturer claims that the lower-level shocks feel like
the charge from carpet static electricity and recommends that
owners try the shock collars on themselves first to reassure
themselves that the charge is not too severe. I did and, at level
3, found it to be somewhat more potent than static electricity _
more like a mild shock from an electrical short.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the dog eventually will associate negative
behavior with the warning sound so he won't need a shock
correction.
</P>
<P>
   All this was in my remote-trainer booklet and instructional
videotape, which I reviewed a half-dozen times to make sure I was
going to do it correctly. But in truth, I had no idea what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Zeke II received his first correction was a moment
that forever altered all our lives.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday, late morning. Zeke II was being even more
recalcitrant than usual, alternately barking aggressively, biting
and ripping apart ``No Bad Dogs,'' one of several books he had
snatched from the bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   We could have corrected Zeke II for any number of problems, but
the remote-trainer manual advised to focus on one misbehavior at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   We focused on cat chasing. From the onset, Zeke II had it in for
Soledad, a stray we had taken in a few years earlier. And sure
enough, it wasn't more than five minutes after we activated the
trainer that the terrier terror began.
</P>
<P>
   As Soledad stepped through the pet door, Zeke II made his move
for her.
</P>
<P>
   The scene unfolded in slow-mo. As always, I told him ``No.'' And
as always, he ignored the command and continued cat bound. I
pressed the warning button on the transmitter, activating a red
pulsating light and a warning tone from the collar.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke II ignored that, also.
</P>
<P>
   Soledad executed an escape maneuver, bounding skillfully from
couch to television to piano. Zeke II compensated and pursued.
</P>
<P>
   My thumb slid up to the correction button. Zeke II may have shot
the sheriff, but he did not shoot the deputy.
</P>
<P>
   One press and the dog fiend froze in mid-molest.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 20 minutes, Zeke II slipped into a peculiar stupor,
eyes focused on nothing in particular, a strapping Airedale youth
reduced to an oversize hood ornament.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where Zeke II went during those 20 minutes, but I'm
convinced a transference occurred. When he came back around, he was
not the same dog. It was as if the personality of the surly, skanky
Zeke II had been electrically exorcised and replaced with the
sweet, gentle spirit of the deceased Zeke I.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that may be a stretch. But consider this: After that first
correction (and only a few more), Zeke II mysteriously began to
obey commands, the barking stopped, the aggression ceased, and we
can now even leave him alone in the house.
</P>
<P>
   To me, it's a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating the use of shock collars. I suspect that
every dog in every situation reacts differently. I'm also guessing
that Zeke II's substantial obedience training contributed to our
positive experience with the remote trainer. A couple of months
have passed, and there has been no relapse. In fact, I no longer
use the collar except for off-leash training outdoors. And he
always responds to the warning tone _ even when a rabbit jumps out
of the brush 10 feet in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Zeke II has become a model dog citizen. We're happy.
He's happy. The cats have returned to the floor. &QL;

SHOCK COLLARS UNLEASH CONTROVERSY AMONG EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Shock collars, as you might expect, are not
universally embraced. The Arizona Humane Society finds them
particularly objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate them,'' said the society's Kim Hicks. ``We're opposed to
anything that causes pain to animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Luper, owner of the Greater Phoenix Dog Training Academy,
uses the motto, ``Never never hit your dog.'' Luper said you can
add to that, ``Never shock your dog either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I've used them is for poison-proofing or
snake-proofing,'' Luper said.
</P>
<P>
   Shock collars are commonly used to teach dogs to stay clear of
snakes. They're also used in the training of retrievers and other
hunting dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Luper said shock collars should not be used as a substitute for
more in-depth, general obedience training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dog's main motivation to listen should be
anticipation of the praise and affection that he'll receive for
listening,'' Luper said. ``I don't like the idea of a dog listening
because he's afraid of the shock he'll get if he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Luper said that in the hands of an inexperienced dog trainer, a
device such as a shock collar can become traumatic to the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, a shock collar can provide a correction at a distance,''
Luper said. ``But if you want a dog to come and you don't use the
collar correctly, it can have the reverse effect. If you use the
shock when he's running away from you, he just might run away
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   If your dog doesn't come when you call him, Luper said, you
should work on modifying your relationship with your pet instead of
just shocking him for not coming.
</P>
<P>
   Some breeds, according to Luper, don't respond well to shock,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pit bulls are virtually immune to pain,'' Luper said.
``Rottweilers are also less sensitive to pain than other breeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Luper said that although he doesn't have firsthand experience,
he has heard good things about devices that use audio or smell
corrections, such as citronella spray, in place of shock.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area animal psychologist Kay Cox, a k a the Pet
Counselor, said that she has used shock collars and that they can
be an effective training device for some dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dog with an attitude needs tough love,'' Cox said. ``You
have to find the right combination of whatever it takes to make
that animal recognize you as the leader in order to communicate
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the more traditional choke-chain and leash-training
methods can also be painful if done incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of trainers train completely wrong,'' Cox said. ``A
good, hard yank with a leash hurts. You do that, you aren't
teaching them; you're controlling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said a key to using a shock collar is to leave it on the dog
for a few days before activating it so the dog doesn't associate
the correction with the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shock collar works because it doesn't have to do with you,''
Cox said. ``Because there isn't a leash between you and the dog,
there is no one the dog can be resentful of when the correction is
made. It's like God strikes him. It can definitely wake up some
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox, too, concedes that shock collars are not necessary in
most situations. She estimates that only about 1 percent of pups
under 8 weeks old demonstrate the kind of aggression and dominance
that may eventually merit such non-traditional training methods.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarian Mark Trueblood of Apollo Animal Hospital in
Glendale, Ariz., said he does not hesitate to recommend using
remote trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a situation where a dog is a problem barker and
you've tried other methods, using a no-bark collar is certainly a
better alternative than taking the dog to the pound or having it
euthanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Trueblood said he is not aware of any physical damage caused by
remote trainers if used correctly. &QL;

THE TEXAS ROOTS OF KENNETH STARR: A MAN WITH A MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ To understand the drive and perseverance of
Kenneth Starr _ whose investigation of presidential improprieties
has delved too deeply, taken too long and cost too much, according
to many polls _ you have to examine his Texas roots, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of Starr's formative years presents a picture that
meshes little with the White House's portrayal of him as a
relentless, if not brutal, and politically motivated inquisitor.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a minister, Starr was born in Vernon but attended
school in San Antonio after his family moved to a small house on
the outskirts of the South Texas city. His classmates and teachers
recall him as a squeaky-clean, mild-mannered, straight-A student.
</P>
<P>
   Even friends who voted for President Clinton say the
straight-arrow Ken Starr they knew from high school, subsequent
reunions and his visits back to Texas is a far cry from the image
spun by some in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are mistaking the fact that Ken is a very
focused and intense person,'' said Jim Hays, a high school
classmate of Starr and now a Houston computer consultant and a
political independent. ``I know Ken Starr, and he is not a cruel
and vindictive person. He was given an assignment and is very
committed to getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a taxpayer, I can say for all of us the amount being spent
is an extraordinary sum. But we may not have spent so much if there
had been earlier disclosures by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sam Houston High School on the Alamo City's east side, Starr
never went out for athletics and _ largely due to his
fundamentalist background _ may never have jitterbugged. Instead of
dating, he'd sit in front of the TV each night shining his shoes
and then his father's, his 90-year-old mother Vannie recalled this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But the meticulous son of a Church of Christ minister was not
what would be classified today as your standard high school nerd.
Despite being one of the class brains, he was immensely popular and
widely considered to be a caring and sensitive classmate, one to be
relied upon, said Gary O. Smith, who served on the Student Council
with Starr and is now a San Antonio College professor.
</P>
<P>
   Elected class president both his junior and senior years (''Star
with Starr!'' was one of his slogans), he also was voted the 1964
graduating class's ``most likely to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his then-thin frame, baby face and rural drawl _ picked
up from early years in Thalia, near Vernon _ classmates saw that
Starr grasped things far before they did, said John Villareal, who
was in Starr's homeroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a few years ahead of his time in high school,'' said
Villareal, 52, now a chemistry professor at the University of
Texas-Pan American at Edinburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him the day President Kennedy got shot. It was
announced at lunch hour, and we were in homeroom. It affected him
more than any of us. I remember him crying when it was announced.
Not many of us were aware of the impact. The rest of us were in a
state of shock, but it affected him more.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr wrote a heartfelt column about Kennedy for the school
paper, The Raven, and later in college joined the Young Democrats.
It would be years before he became a conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was in high school during the early 1960s, the last gasp
of the rah-rah years of school spirit and crew cuts and before the
Vietnam protest era had politically charged the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we were doing was dating and cheerleading, but with
Kenneth, who could be cool, you knew there was more depth,'' said
Diane Bohannon Craig, who was selected with Starr as ``citizens of
the year'' by the Sam Houston High faculty in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Realtor in San Antonio, Craig said: ``We weren't locked
into heavy issues. He could be very serious. A lot of that had to
do with his upbringing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After escaping Germany within months of Hitler's rise to power
in 1933 and wandering the world separately for 15 years, Maurice
and Gerson Goldhaber were ready for the most ordinary of brotherly
relationships when they reunited as particle physicists in the
United States. So when Gerson was engaged in the experiment of his
life, racing to discover a speck of antimatter called the
antiproton, Maurice did what just about any scientist in a close
family might do: He bet a colleague $500 that the antiproton did
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Far from showing disloyalty, he was merely carrying on a noble
tradition _ wagering on the outcome of scientific questions _ that
seems as pervasive in labs, observatories and supercomputer centers
as pools on college basketball tournaments are in office parks and
machine shops.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition was already alive when titans like Johannes Kepler
and Isaac Newton were setting the foundations of modern science _
and making bets.
</P>
<P>
   This century's savants have ponied up on everything from the
properties of matter's tiniest building blocks to the fate of the
entire universe. The stakes generally range from a few dollars to a
few hundred dollars, often in the form of pricey dinners or
expensive liquor _ and in at least one instance, 100 gallons of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many bottles of the finest champagnes and malt whiskies, and
even more esoteric stakes, rest in abeyance while observers
struggle to count rare photons from remote galaxies,'' wrote James
Peebles of Princeton University and Joseph Silk of the University
of California at Berkeley in the journal Nature a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such bets are ``a way to focus attention on what are the really
key issues,'' said Peebles in an interview. Others think that
because scientific betting is as common as shooting craps in a
Damon Runyon story, the custom must say something important about
physical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's often a stereotype that scientists are out to create a
ground plan of the universe and that they believe their theories
with religious fervor,'' said Robert Crease, a philosopher of
science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. ``Bets
are interesting, because they reveal the game-like quality with
which scientists often approach their work.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are far from seeing anything so significant in
scientific bets. Margaret Geller, an astronomer at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics called them ``sort of
disgusting.'' She said, ``It has always struck me as one of the
rather unsophisticated macho aspects of these fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Martin Rees, an astrophysicist at Cambridge University,
``I actually think it is rather frivolous to make them.'' In a
scientific disagreement, professional reputations are the stakes
that count, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the scientific tote board lights up with
remarkable frequency. For decades at the old Bell Laboratories (now
part of Lucent Technologies) in New Jersey, a betting ``book'' lay
in the tearoom, where scientists gathered for discussions each day
at 4 p.m., recalled Pierre Hohenberg, a physicist who is now a
deputy provost at Yale University. ``A few of us were ideologically
inclined to say that arguments should end up with a bet,'' said
Hohenberg. ``Talk is cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten, laboratory-style notebook recorded bets on
highly technical subjects like competing explanations for
superconductivity, in which certain chilled materials transmit
electricity without resistance. It also contained more general
wagers on political and economic issues. The book disappeared from
the tearoom around 1990, perhaps stolen by a sore loser. Long
before then, however, a chance remark by a regular bettor at Bell
Labs inspired a similar book on the opposite coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the front page it says, `The Official SLAC Theory Group
Record of Wagers,' '' explained Michael Peskin of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center in California. It contains 28 pages of
mostly scientific bets dating to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   His own proudest entry, he said, is a winning bet against SLAC's
Sidney Drell regarding the existence and mass of the top quark, an
elementary particle discovered to much fanfare in 1995. ``Dinner
for four,'' said Peskin with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The German astronomer Johannes Kepler is believed to have begun
the game in 1600, when he was given the problem of figuring out
Mars' orbit around the sun from astronomical observations made by
his mentor, Tycho Brahe. Kepler took over the problem from a senior
Brahe assistant named Longomontanus.
</P>
<P>
   Kepler bet Longomontanus he would crack the problem in a week or
so, explained James Voelkel, a historian of science at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The stakes are not known,
but Longomontanus won : It took Kepler five years to find the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for what was ``undoubtedly one of the most
crucial wagers in scientific history,'' said Alan Shapiro, a
historian of science at the University of Minnesota. Kepler's
pondering had produced his three laws of planetary motion, which
describe the elliptical orbits and how fast planets moved in them.
Unfortunately, nobody knew why planets would behave like that.
</P>
<P>
   So as a way to spark competition, Christopher Wren of London
announced in 1684 that he would give a book worth 40 shillings to
anyone who, within two months, could deduce Kepler's laws from the
inverse-square law that says the sun's gravity decreases with the
square of the planet's distance from the sun. Isaac Newton's paper
on his solution grew into his Principia, the tract that became a
cornerstone of modern physics. ``The rest is history,'' said
Shapiro. By the time he published it, however, years had passed,
and Newton could not cash in his winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile wagers among scientists continued to crop up from
time to time in the 1700s and 1800s. For reasons no one can quite
explain, however, this century has been the Monte Carlo night of
scientific culture. ``In my life I have made countless bets on
science; I may not be able to remember all of them,'' said Walter
Lewin, an astronomer at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some notable players complain that there is not enough
action to go around. ``Most scientists are not interested in
bets,'' said Michael Turner an astrophysicist at the University of
Chicago, still fuming after a conference where no one would make a
new bet with him on the rate at which the universe is expanding,
called the Hubble constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bets imply a certain irrationality or in-your-face attitude,''
said Turner. ``I love 'em.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Like a gambler blowing ostentatiously on his dice, Turner stands
out in his enthusiasm, but he is hardly alone. Relating a
not-so-unusual episode in his book ``The Neglect of Experiment''
(Cambridge, 1986), the historian Allan Franklin counted no fewer
than three separate bets on tests of whether ``parity'' _ a kind of
left-right symmetry _ was preserved in subatomic interactions.
</P>
<P>
   The late physicist Richard Feynman, for example, gave 50-to-1
odds on a dollar bet and paid off when experiments in 1957 showed
that the laws of physics were not quite the same when left and
right and up and down were reversed, as in a mirror _ just as
predicted by two theorists, T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone involved in those bets eventually won a Nobel
Prize in physics for one reason or another. Betting by leading
scientists continues to the present: William Phillips of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, who shared a 1997
Nobel, has $100 plus interest riding on whether or not unexplained
surprises turn up in the physics of the quantum microworld anytime
over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his wager with Benjamin Bederson of New York University,
Phillips said he bet against surprises bigger than just a new
particle or force, ``but I'd love to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A similarly high-minded detachment marks the skein of bets made
by the cosmologist Stephen Hawking. The bets, several of them made
with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of the California Institute of
Technology, often involve the properties of black holes _ massive,
collapsed bodies whose gravity is so intense that even light cannot
escape. This tone is not always reflected in the stakes: Thorne won
a subscription to Penthouse magazine in one bet against Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Often the stakes involve expensive liquor.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition may have been started in the 1950s by Walter
Baade, an astronomer at the Palomar Observatory in California.
Baade bet his colleague Rudolph Minkowski a bottle of Hudson's Bay
Procurable whisky that a strange-looking galaxy spewing radio waves
was really a pair of galaxies in collision. Minkowski conceded the
bet and then drank most of the whisky anyway. Justice might have
been served, since colliding galaxies fell out of favor a few years
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of Baade and Minkowski, Peebles of Princeton is
referee for an international bet on the value of the Hubble
constant, a number that describes the rate of expansion of the
universe. The stakes: a case of single malt scotch. Lewin of MIT,
in two separate astronomical bets, staked a dozen bottles of whisky
against a pound of caviar; and six bottles of ``superb'' champagne
against three of cognac and three of champagne. Marc Davis of
Berkeley agreed to wager ``a case of the best wine from Italy
against the best California wine'' with an Italian physicist on the
size of the largest structures in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the oil crisis, almost 20 years ago, Frank Shu
of the University of California at Berkeley bet Caltech's George
Djorgovski 100 gallons of gasoline that by Jan. 1, 2001, theorists
will have determined several crucial cosmic parameters to within 20
percent. One such parameter is the mass density of the entire
universe _ still a notoriously controversial number. In view of the
oil shortage, Shu and Djorgovski stipulated that fine wine worth
the same amount could be substituted if there were no gasoline left
by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one good reason for all this wagering, said
Djorgovski. The system that bestows official scientific awards, he
said, ``is usually rewarding old guys for what they've done
God-knows-when. It would be actually nice if there was an active,
up-to-date system that would provide prizes for great new
achievements quickly. Maybe making bets is a simple, samizdat way
of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bets can also serve quite a different purpose: as a diversionary
tactic to throw other scientists off the scent. In the months
leading up to what physicists call the ``November revolution'' in
1974, Mel Schwartz of Columbia University heard rumors that Samuel
Ting of MIT had discovered a remarkable new subatomic particle.
Schwartz confronted him _ they were then working in the same
laboratory _ but Ting flatly denied the rumor. Still suspicious,
Schwartz offered to bet $10 that Ting had found the particle. Ting
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Ting immediately wrote in his lab notebook: ``I owe Mel Schwartz
$10.'' Ting said he had been put in an ``impossible position,''
since he wanted to check various possible errors before making an
announcement. He paid up just two months later, going public after
learning that another group led by Burton Richter of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center had also seen the particle. Ting,
Richter, and Schwartz all eventually won Nobel Prizes. ``What I
keep kicking myself about is that I didn't make it $200,'' said
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the reasons scientists make bets, however, by far the
most compelling seems to be the urge to make a point in a way that
is not soon forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after Maurice Goldhaber, now 87 and still active
in research at Brookhaven National Laboratory, on Long Island,
arrived at a party in 1954, he got into an argument with his host
over the existence of the antiproton. The particle had been
predicted by the great theorist Paul Dirac, an authority few
physicists were prepared to contradict. ``I said, `I don't believe
it until it is proven,' '' said Goldhaber. After all, he pointed
out, there was the inconvenient detail that the universe around us
is made of matter, not antimatter.
</P>
<P>
   The host _ a brilliant if rough-cut theorist named Hartland
Snyder _ suddenly reached out and grabbed his hand, recalled
Goldhaber. ``He said, `I bet you $500 that the antiproton exists.'
Without thinking I said, `OK' '' Even though Goldhaber's brother
Gerson was scrambling to detect antiprotons at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory and sober reflection told Goldhaber that his odds of
winning the bet were not good, he did not consider backing down.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, a few months before Gerson Goldhaber's results
were ready, another team at Berkeley detected antiprotons, winning
a Nobel Prize for the discovery in 1959. But the widely discussed
bet had its own modest influence on the history of science, said
Gosta Ekspong, who was a member of Gerson Goldhaber's team and is
now retired from Stockholm University. ``People were reported to
say that they believed in the existence of the antiproton,'' said
Ekspong, ``because Maurice Goldhaber paid off.''

SAN ANTONIO: his upbringing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When I hear people criticize and attack him, I realize nobody
likes this (investigation),'' she said. ``I don't think Kenneth
likes this. I'm sure he'd rather be out teaching at Pepperdine
(University Law School). But he was hired to do a job, and I don't
see one ounce of vindictiveness. But we know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr lived in a small frame house in what was the rural
outskirts of town. His father, Bill, was minister for a tiny Church
of Christ on Sundays but barbered for a living and passed on his
trade to Ken and his brother. Ken Starr cut a few classmates' hair.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Starr never cursed or drank, friends say. His
high school adviser, English teacher Roberta Mahan, said Starr was
a photographer for the yearbook and newspaper who would
good-naturedly inform a classmate that swearing wasn't necessary
when something suddenly went wrong in the darkroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight-laced but with a good sense of humor, non-athletic
but straight A's,'' recalled Mahan, 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very clean-cut _ wore Levis and conservative slacks
like most of us,'' Villareal recalled. ``A few dressed as hoods
with pegged pants, built-up shoes with low heels, slicked-back hair
and ducktails, and drove souped-up cars.''
</P>
<P>
   But class bullies never targeted Starr, even though he dressed
as an elf for a yearbook Coke ad and played a character called
``Margaret'' in a talent show skit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken was pretty much appreciated for his leadership abilities,
and no one picked on him,'' Villareal said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was born July 21, 1946, in a Vernon hospital and spent his
early years in Thalia _ the name of the town in ``The Last Picture
Show,'' although the novel was actually based on Archer City,
author Larry McMurtry's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   He was the youngest of three children. His sister, Billie Jean,
a retired Houston schoolteacher, is 16 years older; his brother,
Jerry, an Abilene college instructor, is six years older.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father was one of those hellfire-and-damnation preachers,
that's exactly what he was,'' said Wanda Cates, 74, of Thalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother Starr had a cow and had turned her loose one day, then
went after her to milk it,'' Cates recalled. ``He passed my friend
_ a tall, slim lady _ who was on her property, wearing shorts and
milking her own cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next Sunday he gave a sermon that a good Christian women
shouldn't wear shorts. He didn't identify anybody, but my friend's
reaction was indignation and embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend confirmed the story but said she'd be even more
chagrined to be publicly named, although half a century had passed
since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr's former classmates in San Antonio are not pleased by
all aspects of the independent counsel's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, John Villareal is staggered by the millions of
dollars spent on the drawn-out Whitewater investigation and, later,
the inquiry into the president's relations with White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to take,'' he said. ``Money in those circles is a
drop in the bucket. But for us in the Valley, that's a large sum
that could do wonders. Thirty million could cover scholarships for
20 years, endow 10 faculty professorships or build a new science
building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us in South Texas believe it's pretty much the
president's business as long as it doesn't affect the country,''
Villareal said of the Lewinsky affair. ``Again, lying under oath is
serious. So Clinton might be getting what he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that Ken is just doing what he's charged to do.
I don't think he's hellbent to get the president. I don't remember
Ken Starr having any animosity toward anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith agreed. ``If it was his own party, the investigation would
have been the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken has convictions, principles, and has stayed loyal to them.
This quest for truth is nothing new. It's him.''

MORE DEVICES FOR PETS` BAD HABITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - A slew of other electronic devices is available to
curb a variety of pet problems.
</P>
<P>
   - Bark control collars: When your dog barks, a warning beep
sounds. If your dog continues to bark, a mild static shock is
emitted. The collar senses vibrations in your dog's throat that
happen only during barking. Costs around $50.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are bark collars that use high-frequency sound
pulses rather than shock corrections. Cost around $40.
</P>
<P>
   Citronella bark-control collars are now available. Citronella is
a plant with aromatic oils used to repel insects. Dogs don't like
this lemony scent, so each time your dog barks, a brisk yet
harmless citronella spray is released. Costs around $130.
</P>
<P>
   - Outdoor containment systems: These vary, depending on the size
of your dog (or cat) and the amount of area that needs coverage.
Basically, there's a transmitter that plugs into a standard
electrical outlet and emits radio signals that travel along an
underground wire. A receiver on your pet's collar picks up the
radio signals and alerts him as he nears the underground boundary.
If he crosses the boundary he receives a mild correction similar to
a static shock.
</P>
<P>
   A containment system sold by Radio Fence operates on the
citronella spray principle rather than shock. Costs range between
$150 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   - Indoor containment systems: Place a small, disk-shaped
transmitter near the area you want to protect. Then adjust the
range from 2 to 20 feet. Your cat or dog wears a receiver collar.
If he gets too close to the forbidden area, a warning beep sounds.
If he continues to approach, a mild correction is given. If you
have multiple pets, only the one you want to keep from a given area
wears the collar. Designed to keep pets away from plants, furniture
and even other pets. Costs around $80; a citronella version costs
about $170.
</P>
<P>
   - Mats: These give off a mild correction when dogs or cats touch
them. Normally, mats are placed on rugs or on furniture that pets
are slowly ruining. Also a good deterrent to cats who spend far too
much time under the bird cage. Cost about $57.
</P>
<P>
   - Hand-held trainers: These are small, hand-held audio devices
designed for correcting the misbehavior of dogs and cats. There are
usually two buttons: One gives of a positive tone for reward and an
ultrasonic tone for correction. These devices have been used by
mail carriers and meter readers to deter unwanted advances from
neighborhood dogs. Cost about $30.
</P>
<P>
   - Pest deterrents: Speakers broadcast high-decibel ultrasonic
sounds to discourage rabbits, birds, rodents or the neighbor's cat.
Cost about $60.
</P>
<P>
   - Electronic flea comb: The manufacturer claims that 97 percent
of fleas are killed within 24 hours of combing your dog with this
New Age grooming device. Costs about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Where to find these products:
</P>
<P>
   - Radio Fence in Punta Gorda, Fla., is a large supplier of
remote-training devices. Call up its Web page at www.radiofence.com
or phone 800-941-4200.

AS UNIFORM TREND SPREADS, SCHOOLS OUTGROW KILTS AND KHAKIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Wisconsin, New York)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After nearly 10 years of wearing a plaid kilt,
long-sleeve white Oxford shirt and navy blue blazer, you would
think that 16-year-old Andrea Ogden would have had just about
enough of her uniform at the private Doane Stuart School in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   But Ogden has seen the uniform change through those years,
giving her more options, like the choice of wearing a polo shirt, a
sweat shirt embossed with the school's logo, even khaki shorts on
hot days. The blazer and blackwatch-plaid kilt are reserved for
formal occasions, like ``chapels,'' or memorial services, at Doane
Stuart, set in a serene Romanesque building of dark wood and leaded
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more freedom in the uniform,'' said Ogden, a senior.
``When I was in third grade, girls were not allowed to wear khaki
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   True, private schools tinker with uniforms, and more public,
particularly city schools, are adopting uniform policies to lessen
peer pressure about fashion and to instill a serious, disciplined
atmosphere, administrators hope. That trend is opening up a whole
new market for designers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But today's array of decidedly casual khaki, navy and white
represent only a subtle evolution from the stiff, plaid jumpers and
starched white shirts that baby boomers wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can go back to those scratchy uniforms to what we see
today, there is a major change. I think safe, is the perfect
word,'' said Joanne Arbuckle, a children's wear expert and
assistant professor at Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
Last spring, she led a charge of 24 young, fresh-minded FIT
students who wanted to test the parameters of the school uniform by
designing its future look.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Think faux-fur trimmed coats and anorak jackets in
bright orange Ultrasuede, the fabric invented by Halston; think
striped bike shorts for girls and iridescent blue vinyl pants for
boys. Think, too, washable, colorful and about as far away from
preppy as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden takes one look at these designs and immediately comments,
``I would love it. I think they're great. It's not the same old,
same old uniform,'' a remark she qualifies by saying that such
dramatic looks lessen the chance of their broad acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' uniform, consisting of khaki pants, polos, oxfords,
and blue sweaters or blazer, is fine for Jake Erwin, a 14-year-old
Doane Stuart ninth-grader, if a bit hot during chapel services.
Plainer styles may be a better sell, but, ``then again, it would
probably be impossible to wear a uniform everyone would like.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbuckle and her students note that these slightly over-the-top
designs and fabrics were intended to be futuristic, and for the
runway, not the current market. The students, completing a two-year
degree with a specialty in children's clothing, unveiled their
designs in May at a runway show and related museum exhibit this
summer. Those garments will be shown again at upcoming trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the message inherent in these daring clothes asks people
to consider the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically opening peoples' eyes, that uniforms don't have
to look like uniforms,'' said Joellyn R. Marshall, 24, whose
designs and academic work won the critic's award. Marshall,
coincidentally,is now a design apprentice in children's sleepwear
at Lands' End, a Dodgeville, Wis., catalog clothing company that
last year introduced a school uniform catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Arbuckle did not conceive of FIT's uniform study in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, public schools are turning to the uniform as a way
to enhance school image, curtail peer pressure, instill discipline,
and, in some cases, bolster safety in neighborhoods with gangs who
identify themselves by certain colors.
</P>
<P>
   A February survey of 958 public elementary and middle schools
found that about one-quarter were either considering or had already
begun a school uniform policy, according to the National
Association of Elementary School Principals. The poll was supported
by Lands' End.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in his 1996 State of the Union and subsequent
speeches, has endorsed the concept as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End last year began a school uniform catalog at the
request of customers, said Christine Hess, the catalog's manager.
</P>
<P>
   The company could easily adapt its regular children's line to
uniform designs, said Hess, who gave the example of transforming
cotton chino pants to a cotton/polyester blend for durability.
</P>
<P>
   Full of crew neck sweaters in navy or evergreen, mesh polos and
twill ``skorts,'' a combination of skirt and shorts, the catalog is
dictated by customer requests, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this stress on the comfort and casualness of uniforms
leads to a question about their look: should they be fashionable?
After all, schools are adopting uniforms in part, because they hope
to lessen competition.
</P>
<P>
   But Arbuckle, the FIT professor, believes designers will have to
create uniforms with more fashion sense as more schools adopt
policies and students weigh in on those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you have the school board and administrators who want to
cut down on the competition and want more discipline. What we were
trying to say is, you can have the discipline, you certainly can
cut down on the competition, but the kids can be happy, too.''

THE FOLKS WHO PUT BUSH INTO ORBIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush, a possible
contender for the White House in 2000, is riding about as high as
you can get in politics. Here are some of the people who have
helped put him there:
</P>
<P>
   KARL ROVE (The Guru) _ Rove, 47, is Bush's political director,
top strategist, gatekeeper, fund-raiser and adviser. He worked for
Bush's father in the early 1970s when the future president was
chairman of the Republican National Committee; informally helped
George W. in an unsuccessful 1978 bid for Congress; and was an aide
to Gov. Bill Clements. His firm, Karl Rove &AMP; Co., has served
clients in at least 24 states and one foreign country (socialist
Sweden!). Rove teaches a university class but never graduated.
How's he do that? ``Because I'm good at what I do,'' Rove once
said.
</P>
<P>
   JOE ALLBAUGH (The Enforcer) _ Allbaugh (6-foot-4, 20-inch neck,
crew cut) looks more like a football coach than chief of staff.
He's the guy who keeps the trains running on time. An Okie,
Allbaugh, 47, was deputy secretary of transportation in Oklahoma
and top aide to former Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon.
</P>
<P>
   KAREN HUGHES (The Spokeswoman, also known as Surgeon General of
Spin) _ Much more than a mouthpiece, Hughes, 41, is part of Bush's
inner sanctum of advisers. A former reporter for Dallas-Fort Worth
television station KXAS/Channel 5, Hughes has been known to cut
Bush off at his own news conferences to ensure proper spin. Even
Democrats express grudging admiration for her work, including her
relentless _ and effective _ criticism of Gov. Ann Richards when
Hughes was executive director of the Texas Republican Party
(1992-94).
</P>
<P>
   DON EVANS (The Best Friend) _ Bush and Evans, 52, (''Evvie'' in
Bushspeak) go way back _ to the early days in Midland, Bush's
hometown. Evans is president and chairman of the board of Tom Brown
Inc., a Midland oil firm. He served as campaign manager for Bush's
unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978; he later tapped Bush to
serve on the Tom Brown board. As governor, Bush appointed his
friend to the University of Texas Board of Regents; he remains a
close adviser.
</P>
<P>
   HARRIET MIERS (The Lawyer) _ Miers, 53, was once described by
Bush as a ``pit bull in size 6 shoes.'' The first female president
of a large Texas law firm (Locke Purnell of Dallas), Miers was
selected this year as one of the 50 most influential lawyers in
America by the National Law Journal. She's Bush's personal attorney
and was selected by the governor to be chairwoman of the Texas
Lottery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT HAWKINS (The Numbers Guy) _ A graduate of Fort Worth's
Paschal High School, Hawkins, 45, is director of the governor's
budget office and former assistant director of the Legislative
Budget Board. He's also the top-ranking African-American on Bush's
staff. When Bush needs advice on budget matters, his refrain is,
``Get Albert's opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   VANCE MCMAHAN (The Policy Guy) _ McMahan, 36, oversees policy
and policy research for the governor. He did the same thing for
gubernatorial candidate Bush in 1994. Before hooking up with Bush,
McMahan practiced law in Houston with the firm of Andrews and
Kurth.

NO SIGNS OF THAW IN FAGAN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The handwritten letters, composed in the ``very
touching'' tone of a forgotten friend, have gone unanswered. So,
too, have pleas by Barbara Kurth for a reunion with her two grown
daughters, whom she last saw before their father allegedly
kidnapped them in October 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides in the Stephen Fagan kidnapping case remain as far
apart as they were last April, when Fagan was arrested. With the
matter scheduled for a pretrial hearing in Middlesex Superior Court
Tuesday, sources on both sides report the criminal case is still
forging ahead. No plea agreement is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Continuation of the standoff at this point seems to portend a
highly publicized, contentious trial late this year or in early
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting it to proceed,'' said Peter Kurth, the brother
of Barbara Kurth, ``and we're expecting it to be very dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan was arrested April 16 in Palm Beach, Fla., at one of
several homes in which he has lived since his departure from
Massachusetts nearly two decades ago. Before his arrest, he was
known by his alias, Dr. William Martin.
</P>
<P>
   His daughters, raised as Rachel and Lisa Martin, were living in
New York and California at the time of their father's arrest. The
family reconvened in Massachusetts for Fagan's arraignment on April
21, and during a chaotic week of interviews and meetings, the
daughters stood firmly behind Fagan's contention that he was a
loving parent who spirited them away at ages 2 and 5 to protect
them from their mother, whom he characterized as a neglectful
alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a public appeal from Barbara Kurth, in which she said
she had ``always loved them,'' the daughters said they would not
speak to their mother until the case against their father was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months later, neither daughter appears to have
budged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara has written the girls a couple of times, my mother has
written them; (the letters) were all registered and signed for,''
Peter Kurth said. ``But they certainly haven't replied.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Atwood, an attorney for Barbara Kurth, described the
correspondence as ``very touching, candid letters that always end
up saying, `I love you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the girls believe that their father will go to jail if
they have any contact with her,'' Atwood said. ``That's what they
said, at least initially.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood described their iciness as ``a little bit of bait,'' a
tactic designed to lure their mother into requesting a plea
agreement. But Atwood said that a plea bargain is ultimately the
decision of Middlesex prosecutors, not his client.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Egbert, the attorney for Fagan, confirmed that no plea
agreement has been reached with prosecutors in District Attorney
Thomas F. Reilly's office. But he refused to say whether any
letters had been sent to his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barbara is discussing things, that's her business,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Egbert also said that Fagan is not planning to attend this
week's court hearing, at which the trial date may be set.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO MONTT, Chile _ The clear, burbling waters of Chinchihuapi
Creek flow out of misty hills, past dark stumps of an ice-age
forest and through green pastures, where cattle graze and from time
to time a farmer still finds a huge mastodon tusk eroding out of
the peat. No one standing by the creek today would suspect that
this bucolic place, known as Monte Verde, was so recently the scene
of a pitched intellectual battle among archeologists over when
people first inhabited the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The scars of excavation have disappeared. Lush grass grows over
the filled-in trenches, where archeologists had found the amazingly
preserved wood, tied and knotted strings, hearths and even leftover
mastodon meat of an ancient hunter-gatherer camp. The cookhouse and
tent sites of the excavators are also gone without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scars of battle seem to have healed. Last year, after
two decades of acrimony, a blue-ribbon group of archeologists
reached a kind of peace treaty acknowledging the triumph of the
Monte Verde excavators. Their evidence had indeed established the
site as the earliest firmly dated place of human habitation in the
Americas. People had lived here 12,500 years ago, some 1,300 years
before the previously accepted date for earliest known Americans,
derived from stone spear points found in the 1930s near Clovis,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Monte Verde, east of this seaport in
southern Chile, Dr. Mario Pino, a geologist at the Southern
University of Chile in Valdivia, leaned into the north bank of the
creek and stabbed the dark soil with the pick end of a geology
hammer. He exposed more pieces of wood from the camp where
prehistoric humans once lived.
</P>
<P>
   But the wood held less interest to him than a green knoll
several hundred feet away, south of the creek. Pointing with the
hammer, Pino said that cursory excavations there had turned up
possible remains of human habitation at Monte Verde 20,000 years
earlier than the camp north of the creek. Should this prove true,
it would revolutionize research into one of the most intractable
mysteries in American archeology: Just when were the Americas first
truly a New World, and how did people get here?
</P>
<P>
   Pino and Dr. Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky in
Lexington, the archeologist who has directed the Monte Verde
explorations, are planning more extensive and systematic
excavations of the knoll site in January 2001. Their strategy will
be to strip away six feet of topsoil with a bulldozer, then begin
fine-tooth digging in the lower layers where evidence of human
activity has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about the age _ it's 33,000 years old,'' Pino
said of the sediment layers bearing the apparent artifacts under
the knoll.
</P>
<P>
   The date, which would put the occupation during a warm interlude
in the ice ages, is based on radiocarbon examination of burned wood
that scientists suspect came from hearths at the hunting camp.
Archeologists found the charcoal in three shallow depressions lined
with scorched clay. Other hints of human occupation include 24
fractured pebbles, several of which were probably flaked by people
using them to cut and scrape meat, hides and plants.
</P>
<P>
   When independent archeologists visited Monte Verde last year and
authenticated the younger camp site, Pino said, they also examined
the material from the deeper, 33,000-year-old layer. ``They said
there is no doubt these are real human artifacts,'' he said. ``We
were surprised. We expected another fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillehay is somewhat more circumspect. In an interview by
telephone, he said: ``We'll open up that level and see what's
there. If the results remain ambiguous, we will have done the best
we could. But I'm leaning toward accepting the antiquity of the
level and the traces of human activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Meltzer, an archeologist at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas, who was a member of the review committee that
endorsed the younger site, welcomes the new excavations. The older
layer is ``really intriguing,'' he said, ``but we can't conclude
anything about it until we have a better sense of what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, Meltzer said, are excavations over a much larger
area to increase the chances of finding many more artifacts and
samples for radiocarbon analysis. If these support the date and the
presence of humans at the site, he predicted that other
archeologists would not be as slow to accept the findings as they
had been with the first Monte Verde site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it depends on what they find,'' he said, ``but this
time archeologists wouldn't be as resistant because now they are
not operating within the framework of Clovis history.''

<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1930s discovery of distinctive spear points of the
so-called Clovis hunters, nearly all archeologists staunchly held
the view that the first Americans were big-game hunters who crossed
the ice-covered Bering Straits between Siberia and Alaska some
12,000 to 13,000 years ago _ that is, not long before the
11,200-year-old dates of the earliest Clovis weapons. Prior to the
Monte Verde breakthrough, several other presumed pre-Clovis sites
had been reported, but none has yet met all the requirements to be
judged an authentic human site dating earlier than the Clovis
people.
</P>
<P>
   Once archeologists accepted the 12,500-year date for the younger
Monte Verde camp, they were forced to rethink how long people had
already been in the Americas for them to have made it all the way
from North America to southern Chile, 500 miles south of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists are also puzzled by the absence so far of any
confirmed human sites in North America that predate Monte Verde.
The numbers of migrating human bands must have been so small, and
their movements so nomadic, that they left no impression on the
land _ they were ``archeologically invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   No scholars seriously consider the possibility that the early
Americans landed first in South America. All linguistic, genetic
and other evidence points to the Bering Strait as the most likely
point of entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we realize we don't really know when the human entry
time was,'' Meltzer said. And Dillehay said he did not even want to
speculate on the implications for early American migrations if he
should establish that people were at Monte Verde as early as 33,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If it had not been for a quirk of nature, Pino pointed out,
archeologists would probably never have known that some
hunting-and-gathering people occupied the banks of the Chinchihuapi
at least 12,500 years ago. The land covering the site is a
water-saturated peat bog, which isolated the wooden poles and
tent-pegs, animal hides and other perishables of the old camp from
oxygen and thus decay. Otherwise such materials rarely survive the
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The attention of archeologists was first drawn to Monte Verde by
the chance discovery of some mastodon bones. The owners of the
land, Juan Barria and his son, Sergio, led Pino across the squishy
bog to a backyard shed to show him their latest find. It was a
piece of mastodon tusk, which would have been 6 feet to 10 feet
long and 6 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This animal would have weighed two tons,'' Pino said, rubbing
the tusk. ``Enough food for two or three months for a prehistoric
family living at Monte Verde.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's current political and economic mayhem means
the twilight for Boris Yeltsin, political analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The political obituary of the tenacious Yeltsin, 67, has been
written and erased before. But perhaps never has Yeltsin done so
much to compose it himself as he has in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   His abrupt firing of the government Sunday was widely viewed
here as capitulation to forces increasingly beyond the aging
president's control: Russia's powerful tycoons, a still untamed
post-Soviet economy and a troublesome opposition parliament led by
the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   In uncharacteristic form, Yeltsin stooped Monday to acknowledge
the presidential mettle of another Russian.
</P>
<P>
   In televised remarks, Yeltsin stated that acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin may be the best candidate to succeed him when
Yeltsin's presidential term expires in 2000. He also promised to
give Chernomyrdin extraordinary autonomy to run the government.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Yeltsin forewarned not only the end of his
presidency, but the democratic vision he embodied seven years ago
as the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Yeltsin bowing out. And it's the end of any meaningful
attempt in this country for reform in the near future. It's sad
really. It's a surrender,'' said Al Breach of the Russian-European
Center for Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   As Chernomyrdin, 60, an uncharismatic moderate, sets out to form
a new government amid economic chaos, there are signs that Yeltsin
has agreed to give up considerable powers to him and other Russian
political factions.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist speaker of the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, said political parties had agreed with Chernomyrdin to
devise plans for a new government formed on an unprecedented
``coalition basis'' -- possibly giving some senior posts to the
Communists and allowing them a hand in setting the economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Chernomyrdin is considered the favorite of a small
band of influential tycoons who control much of Russia's industry,
banking and media -- financial interests who have opposed economic
reforms in the past and are now threatened by the country's
deepening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's selection of Chernomyrdin, whom he fired five months
ago, appears to be in accord with these business magnates who
helped re-elect the president during a tough campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``oligarchy,'' they have lobbied in recent weeks
for the return of Chernomyrdin in the hopes that he will use state
money to prop up their faltering banks, many of which are on the
verge of failure and owe billions of dollars to Western lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these oligarchs, the pain of true reform was like a death
sentence for their banks and investment houses. So, they made a
deal,'' said political analyst Sergei Kolmakov.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent economic reformers close to Yeltsin, Anatoly
Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, apparently will not be part of the new
government. They were favorites of Western officials and
personified the economic thinking believed necessary to deliver a
free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov, a deputy prime minister, announced his resignation on
Monday and offered a bitter assessment on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all too difficult to carry out any reforms . . . in the
conditions of such an ugly market, where competition is
non-existent, monopolies are rampant, where rules are few,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yeltsin went on national television in
video-taped remarks to explain his latest government overhaul,
replacing young reformer Sergei Kiriyenko after only five months on
the job. And why he was reappointing Chernomyrdin, whom he faulted
in March for failing to seek needed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said Chernomyrdin possess ``decency, honesty, and
thoroughness,'' adding: ``I think these qualities will be the
decisive argument in the presidential elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments provoked widespread speculation in Moscow that
Yeltsin may resign before the end of his term, though Yeltsin has
confounded such predictions many times in the past. ``Early
elections are necessary ... If Chernomyrdin wins the approval of
the Duma, he becomes the real master of the state and Yeltsin
becomes more of a figurehead in the background,'' said Kolmakov.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, Chernomyrdin would become acting
president if Yeltsin resigned or could not serve for health
reasons, and an election would be held in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of a coalition government, the Communist Party
appeared ready to exploit the turmoil. It called on Yeltsin to
recall Chernomyrdin's nomination. The Duma announced it would not
convene to consider the government overhaul until next week at the
earliest, just as President Bill Clinton is scheduled to arrive for
a summit with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Yeltsin remains in power, no reshuffling will lead
the country out of crisis,'' said Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist
Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin earned his global reputation as the champion of
democracy, who jumped atop the tanks during the communist
hardliners' unsuccessful coup attempt in August 1991 and hastened
the demise of the Soviet Union later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Heart problems, a thirst for vodka and Kremlin intrigues have
taken their toll. He appeared stilted in his brief video-taped
appearance Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   It has been an embarrassing month. Russia's financial markets
continued to tumble even as Yeltsin pursued his summer vacation in
isolation in the country's far north.
</P>
<P>
   Dismally low in opinion polls for the past year, Yeltsin emerged
last week when the financial crisis forced him to abandon his
leading achievement since his reelection in 1996: low inflation and
a stable ruble.
</P>
<P>
   On August 17, the government allowed the national currency to
drift on markets as high as 9.5 to the dollar -- in effect, a
34-percent devaluation. The new policy was a dramatic shift for the
government, which determined it could no longer afford to spend
billions of dollars of its hard-currency reserves to prop up the
ruble and place Russia deeper in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, parliament began impeachment proceedings against
Yeltsin, which Zyuganov said Monday would continue. He said the
Duma would agree to approve Chernomyrdin only if he promised
radical changes in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   So, Yeltsin may have indicated Monday that he is prepared to
throw in the towel, but the fight is still raging. Unfortunately,
for one of the remarkable figures of this century, there are few
Russians left in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If another coup attempt happened now, I don't think people
would go into the street to defend Boris Nikolaiovitch (Yeltsin),''
said Yevgeny Bogdonov, a newspaper editor in the city of Kemerovo.
``Not here.''

 &HT;    RUSSIANS FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS AMID CRISIS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0825.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES AND JULIA SHARGORODSKA 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Rioters have not stormed the Kremlin in outrage over
the sliding value of the ruble, the slow and steady rise of
consumer prices or the latest bewildering shake-up of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   There are not tanks in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for most Russians life goes grimly on in Moscow and
elsewhere with little evidence of the shock from last week's
devaluation of the ruble and Sunday's firing of the government.
</P>
<P>
   All too familiar with economic troubles and political turnovers
since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, many Russians are
care-worn but ultimately resigned to a life of flirting with
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm worried. You can never relax very long in our
country. There is no stability,'' said Dennis Golubkov, 28, manager
of a music shop in Moscow. ``But what can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians are insulated from the economic crisis by their
own poverty. The average Russian salary is only about $200 a month
and there is virtually no credit -- no home mortgages, car loans,
few credit cards. A recent government estimate said 77 percent of
the 147 million living in Russia have no savings.
</P>
<P>
   They also are dubious that Sunday's government overhaul
reappointing Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister will improve
their lives, coming as it did from Boris Yeltsin, a president they
stopped trusting long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest sentiment on the street is suspicion of
politicians and their promises. For months amid the financial
turmoil, millions of workers have gone without their full pay. At
the beginning of this month, Russian workers alone, were owed $11
billion in back-wages and pension monies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general opinion is, 'It's all the same for us who is in
power. But what really matters is whether they pay our salaries or
not,''' said Vladimir Oshchenko, deputy editor of the major daily
in Vladivostok, in Russia's far east.
</P>
<P>
   Polls shows that Russians, who have a short history of
democracy, feel little connection to their government and no power
to compel it to change. Cynicism is the leading ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, if you knock, something will be done. Here, you
knock but there is no response. During the Soviet period, no matter
how badly we lived, the government took care of us in the sense
that, for example, prices were stable. Now we have to fend for
ourselves,'' said Viktor Kapranov, a 67-year-old metal worker in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The worst could still come, as the now ex-Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko warned in a candid speech to parliament on Friday. Banks
are expected to fail. Consumer prices could soar. The ruble, which
has devalued slightly on the currency markets, could yet crash.
</P>
<P>
   Aman Tuleyev, governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region in
southern Russia, warned that the mix of social, economic and
political instability could lead to a ``social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has given Chernomyrdin the task to assemble a new
government and study the issues at a time when Russia should be
coping with its deep financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the one thing the new government has going for it is the
profound apathy in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In Vorkuta, in Russia's far north, Roman Yuniter, editor with
the newspaper ``Zapolyuriya,'' said two issues are on the minds of
people in the region: ``We only want to get our pay on time, and we
pray that it does not start snowing in August.''

RESEARCHERS UNRAVEL THE MOTIVES OF STALKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(See also: SCI-STALKING COPE) 
(lh) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stalkers are wreaking havoc in the lives of millions of
Americans. Every year, a recent national study by the Justice
Department disclosed, an estimated 1 million women and 400,000 men
are plagued by unrelenting pursuers who harass, terrorize and even
kill the victims or anyone else deemed to be in the way of a
stalker's desired goal.
</P>
<P>
   One in 20 women in the United States will be stalked at some
point in her life, various studies have suggested. In a survey last
year among college students in West Virginia, 34 percent of the
women and 17 percent of the men said they had been stalked. The
ability of stalkers to find and harass their victims has been aided
in recent years by computers, e-mail and the Internet, which has
spawned a new psychiatric legal term: cyberstalking.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the stalking problem and its potential for growth
through cyberstalking has astonished even the most astute
researchers in the field and prompted a strident call for stronger
laws and stricter enforcement of existing statutes to better
protect the victims of stalkers, even when there is no direct
threat to their physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalkers simply do not fade away,'' said Rhonda Saunders, who
heads the Stalking and Threat Assessment Team in the Los Angeles
Police Department. She insists that stronger state laws would
``enable law enforcement to intervene before serious bodily injury
is inflicted on the victim or those surrounding the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only 2 percent of stalkers commit homicide, half of
them threaten their victims with violence or say they are going to
damage property or injure pets, according to studies. Even when no
physical harm results, the repeated harassment by stalkers commonly
results in acute emotional distress and can seriously disrupt the
way victims live. Some lose their jobs when stalkers plague them at
work, and some are forced to move and change their identity and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul E. Mullen, professor of psychiatry at Monash University
in Australia, who runs a clinic that treats both stalkers and their
victims, said that 70 percent of the victims suffered from a form
of post-traumatic stress disorder, marked by chronic anxiety,
depression and sleep disturbances. Nearly one in four victims has
considered suicide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only about half the stalking victims ever report their
problem to the police, studies indicate. Even when they do, the
police may not take action until and unless the victim is
physically injured or threatened with a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``The Graduate,'' in which the stalking man
eventually wins the resistant woman, ``Fatal Attraction,'' in which
an unhinged woman stalks her married one-night stand, and dramatic
cases like John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt to woo actress Jodie Foster
by shooting President Ronald Reagan, have created many mistaken
impressions about stalkers, their motives, their usual victims and
how successful they are. In most cases, a man who stalks a former
lover succeeds only in torturing his victim, not in winning her
back.
</P>
<P>
   The first scholarly book on the subject, ``The Psychology of
Stalking: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives,'' edited by Dr. J.
Reid Meloy and published this summer by Academic Press, discloses
that in addition to former boyfriends and husbands, stalkers
include casual acquaintances, disgruntled employees and business
associates, vengeful neighbors and total strangers, as well as
former girlfriends and wives.
</P>
<P>
   The studies described in the book, the first in-depth look at
the psychology of stalkers, found that the underlying problems of
stalkers run the gamut of psychiatric and personality disorders.
</P>
<P>
   And virtually anyone can become a victim. Although celebrities
who are stalked by crazed strangers _ like Madonna and David
Letterman _ are most likely to make the news, the vast majority of
victims are ordinary people who knew their stalkers, usually as
lovers or spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Stalking after the break-up of a physically abusive relationship
has received considerable public attention in recent years, but
experts on the subject report that women are more commonly stalked
by men they once dated or married who were not abusive before the
relationship ended.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Doris M. Hall, a specialist in criminal justice at
California State University at Bakersfield, tells of a California
woman who was stalked by her former husband for 31 years. Though
the woman had a hard time persuading the police to take the matter
seriously, her stalker was finally arrested after being found on
her block with a loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes stalkers seem to pick their victims at random,
prompted, perhaps, by the end of a relationship with someone else,
by some real or imagined slight or, out of paranoia, for a reason
that has no apparent connection to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kristine K. Kienlen, a psychologist in St. Peter, Minn., who
evaluates criminals and patients who are mentally ill and
dangerous, tells of a 31-year-old man who, after his divorce, began
stalking a young teen-age girl he knew. At first he merely attended
her athletic events and wrote of his desire to date her. But after
four years of failing to achieve his goal, he began breaking into
her home and stealing items from her bedroom, including her photo
album, the contents of which he returned to her one picture at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Another Minnesota woman said she has been tormented for nearly
two years by a man she had dismissed from his job for repeatedly
calling her and another woman employee at home and at work,
accusing them of ``wanting his body and stealing from his home.''
</P>
<P>
   When the man began showing up at his former boss' home with a
shotgun, she got a restraining order and a gun of her own. But he
has yet to be imprisoned. And only after she dismissed him did the
woman learn that the ``glowing recommendation'' he had received
from a previous employer had failed to mention that he was
dismissed from that job as well for stalking two women at work.
</P>
<P>
   What prompts someone to stalk need not be as traumatic as a lost
love or job. A retired couple reported being stalked by a business
acquaintance after a minor disagreement. And a woman in her 70s was
stalked by a woman of similar age for reasons she could never
discern.
</P>
<P>
   Men are victims as well. One young man sought a restraining
order to end the unrelenting pursuit by his former girlfriend. The
judge, who told the man he should be ``flattered by all the
attention,'' nevertheless issued mutual restraining orders, which
proved useless to the man. He was killed by the woman several weeks
later.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hall said that typically, when a woman stalks a man and the
man seeks police protection, the authorities did not take him
seriously. In her study of 16 men who were stalking victims, 44
percent were stalked by other men. She said that when a woman
stalks after the break-up of a relationship with a man, she will
often go after the man's new girlfriend, ``probably because women
scare more easily than men do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though stalking is centuries old, it is a relatively new crime,
first rendered illegal in this country by a 1990 California statute
and subsequently by laws in every state and the District of
Columbia. The legal definitions and the arrests they precipitated
opened the way to scientific exploration of the phenomenon, and now
in the newly published ``Psychology of Stalking,'' 23 experts have
summarized what they have learned to date about this noxious
behavior, its underlying psychopathology and motives and the often
devastating effects it has on its victims.
</P>
<P>
   About one fact all the researchers agree. ``There is no single
profile of a stalker,'' said Dr. Kienlen, a contributor to the
book. ``Stalkers exhibit a broad range of behaviors, motivations
and psychological traits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stalkers have psychiatric illnesses, ranging from
depression and schizophrenia to erotomania _ a delusional belief
that the person is loved by another _ and most appear to have a
personality disorder like extreme narcissism or dependency or an
inability to sustain close relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalkers tend to have both _ a mental illness and a
personality disorder,'' Meloy, a psychiatrist affiliated with the
University of California at San Diego, said in an interview. ``And
those who stalk strangers are more likely to be psychotic than
those who stalk prior sexual intimates. The latter are more likely
to be drug or alcohol abusers with a dependency personality
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kienlen conducted the first preliminary study of the
backgrounds and psychological profiles of stalkers. More than half
of the 24 male stalkers she interviewed had evidence of what
psychologists call an attachment disorder stemming from the
childhood loss or absence of a caring and consistent parent or
guardian, usually in the first six years of life.
</P>
<P>
   Although attachment disorder has its critics, Dr. Kienlen and
other experts in stalking believe it may be a ``predisposing
factor'' for stalking behavior by making it difficult for the
person to establish and maintain healthy relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their parents may have divorced and the custodial parent had
little contact with the child,'' she said. ``The parents may have
had a drug or alcohol problem; the child may have been physically,
sexually or emotionally abused or even totally abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kienlen said she had encountered three kinds of attachment
disorders among stalkers. In one, which she calls ``preoccupied,''
the stalker has a poor self-image but a positive view of others and
constantly seeks their approval and validation in order to feel
good about himself. When rejected by others, the person stalks to
restore his sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   In another type, called ``fearful,'' the person has a poor
self-image as well but also sees others as unreliable and
unsupportive. The stalker tends to get caught in a vicious cycle of
wanting someone to boost his own self-image, then rejecting the
person for not being trustworthy, which prompts the person to stalk
because he again needs someone to boost his sagging ego.
</P>
<P>
   In the third type of attachment disorder, called ``dismissing,''
the person thinks of other people as jerks and usually remains
distant from them to maintain an inflated self-image. The stalker
with dismissing attachment disorder who does form attachments
become angry when a breakup occurs and may stalk out of revenge, to
retaliate for being mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stalkers Dr. Kienlen interviewed also had extreme
personality disturbances. The most frequent one encountered in
stalkers was narcissistic personality disorder, which Dr. Kienlen
said gave stalkers an inflated sense of self-worth and an intense
need for other people to compliment and idolize them.
</P>
<P>
   Other personality disorders experts frequently encounter in
stalkers are extreme dependency, constantly needing the support,
attention and approval of other people; and borderline personality
disorder, having unstable moods and an exaggerated reaction to
rejection and abandonment. Only about 10 percent of stalkers have
an antisocial personality disorder, with an above-it-all detachment
from other people that is most often encountered in criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In 80 percent of the men Dr. Kienlen interviewed, there was also
a precipitating factor, such as a recent loss that seriously upset
them and seemed to have brought on their stalking behavior. The
losses ranged from the break-up of an intimate relationship, a lost
job and death of a parent to learning that they themselves had a
serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that in these vulnerable individuals, the losses
damaged their sense of self-worth,'' Dr. Kienlen said. ``To
alleviate their grief or feelings of emptiness, they compensated by
focusing on stalking. Sometimes the stalker blames the victim for
the loss and stalks out of anger.''

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; There's much to be said for getting into your
character. But Wesley Snipes may be taking this vampire thing a
little too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie represents a lifestyle,'' Snipes says of ``Blade,''
the living-dead style action movie he produced and starred in.
``This is a modern-day vampire film; very chic, very up-to-date
people in it. It's cross-cultural; cross-discipline! It's not just
an action film. It's a whole dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are like that,'' claims the 35-year-old actor, who
plays a leather-clad vampire slayer who has strains of Draculian
blood coursing through his own, eternal veins. ``We have that split
personality. We function very normally in the acceptable community
in the daylight, getting our jobs done. But at nightfall, it's a
whole different ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Snipes, who tends to divide his film jobs between comic
(``White Men Can't Jump,'' ``To Wong Foo ...''), dramatic (``New
Jack City,'' ``Jungle Fever'') and action roles (``Passenger 57,''
``Demolition Man''), has been known to liven up his work-loaded
life with extreme martial arts practices and the occasional
high-speed police chase.
</P>
<P>
   And he characteristically took an unusual approach to promoting
``Blade,'' which opened at the top of last weekend's box-office
chart with an estimated $17 million in ticket sales. To seek out
self-styled live-forevers _ or at least those who might enjoy the
fantasy _ he hosted a series of ``Blade''-themed techno-rave
parties in major cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were parties that acknowledged, `This is what you are',''
Snipes says. ``You're being let in on the new young thing. No more
yuppies, no more buppies, no more X generation; that's all dead and
gone. We're inviting you into an immortal nation, where your deeds
will make you immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   As we said, Wesley may be getting a bit too into this. But you
can't blame him. He's been immersed in ``Blade'' for more than a
year, both in front of and behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Marvel comic book hero, the film offered Snipes
ample opportunity to display his fighting prowess (an eclectic mix
of Asian, French, African and the dancelike Brazilian Capoeria
martial-arts styles) and strike cooler-than-you poses in
physique-enhancing, rubberized armor and wraparound shades (some of
which he wore to the interview).
</P>
<P>
   But Snipes was just as vigorously engaged in his producer
capacity. His primary, self-imposed duty on that front was to
ensure the film balanced the drama he loves with the action he
thrives on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, right off the bat, I liked that Blade was a
brother,'' says the Orlando-born, South Bronx-raised Snipes, who is
also nurturing long-held plans to play Marvel's African hero the
Black Panther in a movie. ``Second of all, he's not like one of
these other superheroes in that he doesn't have superhuman powers.
He's an enhanced human being, which afforded me the opportunity to
display my martial-arts abilities and keep it within a certain
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then there's the fact that he is, in some ways, a tragic
hero. He has inner demons he has to deal with if he's going to
fulfill his destiny, and I liked that. We needed to add elements to
the script, as good as it was, that humanized and dramatized some
of the inner turmoil, as opposed to just talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the problem with a lot of action movies is
that they have no story,'' adds Snipes, some of whose own action
attractions _ ``Drop Zone'' comes to mind _ have been accused of
that deficiency. ``If it's gonna be a straight-up entertainment
film, cool. You don't need it, you can do situation-comedy-type
things. But if you want to do something really substantive, let's
get the foundation first, where the arcs of the characters lie,
then we'll pepper the action around that in context.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes has been exerting his behind-the-scenes influence a lot
lately through his new production company, Amen Ra Films. The
spring caper comedy ``The Big Hit'' was the outfit's first release,
and ``Blade'' will be followed up with ``Future Sport,'' a
television action series made for ABC, and the feature film ``Down
in the Delta,'' directed by the acclaimed poet Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes makes small appearances in both upcoming projects. But
his main reason for setting up Amen Ra is to give a shot to talents
that may not otherwise get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to firmly, firmly establish that we have great
filmmakers in the African-American experience,'' he says. ``But
they're not just African-American filmmakers; they're American
filmmakers. They have stories and technical abilities rivaling all
of the others that are out there. We want to expose that, we want
to bring them into the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' is a perfect example. The tale of a
troubled city child who moves in with relatives in the rural South,
the movie is the multitalented Angelou's first attempt at feature
directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done everything else,'' Snipes says confidently. ``She
was a professional singer, professional dancer, of course a
professional writer, she's directed theater before. So it just
stands to figure: Why not give it a shot? We put enough people
around her to assist in the new venue, but we were never worried
about her failing. That's like thinking Paul Robeson is going to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing one immortal by invoking the name of another. Maybe,
like them, Wesley Snipes, or at least some of his work, will live
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going in the direction of, `Hey, we're not tying to be
outcasts. We're incasts','' he says, referring to vampires or
artists _ it's not certain. ``At the same time, we have this other
world that we exist in, and this is where we get our inspiration
and our rejuvenation to deal with that other world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we look good doing it.''

   High in the mountains of central Mexico, monarch butterflies
arrive by the millions each winter to take refuge, their black and
orange wings festooning stands of towering fir trees. But
conservationists have grown increasingly concerned about the
butterflies as these small patches of forest, some of which were
set aside as preserves, compete with the needs of the residents
around them.
</P>
<P>
   Now conservationists are trying to help the butterflies by
helping the residents. In July, 40,000 trees were planted near El
Rosario in the state of Michoacan (pronounced mee-cho-an-KAHN) in
an effort to save the fragile habitat where monarchs congregate
after their long flight south from the eastern United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than becoming new roosts for monarchs, the newly planted
trees are intended to be cut. The idea is to provide local farmers
with trees to grow for firewood, construction and selling, leaving
the monarch forests intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monarchs over wintering areas were really being hit
hard,'' said Robert Small, who runs the Michoacan Reforestation
Fund, a one-man fund-raising organization aimed at buying trees to
reforest the mountaintops of central Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The local subsistence farmers ``were poor and had to have wood
to live on, and they would sell whatever they could,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extreme poverty,'' he said. ``We're trying to give
them an economic alternative that they've never been offered
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Small, a retired public administrator who runs the fund from his
home in Oakland, Calif., raises money that is used by the La Cruz
Habitat Protection Project, the Mexico-based arm of this
conservation effort, to buy the trees. The project had a tentative
start last year with the planting of 7,000 trees, most of which
were killed by El Nino, according to Jose Luis Alvarez, the Mexican
nurseryman who has overseen the planting.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing frustration over the many previous failed attempts to
stop logging in the area, Dr. Lincoln Brower, a biologist at Sweet
Briar College in Virginia who is a monarch advocate, said: ``I've
grasped at a lot of straws in the last 20 years. A lot of what
people do is for show, but Bob and Jose may really have found
something. I don't see any alternatives that anyone has suggested
that have as much promise as this one does.''
</P>
<P>
   By planting seedlings, Oyamel firs, the trees where the monarchs
roost, and pines, farmers can begin making money from reforested
land in a few years, Alvarez said. Oyamels can be harvested as
Christmas trees in four years, and pines can be harvested for wood
in as little as five years. The hope, Alvarez said, is for farmers
to use the donated trees to begin a cycle of planting, harvesting
and replanting that will maintain a standing forest.
</P>
<P>
   But at first, even giving away the trees was not easy. Alvarez
said residents were concerned that if they reforested their land it
might be taken by the Mexican government as a monarch sanctuary.
Small said that in 1986, when the government set aside land for the
monarchs, the communities that had been using those forests
received no financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said that attitudes were slowly changing and that all
40,000 seedlings he delivered to El Rosario were immediately loaded
onto burros and carried up the mountainside by farmers to plant on
their land.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists agree that even next year's hoped-for planting
of 100,000 trees is just a beginning, the equivalent of a mere 100
acres of forest. They say the effort must grow considerably to keep
the monarch sanctuaries out of harm's way in this poverty-stricken
region. At least one similar reforestation effort is under way, run
by the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Planting trees near the monarch sanctuaries may have benefits
besides the obvious economic ones. As trees have been cut around
the sanctuaries, stronger winds are blowing through the reserves,
drying the normally moist habitat and making the trees more prone
to disease, Brower said. As trees are planted, he said, this
potentially devastating problem should begin to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said: ``There are thousands of acres out there that have
been transformed into corn or oat fields. I want it all to go back
to forest. I think this is definitely the answer.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Virginia Valian, a professor of psychology and
linguistics at Hunter College in New York, normally studies how
children learn language, but years ago she came across an academic
monograph that practically left her speechless. The report
demonstrated how the same professional credentials are evaluated
differently depending on whether they are possessed by a man or a
woman _ with the woman being the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Valian has analyzed many hundreds of studies on the
status of women in the professions, science and academia. She has
now pulled the vast and ragged literature together into a
compelling book called ``Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women,''
published by the MIT Press. On a recent summer afternoon, as
construction workers clattered and hammered outside her office
door, Valian, a sturdy, dynamic woman with thick white hair and
thick dark eyebrows, talked about women's professional progress,
and what might help pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your book is about the progress of women in academia, in
science and other professions, and its very title, ``Why So
Slow?,'' starts with the assumption that women are not getting
ahead at the rate they should be. But are women really going so
slowly? What is the evidence?
</P>
<P>
   A. The cleanest and most thorough data we have on the course of
women's careers is for women in academia, but a similar pattern
holds for lawyers and business people. Several agencies have
tracked the progress of male and female PhDs in the sciences and
the humanities and looked at how they fare on the professorial
track.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to happen is that men and women start out on roughly
equal footing. They get almost the same salaries, and they begin at
the same rank, assistant professor. But if you look several years
down the line, the differences in their career paths become
apparent. The men are earning more, and they are being promoted at
a faster rate than the women are.
</P>
<P>
   There's one very good study in which researchers looked at a
subset of PhD scientists who had won prestigious postdoctoral
fellowships. Their question: In this group of people with
outstanding early promise, will the men and women advance equally
in academia? Even here, the answer was no. After 10 to 12 years,
the men were almost a full rank ahead of the women.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are the men pulling ahead?
</P>
<P>
   A. One factor that people often raise in explaining the
discrepancy is, men in academia publish more than women do, and
publications, as we all know, are essential to academic success.
Yet there are two points to be made about publication rates. First,
even when you control for productivity, men still advance more
rapidly than women do. Second, although men publish comparatively
more papers, women's papers have a higher citation rate _ that is,
they're referred to more often by other scientists. So women
publish less, but if you take citation rate as a measure of
quality, women publish better work. Unfortunately, university
boards don't often explicitly consider publication quality when
making decisions on promotion and tenure. Maybe they should.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do women emphasize quality over quantity in publishing?
</P>
<P>
   A. Women may fear or suspect that their work will not be
evaluated in the same way a man's is, so they need more
documentation to back up what they are saying. Men may be more
willing to take a flier, to come up with some intriguing hypothesis
for which they have relatively meager data and just put it out
there to be proven true or false. Women may believe, perhaps
correctly, that they are less likely to be given the benefit of the
doubt, and that their off-the-cuff ideas will be dismissed as
foolish. We associate risk-taking behavior with men, and we may be
less tolerant of intellectual risk-taking in women.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A core thesis of your book is that we all have ideas of how
men and women generally behave, and that these gender schemas can
work against women's professional advancement. Why not just call
these schemas stereotypes?
</P>
<P>
   A. I prefer the term schema to stereotype because stereotype has
such negative connotations, as though we shouldn't have these
things in the first place. But we can't get along in the world
without some conceptual framework, some generalizations about
social groups and events. We need a way to predict what will
happen, and to know how to behave appropriately in various
situations. If you're a college student, you need a schema of what
a professor is. A professor is supposed to show up for every class,
be there on time, stay the whole period, be competent in the
material, grade people fairly, and so forth. A student knows that
you don't bribe your professor, that's not how things work.
</P>
<P>
   When we get to male and female schemas, well, then, we're all
self-styled experts. You can take a person at random and list a
bunch of adjectives _ ``assertive,'' ``has high leadership
ability,'' ``is kind to children'' _ and the person would have no
trouble matching them up with one sex or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If gender schemas are not necessarily bad, how do they hurt
women?
</P>
<P>
   A. In many professional situations, our gender schemas have the
effect of making a man seem slightly more qualified and competent
than he is, and a woman slightly less. A number of studies have
demonstrated this tendency in action. Take the
``head-of-the-table'' experiment, in which researchers showed
college students pictures of five people sitting around a
conference table. When the people depicted were of the same sex,
all-male or all-female, the students reliably labeled whoever sat
at the head of the table as the leader of the group. When it was a
mixed-sex group, and the person at the head of the table was male,
again the students reliably chose him as the leader. But when it
was a mixed group, and the person at the head of the table was
female, half the time the students chose her as the leader, and
half the time they chose a man who was sitting somewhere else at
the table. This is a small example of something that happens
repeatedly to women. Even in a position of leadership, they're not
getting the same benefits from it that a man in the position is
getting. If you're a man, you get automatic deference.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where do our gender schemas come from?
</P>
<P>
   A. My explanation is a cognitive one: we take a salient physical
difference between the sexes - women can bear and physically
nurture children but men cannot - and use that difference as a
metaphor for personality differences. To make women's personalities
consistent with their bodies, we label them as nurturant, and then
define men as the opposite. If men have greater physical strength
than women do, we read that trait as a metaphor for superior
leadership capacity.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. You talk in the book about how there's no one big factor
responsible for women's lagging progress, but rather a series of
small nicks along the way.
</P>
<P>
   A. What makes it hard to understand women's slow advancement is
that nothing seems overtly wrong in most work situations,
especially in academia and science, where the meritocratic ethos is
so prominent. People are often unable to perceive or assess how
small imbalances can really add up. One computer simulation showed
what happens in an organization with eight levels of hierarchy,
when it is staffed initially with equal numbers of males and
females, but the men are given a tiny advantage in the promotion
process _ a mere 1 percent. The programmers continued the
simulation until there had been a complete staff turnover at their
fictitious organization. At the end, the top level was 65 percent
male, 35 percent female.
</P>
<P>
   Any single instance of bias is likely to be tiny, and someone
might say, you're making mountain out of a molehill. But mountains
are molehills piled one on top of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what do we do about our gender schemas and the little
molehills we stumble over? It sounds as though just getting more
women into the pool will not necessarily help.
</P>
<P>
   A. In fact, widening the pool of female candidates does help.
Women progress faster through the ranks in those law schools with a
high percentage of female faculty members than they do in schools
where there are few female professors. Studies have shown that when
people are asked to rate a female candidate for a managerial job,
they rate her more positively if she is one of several women in the
candidate pool than if she is the only woman. The explanation for
this seems to be that if you're in a tiny minority of women, you're
seen in terms of your gender _ and the general view of women is
that they aren't so competent professionally. But if there are many
women besides you, people stop focusing on your gender and start
judging you in terms of your ability.
</P>
<P>
   Being aware of one's gender schemas also helps. I want to
emphasize that in almost every study I have reviewed, it's not only
men who undervalue women _ women also do it. There are no
victimizers or victims. We all have the same basic gender schemas
through which we evaluate people. But each time we stop and
question our schemas, we're less likely to be swayed by them.
</P>
<P>
   We can improve the conditions under which people evaluate
others, in sometimes very simple ways. One nice experiment showed
that when people are in a room with a mirror, which increases
self-consciousness, they make decisions more in accord with
meritocratic factors than they do if the mirror is covered over.
Also, being vouched for by a leader increases how positively people
are evaluated. Leaders can share authority and legitimize authority
in others, including in women. That's one very important thing that
corporate executives, chairs of academic departments, and so forth,
can do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about your own life? Do you feel that you have been
discriminated against as a woman in academia?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't like to talk about my own situation. Nobody wants to
feel like a victim _ it's too depressing. But what I think is wrong
is for people to deal with not wanting to be a victim by denying
there's any undervaluation of women in the first place. It's
necessary to see things as they are if we're ever to devise
effective ways of doing something about them.

in this long charade _ playing to the sexual schizophrenia of the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Sex _ as a nation we don't know what to do about it. Some want
all references to sex eliminated from books and the Internet,
others will buy something they don't need if it's sold in a sexy
manner, as any advertising director can verify.
</P>
<P>
   Self-righteous moralists can't get enough of the nitty-gritty on
the president's sex life _ so they can feel and act superior. They
would deny, however, any tingling sensations that might arise from
their prurient interests.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, a hounded and subpoenaed Clinton finally
publicly admitted that he had sex _ ``an inappropriate
relationship,'' as he called it _ with Monica Lewinsky. Even so, he
didn't quite confess to what he had denied previously.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits act shocked; others call for him to step down _ as
if Clinton were the only president who had affairs while in office.
These commentators seriously need a reality check. They act as if
they are totally naive about the relationship between power and
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Power is an aphrodisiac _ to those who have it and to those in
proximity. From the kings and queens of England to the generals in
the early republic, power has been granted sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   Others comment that Clinton's presidency will be diminished in
the view of history. Have any presidencies been diminished
historically because of rambunctious sexual cavorting? Not one _
from Washington to Jefferson to Kennedy and Johnson. Presidencies
are historically judged on leadership and the state of the nation
when they ended their tenures.
</P>
<P>
   When the years erase the topical and irrelevant, only the
accomplishments remain.
</P>
<P>
   Were any of the two dozen known philandering presidents forced
to admit that they had affairs while in office? No.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the president was respected, even if a particular
president wasn't. Such investigations would have been squelched.
Now, the office has been so degraded that Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
can call the president a jerk on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Is a president's sexual behavior the public's business?
Generally, no.
</P>
<P>
   No more than it's the president's business to look into our
sexual partners. The only time such revelations would be important
is if there was a significant showing that the president's ability
to lead the country was severely compromised by the relationship.
There's been no such showing.
</P>
<P>
   What has hampered the president is Special Prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's politically-motivated investigation and chipping away at
the office of the president. Through his actions, Starr may have
seriously diminished future presidential prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   Starr took years and what some estimate will be a $50 million
tab to uncover this illicit relationship between two consensual
adults. Was it worth it? Only to those Republicans who have been
harboring retribution in their dark hearts _ anxious to pay back
Democrats for bringing President Nixon down.
</P>
<P>
   After the air strikes against terrorists in Afghanistan and
Sudan, ordered by the president, Republican Sens. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Dan Coats of Indiana cast doubt on Clinton's real
motivation. They intimated that the attacks were to deflect the
public's attention from the Lewinsky affair. Paybacks for Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   If we were to split Starr's $50 million into 50 portions --- $1
million to investigate each state house in our nation, there would
be many uncomfortable governors looking for places to hide.
</P>
<P>
   How many people could withstand such scrutiny into their private
lives?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sex isn't your Achilles' heel _ perhaps greed is, or
cruelty, or alcohol, or temper, or lack of courage. A hound dog
prosecutor like Starr could make you look like a fool. He's turned
his office into that of an old-time divorce detective _ hiding in
order to snap incriminating photos and gather semen-stained
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone be shocked that the president denied a sexual
liaison with Lewinsky? Most men and women when asked about an
illicit sexual relationship deny it. They deny it to cover their
tracks, to protect the other person in the affair, to protect their
wives or husbands. They deny it in order to provide time to think,
to provide cover. Sometimes they deny it so that the relationship
can continue. It's human nature.
</P>
<P>
   It's reality.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine also that the answer given is going to be broadcast to
the entire nation. Wouldn't most people deny?
</P>
<P>
   The real question: Why was it anyone's business?
</P>
<P>
   The Starr investigation was outrageously rampant _ from an
Arkansas land deal to sex in the Oval Office _ but politically
impossible for a Democratic president with a GOP-controlled
Congress to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Starr conducted a fishing expedition that eventually found
evidence of the president's weakness. He has such latitude, money
and resources, and political motive that anyone he targets can be
brought down.
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutors can be useful to the public when they bring
to light fraud and illegal activities of those in high office. But
Starr has crossed into a tawdry, tabloid-style investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the people to put an end to this travesty. The
special prosecutor law must be revised and strict restrictions put
on the office. The sooner, the better.
</P>

ALCOHOL AND FERTILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although women trying to conceive have long been warned against
heavy drinking, a new study suggests that even moderate alcohol
intake can impede conception.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the National University Hospital in Denmark
looked at 430 Danish couples aged 20 to 35 who were trying to
conceive a child for the first time. They were asked to report on
intake of beer, wine and spirits over six menstrual cycles or until
pregnancy occurred. The research team adjusted for factors such as
cigarette smoking, sexually transmitted disease, sperm counts and
caffeine intake, said Dr. Tina Kold Jensen, an epidemiologist and
lead author of the study, which appeared in last week's issue of
the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers concluded that women who did not drink at all had
the highest chance of conceiving in a menstrual cycle, followed by
those who drank one to five alcoholic beverages per week. Women who
consumed 10 drinks or more had only one-third the chance of
conceiving compared to the nondrinkers. Alcohol did not affect male
fertility, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jensen and her colleagues remain uncertain about the
physical mechanism that triggered lower fertility in drinkers.
``Even low doses of alcohol increase miscarriage,'' she said. ``It
may be that alcohol is causing early abortion, preventing the fetus
from being implanted. But this is only speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen advises women trying to get pregnant to reduce alcohol
intake. ``Alcohol can damage the fetus after conception, so why not
cut down while you're trying to get pregnant, too,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This month Thomas Hales, a professor of mathematics at the
University of Michigan announced a solution to a problem that had
plagued mathematicians for almost four centuries: Which is the best
way to stack oranges? It turns out that the classic arrangement
used by greengrocers around the world is undoubtedly the most
efficient way to stack oranges. While greengrocers reached their
conclusion via experience and intuition, Hales spent 10 years
developing a complex 250-page argument, which relies on three
gigabytes of computer files.
</P>
<P>
   Although greengrocers may not be impressed by Hales' result,
other mathematicians are already considering its implications for
related stacking problems. These problems are linked to an area of
research known as coding theory, which involves trying to compress
data without corrupting it. In some ways, stacking data is very
much like stacking oranges, and understanding of both could lead to
more efficient and accurate transmission of information.
</P>
<P>
   The orange stacking problem can be traced to the latter half of
the 16th century, when Elizabethan explorer Sir Walter Raleigh
wrote to English mathematician Thomas Harriot, asking him to find a
quick way to estimate the number of cannonballs in a pile. In turn,
Harriot wrote to Johannes Kepler, the great German astronomer, who
was already interested in stacking, but at the most fundamental
level. A staunch believer in the Greek idea of atomism, Kepler
wondered how water particles stacked themselves to form symmetrical
snowflakes. All this speculation about stacking spheres, be they
water particles or cannonballs, caused Kepler to investigate which
was the most efficient way to arrange spheres to minimize the gaps
among them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, imagine a layer of spheres arranged such that the
centers of four neighboring spheres form a square. Other identical
layers are placed so that the spheres are directly above each
other, the centers of eight clustered spheres forming a cube. This
arrangement is known as the simple cubic lattice, and it has a
packing efficiency of only 52 percent, that is, the gaps among the
spheres are almost as big as the space occupied by the spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Kepler experimented and could not find any more efficient
arrangement than the so-called face-centered cubic lattice, which
has a packing efficiency of 74 percent. In this arrangement, the
first layer is formed by placing each line of spheres in the cracks
of its neighboring line of spheres, such that the centers of four
neighboring spheres form a diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Each successive layer is built by placing spheres in the dimples
of the former layer. Coincidentally, this arrangement is used by
greengrocers to stack oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kepler could find no arrangement with a higher packing
efficiency, he could not prove that no such arrangement exists.
After all, there are an infinite number of possible arrangements,
including random ones as well as regular lattices. Hence, his claim
that the face-centered cubic lattice is the most efficient
arrangement became known as the Kepler conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20th century, generations of mathematicians had failed to
demonstrate categorically that the Kepler conjecture was true, but
no one had discovered a more efficient arrangement. For all
practical purposes the conjecture was undisputed, but
mathematicians demand absolute certainty, achieved via a logical
series of arguments, otherwise known as a proof.
</P>
<P>
   Because mathematicians do not rely on experimentation nor
imperfect measurement of the real world, their logic can lead to a
truth that is far more certain than that which can be obtained via
the other sciences. Mathematicians will not accept anything, unless
it has been formally proven. This led the British sphere-packing
expert C.A. Rogers to comment that the Kepler conjecture is one
that ``most mathematicians believe, and all physicists know.''
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the problem can be judged by the fact that it has
remained unsolved for so long. Karl F. Gauss, the most brilliant
mathematician of the 19th century, failed to prove the Kepler
conjecture, but he solved the two-dimensional version of the
problem: The best way to arrange discs in two dimensions is to
surround each disc by six others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, the problem was included in a hit-list of 23 great
unsolved problems compiled by David Hilbert, one of the most
eminent figures in the subject. This raised the profile of the
problem, but Kepler's conjecture remained inviolate, causing one
1970s mathematician to call the situation scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   After four centuries of failure, Hales' announcement of a proof
of the Kepler conjecture has been greeted with some surprise and a
great deal of euphoria. Hales has been obsessed with the problem
for more than a decade. To solve it he set out to analyze one
equation consisting of 150 variables, which can be changed to
describe every conceivable arrangement. The challenge for Hales was
to confirm that there is no combination of variables which leads to
a packing efficiency that is higher than that of the face-centered
cubic lattice.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional pencil-and-paper techniques for performing this task
fail, because of the complexity of the equation and the large
number of variables. Even computers would be confounded by a
straightforward analysis of the equation. Hales and his research
student Samuel P. Ferguson, however, discovered shortcuts, then
exploited great computer power to bring the problem within the
realm of the possible. He announced his result on the Internet
(www.math.lsa.umich.edu/hales) _ no arrangement beats the
face-centered cubic for efficiency. In other words, Kepler and
greengrocers were right all along.
</P>
<P>
   Hales acknowledged that his work needs to be reviewed by other
mathematicians before Kepler's conjecture officially turns into a
theorem: ``These results are still preliminary in the sense that
they have not been refereed, but the proof is, to the best of my
knowledge, correct and complete. I have put several years of
intense effort into this problem. Now I'm taking my first real
vacation in years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The importance of refereeing was underscored in 1990, when Wu-Yi
Hsiang of the University of California at Berkeley said that he had
proved Kepler's conjecture. Subsequent checking of his manuscript
revealed flaws in logic that invalidated his proof. Although Hsiang
attempted to correct the mistakes, the consensus was that he had
failed to meet the strict demands of absolute mathematical proof.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Andrew Wiles of Princeton University announced a proof
of French mathematician Pierre de Fermat's last theorem. Within a
few weeks, colleagues pointed out a subtle error that effectively
destroyed seven years of work. But this story has a happier ending,
because Wiles, collaborating with his former student Richard
Taylor, bypassed the error and published a corrected proof in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Hales' proof, the process of refereeing will be
particularly exacting, because, in addition to the 250 pages of
logic, three gigabytes of computer files must be scrutinized.
Mathematicians are experienced in checking conventional
mathematical arguments, but looking for errors in computer software
is a relatively new part of refereeing. And errors could exist in
the hardware running the computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   The first significant problem to succumb to the power of the
computer was the so-called four-color conjecture, solved in 1976 by
Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel. In 1852, English mathematician
Francis Guthrie had claimed that only four colors are necessary to
color all maps such that no neighboring regions are colored the
same. All the maps he examined did indeed require only four colors,
but he could not be sure that there was not a map which would
require five colors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of conceivable maps is infinite, Haken and
Appel showed that the colorability of all these maps depends only
on the colorability of a large, but finite, set of fundamental
maps. Using computers, they set about testing these fundamental
maps and proved that Guthrie's conjecture was correct. But the
mathematical community was split on the viability of a computer
proof.
</P>
<P>
   Some mathematicians celebrated the solution to a 19th century
problem, while others were concerned about how the certainty of
such a proof could be verified. Some also worried that the computer
proof lacked the elucidation of a traditional proof _ the brute
force checking of the large finite group of maps proves that
Guthrie's conjecture is true, but it does not explain why.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to the Kepler conjecture, the refereeing process
could take several months. In the meantime, general optimism exists
that Hales has cracked one of the most well-known problems in
mathematics. According to John Conway, a mathematician at Princeton
University and co-author of the standard text on sphere packing:
``For the last decade, Hales' work on sphere packing has been
painstaking and credible. If he says he's done it, then he's quite
probably right.''

MORE ABOUT WEBTV: AMBITIOUS NEW CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(mk) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's column on WebTV for Windows stirred up enough
questions from readers about TV cards for personal computers to
warrant a review of the latest and most ambitious of this breed of
hardware, All-in-Wonder Pro from ATI Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, this product is an all-in-one television,
video and graphics upgrade that can be installed in any Pentium
computer with an available PCI slot. PCI (for Peripheral Component
Interconnect) is a standard introduced several years ago by Intel
Corp. for high-speed, multitasking devices like video hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Most Pentium computers have two PCI slots, so before buying a TV
card or other high-speed video upgrade _ especially the new
generation of 3-D video cards _ make sure the machine has a free
PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   Another version of the All-in-Wonder Pro is available for owners
of Pentium II computers that have the new Accelerated Graphics
Port, or AGP, which can handle larger, more complex 3-D animations
by borrowing memory from the computer's RAM. This is especially
useful if the computer is often used for 3-D games or other
applications that do extensive three-dimensional rendering.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-Wonder comes in two versions, the original, which has
a minimum of two megabits and maximum of four megabits of
high-speed, EDO (Extended Data Out) memory.
</P>
<P>
   The card tested for this column was the All-in-Wonder Pro, a
more powerful version that offers twice as much memory, to a
maximum of eight megabits, and the memory is slightly faster. In
addition, the Pro version adds what is known as a 3-D Triangle
setup engine, which uses a sophisticated math processor to add
detail to complex 3-D animations, and DBX brand television audio,
which cuts the background hiss and static to deliver clear, bright
sound approaching CD quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro also allows people with similar equipment to conduct
videoconferences and includes extra features beyond the scope of
this review. It also comes bundled with multimedia and game
software that show off the card's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The basic All-in-Wonder retails for about $150. The Pro version
is twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Installation is straightforward and well-documented, and all the
drivers and other setup software are delivered on a self-starting
CD-ROM. But installing the card requires opening the computer, so
users who are squeamish about exposing the machine's guts should
probably buy the card from a retailer that will install it.
</P>
<P>
   Both cards were tested in low-end machines. The All-in-Wonder
was installed in a home-built 100-megahertz Pentium computer
running Windows 95, and the Pro version was installed in an AST
computer with a 166-megahertz Pentium MMX processor running Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   The only glitch in both cases was that installing the
All-in-Wonder for some reason removed the speaker icon from the
tool bar tray and muted the line input in the Windows sound mixer,
resulting in no sound from the on-board television until the
original audio settings had been restored. This problem is not
mentioned in the original or supplemental documentation for either
card, but it was not difficult to diagnose and fix.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hardware and software are installed, the card has to be
told whether it is connected to an antenna or cable system. It then
scans to find all available channels _ as many as 125 on cable
systems and 70 on antennas. In either case, the setup time, from
breaking the seal on the package to sitting back to watch
television, was about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reception on a Comcast cable hookup was far superior to
reception of standard televisions in the same house _ or at least
seemed to be. Some of this is an eye-brain trick that's performed
by many TV cards, a result of the higher scan rate of computer
monitors relative to televisions, and the fact that viewers tend to
sit much closer to a monitor than to a television set.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the soft, flicker-free image can be
attributed only to fine electronics in the tuner part of the ATI
card. Previously tested cards connected to the same cable system
could not match the ATI's image quality.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the card is rich in features. While
WebTV, the television software that comes with Windows 98,
showcases the strength of blending the Internet with television,
ATI's software demonstrates that mating the computer and the
television can produce a surprisingly useful information appliance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a standard television, closed captioning is
primarily a technology for people with hearing disabilities,
although it is occasionally used to avoid bothering someone
sleeping in the same room or in noisy public places like Times
Square, where audio is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   On a PC-TV hybrid, closed captioning takes on data-base
characteristics. The text can be searched for keywords, stored in a
file as a complete transcription of a program, or told to flag the
viewer if certain words are spoken on any channel that is being
scanned. This feature can be set so that a television window pops
up, either full screen or in a smaller window on the desktop,
whenever certain words are spoken in a program, allowing the user
to work uninterrupted until certain subject matter appears.
</P>
<P>
   Complete transcripts of programs can be saved in several
formats, which ATI calls ``TV magazines.'' The advantage of these
is that the text is saved in rich text format (.rtf files) that can
be read by most word processors. The magazine feature also
intersperses black-and-white screen shots in the text at a
frequency defined by the user _ that is, one picture per so many
words of text _ and changes the all-capital-letter text that closed
captioning delivers into upper- and lower-case text.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the most useful of ATI's tools is a feature that
continuously scans the channels available and builds a grid of
thumbnail images of what is playing on each channel at that moment.
On a monitor set at a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels, this
feature displays the current programing on as many as 80 channels
simultaneously. The user can double-click on any thumbnail to tune
to that channel.
</P>
<P>
   The memory in the card is employed in several ways that make the
PC-TV hybrid more interesting than standard television, including
storing two to 10 seconds of video streams for instant replays.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has used a high-quality image editing program like
Adobe Photoshop will appreciate the ability of ATI software to save
``screen grabs'' as graphic still images. And, ATI's television
software allows the user to define a rectangle on the television
screen by dragging a mouse and then zooming in to just that portion
of the image.
</P>
<P>
   The software also captures full-motion video and/or audio and
saves it as an AVI (audio-video interleave) movie, although no type
of data eats disc space faster. The Pro version bundles MGI
Videowave, a video editing program that works with any source,
including the television tuner or a VCR, enabling users to edit
piece of video and create rudimentary special effects, fades and
titling.
</P>
<P>
   The card offers audio-visual input and output connections that
make it usable with any television, VCR, DVD, video CD or stereo
component. These include the single-cable S-Video connectors that
have become a standard for camcorders and VCRs, plus old-fashioned
composite video connectors that take traditional patch cords.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-Wonder viewer can be used for video formats other
than television, including MPEG (Motion Pictures Experts Group) and
AVI movie formats, and it includes a CD music player that is
slightly more advanced than the one shipped with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation accustomed to equating television with the
passive medium that spawned generations of couch potatoes, the
PC-TV hybrid begs a rethinking of what the appliance can, and maybe
should, be. At the very least, it is a lot more entertaining than
either of its progenitors. At best, it is an interactive
information machine that promises to grow more powerful over time.

 &HT;    Delta-UAL alliance stumbles over board seat issue
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta and United airlines trumpeted their planned
alliance last spring as a major strategic move that would marry the
two giant carriers' route systems and create ``the wave of the
aviation future.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that wave could be reduced to a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines will have to live with a scaled-down alliance _
with joint frequent flier benefits but no ability to book
passengers on each other's flights _ unless Atlanta-based Delta and
its pilots union can make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Delta's directors rejected a union demand for a
voting seat on the board in return for a contract change that would
allow the airline to code-share, or sell seats on United flights as
if they were its own.
</P>
<P>
   The union had demanded the board seat last spring as a
prerequisite to changing the contract, which prohibits code-sharing
with another big domestic airline. The company, which announced the
alliance in April, agreed to study the demand and respond this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   After being told of the rejection by Delta Chief Executive Leo
Mullin and non-executive board Chairman Gerald Grinstein, union
leaders last week ordered a committee studying the needed contract
change to stop its work.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Giambusso, the just-elected chairman of the Delta unit
of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the Delta board's
``resistance to having an employee as a full voting member of the
Delta board ... exceeded their desire to go forward with the United
alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the impasse is broken, Delta and United can only proceed
with frequent flier elements of their alliance. On Sept. 1, they'll
begin allowing fliers on either carrier the option of accruing
miles in either carrier's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the very near future we will make some announcements
regarding joint redemption,'' said Delta spokeswoman Laura Gillig.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent flier cooperation alone will produce some strategic
gains. Passengers who usually fly Chicago-based United to Asia or
the western United States, where it's strongest, should be more
likely to use Delta elsewhere so they can accrue United mileage.
</P>
<P>
   But code-sharing _ a more direct way of creating cross-loyalties
between passengers of the two airlines _ has always been seen as
the heart of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the lion's share of the strategic and
financial benefits accrue from code-sharing,'' said analyst Tom
Longman of Arnhold &AMP; S. Bliechroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The United-Delta deal was in part a competitive response to a
similar deal announced last winter between Northwest and
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   But the Northwest-Continental partnership hasn't taken effect,
Northwest is mired in labor woes of its own, and federal regulators
have yet to signal their stance on major airline alliances
generally.
</P>
<P>
   So the urgency behind the Delta-United deal has waned for the
moment, said PaineWebber analyst Samuel Buttrick. That could
contribute to Delta's unwillingness to give in on the pilot demand.
</P>
<P>
   As for the union's stance, Buttrick said he's puzzled. Board
seat or no, he said, the union can extract job security assurances
and pay boosts when the new contract language is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an economic matter, the contract change gives the pilots
all the leverage they need,'' Buttrick said. And with just one vote
on an 11-member board, the union wouldn't be able to sway corporate
policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Karen McGuffey, spokeswoman for Delta's ALPA group, said the
issue isn't about voting power, but rather an equal and ongoing
voice in deliberations that will affect pilot careers. As the
alliance evolves it could lead to joint decisions about which
carrier adds or drops routes in different areas, and that would
affect both the number and type of Delta pilot jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize being one of 11 votes on the board is not going to
affect change,'' McGuffey said. ``The issue to us is one of
participation. Being a full member of the board provides access,
and that's what's critical. As the alliance moves ahead, there are
going to be decisions that affect pilot careers, and we want to
participate in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuffey also said there is a question of equity.
</P>
<P>
   United's pilots union has a voting seat on parent UAL Corp.'s
board of directors. That seat was granted as part of a 1994
employee buyout in which workers gained a 55 percent stake in the
company. Delta's pilots, by contrast, have a single-digit stake in
the company. Their union is allowed to appoint a board
representative, but that member can't vote and isn't privy to all
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the four parties involved (the two companies and two pilots
unions), we are the only one that doesn't have a full voice at the
table,'' McGuffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ALPA made it ``crystal clear'' to Delta management last spring
the board seat was a threshold condition to any contract change,
according to union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, in a memo to workers last week, said the board gave the
union demand ``serious study'' but rejected it to preserve its
independence from special interest considerations. He added he
hoped union leaders, who meet at the end of this month, will
reconsider their position.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the board consulted with both
legal experts and major shareholders. ``Many (shareholders) have
stated positions on board composition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giambusso, in a letter to pilots, said the decision reflects
``our board's and management's inability to conduct business in a
non-paternalistic manner.''
</P>
<P>
   How does United view the snag? ``We think code-sharing is quite
important, and we're hopeful Delta can work out the issues with
their pilots,'' said spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``There is value in
what we are doing with the frequent flier programs ... but we would
like to go further with the rest of the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   If code-sharing dies, speculation about other strategic moves by
Delta will likely be rekindled _ especially given that, prior to
the United alliance, Mullin had tried to buy Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road,'' said analyst Longman, ``if Delta isn't
involved in a code-share with United, it's still going to be
looking for some form of partnership.''

 &HT;    Georgia-based Roper ready to bear storm in Russia
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Officials at Georgia-based Roper Industries say they
are sufficiently protected to weather Russia's latest economic
storm but might have a harder time winning new business there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Russia and there is more risk and more uncertainty
than there is in most other markets in the world,'' said Martin
Headley, Roper's vice president and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been good to Roper, a company based in Bogart, near
Athens, GA, that makes analytical instruments and industrial pumps
and valves.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian company Gazprom, one of the world's largest energy
companies, is also Roper's biggest customer, bringing in $40
million in annual revenue. That's expected to equal 10 percent of
Roper's sales this year. The money has helped to fuel a number of
Roper's acquisitions in other markets. Roper has been doing
business with Gazprom since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As it usually does with other international customers, Roper
requires payment from Gazprom in dollars. That is particularly
important in Russia, Headley said, where exchange rates for the
ruble have had wild swings.
</P>
<P>
   Roper's chief financial officer says his company is insulated
from Russia's economic troubles because Gazprom's payments are in
dollars and because the work centers on revenue from Gazprom's
business in Europe. Roper sells Gazprom compression controls, which
allow the pipelines to operate at higher pressure, thus handle an
increased flow of natural gas to markets in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Roper does not expect the devaluation of the Russian ruble to
affect it in the short to medium term, Headley said.
</P>
<P>
   But coupled with the Russian economy's broader difficulties, the
currency problems do make it more difficult for Roper to generate
new business there, Headley said. Roper has contracts with other
Russian businesses to supply equipment _ if they have enough money
to pay Roper with dollars. None has, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Headley said it is difficult to gauge how Russia's economic
problems might affect Gazprom in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom sells much of its natural gas to Russian markets, but it
also has significant business outside the country, Headley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it ought to have some strength independent of the
Russian economy,'' he said.

 &HT;    Video games capture pros' moves, hearts
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami Fusion defender Cle Kooiman was a starter for the United
States in World Cup '94. But while the real U.S. team stumbled,
Kooiman's computer-generated twin went on to greater soccer glory
in Electronic Art's new video game, World Cup 98.
</P>
<P>
   That's Kooiman doing the video victory dance after the World
Cup's winning goal is scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did (that scene) once and it took me 10 minutes to calm
down,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kooiman did that victory dance _ along with dribbling, tackling
and running _ at an Electronic Arts laboratory in Vancouver last
December. Console computer sports games require human movement if
the video players are to move realistically. The process is called
motion capture.
</P>
<P>
   Kooiman wore a stifling hot, black, rubbery body suit that
looked like it was covered with dozens of ping pong balls. He
played soccer in a dark, empty room as cameras and computers
captured his movements.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Arts is the biggest player in the $6.6 billion video
game industry. EA Sports games for PC, PlayStation and Nintendo 64
systems cost between $40 and $60. The games feature brand-name
announcers such as Fox NFL's John Madden and in-stadium music from
groups such as Chumbawamba. And the teams are made up of real
players.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup 98 features 1,600 players that have 850 movements.
</P>
<P>
   Motion capture began about four years ago when video games began
featuring 3-D players. EA, which has been creating software since
1982, has a permanent studio that features a sod ``playing'' field
and $20 million in motion capture equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as EA don't look for marquee names for motion
capture but instead seek players who can act and can quickly
understand the process, says World Cup '98 producer Marc Aubanel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cle jumped right out as an absolute, right guy, a natural born
ham,'' says Aubanel. ``He can imagine anything that happens on the
pitch (field) and re-create it in the studio. Of all the soccer
players we've worked with, he's the most charismatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Aubanel says it's not yet feasible for computers to create
accurate human movement for video games. That's why EA, based in
San Mateo, California, seek pros such as Kooiman.
</P>
<P>
   After he was picked, Kooiman wasn't sure he could finish the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first day I honestly didn't think I could make it
through seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long process. It takes 40 minutes to hook you up in the
suit and then you start sweating like crazy,'' he recounts. ``You
do one sequence at a time, like pass the ball at a 45 degree angle.
If you don't do it right, you do it again. You can do six, seven,
eight takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it can take the computers three to four minutes to set up
again. If a (soccer) ball hits a camera it can take an
hour-and-a-half to reconfigure it. You do this for about 10 hours a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfer Tiger Woods has been playing video games for years and
knew exactly what new wrinkles he wanted when EA signed him for a
game due in the fall. For one, Woods wanted his game to play faster
than the competitors. You'll be able to play 18 holes of Tiger
Woods 99 in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are played in every Major League Baseball clubhouse,
including the Florida Marlins. Cliff Floyd, the Marlins left
fielder, plays out a whole video game season. His mid-season report
is that his video Marlins are way behind the Atlanta Braves. Sound
familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``It relaxes me,'' says Floyd, who adds that playing baseball
for a living isn't necessarily a video advantage. ``Playing the
game puts you in the position you think you know what you're doing
and when you don't . . . whoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Miami Dolphins take video games on the road to ease
hotel room boredom. When wide receiver Lamar Thomas plays EA's John
Madden NFL 98, he likes to put NFL players he doesn't like on
``sorry'' teams so he can trash them.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be disconcerting when he's playing and the video
Lamar Thomas drops a pass. ``First I get mad at myself and then I
remember to get mad at the guy who made the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kooiman admits when he plays World Cup 98 the game doesn't last
very long. He sets out to get a red card ejection for a violent
foul as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me doing the rant against the referee,'' he says, ``I
just love seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   REAL PROS TAKE THE FIELD IN VIDEO GAMES
</P>
<P>
   All EA sports video games use real athletes for motion capture.
When the Dolphins' Lamar Thomas' computer alter ego catches a pass
on Madden NFL 98, the movements were supplied by former San
Francisco '49ers receiver John Taylor. Linebackers Gary Plummer
(49ers) and Ken Harvey (Washington Redskins) also did motion
capture for the game.
</P>
<P>
   For EA's NCAA March Madness 98 women's basketball, Kate Starbird
of the Seattle Reign and former Florida Atlantic star Yolanda
Griffith, now with the Long Beach StingRays, did the motion
capture.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, the NBA's 1997 Rookie of the Year with the San
Antonio Spurs, was picked for men's movements for the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Boxers Sugar Ray Leonard and Oscar de la Hoya are the movement
models for EA's Knockout Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Players doing motion capture for NHL 99 include goalkeeper John
Vanbiesbrouck and center Mike Sillinger, both with the Philadelphia
Flyers, along with Vancouver Canucks players Markus Naslund,
Mattias Ohlund and Donald Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker, from the Boston Celtics, is involved in NBA Live
99 . For NBA Live 98, the Miami Heat's Tim Hardaway and Mitch
Richmond of the Sacramento Kings supplied motion.
</P>
<P>
   To complement Kooiman's work for EA's World Cup games, other
Major League Soccer specialists were used, including D.C. United's
Roy Lassiter (shooting), Dallas Burn's Mark Dodd (goalkeeping) and
Kansas City Wizards Preki (trick dribbling).

CLINTON SCANDAL PUTS GORE ON THE GRIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As cries mount for President Clinton's resignation
or censure, Vice President Al Gore remains fiercely loyal to his
mentor despite some ominous implications for his own political
future.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been mocked for insisting he is still proud to serve
with Clinton and thinks of Clinton as a great president. Some
pundits even suggest that Gore damaged his own chances of being
elected president by being so uncritical of behavior no one else
defends.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore, as the Democratic heir apparent, has little
choice but to stand by the president. After nearly six years of a
close personal and political partnership, it would be neither in
Gore's nature nor his interest to waiver now.
</P>
<P>
   Like the legendary British Prime Minister Winston Churchill,
Gore understands the basic principle of loyal public service.
Churchill, once asked to turn against the Crown, stoutly replied,
``I have taken the king's shilling. I am the king's man.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats facing re-election in November are
nervously sidling away from their discredited president. But Gore's
fate is inextricably tied to Clinton's. A vice president's proper
role is to be an honorable team player, not a selfish opportunist
willing to pile on a pal when he's down.
</P>
<P>
   There will come a time after the fall elections when Gore will
have to move beyond Clinton's shadow to establish a separate
identity as a presidential candidate, on character as well as
global issues. But that time has not yet come.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's own clean family life partially insulates him from the
widespread public disgust voters register toward the president's
tawdry dalliance with Monica Lewinsky. And so far Clinton's
continuing high job-approval ratings _ in the 60 percent range _
have further spared Gore from a deadly undertow that could bring
down not only Clinton but everyone associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles Times poll last week, 73 percent of those
surveyed said the Clinton sex scandal would have no effect on their
vote for Gore in the 2000 presidential contest. Other polls show
that Gore's job-approval ratings have remained slightly over 50
percent during the entire scandal, at roughly the same level they
were before the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much Gore's job-approval ratings are buoyed by
Clinton's and how much they are due to a definably favorable public
image of his own. Some polls do indicate a majority of voters see
Gore as more honest and trustworthy than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But vice presidents traditionally benefit, or suffer, from the
fortunes of the presidents in whose shadow they labor. And Gore
does have problems, although they are still in embryonic form.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, the freshness factor. If voters are sick
of Clinton's misbehavior, they may simply want to get rid of the
whole Democratic shebang, including the fellow endlessly
photographed at Clinton's side. No matter how uninformed they may
have been thus far about Gore's personality, he's a familiar figure
visibly identified with an administration that is wearing out its
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the lingering 1996 Democratic campaign fund-raising
controversy. Although congressional probes into potential
wrongdoing proved nothing materially wrong with Gore's role, a
White House memorandum recently turned up by Justice Department
investigators suggests that some of Gore's telephone solicitations
may have violated federal campaign finance laws after all.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who had previously absolved Gore of
wrongdoing, is now examining the issue of whether a special counsel
should be appointed to look into his fund-raising activities. Under
Republican pressure, Reno also is reconsidering whether to approve
a special counsel for the entire 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign
financing operation.
</P>
<P>
   Any controversy that keeps alive the fund-raising issue is bound
to hurt Gore.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest gaffe remains his effort to explain away his
fund-raising calls by saying ``no controlling legal authority''
forbade them. He sounded as legalistically evasive as Clinton and
just as deceptive. Nor did he seem forthcoming about the nature of
a Buddhist temple fund-raiser, which he originally described as
``community outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   He is once again raising campaign money by the carload, but he
is highly vulnerable to further partisan scrutiny in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The closer he gets to the throne room, in fact, the fatter a
target he becomes for political arrows from others who would like
to be president as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a discreet vice president of greater indirect influence than
his predecessors but with little real power, Gore has been able to
maintain a low profile with relatively little controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changes dramatically if Clinton is censured by
Congress and becomes unable to function effectively as president,
making both himself and his vice president look like failures. Or
if Clinton resigns and Gore becomes the incumbent president,
burdened with the previous administration's record and no electoral
base of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is the least likely scenario, given that the House
Judiciary Committee may not be able to publicly take up the task,
if at all, until next spring. The next presidential election could
be practically upon us by the time Clinton faced imminent danger of
being ousted that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gore would have no control over the major
events shaping his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe political satirist Mark Russell has the ultimate ironic
answer to Gore's fate. ``Bill Clinton is so slick,'' Russell jokes,
``they'll impeach Gore.''

FINDING THE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is meant by the term ``geographical center''? How is it
determined? What is the geographical center of the United States?
Is that with or without Hawaii and Alaska?
</P>
<P>
   A. What the U.S. Census Bureau calls the ``geographic center of
area'' is the point at which the surface of a geographical entity
would balance if the surface were a plane of uniform weight per
unit of area.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, that point has been in Butte County,
S.D., on the state's western border, since the census of 1960, the
year the bureau began including Hawaii and Alaska in its
calculations. If only the 48 contiguous states are included, the
point is in Smith County, Kan., which is roughly in the middle of
Kansas' northern border.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also determines the population center of the
United States at each census. The statistical method it uses to do
this assumes that the map of the United States is flat, weightless
and rigid; the population center is the point at which this surface
would balance if weights of equal value were placed on it with each
weight representing the location of one person on a particular
date.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1990 census, the date was April 1, and the point lies in
Crawford County, Mo., about 90 miles southwest of St. Louis.

BLACK TRUFFLES: VIVA VARIETY  
 PRE-COLUMBIAN ULCERS  
 EXPANDING UNIVERSE  
 FLAWED MERCURY MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Md.)  (js) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That culinary delicacy, the black truffle, may be relatively
rare and expensive these days, but pity the poor cave man: the
supply appears to have all but shriveled up around 10,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is the hypothesis of a trio of researchers (from France,
naturally) who studied black truffles with an eye to understanding
why they vary in flavor and aroma. In a brief article in Nature,
they report that the fungi, which are found among tree roots, show
almost no genetic variation across the species. This contrasts
sharply with burgundy and summer truffles, which vary greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic sameness can often be linked to a population bottleneck,
an event that kills most of a species, leaving a relative handful
of specimens (and a correspondingly small gene pool) to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other two varieties, the black truffle ripens in
winter, and can be killed by a cold snap. The researchers theorize
that the truffle's population bottleneck came in the last Ice Age _
that cold snap of epochal proportions, which ended about 100
centuries ago _ when European forests were greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   They conclude that differences in the perfume and taste of black
truffles are probably due to environmental conditions and suggest
further research to identify the specific influences. Well,
somebody has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-Columbian Ulcers
</P>
<P>
   While shedding tears for the truffleless cave men of Europe,
save some sympathy for the mountain dwellers of pre-Columbian South
America. Some of them, it turns out, may have had stomach ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pelayo Correa, a pathologist at Louisiana State University,
detected antigens for Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria at the root
of peptic ulcers, in stool samples from Andean mummies. Correa used
a new test designed to detect infection in living people, but it
proved effective in remains that were up to 1,800 years old. His
findings are the earliest evidence of H.pylori infection in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding Universe
</P>
<P>
   Current thinking that there is not enough mass in the universe
to stop it from expanding forever has received support from the
seemingly paradoxical discovery of a huge mass in space: a cluster
of thousands of galaxies containing trillions of stars.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster, found by Megan Donahue and others at the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is 8 billion light-years
from earth. In addition to its great mass, it is incredibly hot _
the gas between galaxies is calculated to be 300 million degrees
Fahrenheit. The presence of such a massive cluster so far away, and
thus so far back in time, suggests that the cluster did most of its
accumulating when the universe was relatively young, and has since
slowed its growth.
</P>
<P>
   This finding runs counter to the theory of a dense universe that
could eventually collapse upon itself. If there was a lot of mass
around to be accumulated, clusters of galaxies would grow
continuously, and the most massive ones would have been growing
longest. It would be highly unlikely to find one so early in time.
</P>
<P>
   But a cluster that has grown relatively quickly and then slowed
supports the opposite idea, that the universe is relatively
lightweight, without the critical mass that would allow clusters to
grow steadily or prevent its own eternal expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Flawed Mercury Measure Mercury, the element, not the planet, is
one of the world's great environmental poisons. It accumulates in
the food chain, starting in plankton and building up through ever
larger sea creatures to wind up in humans, where it is toxic to the
nervous system. The amount of mercury from industrial processes and
the burning of coal and solid waste has long been a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. and French researchers have shown that one important
barometer of mercury pollution, measurements of the amount of the
metal found in the Greenland ice cap in the 1970s, was too high.
Where tests of snow samples two decades ago found mercury
concentrations as high as 800 parts per trillion, the new studies,
of samples from 1949 to 1989, found concentrations below two parts
per trillion. Apparently the older testing methods contaminated the
samples.

`RESERVATION ROAD': COMPELLING READING, DESPITE ITS JERRY-BUILT
PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cover of John Burnham Schwartz's new novel, ``Reservation
Road,'' depicting a country gas station, is reminiscent, in a crude
way, of Edward Hopper's famous 1940 painting ``Gas.'' There is
something lonely and haunted about the picture, a sense of
isolation, even impending menace.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the gas station in the painting play a pivotal
role in this psychological thriller _ it is the place where
10-year-old Josh Learner is struck and killed by a hit-and-run
driver _ but the painting's mood of brooding loss also underscores
the novel's haunting evocation of the precariousness of ordinary
life.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the opening pages of ``Reservation Road'' is
this: The Learners are returning from a concert to their home in
upstate Connecticut when they stop at a local gas station. A
speeding car suddenly careers around a bend, striking Josh, who is
standing at the side of the road. He is killed instantly, but the
car continues on its way as Josh's father, Ethan, tries, in vain,
to give chase. The remainder of the novel is devoted to chronicling
the emotional fallout of this awful accident on both the Learner
family, and on Dwight Arno, the hit-and-run driver responsible for
Josh's death.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Reservation Road'' marks a huge departure in subject
matter and tone from Schwartz's first novel, ``Bicycle Days''
(1989) _ a comic Bildungsroman about a young American trying to
begin a new life in Japan _ the two novels share an emotional
density of experience and a writerly concern with language and
domestic detail. In fact, it is Schwartz's authoritative depiction
of his characters' inner lives _ their efforts to come to terms
with Josh's death and their own feelings of guilt, anger and grief
_ that makes this novel so compelling to read, despite its somewhat
jerry-built plot.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting back and forth between the voices of Ethan Learner and
Dwight Arno, Schwartz meticulously depicts the immediate aftermath
of Josh's death. The Learners' stunned disbelief that ``one minute
there is a boy, a life thrumming with possibilities, and the next
there are marked cars and strangers in uniform and the fractured
whirling lights.'' And Dwight's equally stunned realization that in
a brief second he has become a murderer, the inadvertent thief of a
child's life, a boy the same age as his son, Sam.
</P>
<P>
   While Dwight toys with the idea of allowing himself to be caught
by the police, he knows, as a lawyer, that his own dubious past
will probably be held against him: Years before, when his wife Ruth
announced that she was leaving him, he attacked her with his fists,
and broke the jaw of Sam, who was trying to keep his parents apart.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight tells Sam, who was asleep in the car when the accident
occurred, that they hit a dog on their way home, and he puts the
car, with a tell-tale bit of Josh's jacket caught on its smashed
right headlight, into the garage and shuts the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Learners' lives, meanwhile, have shattered into a before and
after. Ethan, who teaches English at a small New England college,
vacillates between rage at the police for not doing more to catch
the man who killed his son, and sharp, aching grief, as he replays
memories of his son in his head. Grace Learner has sunk into a
state of anguished numbness, unable to work and unable to forgive
her husband, whom she blames for failing to keep Josh safe. As for
their 8-year old daughter, Emma, she blames herself for her
brother's death. After all, she reasons, she was the one who
insisted on stopping at the gas station (to use the bathroom) in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in lyrical, carefully hammered prose, Schwartz does a
sensitive job of showing us the mathematics of loss as they apply
to both the Learners and to Dwight, a man depicted not as your
usual villain, but as an unlucky, frustrated individual devoted to
his son and eager to make up to him all the hurt he has already
inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to orchestrating the thrillerlike aspects of this
novel, however, Schwartz is decidedly clumsier. Though
``Reservation Road'' is highly suspenseful, its author's efforts to
put Dwight and Ethan on a collision course often feel highly
synthetic. He repeatedly makes portentous references to Dwight's
violent temper, and he occasionally has Ethan step out of character
to utter such theatrical remarks as ``I was a hard wronged man with
a mission'' or ``without hope, the need to punish is the one true
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   As the novel speeds toward its melodramatic conclusion, the
coincidences, too, begin to proliferate: it just so happens that
Dwight's ex-wife is Emma's music teacher, and it just so happens
that Ethan runs into Sam, who tells him about the night his
father's car hit a dog. No doubt we are meant to believe that such
uncanny events could easily happen in a small town, but as
delineated in ``Reservation Road'' they feel hokey and contrived
and in retrospect they cast a small but lingering shadow over what
is otherwise a powerful and affecting novel.

`OLIVER SACKS: THE MIND TRAVELER': ON BEING HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Wash.)  (Eds: Broadcast notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only Oliver Sacks would have the wit to alert readers of
``Seeing Voices'' (one of his early books, about the deaf) that the
footnotes are ``mental or imaginative excursions, to be taken, or
avoided, as the reader-traveler chooses.'' Those footnotes are
mini-essays, always worth the detour. More to the point, no one has
better defined Sacks' writing. A neurologist and dazzling essayist,
he creates travelogues of the best sort: forays into the human mind
and personality.
</P>
<P>
   In the PBS series ``Oliver Sacks: The Mind Traveler,'' he turns
to a different form. Yet these absorbing documentaries remain
imaginative excursions. Sacks takes viewer-travelers along as he
examines the peculiar, sometimes magical-seeming ways in which the
brain works.
</P>
<P>
   The four-part series begins Tuesday night with ``The Ragin'
Cajun,'' about a man with Usher's syndrome, a condition in which
people are born deaf and become progressively blind from
adolescence. On the next three Tuesdays Sacks goes to a Pacific
atoll where part of the population is born colorblind, visits a
talented autistic painter and meets an 8-year-old girl with
Williams syndrome, in which a flair for social skills and music
coexists with limited ability to deal with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, Sacks is a genial, curious guide, with his Santa
Claus beard, precise British accent and large supply of T-shirts
and hats from the New York Botanical Garden. These are
straightforward documentaries, with no visual flash-and-dazzle.
They are not poetic and not nearly as philosophical as his
deservedly best-selling books (including ``An Anthropologist on
Mars'').
</P>
<P>
   His literary qualities are replaced by the close-up experience
of meeting the people he examines. It would seem off-base to call
them subjects. Sacks always views them not merely as case studies
but as individuals with winning personalities, whose differences
from the rest of us shed light on the essence of what it means to
be human.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's episode focuses on Danny, the chef in a Seattle
restaurant called the Ragin' Cajun. He was born in a Louisiana
county with a high incidence of Usher's syndrome, a result of
isolation and inbreeding going back so many generations that his
parents were unaware of those factors.
</P>
<P>
   Danny and several friends, all of whom use sign language
eloquently, have moved to Seattle, where there are better services
and acceptance of the deaf and blind. In this ``migration,'' Sacks
finds ``a portrait of a community.'' And though he examines the
physiology of Usher's, the condition is equally important for what
it tells him about the fierce need to communicate. As they lose
their ability to see, adults with Usher's syndrome are in danger of
losing their native language. Yet they learn to feel the hand
motions of signing and even to discern emotion according to the
tension in the speaker's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Danny is the perfect Sacks subject: At 35 he is a smiling,
good-looking man with a ponytail. But he now has tunnel vision, and
in 10 years will most likely be blind. As in Sacks' books, there is
no condescension or sentimentality in his attitude. But there may
be an element of self-fulfilling prophecy in his choice of
examples, as he focuses on people who are flourishing and
accomplished in at least one direction, however limited they may be
in others.
</P>
<P>
   That is also true of ``Rage for Order,'' the third episode and
one of the best, about a 37-year-old autistic woman named Jessy.
She lives with her parents, a physicist and a writer. We meet her
when two of her paintings are put on display at the National Arts
Club in Manhattan. The canvases depict houses and skies with a
hyperreal flatness and a distinct sense of pastel, rainbow colors.
</P>
<P>
   Jessy has obsessions that help her order her world: she has been
fixated on refrigerators and on bank fees for using ATMs. And she
has an elaborate system for painting suns, in which the number of
rays are good or bad, and colors equal foods. She has created rice
suns and licorice suns, whose colors have no relation to the actual
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at her painting of a night sky filled with accurately
rendered constellations, Sacks says, ``For a minute I was tempted
to equate these dark vacuums with some inner empty state that was
Jessy's, but the force of her presence discouraged such an easy way
out.'' Instead, he asks unanswerable questions: ``How much is Jessy
the product of her autism? How much has she been shaped by her
parents?'' He wonders, ``Who is Jessy?'' The episode, as he
suggests, is a display of her fascinating, engaging personality.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception, this series does not echo published
material. Next week's episode presents the journey that is the
basis of Sacks' most recent book, ``The Island of the Colorblind.''
Knut Nordby, a Norwegian scientist born colorblind, accompanies
Sacks to Pingelap, where one in 12 people share his condition. This
episode leads to the not-exceptional conclusion that different
cultures have different standards of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   And it includes the series' oddest segment, in which Sacks
becomes obsessed with finding the perfect indigo, a color he once
experienced in a mild drug-induced state in the '60s. His search
makes the point that color comes from the mind as well as the eye,
and hints at crosscurrents in the series. Sacks' search suggests
his own rage for order, so different from Jessy's yet so
fundamentally part of the human psyche.

   WASHINGTON _ The joint strike fighter program, which is supposed
to produce a new aircraft that can be adapted for the Air Force,

A HINT OF THE EXOTIC FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a chapter in the fall fashion story devoted
to romance, to exotic embroideries and patterns inspired by foreign
cultures. The resulting clothing has an ethnic feeling but is never
a literal interpretation of a country's mode of dress. It's a
refreshing alternative to the new season's daily uniform of sweater
and pants.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hint of India in the subtle trimming on shift dresses
by Tocca (starting at $250) and a bohemian attitude to the printed
silk scarves trimmed with velvet and fringe from Voyage (starting
at $550) at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue has dresses with Indian-inspired embroidery by
Plenty ($135), Anna Pia ($295), Laundry by Shelli Segal ($130) and
Vivienne Tam (from $215).
</P>
<P>
   Mexican accents at Neiman Marcus include what Tracy Feith calls
``fiesta'' skirts in silky crinkled fabrics with beads and fringe
($200 to $225). Neiman Marcus also has Ms. Tam's Day of the Dead
T-shirt and sleeveless dress, with skeleton motifs ($165 to $255).

VACATION RECIPE: STUDY COOKING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one thing to seek good food on vacation. Increasingly
though, cookbooks are replacing guidebooks as travelers take to the
stove.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of merely spending a few nights at a farmhouse inn in
Tuscany, or ensconced in a charming village in Provence and dining
in the local cafes, travelers are signing up for cooking classes in
these places. In the 1998 edition of ``The Guide to Cooking
Schools,'' published by Shaw Guides of New York ($19.95), there
were 270 vacation cooking courses listed, triple the number in
1989, when the guide was first published. (Although the guide does
not evaluate the schools, it is an excellent source of information;
it is also available, regularly updated, on the Web, at
www.shawguides.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Options now range from a few demonstrations by chefs on a cruise
ship to intensive experiences, including the opportunity to do some
heavy lifting in a Michelin three-star kitchen in France. There are
courses given by celebrity cooks, and serious technical courses in
established schools like the Cordon Bleu in Paris. The cost of most
programs is in the $2,000 range for five to seven days, not
including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   There are more programs in the cities and countryside of France
and Italy than elsewhere, but you can often choose your destination
first, then find a course. Cooking vacations can now be arranged in
more than two dozen countries, several as far-flung as Brazil,
Oman, Thailand and Japan, where Elizabeth Andoh teaches one- to
four-session courses in home-style cooking in Tokyo. Visits to many
American vacation spots like New England, Hawaii and the California
wine country can also be combined with cooking classes.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation is the critical term. A basic requirement is a
well-equipped kitchen with an overhead mirror, but the setting and
locale are significant factors. Some courses are held in
particularly alluring settings in the midst of historical and
cultural attractions. Provence, where Patricia Wells teaches in her
beautifully restored 18th-century farmhouse, is one such example.
Another is Lorenza de'Medici's school at Badia a Coltibuono, a
beautiful residence and winery in a former monastery near Siena.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where you visit, selecting a program featuring the
local cuisine will enhance the experience. Larraine Stroman of
Dallas, who took the course at the Domaine de la Fontaine in the
lovely small Provencal town of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, said, ``It was
a great way to learn about regional foods,'' even though she
admitted that she began to tire of eggplant recipes after a week.
Jane Butel's course in Albuquerque takes students through the vast
range of chilies, from tame to inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   Taking cooking classes is also a good way to meet people who
share interests, making them ideal for single travelers. Of course,
many couples take them together.
</P>
<P>
   The best courses are hands on, not merely demonstrations, and
they vary in intensity. Some involve cooking all day, while others
offer side trips, visits to markets and free time.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the level of instruction, class size, and whether each
student has a work station. Request sample recipes. If the
instructor has written a cookbook, buy it for a better idea of the
teacher's approach. Though the idea of taking classes given by
well-known chefs may sound exciting, bear in mind that professional
chefs are often not the best teachers, nor are their recipes always
easy to replicate at home. Ask for names of students to contact for
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is the time of year a course is offered.
Many courses are excuses to fill hotels and inns during the off
season. Do you really want to go on a cooking vacation in Hawaii in
August or one near Yosemite National Park in March? On the other
hand, fall _ white truffle season _ would be an added enticement
for northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Though some courses can be reserved on fairly short notice,
those with well-known cooks and authors, like Marcella Hazan and
Giuliano Bugialli, tend to be booked months, even years, in
advance. But they have waiting lists. And people cancel.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing up, determine what kind of lodging is available
and whether it's included in the price. Are all meals and any side
trips part of the program? Does the school accommodate noncooking
companions, or if not, what kind of lodging can be arranged nearby?
Will you be met at an airport or train station? Do you need a car?
Are credit cards accepted?
</P>
<P>
   And if you plan to take your own knives to the school _ some
prefer it _ check them in your luggage or give them, well-wrapped,
to airline personnel so they won't be confiscated. You'll get them
back when the flight lands.

   La Varenne at the Greenbrier: As cooking schools in resorts go,
this one, taught by Anne Willan at the vast, historic property in
White Sulfur Springs, W.Va., is one of the most serious. Though

<P>
   Q: My 12-year-old son is obsessed with the Loch Ness monster, so
I have decided to take him to the source next month. Can you
provide information on what Nessie-themed tours or sites there are
in Drumnadrochit, Scotland? _ Sam Payne, Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: It has been described as resembling everything from a dragon
to a giant sturgeon, but whatever it may or may not be, Nessie, the
legendary inhabitant of Loch Ness, attracts tens of thousands of
tourists each year. Many of the monster sightings have been near
your destination, the tiny village of Drumnadrochit on the northern
side of the lake, about 15 miles from Inverness in the Scottish
Highlands. That is where you'll find the greatest concentration of
Loch Ness monster sites, as well as shops selling everything from
stuffed Nessies to refrigerator monster magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Local historians say the first recorded sighting of the beast
was by the Christian missionary St. Columba in 565. In 1886 the
Inverness Courier noted the ``local tradition of a strange fish in
the Loch.'' Some 50 years later newspapers throughout Britain
carried reports of a surging mass of water in the center of the
23-mile-long loch created by an enormous animal rolling and
plunging. One of the most recent sightings was reported on June 1,
following 11 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, high-tech investigations involving submarines,
sonar and underwater video cameras have neither proved nor
disproved Nessie's existence.
</P>
<P>
   In Drumnadrochit, you'll find two major exhibitions on the lake
and the monster. At the Official Loch Ness Monster Exhibition,
which is housed in a former Victorian hotel in the center of
Drumnadrochit, a 40-minute presentation uses video, photographs,
music, narration and dramatic lighting to describe the geology,
history and legends surrounding the 800-foot-deep lake, whose basin
was carved out by glaciers some 300 million years ago; it is the
largest body of fresh water in Britain. Ample time is devoted to
the myths surrounding Nessie and the various attempts to locate
her. Exhibits include the John Murray, a sonar research vessel used
in search of the monster in the 1970s. The center is open from 9:30
a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; admission is $7.60 (figured at a rate of 59
pence to the dollar), $4.25 for children. From late October to next
spring, the center will be partly closed for renovations.
Information: (44-1456) 450573.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Original Loch Ness Visitor Center, where you
can view another multimedia presentation, as well as photographs of
the creature (probably faked, a spokesman for the center says).
Admission is $6, $4.65 for children. The center is part of the Loch
Ness Lodge Hotel, a 350-year-old 60-room inn with modern double
rooms available for $119, including breakfast. Information and
reservations: (44-1456) 450342, fax (44-1456) 450429.
</P>
<P>
   The winding one-mile-wide lake, rimmed by forested hills and
glens, is an attraction in itself. Among the sightseeing cruises
available is an hourlong trip on the Deepscan research vessel,
which carries up to 12 people and departs hourly in the spring,
summer and fall from 10:30 a.m. through 5 p.m. Besides learning
about the Nessie legend from well-informed guides, you'll pass the
imposing ruins of the 500-year-old Urquhart Castle; about two miles
southeast of Drumnadrochit, it is open to visitors (admission is
$6). The cost of the cruise is $13.50; $8.50 for children. The trip
can be booked at both exhibition sites mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact the Highlands of Scotland Tourist
Board, Post Office Box 9, Dunoon, Argyll PA23 8QQ; (44-1997)
421160.

<P>
   Q: I'm looking for companies offering guided day hikes on Maui.
Can you help? _ Susan Wolff, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here are two possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   Hike Maui has a variety of half-day and full-day hikes on the
island; most are described as moderate hikes, meaning they are
suitable for people in reasonable physical shape. Prices range from
$75 to $115 and include snacks and sandwiches. Participants are
transported by van to trail heads; during the trip _ which,
depending on the itinerary, could last up to two hours _ guides
lecture on the geology, flora and fauna of the volcanic island. For
example, a seven-hour three-mile hike along the arid coastline
above La Perouse Bay costs $90, $70 for children 15 and under.
Snorkeling equipment is included. Information: (808) 879-5270, fax
(808) 876-0308.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Journeys to Paradise, which organizes kayaking, driving and
hiking trips, has a Haleakala Hiking tour that lasts six to eight
hours and covers eight miles. Participants start at an altitude of
8,000 feet and hike into the Haleakala Crater. The cost is $79 and
includes transportation to the trail, lunch and snacks.
Information: (888) 232-3601 or (888) 345-7685.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know of a Spanish organization that offers tours to a
group of private castles in Catalonia? _ Janice P. Mincks, New
York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're probably thinking of the Castle Cultural Foundation of
Catalonia, a relatively new foundation committed to preserving 77
privately owned castles, most of them in the region of Catalonia in
eastern Spain. Only four of the castles are open throughout the
year (except in August), although the owners of the majority of the
castles will participate in the second annual ``open door'' visit
on Sept. 27, when free guided tours are scheduled at 11 a.m., 12:30
a.m., 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four that are open year round is the 11th-century
Montsonis Castle, in the village of the same name, 36 miles
northeast of the provincial capital of Lerida. The idea for the
foundation was conceived in 1991 by the castle's owner, Baron
Carlos Montoliu. His 30-room palace is five stories tall and has a
former prison and a secret escape passageway. Montoliu, a corn and
alfalfa farmer, lives there with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Montclar Castle, about 15 minutes away, and two castles in the
nearby towns of Florejachs and Pallargas, also share the same
year-round schedule of guided tours, which are on Sundays at 11
a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Admission is $3.30 for each. Group visits are
held on other days, by appointment; individuals may be able to join
the groups by contacting the foundation's office in Montsonis, at
(34-973) 402 045, fax (34-973) 400 735.

   The words are: Postal Service. The question is: What sort of
image do they conjure up? Those who answered ``heroic'' are on top
of today's news. Plans are in progress to broadcast a
made-for-television movie starring Louis Gossett Jr. and Jonathan
Silverman as a couple of intrepid postal inspectors tracking down a
mail bomber. The film, ``The Inspectors,'' is to be shown on the
Showtime cable network on Sept. 20. The little-known 2,200-member
investigative arm of the U.S. Postal Service traces its origins to
Benjamin Franklin and combats mail fraud, child pornography and
terrorism.

<P>
   He was a great architect. Was he also a saint? The subject is
Antonio Gaudi, the Spanish modernist perhaps best known for the
towers and spires of his vast and still unfinished Sagrada Familia
Cathedral in Barcelona, Spain. Now comes word that the archbishop
of Barcelona, Ricard-Maria Cardinal Carles, with the support of the
bishops of Catalonia, has proposed the beatification of Gaudi, who
was born in 1852, spent the last 40 years of his life working on
the cathedral and died in a tram accident in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly letter, the cardinal wrote of the known and
generally unknown areas of the architect's life. ``One of these
aspects,'' he said, ``is Gaudi's intimate and spiritual life.''

   NEW YORK _ People who like to mark their calendars with special
events may want to record that 74-year-old singer, actor, composer
and songwriter Charles Aznavour is bound for Broadway, not to
overlook Los Angeles. From Oct. 21 to Nov. 3, the entertainer, who
became prominent in the 1950s with his emotional chansons and
starring roles in films like Truffaut's ``Shoot the Piano Player,''
will play 12 performances at the Marquis Theater in New York. From
Nov. 18 to 22, he'll be at the Wilshire Theater in Los Angeles.

   Space Trip
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's hot. But figuratively speaking, stay cool. For those
who are patient, the place that beckons the overheated next year is
the National Building Museum in Washington. Beginning May 1 and
continuing into the next millennium (well, Jan. 2, 2000, to be
precise), the museum will mount a major exhibition titled ``Stay
Cool! Air-Conditioning in America.'' Trumpeted as the first major
show to explore the transformative power of air-conditioning and
its impact on architecture, interior design and the way Americans
live, work and play, the exhibition will feature a series of
pertinent environments.
</P>
<P>
   These include a 1920s movie theater where millions of Americans
were introduced to air-conditioning; a centrally air-conditioned
1960s suburban living room, and an inflatable structure supported
by its own air-conditioning that will feature projects by
visionaries like Buckminster Fuller and Frank Lloyd Wright.

HOYT C. HOTTEL, MIT RESEARCHER AND WEAPONS DEVELOPER; AT 95 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoyt Clarke Hottel, a specialist on fuel and combustion who
helped develop the incendiary bomb and the flame-thrower during
World War II, died of pancreatic cancer last Tuesday in his home in
Winchester, Mass. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hottel, a member of the faculty at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology for 40 years and director of the school's fuel
research laboratory for 35 years, was awarded a Presidential Medal
of Merit, the nation's highest civilian honor, for his
contributions to the bomb's development.
</P>
<P>
   At a chemical engineering dinner in 1992, Mr. Hottel, who was
nearly 90 at the time, poked fun at his tendency to procrastinate
by quoting pianist Victor Borge, ``Plan to die young and keep
planning,'' he said, ``just put off the act as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   An only child, he was born in Salem, Ind. He recalled watching
Halley's comet from his family's back yard on April 21, 1910, the
day Mark Twain died. At the time, he said, ``I thought I never
would see Halley again because it would be about 76 years.'' He
did, of course, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hottel, who completed high school at the age of 15,
graduated from the University of Indiana and earned a master's
degree in chemical engineering at MIT in 1928, the year he joined
the school's faculty. He retired in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, when MIT instituted a Hoyt C. Hottel lecture series,
Mr. Hottel delivered the inaugural address. A chair in chemical
engineering was endowed in his name at the school in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he helped develop the M-69 incendiary bomb,
which was used extensively in Europe and Japan. The device was
tested on a meticulously-constructed village of 32 Japanese-style
homes and 16 sturdy German-style dwellings constructed at the
Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hottel visited Japan in 1961. ``They are a warm, gracious
and friendly people,'' he said in a story published in the Boston
Herald on July 1, 1962. ``They are a nation of high culture and
intellectual depth. One can't help having regrets about the way
things were and what had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he was among the 55 scientists from 13 countries who
volunteered to visit the Soviet Union as ``good-faith witnesses''
to guarantee the return of ailing dissident Yelena Bonner, if she
were allowed to leave the Soviet Union for medical treatment in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves three daughters, Lois H. Wood of Lebanon, N.H.;
Barbara H. Willis of Severna Park, Md., and Elizabeth H. Barrett of
San Diego; a son, Hoyt Jr., who is known as ``Clarke,'' of
Mattapoisett, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.

   MARRAKESH, Morocco _ Not long ago, the imam at the Casbah mosque
agreed to show an interested outsider the mosque's ancient minbar.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to compare it to the 12th-century minbar from the
Kutubiyya mosque here, which conservators from the Metropolitan
Museum of Art have lately restored and installed, to justified
local fanfare, in the remains of the city's immense Badi Palace.
The Kutubiyya's minbar is worth traveling halfway around the world
to see. And it is not likely ever to go anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Minbars are portable pulpits, decorated wooden staircases on
wheels from which the imam addresses the congregation during Friday
worship. It is often the most elaborate work of art in a mosque.
Six years ago, the Met asked to borrow the Kutubiyya minbar for
``Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain,'' a big loan exhibition.
But it was too fragile to travel; in fact, it badly needed repair.
</P>
<P>
   So the Met did something unusual in the museum world: It
proposed to restore the minbar, never mind any exhibition. Mahrukh
Tarapor, the museum's associate director, arranged the deal
directly with the Moroccan King, Hassan II. Patti Birch, an
honorary trustee of the Met who has a home in Marrakesh, offered to
pay for the restoration. The Moroccans supplied craftsmen to help.
</P>
<P>
   The whole deal took a while to get in motion, but two years ago,
Met conservators and installation and lighting experts got started.
They worked with a Moroccan architect, El Mostafa Hbibi, and
several Moroccan woodworkers to shore up the minbar's rickety
structure, secure loose panels, clean the surface and design a
place for it in the Badi Palace Museum. The result is one of the
most amazing sights in Marrakesh, a charismatic object, sublime and
handsomely installed.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Casbah minbar is exquisite, too _ though a wreck _
and is still in use. So however they compare esthetically, the two
minbars have now become fundamentally different kinds of objects.
</P>
<P>
   The Kutubiyya minbar, after all, is a modern museum object. Its
display in the Badi Palace represents essentially U.S. exhibition
standards and a Western approach to conservation. There are no
interpolated carvings, for instance, as there are on the other
minbar; the very idea of adding new touches to it seems outrageous,
like trying to pass off a fake.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Casbah minbar remains part of a culture
seamlessly integrated with the past. It belongs to a living faith.
Nearly as old as the Kutubiyya's, it could also be retired to a
museum, though one can imagine it being treated quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Fez, several hours to the north, city planners
have decided to hire local artisans, people from the city's walled
center, or medina, who have been strictly trained in an old craft
tradition, to fix up the decorated facades of ruined monuments,
adding their own designs in the style of the originals. There's
nothing kitsch or ersatz about the plan. The medina is not a theme
park, nor a museum. It's a community. The workers who live there
get jobs with the restoration, and the buildings are put back into
use. One landmark site has become a museum; others are mosques,
restaurants, homes and a university dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   It is a philosophy of historical continuity: If the heel on your
favorite shoe breaks, you don't throw the shoe away or stick it on
a shelf to admire it. You replace the broken heel with a new one
and keep walking.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the minbar in the Casbah mosque it is possible to be
reminded just how much modern conservation, like almost every other
issue in art, is a matter of relative values and parochial
esthetics. Western conservators, loyal to a secular museum culture,
claim a certain objective rightness based on scientific devotion to
a work's historical integrity. And this is a perfectly justifiable
approach if you think in terms of museum objects. But which context
is ultimately more faithful to the spirit of something like the
minbar: the Casbah Mosque or the Badi Palace Museum?
</P>
<P>
   Every generation has claimed to understand the intent of past
artists. Restorers in previous centuries who saw the darkened
Sistine Chapel ceiling were convinced that Michelangelo was a
painter of shadows, so they added their own dark touches to his
work, reinforcing a view of him that affected future restorers, and
so the cycle of restoration proceeded. When an artist named
Mazzuoli stuck darkening glue to the Sistine ceiling in the early
18th century, he was just reflecting the beliefs of his day, as
restorers today, having cleaned away the grime, reflect the modern
faith in science, technology and historic revivalism. A century
from now, the ceiling will probably look as much like a work of
late-20th-century restoration as the darkened ceiling looked like
an anachronism.

</P>
<P>
   The point isn't that the Kutubiyya minbar should be returned to
the Kutubiyya mosque and put back into service. It was removed to
storage years ago because people here decided that it was too
precious to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by the Almoravid Sultan Ali Ibn Yusuf in 1137, it
was made in Cordoba, Spain. More than 12 feet high, it originally
consisted of more than a million differently carved pieces of bone
and colored woods, some pieces the size of sesame seeds, in the
shapes of stars, ``Y''s, hexagons, arabesques, scrolling vines,
palmettes, pine cones, blossoms, checkerboards and Arabic letters.
(There are inlaid inscriptions cut from African blackwood and
outlined in bone.) Pieces have fallen off during the last eight
centuries, but the Met's conservators have painstakingly restored
what is left.
</P>
<P>
   A modern craftsman, as a test, recently took a week to
reproduce, coarsely, one of the minbar's panels, and from this,
experts guess that the whole minbar required 72,000 man-hours of
labor.
</P>
<P>
   It was shipped in pieces down the Guadalquivir River, across the
Strait of Gibraltar and on camelback over the Middle Atlas
mountains to Marrakesh, where it was reassembled.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has estimated that during the eight centuries it was
rolled every Friday in and out of its closet in the mosque, the
minbar traveled a total of 250 miles. Imagine rolling one of your
family's heirloom dinner plates between New York and Washington,
and you can estimate, more or less, the wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   The Met acted remarkably in the situation, committing resources
to an object that doesn't directly benefit its audience. Skeptics
may have asked why the museum was so generous. But one can't help
wondering: If something equivalent from the West _ say, a Giotto
altarpiece _ had been discovered abroad and needed repair, wouldn't
U.S. museums have competed for the honor to restore it?
</P>
<P>
   The Kutubiyya minbar has found a home in the most dramatic
secular setting here: the vast, crumbling Badi is essentially a
museum only for it, at least so far because no other objects are in
it. The 16th-century palace was destroyed by the ruler Mouley
Ismail in the 17th century, its gold, marble, onyx and ivory
stripped and used to build a palace in Meknes, some 200 miles
northeast of here. With a courtyard the size of several football
fields, what is left of the Badi might plausibly be compared to the
Baths of Caracalla in Rome. The minbar occupies one of the few
palace rooms that still has a roof.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in Marrakesh quite like this mix of old with
new: an up-to-date display in a ruin. At dusk, as visitors start to
leave, storks, which nest on the Badi's walls during the day,
descend into the palace courtyard to waddle around the reflecting
pools and orange trees. The storks make a kind of clacking sound;
they lean their heads way back and smack their beaks together. And
as the noise of the city dies down a little, they sound like an
orchestra of castanets, drowning out the coo of the doves that also
live in the palace.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost prehistoric. And suddenly a 12th-century minbar
doesn't seem so old.

MEXICO BATTLES MALARIA EPIDEMIC 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Already devastated by forest fires and drought,
Mexico is struggling to slow a Malaria epidemic that has struck
more than 10,000 people in the southeastern state of Oaxaca, health
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Alvarez Peralta, an epidemiologist for the Pan American
World Health Organization, says an unusual combination of El
Nino-related drought followed by heavy rains along Oaxaca's coast
has caused the anopheles mosquito population _ which carries the
malaria virus _ there to explode.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Oaxaca officials report 10,500 cases of
malaria _ compared to 565 cases all of last year. However, there
has been no reports of any deaths due to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation that no one can ignore,'' Alvarez says.
</P>
<P>
   While the popular coastal towns of Huatulco and Puerto Escondido
have been affected, the U.S. Embassy here has not issued any
specific health advisory for people traveling to the areas.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez says curbing the malaria epidemic will hinge on
controlling the mosquitoes that carry the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public health authorities there are now on a preventive
offensive, and I am sure that they will soon have things under
control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities in Oaxaca _ one of Mexico's poorest states _
admit that most of the state's funds have been used to fight
hundreds of forest fires sparked by a severe drought this Spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this year's epidemic, the number of cases remains low
compared to outbreaks of the disease 20 years ago, Alvarez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to count more than 100,000 cases of malaria every
year,'' he says. ``They are really doing a very good job.''

ARCHITECTURE JOINS ARTISTS TO STAR AT THE LUCERNE FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCERNE, Switzerland _ It is perhaps a measure of the mysterious
power of opera that the summer music festival in Lucerne is far
less well known than those of, say, Salzburg, Bayreuth,
Aix-en-Provence and even Glyndebourne. Of these five, Lucerne alone
does not present opera, limiting itself to a busy program of
concerts and recitals. And that, it seems, suffices to give it a
more modest place in Europe's crowded calendar of festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if judged by quality rather than publicity, Lucerne's
International Music Festival is hard to match. The Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam show up here every summer,
while this year's four-week festival, which runs through Sept. 16,
is also presenting the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra and five other leading ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, this year's roster of big-name conductors includes
Claudio Abbado, James Levine, Daniel Barenboim, Kent Nagano,
Esa-Pekka Salonen, Riccardo Chailly and Lorin Maazel. Further,
there are piano recitals by Maurizio Pollini, Andras Schiff and
Barenboim as well as recitals by the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter
and the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, the real star of Lucerne's 60th music
festival is architecture in the shape of a striking new concert
hall. Designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, it forms part
of a $134 million Lucerne Culture and Convention Center, which will
include a multipurpose hall, a convention center and a Museum of
Fine Arts when completed next year. The concert hall alone was
inaugurated by Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra on last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For this centuries-old city, the ultramodern center, with its
glass and multicolored steel facade and its dramatic cantilever
roof that projects more than 100 feet beyond the main building,
represents a dramatic break with tradition. Standing on the edge of
Lake Lucerne, it looks out toward 17th-century houses, an ancient
wooden bridge and medieval stone watchtowers.
</P>
<P>
   Had Nouvel's original plan been accepted, the center would have
been even more revolutionary. In 1990, he won a competition with a
design that would have had the center jutting out on the the lake
itself, but the city council then asked a Swiss architect, Rodolphe
Luscher, who placed third in the competition, to build the complex.
Two years later, Luscher was dropped and Nouvel was recalled, but
on condition that the lake remain untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I cannot go to the water, the water shall come to me,'' he
decided. And, with that, he designed two channels of shallow water
that run through the complex and effectively separate it into three
sections. Nouvel has also sought to draw the lake into the center
by adding large picture windows and a summer terrace.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,840-seat concert hall, though, was to prove his greatest
challenge. His brief was to design what is known as a ``shoe box''
hall _ that is, rectangular with a flat ceiling. ``This is what
conductors and music lovers prefer,'' he noted. He added four
balconies, each with narrow ``arms'' that stretch along either side
of the hall, while four rows of seats were included behind the
orchestra below the organ.
</P>
<P>
   Before construction began, however, Nouvel was joined by the
renowned American acoustician Russell Johnson. The connection was
fortuitous _ while conducting at the Symphony Hall in Birmingham,
England, the festival's director, Mathias Bamert, was impressed by
the acoustics designed by Johnson _ and would prove felicitous. ``I
am the guardian of the eye,'' Nouvel, 51, explained. ``Russ Johnson
is the guardian of the ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from including a traditional flexible canopy and
identifying the natural reverberance of the floor, stage and walls,
Johnson and his Artec Consultants staff introduced heavy pivotal
panels covered with hollow geometric motifs on either side of the
hall. Depending on the needs of the music, these panels remain
closed or can open to any angle up to 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience must be able to hear in every seat,'' explained
Johnson, 74, tapping decades of experience in concert halls around
the world. ``The conductor and musicians on stage must also hear
each other and have a sense of what it sounds like in the hall. The
aim is simultaneous clarity with some reverberance. You also have
to work very carefully to get the silence right. The acoustician
builds his signature on that silence.''
</P>
<P>
   After the inaugural concert, comprising Wolfgang Rihm's 1995
composition, ``In-Schrift,'' and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Abbado
gave an enthusiastic thumbs-up to the acoustics. The Welsh
bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, who performed in the Beethoven symphony,
said the sound in the new hall was ``wonderful.'' Johnson, though,
expects to work here for another three years before he is satisfied
with the acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   As ``guardian of the eye,'' however, Nouvel had to make some
concessions. Best known for his designs of the Arab Institute and
the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art, both in Paris, Nouvel
also rebuilt the 19th-century opera house in Lyons, adding a
stunning arched roof and, most memorably, an entirely black decor
inside the auditorium. In Lucerne, he again wanted a concert hall
of dark colors, but he faced a rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an opera house, the room disappears,'' Bamert said,
recalling the debate over color. ``In a concert hall, the room is
always there. It took Jean Nouvel a while to get this. The hall
cannot compete emotionally with the music. Nouvel thought we didn't
like his colors. They were beautiful, but that wasn't the point.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect finally surrendered, using rich reds, greens and
blues for the facade and Bordeaux red for the lobbies and corridors
leading to the hall, but opting for white in the hall itself. ``So
having made an all-black opera house in Lyons, I have now made an
all-white concert hall in Lucerne,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bamert could not be happier with the result. And, having run the
festival since 1992, the soft-spoken Swiss conductor, who is also
music director of the London Mozart Players, now feels ready to
leave his post here at the end of this year (he will be succeeded
by Michael Haefliger, currently director of the Davos International
Music Festival's ``Young Artists in Concert'' program).
</P>
<P>
   Before then, though, to an existing annual Easter Festival,
Bamert is adding a new Lucerne Piano Festival from Nov. 19 to 22
this fall, all part of a strategy to make as much use as possible
of the new concert hall (which will also become the permanent home
of the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra). Further, he has organized a
symposium, ``The Festival in the 21st Century,'' between Aug. 30
and Sept. 2 this year, to stimulate debate among musicians,
cultural managers and politicians over the future of festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining his fascination with this form of musical jamboree,
for this year's festival theme Bamert even chose festivals. Thus,
as a nod to Lucerne's 60th birthday, in the coming days the
Bayreuth Festival Orchestra and Chorus will perform part of
Wagner's ``Meistersinger'' and ``Gotterdammerung'' in concert,
while the Salzburg Festival will present its new production of
Messiaen's ``Saint Francis,'' also in concert. So could Lucerne
also be bending to the temptation of opera? ``Of course, with a
hall like this we can now contemplate putting on semi-staged
operas,'' Haefliger said. ``But my main challenge will be to
persuade great orchestras and conductors to keep coming here,
perhaps even to stay a little longer. I'd also like to influence
the programs a bit more. Next year's theme is the myth, the myth at
the end of the century.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 2 P.M. Monday, powerful hurricane Bonnie was located about
600 miles southeast of Savannah, Ga., moving slowly northwestward
at five miles per hour. Packing winds of over 100 miles per hour,
Bonnie is expected to continue its drift toward the Carolina coast
Tuesday. The only notable effects from the intense hurricane will
be unusually high surf along the Southeast coastline. Ten-foot
waves will cause dangerous rip currents and limited beach erosion
near the time of high tide. If Bonnie impacts the U.S mainland, it
would not be until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Intervals of clouds and sunshine will cover the Northeast
Tuesday. Clusters of potent thunderstorms will erupt from the Ohio
Valley to New England as a flow of sultry air intercepts an
approaching cold front. A few of these storms will contain hail and
damaging wind gusts. These thunderstorms will press east, reaching
the northern Middle Atlantic Coast toward evening. Isolated
thunderstorms will also form near the western boundary of the front
from Indiana to the northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure and its sinking air currents will suppress clouds
over much of the Southeast, including Florida. Beneath ample
sunshine, daytime temperatures will reach the middle and upper 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Severe flooding will continue to plague portions of
south-central Texas Tuesday where the remnant moisture from
Tropical Storm Charley had led to at least four deaths since last
weekend. Elsewhere, onshore breezes will promote clouds near the
Northwest coast while abundant sunshine and seasonable warmth
covers California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Agitating Bonnie
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie weakened slightly Monday as the mammoth storm
stalled north of the Bahamas. Bonnie's weakening was self-induced.
While floundering over the same seas for hours, Bonnie's winds
agitated the upper layers of the ocean, causing warm surface water
to sink and cooler water to rise from the depths. In turn, cooler
waters decreased the rate of evaporation, lessening the amount of
water vapor injected into the atmosphere. Because hurricanes derive
fuel from heat released when water vapor condenses into cloud
drops, a reduction in the available fuel caused Bonnie to weaken.

COLORADO EXPLORER USES BIBLE AS GUIDE TO FIND `TRUE' MOUNT SINAI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ Colorado adventurer Bob Cornuke and his
partner, Larry Williams, were stunned by what they saw on the Saudi
Arabian mountain that they believe is the true Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   The duo had forged a letter, crawled under wire fences in the
sizzling desert and eluded soldiers at a nearby Saudi military
outpost _ all for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   They were awed by what Cornuke said was the ``unnaturally
scorched'' peak of Jabal al Lawz. According to the Bible, fire
rained down when God delivered to Moses the two stone tablets
containing the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The two also found what was left of a 30-foot-high stone altar
with renderings of a cow, which Cornuke believes is the altar where
Israelites worshipped the image of the golden calf in rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What blew me away was that everything was there that the Bible
talked about, and I didn't expect that,'' Cornuke, 47, told members
of First Baptist Church of Grapevine on Sunday. ``I thought, `This
is either Mount Sinai or the movie set that they had abandoned.'''
</P>
<P>
   To a rapt audience of hundreds, Cornuke described and played a
videotape of his quest to use the Old Testament as a road map to
find the sacred Mount Sinai. He also talked about the discovery of
an underwater land bridge, or reef, in the Red Sea that he and
Williams theorize the Israelites might have used to cross the water
during their exodus from Egypt 3,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That trek to Saudi Arabia in 1988 is the subject of the book
``The Gold of Exodus: The Discovery of the True Mount Sinai,'' by
Howard Blum. Rob Reiner has optioned the book for a film. Cornuke
is writing a book describing the ``Christian, inspirational'' side
of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Cornuke said that many biblical scholars are critical of his
findings, but he said no one has confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholars are upset at me because they say, `How can this yahoo
go find this stuff when we have been looking for hundreds of years
and haven't found it?''' he said. ``I look at it from an
investigator's eyes, and I look at it as if the Bible is true. It's
a wide-open field for investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornuke, who was a police officer and SWAT team member for nine
years in Costa Mesa, Calif., moved to Colorado in the early 1980s
to escape the congestion and pressures. It was there that this
married father of four children met his mentor, former astronaut
Jim Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Irwin was preparing for a trip to Turkey to search
for Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat, but he had gotten word that Kurdish
terrorists knew of his plans and were going to kidnap him to
advance their cause, Cornuke said.
</P>
<P>
   So Irwin asked Cornuke to come along to provide protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I knew about Moses at that time was that he
looked like Charlton Heston,'' Cornuke said. ``I didn't know that
much about the Bible. I was a kind of now-and-then churchgoer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin's enthusiasm was contagious, and Cornuke went on to
found the Bible Archaeology, Search and Exploration Institute in
Colorado Springs, Colo. He has followed the Exodus route of Moses,
dived into the Red Sea in search of the pharaoh's chariots and
searched for the Lost Ark of the Covenant _ which carried the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Cornuke and Williams, a two-time Republican congressional
candidate in Montana, left for Saudi Arabia on the assumption that
Mount Sinai was not in the Sinai peninsula, as tradition holds, but
in the ancient land of Midian, in Saudi Arabia. Williams bankrolled
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   They also were looking for artifacts _ gold and gems that the
Israelites had taken with them when they fled Egypt. Two years
before, a friend of Williams' had discovered a gold bracelet near
the mountain but was arrested, tried and asked to leave the country
_ without the bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   The kingdom of Saudi Arabia prohibits foreign archaeologists
from the country. Cornuke and Williams got around that by forging a
letter from a Saudi official to get visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing I regret out of this whole story,''
Cornuke said of the forgery. ``At the time, I was so full of
adventure and full of myself. I just figured I'd be like Mission
Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   When they reached their goal _ the Jabal al Lawz mountain _ they
learned that it is the site of a top-secret Saudi military
operation, with armed guards and missile launch areas.
</P>
<P>
   So for their nighttime excursion up the mountain, they used
night-vision binoculars. They crawled under a fence, eluded guards
and scaled up the mountain. They returned home soon after that.
</P>
<P>
   Cornuke said he has returned to Saudi Arabia several times but
would not elaborate. He worries, though, that the recent terrorist
bombings and the United States response will make it more difficult
for archaeologists to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to mess up everything,'' he said. ``It really will.
And it was tough before.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Rev. Rick Lineberger donned a distinctly
unblemished Indiana Jones-type fedora in Cornuke's honor at the
conclusion of the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' Lineberger said after the
presentation. ``I think it will stimulate our people to study the
Scripture even more.''
</P>

   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ Tchaikovsky needs to be rescued from
his own enormous popularity.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the overriding theme of the ninth annual Bard
Music Festival, which concluded Sunday with a substantive
orchestral program at the outdoor festival tent on the Bard College
campus, conducted by Leon Botstein.
</P>
<P>
   Botstein, who is also the president of Bard College, is an
insightful and engaging thinker who has made these annual festivals
a forum for re-examining the work of composers like Dvorak,
Schumann and Bartok, to name three, whom we think we already know
about. This summer's festival, called ``Tchaikovsky and His
World,'' was typically generous, offering 10 concerts (including a
concert performance of his seldom-heard opera ``The Maid of
Orleans''), each preceded by a lecture, as well as four panel
discussions and a screening of Soviet-era film versions of
Tchaikovsky ballets, over two weekends. Botstein shared the duties
as artistic director with another musician-philosopher, cellist
Robert Martin, who is also the dean of graduate studies at Bard.
</P>
<P>
   A recurring premise behind this festival was the idea that there
is a disconnection between Tchaikovsky's music, which has always
been beloved by audiences, and the treatment it has received from
many musicians, critics and scholars. Too often he has been
regarded as an ``adolescent passion you outgrow,'' in the words of
scholar Harlow Robinson, who spoke at Saturday morning's panel on
the critical assessment of Tchaikovsky as a composer.
</P>
<P>
   This premise seems outdated. It is true that, in the mid-20th
century, when most composers were trying to outdo one another in
cutting-edge modernity, Tchaikovsky was disdained in some circles;
his emotionalism was not the flavor of the times. Significantly,
several of the put-downs of Tchaikovsky's music cited during that
panel came from voices of the 1940s, like Wanda Landowska's barb
that Tchaikovsky ``cries louder than any suffering could justify.''
</P>
<P>
   But more recently, with the coming of neo-Romanticism in
contemporary music, and the cessation of hostilities between tonal
and atonal composers, Tchaikovsky has been viewed as a striking,
skillful and original master who can not be blamed for the
overexposure much of his music is subjected to. The best thing
about the Bard Festival is the way it found to present the music in
interesting programs that made you hear it afresh.
</P>
<P>
   That said, one could object that the philosophical, historical
and, especially, psychological contexts surroundings these works
were emphasized at the expense of strictly musical issues. For
example, on Sunday morning, in a lecture prior to a delightful
program of works written for children, all sorts of explanations
for Tchaikovsky's emotional attachment to children, and the idea of
childhood, were advanced _ for example, that as a tormented
homosexual, Tchaikovsky was entranced by the prepubescent innocence
of children.
</P>
<P>
   But could it not have been that Tchaikovsky the musician, much
like Bach, Schumann, Bartok and others, was simply interested in
the challenge, which it is, of writing music for children? Don't
most people simply like children? That certainly seemed true during
this concert of piano works performed entirely by talented
youngsters, several of them just 8 years old, and, most
interestingly, by Sarah and Susan Wang, 14-year-old twin sisters
who played an arrangement of ``The Nutcracker'' Suite for two
pianos. Their performance completely fulfilled the festival's goal
of making you hear familiar music freshly: take away the orchestral
colors from ``The Nutcracker'' and you hear what inventive, exotic,
structurally succinct music this is.

 ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y.: that is.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In terms of examining Tchaikovsky's works from a strictly
musical perspective, nothing during this past weekend was as
interesting as a topic raised by composer Richard Wilson during
Saturday morning's panel. Addressing the charge that Tchaikovsky's
music is flawed by a penchant for repetition, he contrasted
recordings of three sections of the last movement of the violin
concerto: In one, an older performance by Nathan Milstein, the
music was played with familiar cuts that were sanctioned by
violinist Leopold Auer, to whom the work was dedicated; in the
other, a recent recording by Maxim Vengerov, the original uncut
version was performed.
</P>
<P>
   This provoked a heated discussion: Are Tchaikovsky's repetitions
incantatory, relentless or just careless? The uncut version was
indisputably stronger: It made the asymmetries of the phrase
structure seem crazier, more startling. But it was a lively debate,
culminating with some psychobabble from musicologist Henry
Zajaczkowski, who, relating Tchaikovsky's rhythmic repetitions to
his homosexual distress, described the phenomenon as ``suppressive
compulsive release.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main musical events were the concerts by Botstein with
the Bard Festival Orchestra (essentially the American Symphony
Orchestra, which Botstein also directs). Botstein has strengths and
weaknesses as a conductor. Large-scale matters, like the overall
shape and sweep of a piece, are well attended to. But finer points
of nuance, balance, incisive rhythmic detail and careful phrasing
are lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the conditions he must work in are not ideal. These
musicians are excellent, but they cannot hear one another well in
this outdoor festival tent. And these formidable programs required
more preparation time for even a technical whiz of a conductor than
the limited amount available.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the programs were satisfying. It's not often that one has
a chance to hear Tchaikovsky's opera on Joan of Arc. Conceived
rather in the style of a French grand opera, the work is a bit
overblown and structurally messy, but it teems with musical ideas
and passion. Botstein assembled a strong cast of singers, mostly
from Russian companies, topped by Makvala Kasrashvili, who brought
her cool, gleaming soprano voice and fervor to the role of Joan, as
well as impressive soprano Oksana Krovytska, tenor Oleg Kulko and
baritone Vladimir Redkin in other roles.
</P>
<P>
   The final concert Sunday, titled ``Literature and Music,''
included three of Tchaikovsky's dramatic orchestra works inspired
by classic literary sources: ``The Tempest'' (Shakespeare),
``Francesca da Rimini'' (Dante) and the hourlong ``Manfred''
Symphony (Byron). This was a formidable program, and the
performances were inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the festival's emphasis on making literary connections
seemed out of proportion. Neither in any lecture nor the program
notes was it ever mentioned that, for example, in the final
movement of the ``Manfred'' Symphony there is a quite elaborate and
exciting episode in fugue, and that the work ends with a consoling
chorale. Surely, having these wholly musical matters pointed out
might have helped listeners to appreciate the greatness of this
work. There were times when one wished for a musician less
intellectually endowed but with the technical chops to arrive on
the scene and straighten up some things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an involving concert. Botstein and his players put
themselves out admirably, and the program, the whole festival in
fact, sent you home with vivid musical memories and much to think
about.

 &HT;    RUSSIA IN TURMOIL: WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0825.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin's unexpected
sacking of the government on Sunday -- the second time in five
months -- has once again focused the world's attention on the
former superpower and its wily, unpredictable president. A looming
financial crisis and potential political meltdown has Americans
once again asking what it all means. Cox Newspapers Washington
correspondent Eunice Moscoso put that and other questions to
Professor Harley Balzer, director of the Center for Eurasian,
Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What does Yeltsin's decision mean to the U.S.
politically, considering that many Western nations supported ousted
pro-reformist Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: On a whole range of issues that are the most important
things for us, it doesn't change very much. (Newly named -- and
former -- Prime Minister Viktor) Chernomyrdin had a good
relationship with (Vice President Al) Gore. There is a whole raft
of security issues, non-proliferation issues, environmental
agreements that I'm sure are still going to be major agenda items
at the summit, when Clinton goes over there next week. The problem
is that the United States and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
agreement to economic policies had been very much dependent on our
confidence in Kiriyenko, and this group of reformers, and that's
now up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does it mean for the U.S., militarily, considering
Russia's nuclear capability?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think it presents much of a military threat as long
as the country doesn't fall apart. Our worry is not that Russia is
going to attack us. Our worry is either that they are going to
support the bad guys -_ the Saddam Hussein's of the world -_
although it's not in their interest to go too far in that
direction. An even more serious threat would be if things really
get out of hand in Russia, if the economy gets even worse or if
central controls become even more lax then they already are. Then
we could see both hardware and personnel getting out of the
country, and that could be a very serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will recent events in Russia have economic consequences for
the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not on a national scale. There are individual companies, of
course, that are going to be affected by this. But remember that
the Russian economy is roughly the size of the Netherlands. We've
been getting this mirror-imaging of people reporting the Russian
stock index everyday as if it were the Dow Jones stock index. Less
than one percent of all Russians own stock, and the total
capitalization of the Russian stock market is only 1 or 2 percent
of the country's gross national product (GDP). It's not a
particularly significant economic indicator. It's a
misrepresentation. You don't have millions of Russians sitting
around everyday watching their stock market average, and thinking
that it affects them in any meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How concerned should the U.S. be that many of Russia's banks
could go bankrupt?
</P>
<P>
   A: That should concern us. First of all, it depends which banks.
I don't think that the Russian government is going to let the major
ones go. My concern with Chernomyrdin would be that he won't let
any of them go. There are a bunch of Russian banks that ought to
fail. There are way too many banks in Russia and a lot of them
aren't real banks. They are simply money-laundering operations . .
. that allow individuals to loot companies that they've privatized,
or they're a way that people can conduct financial manipulations
and pyramid schemes. A lot of them have been making bad loans that
they know are bad. They just assume the government will never allow
them to be called into account. Maybe (Chernomyrdin) is coming back
a changed man, but his policy previously was nobody gets hurt --
you support all of these idiotic, uneconomic practices because
after all, we have to protect the people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Russia isn't able to pay back several billion dollars it
owes to Western lenders, will that hurt the U.S. economy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the Western investors used this last ($22.6 billion)
IMF bailout to run for cover. I don't think there is any massive
exposure. Most of what they've borrowed at this point are IMF kind
of loans, and those are generally long-term. It's nothing compared
to what default in a European country or Japan would be for the
United States. The more serious concern is if there is significant
bank failure, and failure to payback loans, and that the contagion
could spread to other central European countries. If it becomes a
serious regional crisis, if it begins to affect Estonia, Poland,
Hungary, Czech Republic, than the Germans will start taking a
serious hit and that has ripple effects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens if the ruble drops even more, leading to severe
inflation and social unrest? A: That's not likely to happen
overnight. The real danger is probably somewhere three months to a
year away if inflation does build. It could produce political
instability. It doesn't have to, but it could.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will these events affect the upcoming summit between
Yeltsin and President Clinton? Will the economy be the main topic
of conversation?
</P>
<P>
   A: There isn't a whole lot they can do about the economics and
therefore, the non-proliferation and environmental issues are
likely to take center stage in their talks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it politically risky for Clinton to come to the summit
considering Yeltsin's condemnation last week of U.S. air strikes in
Afghanistan and Sudan?
</P>
<P>
   A: I read that more as ``my friend Bill didn't call me and talk
to me about it. Why weren't we included?'' They are much too
interested in good relations with us. Somebody will informally tell
the Clinton people that they're sorry -- that you really should
have warned us. I think they'll patch it over because it's in
everybody's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible that Clinton could be the U.S. president to
lose Russia back to the Communists?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think so -_ not back to the Communists. The
Communists are still the biggest party in the country because there
are no other parties. But Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party
leader, has not shown any inclination to make himself a social
democrat with a broader appeal. The Communists really seem to have
peaked at somewhere between 30 and 40 percent in a two-way race.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If it's not an economic force like, say Japan or Germany, why
is Russia so important to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because they still have between 10,000 and 20,000 nuclear
weapons. Because they occupy an enormous chunk of real estate in a
very dangerous neighborhood. Because they are the key to the
security and the successful economic and political transformation
of all the countries on their borders.
</P>
<P>
   And, because they're a country of 150 million people with one of
the better education systems in the world; and if they actually
could pull off a successful transition, it would take them a very
short period of time to become a net contributor to solving the
problems of the countries that are really in desperate
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be happening.

BIRMINGHAM SYMPHONY: CONDUCTOR'S FAREWELL IN MUSIC HE LOVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ Simon Rattle will soon come to the end of
his 18-year tenure as music director of the City of Birmingham
Symphony. The final concerts will, quite properly, be given in the
orchestra's hometown, for the audience that has supported this
remarkable partnership. As for the wider world, the farewells took
place at the Salzburg Festival over the weekend, with a performance
of Szymanowski's opera ``King Roger'' and the last concert in a
cycle of the Beethoven symphonies interlaced with contemporary
British music.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle has always been disinclined to play music he does not
love, and here he loved exuberantly. Szymanowski's score _ a grand
arabesque that evokes the opulence and sensuality of medieval
Sicily by piling Scriabin's yearning on top of Ravel's glitter,
Byzantine chanting and orientalism a la Russe _ belongs near the
center of one of the chambers of his capacious heart, and gained
from its place there. The three acts, given without intermission,
moved sinuously upward from climax to climax, bolstered by
exceptional playing from the Birmingham musicians: forthright,
lustrous, virtuoso. Languor and ornament were consistently vivified
by passion and drive.
</P>
<P>
   In the title role, Thomas Hampson was magnificent. As he came
onto the stage he was almost unrecognizable, already sunk into his
character, which, as he sang, became that of a monarch and a
lonely, fearful individual. Resolution and command were in his
voice along with hollowness and a sense of dread. Bearing
responsibility for that dread was the exciting erotic appeal
embodied in the singing of Elzbieta Smytka as Roger's queen,
Roxana, and of Ryszard Minkewicz as the Shepherd, who arrives in
Palermo spreading a new religion of abandonment to natural forces.
Ms. Smytka was radiant and sure in her hymns to the night;
Minkewicz had a thrilling and chilling wildness to him, a raw vocal
beauty. Excellent, too, were Philip Langridge as Roger's alter ego,
the supple, voluble Edrisi, and Robert Gierlach as the sonorous
Archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   But rarest of all was the vivid contribution made by the City of
Birmingham Symphony Chorus, both in ``King Roger'' on Sunday and in
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony the previous night. They made an
exciting sound: frank, strong, completely engaged. In the
Szymanowski they filled the set built into the Felsenreitschule for
Messiaen's ``Saint Francis'': adults right across the wide
platform, girls in the first act inside the skeleton of a wooden
cathedral to one side. In the Beethoven, given in the Grosses
Festspielhaus, they sang by heart, and fully from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Beethoven was altogether a revelation. Played with the
basses in a line above and behind the rest of the orchestra, it
stood on firm feet. It also had the benefits of the transparency
and engagement that have characterized the Birmingham orchestra's
association with Rattle: the transparency with which the
conductor's gestures and ideas are realized as sound, and the sense
of responsibility the conductor and all his fellow musicians exude,
of responsibility to one another, to the music, to the moment at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   With its thought herded and sweeping in zigzag strokes, the
performance was as far as possible from the traditional long-lined
approach, and the Ninth Symphony became vigorous, rough and young
again, its features fresh, right from the lovely, almost
vibrato-free cello pedal revealed near the start of the first
movement to the skyrocket of tone immediately before Willard White
dramatically enacted the bass' intervention in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Birtwistle's ``Triumph of Time'' thoroughly justified
being placed alongside one of music's noble monuments. With grainy
rocks of sound in its tutti sections and beautiful playing from
solo English horn, French horns and percussion, it was a monument
itself.

NEW ENERGY CHIEF SAYS GLOBAL WARMING SHOULD BE U.S. PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson vowed Monday to
focus the nation's attention on decreasing pollutants that are
blamed for global climate changes and the gradual warming of the
planet's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The former American ambassador to the United Nations, who took
over the Energy Department on Monday, said the agency had ``really
been outgunned'' in the push to reduce greenhouse gases. ``We have
to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The pledge to curb emissions comes in response to warnings from
some scientists that the increase in greenhouse gases is causing
global temperatures to slowly rise. Greenhouse gases are mostly
carbon dioxide and other pollutants that are released with the
burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
   These scientists fear that unless emissions are controlled, the
polar ice caps will melt, swamping coastal areas and many islands.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said one of his priorities as secretary would be to
keep Congress and the public informed by being ``the lead agency on
global climate change.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the United States signed the so-called Kyoto
Protocol, an international accord that would require industrial
nations to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping gases by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement faces opposition in Congress, where critics fear
it would be too taxing to American businesses. Opponents of the
protocol also want developing countries to be included in the
required cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a globe-trotting former representative from New
Mexico, replaced Federico Pena as energy secretary and is the
highest-ranking Hispanic in the government. He was confirmed by the
Senate on July 31 for the Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   In Richardson's new role, he will oversee a department that
concentrates on oil and gas production policies; energy technology;
scientific research for energy conservation; and the regulation of
nuclear power and waste.
</P>
<P>
   America's growing dependence upon foreign oil is also of
concern, Richardson said, and he said he wants to direct more
department resources toward reducing American dependence on fossil
fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old department should be ``committed to renewables
(and) alternative sources of energy,'' including solar energy and
wind power, Richardson added.
</P>
<P>
   There are many positive programs at work in the agency, he told
the packed Energy Department auditorium, but there are
``significant challenges,'' including the dangers of nuclear
proliferation and storage of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will wear dual hats as secretary and ambassador until
Richard Holbrooke replaces him at the United Nations in September,
he said.

   &UR; PHONES OVERTAKE CRIME IN RIO TOURIST POLL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After years of a combined effort by state and municipal police
to fight street violence in Rio de Janeiro, results are beginning
to show. Crime is down and tourism is up _ now telephones are the
biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll recently released by Embratur, Brazil's
government tourism agency, Rio's telephone system is the most
frequent source of visitor complaints. Filth, inefficient public
transportation and lack of tourist signs follow in that order.
</P>
<P>
   The poll surveyed foreign tourists at Rio's international
airport in 1997 over a four-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Street violence came in fifth, down from first in recent years.
Tourist officials attribute the drop in the crime rate _ 20 percent
in the last two years _ to a 24-hour police patrol in Copacabana,
Ipanema and Leblon, and a police station in Leblon specially
designated to attend to tourists who are victims of crime. They say
this may be the main reason for the steady growth of tourism in
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The number of foreign visitors jumped from 378,000 in 1993 to
1.1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one third of Rio's visitors are business travelers, for
whom the telephone is crucial. Connections often break off in
mid-conversation, crossed lines and static are common, getting a
dial tone can be a lengthy ordeal, and operators are often not
available.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation that service would improve after the
privatization last month of the state-owned telephone company,
Telebras, has quickly faded. Soon after the sale, a spokesman for
the Brazilian consortium that bought the Rio division said that
improvements should not be expected for at least two years.

Rockland, Me., has just opened its Center for the Wyeth Family in
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The new $10 million addition includes galleries in a converted
church and a study center and gallery in the new wing. They will
house 4,500 objects, including 75 major paintings and hundreds of
watercolors, drawings, photographs and archival materials, given by
Andrew and Betsy Wyeth, son and daughter-in-law of the American
illustrator N.C. Wyeth.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the area since the 1920s, N.C., Andrew and his son,
Jamie, have drawn on the rugged coastline, scenic islands, diverse
landscape and resilient residents of the area for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The Farnsworth's featured exhibition, through Nov. 8, is
``Wondrous Strange: Pyle, Wyeth, Wyeth and Wyeth,'' which uses 105
works to trace the influence of Howard Pyle, the illustrator who
was N.C.'s teacher, on N.C., Andrew and Jamie Wyeth. The exhibition
travels to the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Farnsworth is open daily through Oct. 12, after which it is
closed on Monday. Admission is $9, $8 for seniors, $5 for students
18 and older and free for children ($8, $7 and $4 after Oct. 12).

<P>
   &UR; A NEW HOTEL RISES NEXT TO OLD FAITHFUL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The new $19 million Old Faithful Snow Lodge in Yellowstone
National Park recently completed its first stage of construction,
and 52 of 100 planned guest rooms, along with the restaurant and
lounge, have opened.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the rustic style of early 20th century national park
lodges, the new lodge is a short walk from the Old Faithful geyser.
All the pine and cedar heavy timbers used in the construction were
recycled from older buildings. The lodge features exterior log
columns and a cedar shingle roof, hardwood floors and a two-story
lobby fireplace. All guest rooms in the new lodge have private
baths.
</P>
<P>
   The new lodge replaces a two-story motel-style building that was
built in the 1960s as a dormitory for park employees.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is expected to be completed next May, including 48
more guest rooms, another restaurant and a ski store.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Faithful Snow Lodge and the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel at
the north entrance are the only properties in Yellowstone open
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Double rooms at the Snow Lodge are $121 a night. The lodge is
operated by Amfac Parks and Resorts Company in Denver. Information
and reservations are available at (307) 344-7311 or
www.ynp-lodges.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 50-YEAR-OLD ENGLISH RACE COURSE REOPENS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous sports-car racing courses in the world,
Goodwood Motor Circuit near Chichester, England, will officially
reopen Sept. 18 to 20, looking much as it did when it made its
debut 50 years earlier _ right down to the cars and many of the
drivers of the era.
</P>
<P>
   In Goodwood's heyday, such legends as Jim Clark of Scotland and
Stirling Moss of England competed there. It held its first event on
Sept. 18, 1948, using the perimeter roads of a wartime air base,
and will now be used exclusively for exhibition races featuring
historic sports cars, motorcycles and Formula One cars from the
1950s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing danger that accompanied faster cars was one of
the reasons Goodwood was retired as an active track in the late
1960s. ( Moss crashed there in 1962, suffering injuries that forced
him to retire.) The 2.4-mile circuit was not modernized, but that
is now one of its charms: a chance to relive the days when bold
drivers raced Ferraris and Jaguars on tracks surrounded by hay
bales and cornfields (organizers plan to have cart horses finishing
the corn harvest within sight of the track, just as in the old
days).
</P>
<P>
   Along with flyovers by World War II Spitfires, one of the
weekend's highlights will be an exhibition race on Sept. 20
featuring Moss and the former world champions Phil Hill of the
United States and Sir Jack Brabham of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Advance-purchase tickets are $85 for the weekend, $17 Friday to
$34 Sunday; at the gate, it's $25.50 Friday to $59 Sunday. Call
(44-1243) 755055.
</P>
<P>
   The track is about 90 minutes south of London by car. It can be
reached by taking the A3 to Milford and the A283 to Petworth, then
the A285 to Halnaker, and following the signs from there.

<P>
   BECKET, Mass. _ The three dances presented by Jawole Willa Jo
Zollar's Urban Bush Women here on Sunday in the Doris Duke Studio
Theater at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival were a record of
public and private histories. That record began in the present,
looped back to the past and caught up with the present, with
extraordinary poignancy, humor and immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   The evening opened with ``Self-Portrait,'' created last year by
Ms. Zollar, Steven Kent and the dancers, with a text by Carl
Hancock Rux that was spoken by Ms. Zollar. ``Self-Portrait'' is a
tour de force on several levels. The dance chronicles a rehearsal,
an often unconvincing genre. ``Self-Portrait'' is also
simultaneously solemn and self-mocking, with a blessedly un-ironic
humor. Ms. Zollar, a famously demanding choreographer, takes a hard
but infectiously empathetic look at her behavior and how it can
affect even committed performers. And the Urban Bush Women are
committed, triple-threat performers who dance, sing and act with a
sometimes searing sense of truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The company moves on to the dancers' spiritual lives in
``Transitions,'' which ends with a group passage that suggests a
resolution of all that has come before. Maria Earle, majestically
imposing with an air of charming innocence, winds through the piece
like a motif, drawing the others along to music by Michael
Wimberly, the group's genial, coolly impassioned percussionist.
``Like Self-Portrait,'' the dance was created with Kent, a
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands Singing Song,'' the program's premiere, looks as if it
hasn't yet settled into itself entirely yet. But it quickly picks
up speed and authority as it examines the role of the hands in the
everyday lives and history of black Americans. ``Hands Singing
Song'' is set to a hymn by Bernice Johnson Reagon and instrumental
music by Wimberly that catches the mood of each section and even of
individual dancers with breathtaking simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Love's costumes similarly enhance the piece. And the
performances are powerful, especially those of Kristin McDonald, so
delicately sensual in the section ``My Female Hand,'' and Christine
King in ``Hands Singing Hallelujah.'' But this is ultimately Ms.
Zollar's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from an interview with the poet Abiodun Oyewole, she
creates a glancing portrait of black American culture and history.
Hands push at invisible boundaries, embrace and shove others away
and signal power, sometimes comically. Masturbation is explored in
the tastefully explicit and imaginatively staged ``My Female
Hand.'' Ms. King recalls the firm but gentle hands of her
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Hand to Fist'' manages to chronicle the social battles of
today and to sing of those often-forgotten battlers in a time when
the idealism of the 1960s seems lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   The litany is at times doctrinaire. But Ms. Zollar bravely steps
out of line, in a coolly dismissive era, as someone who has not
forgotten and who still believes in the possibility of change for
the better.
</P>
<P>
   J. Russell Sandifer designed the lighting. The choir robes were
by Stefani Mar. The company was completed by Diedre Nyota Dawkins,
Michelle Dorant, Francine Sheffield and Carolina Garcia, an
irresistibly cheerful, charging little dynamo.

MARINES FIND FAULT WITH DESIGN OF JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The joint strike fighter program, which is supposed
to produce a new aircraft that can be adapted for the Air Force,
Marines and Navy, has picked up new flak on its radar.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has told the defense titans competing to build
the aircraft _ Lockheed Martin and Boeing _ that current designs
are not satisfactory. The Marines Corps expects its version of the
plane to replace the AV-8B Harrier II, a fighter that can take off
and land vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Bruce Byrum, the Marines' assistant deputy chief of
staff for aviation, said the service has told both companies they
will have to do better to meet Marine goals for the Harrier
replacement, which is expected to become operational in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Byrum said the Marines want an aircraft that is lighter, has
more maneuverability and greater range and can carry more weapons
than the aircraft depicted in models and designs presented by the
two contractors.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Marines have been looking at the models that
Boeing and Lockheed are developing and that neither design meets
all the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some areas of concern which dealt with maneuverability,
range, stow (weapons storage) and, in particular, the vertical
landing capability,'' Byrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Hayden, a Lockheed spokeswoman in Fort Worth, said the
company was ``somewhat surprised'' by Byrum's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Lockheed has ``great faith'' in its JSF entry and
that the company believes its aircraft will be ``fully compliant''
with the needs of all three services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to remember that the design is still being refined,''
she said. ``There are some things that will be improved upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives declined to respond to phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Marines' problems could be a natural byproduct
of trying to produce three different aircraft from a common design.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lockheed and Boeing are still in the early stages of
developing all three fighters and have yet to produce prototypes
beyond so-called paper airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the strengths in our design,'' Hayden said. ``It
is flexible enough to accommodate the changes, rather than a fixed
design. Having dealt with the F-16 and over 110 variations of that
aircraft, we felt it important to do the same (develop a flexible
design) for the next multirole fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   All three variants of the fighters to be produced in the joint
strike fighter program will have distinctly different performance
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   But they are to be built from a common design and manufactured
on a single assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon contract for the planes is expected to be worth
more than $250 billion. The Pentagon will determine in 2001 which
firm will produce the fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin has said it intends to produce most of the plane
at its factory in west Fort Worth, so winning the contract is
considered essential for the long-term future of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also vital for the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts say that any problems in fielding a Harrier
replacement _ expected to cost $35 million per plane _ could
undermine the Marines' role in providing close air support for
forces on the ground. In turn, that could reduce the Marines'
overall role in military aviation.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, key lawmakers believe the services in the JSF
program must do everything possible to control costs because the
planes will come on line about the same time as the F-22 Raptor, a
21st century air-superiority fighter for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of a House National Security
Committee subcommittee that examines tactical aviation, said the
Marines recognize that the JSF program has to be carefully watched
for cost overruns, often caused by last-minute design changes.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the JSF may become the target of
Pentagon budget cutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marines are now facing up to the fact that you cannot do
three new tactical aviation programs with the current budget'' he
said. ``The last time I checked, we were doing $2.7 billion on
tac-air a year. The (General Accounting Office) said it would cost
$14 billion a year to build the programs the administration has on
the books. And that is within a defense budget that continues to
decrease at a dramatic rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has gone to the wall for the F/A-18E/F and they have
won,'' he added. ``The F-22 has already begun to develop its own
constituency. The joint strike fighter is basically out there as a
concept. Unfortunately, it is the only replacement the Marine Corps
has for the Harrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to buy about 2,000 of its JSF variant, which
will, like the F-16, perform as a multirole fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy will buy about 300 aircraft to fill its needs for a
strike aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines will use the Harrier replacement in close air
support, backing up troops in enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrier replacement is being designed to take off and land
vertically, or to take off and land more traditionally on runways.
It is intended to operate from land bases and naval vessels. It can
be used in a fighter or attack role and can escort helicopters,
conduct close combat air support and attack enemy ground-to-air
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Byrum said the Marines are compiling written requirements that
will explain to both contractors what performance standards they
want in the aircraft. If the plane doesn't meet those standards,
the Marines could look elsewhere to replace the Harrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have a lot of confidence that we will get to a
good solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important to us,'' he said. ``It would be hard for us
to walk away. We are dedicated to it. We see a lot of positive
aspects to the program, as far the three services are all partners,
as well as the U.K. The commonality of support will make it less
costly for us over the years. We do need a replacement for the
Harrier.''

SCANDALS HAVE PUT TRUTH TO THE TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATTHEW BRADY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two columnists from The Boston Globe resign under allegations of
fabricating stories. A major news network (CNN) and newsmagazine
(Time) jointly retract a story. The president of the United States
confesses on national television that he ``misled'' the American
people about his relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Truth, it seems, is taking a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is a sign of the times, calling President Clinton's
debacle simply a ``snapshot'' of decaying morality in America.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it is difficult to prove that society is less honest
now than before.
</P>
<P>
   Every decade has had its disgrace _ from the McCarthyism of the
1950s, the Pentagon Papers of the 1960s and Watergate in the 1970s
to the savings and loan and Iran-Contra scandals of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like easy answers,'' said Timothy E. O'Connell, professor of
pastoral studies at Loyola University in Chicago and author of
several books on ethics. ``I don't luxuriate in all the ambiguity,
but I think there is a lot of it there. If we ignore it, we betray
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little ambiguity surrounding Clinton's revelation. But
there is plenty of ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   People don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval rating dipped but remained high after the
admission, which creates a type of moral ambiguity. Does it matter
what he did? Should he be punished? How?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's between the God he and the woman he sleeps with,''
said Ervin Kingsbury, 61, an Arlington, Texas, resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say to him, `Bill, go to your wife, go to your
minister, straighten these things out and then, in the words of
Christ, I would say, `Go, sin no more,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others would like to tell Clinton, ``Go, and don't come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Eppstein, a political consultant based in Fort Worth, said
that out of respect for the country and the office, Clinton should
resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has done is disgrace the office, the highest office in
our country. Then he lied about it. Now, what we are seeing is the
cover-up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eppstein praised the example of former Speaker of the House Jim
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in allegations of ethics violations regarding profits from
a book he had written, Wright resigned as speaker in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who is now a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
wrote later that he could have disproved the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at what cost to the institution, the country and the
well-being of my family?'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Eppstein said that Clinton's refusal to resign is a ``selfish
act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton cares more about himself than he does about the
United States of America,'' Eppstein said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he is not worried about Clinton dragging down the
American public or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It has weathered numerous indiscretions by other presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But he is concerned about the influence of the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, I don't know that anybody is going to be
terribly anxious to imitate Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more nervous about them imitating all the pundits and
commentators, who all look well-scrubbed but who are also
manipulative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of The Boston Globe columnists Patricia Smith
and Mike Barnicle, plus the retraction of a story by Time and CNN
about the use of the nerve gas sarin during the Vietnam War haven't
helped the media's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media's agenda is an interesting hour,'' O'Connell said.
``They want controversy. In a certain sense, Jerry Springer just
does it more blatantly than `Meet the Press.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell recalled the time he was asked to sit on a panel for a
Chicago TV program. The topic was abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He was to be the virulent Catholic anti-abortionist. A
Protestant was to provide an opposing viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 minutes into the program, the two ``opponents'' ended up
agreeing on the basic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers were furious,'' he said. ``Their agenda is not
evil, but their agenda is to catch stuff, to give it clarity, to
create controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes media harmful is the lack of counteractive forces in
people's lives, O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient days, people would stand in the village square and
listen to village news or proclamations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were standing together and they could elbow each other
and say, `That's baloney' or `What do you think about that?,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   People got the ``top down'' communication and at the same time
``lateral assessment'' communication, O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lateral communication has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit one by one in our living rooms. If I don't agree with
the person on TV, my first instinct is to presume I'm wrong, and I
don't have anybody to check it with,'' he said. ``We are not all
sitting around the same bonfire anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice for Americans is to seek a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about what you read,'' O'Connell said. ``Talk about what
you see. We are never going to undo the media. It's done.''

U.S. TO AUCTION BILLS AND 2-YEAR NOTE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities were mixed Monday, with the price
of the 30-year bond down for the first time in four days as the
dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar declined amid speculation that the Japanese
government was ready to take action in the currency market when
necessary to bolster the value of the yen by selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A weak dollar would make dollar-denominated investments like
U.S. government securities less attractive to foreign investors,
who have been supporting the recent rally in the bond market by
seeking the safety of bonds as stock markets overseas tumble.
Foreign investors also hope to gain when they convert their dollar
returns to other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond was down 14/32, to 100 19/32. The yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.46
percent, from 5.43 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders point out that with yields at historic lows, it is
becoming harder to get investors to buy Treasury securities. Buying
is not expected to increase until investors get more signs of
sustained weakness in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in bond pricing Monday was the turbulence in the
stock market, which has been a leading factor in the decline of
nearly a quarter of a percentage point in bond yields in the last
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca
Raton, Fla., described the market environment as not for the faint
hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are seeing and getting inverse reactions to the stock
market _ when stocks go up, the bond market goes down; when stocks
go down, bonds go up,'' he said. ``I believe we are fully priced,
so the only impetus at this juncture would be if we had a further
flight to quality by investors thinking the stock market will get
hammered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are pretty much in a trading range, and with
global events so compelling, I doubt any one of this week's
economic reports will have much of an impact on prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The market will get reports Tuesday on consumer confidence in
August and existing-home sales in July. On Wednesday, durable goods
orders for July will be announced, and personal income figures for
July will be released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, in when-issued trading ahead of Wednesday's $15
billion auction of two-year Treasury notes, the securities are
being offered at a price to yield 5.19 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's 60 million Roman Catholics continue to be
embarrassed by revelations of priests accused of sexual abuse of
minors. But despite major efforts by U.S. Catholic bishops to
address the problem, it doesn't seem to be going away.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the furor died down this summer over a Dallas case in
which a jury awarded $30.9 million to 11 men sexually abused as
boys by a priest, reports surfaced that a former Fort Worth priest
had been accused of sexual misconduct in his native state of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The dark shadow of sex abuse reached into four small parishes
west of Fort Worth on Aug. 16 when the weekly sermon was replaced
with pleas to parishioners to report any known sexual abuse by the
former Fort Worth priest, the Rev. Thomas Teczar.
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes in the past five years have provided a wake-up
call for the nation's 300 Catholic bishops, said Sister Mary Ann
Walsh of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, bishops dealt with this like it was a moral
failing; now they realize it is a mental illness,'' said Walsh, a
spokeswoman for U.S. bishops.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Walsh said, an accused priest would confess his
sins, go off to a retreat and engage in serious prayer, and the
bishop thought he would be fit to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they realize there is a high danger of recidivism in the
cases of sexual abuse,'' Walsh said. ``It is very difficult to get
a re-assignment if a priest is found to have had a serious
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Joseph P. Delaney said the Fort Worth diocese is part of
the movement to be more diligent in dealing with sexual abuse
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prided ourselves during the last several years in
responding very forthrightly to any hint of any kind of
impropriety,'' he said at a recent news conference about Teczar.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth diocese officials had not received any complaints
related to Teczar by late last week. Reports can be made by calling
the Catholic Center at (817) 560-3300.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of priests sexually abusing children began making
headlines more than a decade ago. The Chicago-based Survivors
Network of Persons Abused by Priests (SNAP) estimates from various
sources that more than 800 men have been removed from priestly
duties in the past 10 years because of sex abuse complaints.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-billion dollars has been paid in civil
judgments, out-of-court settlements and attorneys fees, the
organization estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Frank Maniscalco, a spokesman for U.S. Catholic
bishops, said the church's calculation is similar. From anecdotal
evidence, it estimates that about 1,000 priests have been accused
of child sex abuse in the past decade. That is 1 percent of the
100,000 U.S. clergy who served during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Catholic bishops, Maniscalco said, have been dealing
forthrightly with the t2K+V- &QC; U!
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations call for: responding quickly to
allegations; removing the suspected offender from ministerial
duties; reporting the violation to civil authorities; cooperating
with the investigation; reaching out to victims and their families
and making the matter public while respecting privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth diocese had to deal with the issue again recently
after published reports that Delaney accepted Teczar into the
diocese 10 years ago, even though the priest's Massachusetts
diocese had suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said that in retrospect, he regrets accepting Teczar,
who served in the Fort Worth diocese from 1988 to 1993. No
accusations of sexual abuse were made against Teczar while he was
in North Texas. Delaney said he did not know of several past
accusations that had been made in Teczar's home diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Teczar lives in Dudley, Mass., and has been on administrative
leave from duties as a priest since he left Texas. He faces a civil
suit in Massachusetts filed by David Lewcon, 44, who contends that
Teczar sexually abused him repeatedly in 1971 and 1972 when Teczar
was assigned to St. Mary's Church in Uxbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Teczar and his attorney did not respond Friday to messages left
on their telephone answering systems.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said he had received some good recommendations about
Teczar before accepting him, but he also knew that the priest had
gone through a year of therapy after church authorities
investigated a complaint that he had provided alcohol to a youth in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, two years after Teczar came to Texas, Delaney said, he
learned from Massachusetts church authorities that Teczar had been
charged and convicted of a misdemeanor concerning the alcohol
complaint. The victim also accused Teczar of seeking sexual favors
in the alcohol incident, Delaney said, but Teczar denied it and no
sex abuse charges were brought.
</P>
<P>
   Stricter guidelines adopted by the 28-county Diocese of Fort
Worth in the past five years require incoming priests to go through
extensive psychological screening and serve as associate pastors
before getting a permanent position.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the diocese's 105 priests come from within the diocese
or from worldwide missionary orders such as the Franciscans, who
come with high recommendations from their superiors, Delaney said.
The missionary priests are also carefully screened, the bishop
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, the U.S. bishops' spokeswoman, said Catholic bishops who
accept or recommend priests for an assignment have tough judgments
to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bishop may review a priest's record carefully, but nothing
is 100 &LR; %HW.cent,'' she said. ``It is just like a doctor who tells
you that you are in good health, and then you die of a heart attack
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishops also have a problem in being open about sexual abuse
complaints, she said, because many victims don't want such matters
to become public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting the victim is the first concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Jenkins, author of the book ``Pedophiles and Priests:
Anatomy of a Contemporary Crisis,'' said sex abuse of minors is a
problem in all church groups. But it gets more attention in the
Catholic Church because of the church's high profile and because
priests are unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the problem of sex abuse is related to the
church's system of mandatory celibacy, although church authorities
strongly dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the church hierarchy will even concede that there is
a problem with celibacy,'' said Jason Berry of New Orleans, author
of ``Lead Us Not Into Temptation: Catholic Priests and the Sexual
Abuse of Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Church authorities often cite studies indicating that most cases
of child sexual abuse occur within heterosexual families, Berry
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that celibacy does not cause men to molest children
any more than marriage can be blamed for incest,'' Berry said.
``But celibacy creates a climate of sexual denial that can
contribute to sexual abuse.''

 &HT;    Late-game heroics by Lopez, Jones gives Atlanta win over L.A.
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If good teams are determined by winning games they
should have lost, the Atlanta Braves must be pretty high in
baseball's pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won a game they should have lost on Monday. For the
seventh time this season, Atlanta won after trailing in the eighth
inning, a neat trick that concluded a 5-2 homestand and sent the
woebegone Los Angeles Dodgers home to wonder why they ever left.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez and Andruw Jones beat L.A. 4-3 with back-to-back
homers off closer Jeff Shaw, who has blown six saves this season
but surely not one like this.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Braves tackle the final challenge remaining on the
schedule, a five-game run during the next nine days with the NL
Central-leading Houston Astros, another possible playoff opponent
who hosts Atlanta tonight for a two-game set.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're packing them in down there now,'' manager Bobby Cox
said, ``and then, of course, they got the (Mark) McGwire thing
going on in St. Louis (where the Braves go for a weekend series).
So it's going to be a fun trip.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard to top the 10-minute trip that was Monday's
eighth-inning, when Tom Glavine watched his shutout blown on a Gary
Sheffield RBI single and Eric Karros' two-run homer. L.A. lefty
Brian Bohanon had held the Braves to just five singles, and his 3-0
lead looked padlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't real happy with the turn of the events, and I was
pretty much sitting there counting on getting a loss,'' said
Glavine, who improved to 17-5. ``But the guys turned it around with
a huge eighth inning. For me, you go through the full spectrum of
emotion, but for the team, this is a great win.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bohanon issued a one-out walk, Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman brought in Shaw, who has posted a 1.61 ERA since coming to
L.A. from Cincinnati. The move was not an entirely successful one.
Andres Galarraga singled on the first pitch to put two men on, and
two pitches later, Lopez broke up a 4-for-27 slide with his 26th
homer, the 100th of his career, to tie the game, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw him in L.A, and he handled us pretty good over there,''
Lopez said. ``You figure one day is for you, and the next day has
got to be for us. He made some pitches that I believe were
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had to work for his, fouling off five pitches before Shaw
threw an inside fastball that he pulled for his 22nd homer and his
second in two games. Jones finished the homestand 11-for-27 (.407)
with nine runs scored and a pair of stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been putting the ball in play,'' Jones said. ``No matter
where the pitch is, inside or down the middle, there's a way to put
it play. If it comes to my strength, I'm going to go ahead and use
my power.''

 &HT;    Maryland: Slight hope for improvement _ but not much
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ Maryland coach Ron Vanderlinden compares his
Maryland football team to a 1969 Chevrolet Impala once owned by his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a car with no power steering, no power brakes and no
power period,'' the second-year coach said. ``It was a chore to
drive, and I think our Maryland program is like that. But there
will come a time when we'll become an automatic and have power, and
all the coaching staff will have to do is steer it and give it
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   O.K., so the former Northwestern assistant would probably flunk
Analogy 101, but it's tough to find something to say about a team
that finished 2-9 last season and probably was even worse than its
record.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderlinden is the coach who was introduced at halftime of a
December Maryland basketball game after his hiring in 1996 and
promised the 14,500 in attendance that they wouldn't be spending
any more Christmas holidays at home, that they'd be going to bowl
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that the talent level wasn't a little
higher,'' Vanderlinden said about his first Terp team. ``I was
surprised how good this conference was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terps could be better this year, although probably not by
much. The positives include linebackers Kendall Ogle and Eric
Barton, who finished No. 2 and No. 3 in the ACC in tackles last
year, and tailback LaMont Jordan, who gained 689 yards as a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The negatives include a group of seven quarterbacks, none with
have any appreciable experience; an offensive unit with only one
senior; a defensive line that returns only one starter; and a
secondary green in three of four spots.
</P>
<P>
   But don't suggest to Vanderlinden that this might be a
rebuilding year. ``I'm going to play the best players, and I'm
going to do my damnedest to win every game,'' he said. ``I realize
where we're at in terms of mental attitude and the problems we have
to overcome, but I'll be doggone if I'm going to write off the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps junior quarterback Ken Mastrole can answer the
quarterback questions. The 6-3, 225-pound junior has ``distanced
himself from the pack,'' Vanderlinden said. Mastrole played in
seven games in '97 and hit seven of 19 passes for 83 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Terps lone senior offensive lineman, 6-7, 299-pound John
Feugill, promises that Maryland will be better up front. ``Our
offensive line last year, we had five individuals,'' Feugill said.
``There was no chemistry there. When things went wrong, there was
nothing said. The team has a new attitude this year. The offense is
so much more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may be the Terps' ace in the hole. The 5-11, 214-pounder
has the talent to be one of the ACC's best, especially for a guy
who doesn't like to get hit. ``I hate contact,'' Jordan says.
''People ask me, 'Why are you playing running back,' and I tell
them I have no idea. I think because I don't like contact it's made
me a better player. I try to avoid it, but when it's inevitable, I
like to give it instead of taking it. We're going to be better. . .
. I've seen holes in practice I've never seen before. You can tell
if your offensive line is jelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's strong point last year might be its undoing this
time. The defense is inexperienced and lacks depth. ``This league
is defense-oriented,'' linebacker Barton said. ``I've never seen
bigger people run faster than in this conference.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly why the Terps might be in for an exceptionally
long year.
</P>

 &HT;    Inside Pro Tennis: Atlanta bypassed by big names
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anna Kournikova and Steffi Graf were to make their
Atlanta debuts this week. Instead, the two superstars are playing
in the Pilot Pen International Women's Championships in New Haven,
Conn. That's the tournament formerly known as the U.S. Women's
Hardcourt Championships, the flop that was supposed to be Atlanta's
regular stop on the Corel WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's tournament, which returned women's pro tennis to
Atlanta for the first time in 14 years, was an attendance bust at
Stone Mountain Park, with only two sessions _ Monica Seles' one and
only match and the Lindsay Davenport-Sandrine Testud final _
attracting more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big loss for the city of Atlanta, particularly with
the depth and quality of women's players today,'' said Sheila
Cronkright, the executive director of the Georgia Tennis
Association. She also winced at the lost prospect of Kournikova
playing Graf in a quarterfinal here Thursday night. ``That would've
been huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a four-year contract with the USTA and Stone Mountain,
the local group that managed the event, International Sports and
Entertainment Strategies (ISES), requested out of the lease. The
USTA granted the request because Butch Buchholtz, owner of the
Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Fla., and one of the game's
top promoters, was pitching to take the U.S. Open warm-up to
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilot Pen, which began Monday with Kournikova as the evening
attraction, has three things the U.S. Women's Hardcourts didn't
have: a title sponsor, clever marketing and low ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   For $125, a fan can see every match this week through the final.
For $15 Monday, spectators were entitled to half the first round,
matches that included Kournikova, Mary Joe Fernandez and Amanda
Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
   At the USTA Women's Hardcourts, ticket prices averaged $10 more
per ticket and granted admission to only half as many matches.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras mulling Davis Cup
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras says he'll decide by next week if he'll play in
next month's Davis Cup semifinal against Italy in Indianapolis.
Andre Agassi won't play. Sampras skipped the first two rounds this
year for the second-straight year. If Sampras says no, captain Tom
Gullikson probably would go with Vince Spadea, who's up to a
career-high No. 42 after beating Agassi and Richard Krajicek
earlier this month. Loyalty to the team and past heroics will keep
Jim Courier in the lineup, although his ranking is No. 68.
</P>
<P>
   This week in tennis history
</P>
<P>
   This week is the 25th anniversary of the first computer rankings
in men's professional tennis. Ilie Nastase was the first No. 1
player and kept the spot for 40 weeks before John Newcombe
supplanted him. After Newcombe's eight-week reign ended on July 29,
1974, Jimmy Connors held No. 1 for 160 weeks consecutively, still a
record. There have been 100 top-10 players from 25 countries,
including Atlanta residents Mikael Pernfors and Tom Gorman, who
each peaked at No. 10. Only 14 players have been No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis on TV
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net will televise the ATP Tour's Hamlet Cup from Long
Island on Saturday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. (semifinals) and Sunday at
2 p.m. (final). Marcelo Rios and Patrick Rafter are the top seeds.
Best potential early match is Rafter against Goran Ivanisevic in
the quarters. ... CBS will televise Saturday's 2 p.m. final of the
Pilot Pen women's tournament. Top seeds are Davenport and Jana
Novotna. Best potential early match is Kournikova versus Graf in
the quarterfinals. ... Luke and Murphy Jensen will host the second
episode of Topspin, the USTA's new tennis show targeted at a young
audience. It airs Sunday at 1:30 on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Loose points
</P>
<P>
   Sampras on his second-round defeat by Leander Paes last week:
``Playing three weeks in a row has taken its toll emotionally.''
... Seles on winning the du Maurier Open: ``I've played
five-straight weeks, and I'm worn down. I'll arrange my schedule
next year so that won't happen again (leading up to the U.S.
Open).'' ... Rios on losing in the third round in Indianapolis to
Byron Black: ``I was playing so bad I never felt I was going to
win.'' ... Graf on losing to Magui Serna in the third round in
Montreal: ``I have no consistency in my game at all right now.''
... Martina Hingis hasn't won a tournament since the Italian Open
in early May. ... Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who's fallen out of the top
10, withdrew from the Long Island event this week and doesn't sound
up to the U.S. Open, either. Last week in New Haven, Russia's
all-time top player noted that he plays more matches than anyone
else on the ATP Tour and said, ``I'm burned out. ... I have no
motivation to go on right now.''

SEXUAL ABUSE LEGACY PLAGUES U.S. BISHOPS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's 60 million Roman Catholics continue to be
embarrassed by revelations of priests accused of sexual abuse of
minors. But despite major efforts by U.S. Catholic bishops to
address the problem, it doesn't seem to be going away.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the furor died down this summer over a Dallas case in
which a jury awarded $30.9 million to 11 men sexually abused as
boys by a priest, reports surfaced that a former Fort Worth priest
had been accused of sexual misconduct in his native state of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The dark shadow of sex abuse reached into four small parishes
west of Fort Worth on Aug. 16 when the weekly sermon was replaced
with pleas to parishioners to report any known sexual abuse by the
former Fort Worth priest, the Rev. Thomas Teczar.
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes in the past five years have provided a wake-up
call for the nation's 300 Catholic bishops, said Sister Mary Ann
Walsh of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, bishops dealt with this like it was a moral
failing; now they realize it is a mental illness,'' said Walsh, a
spokeswoman for U.S. bishops.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Walsh said, an accused priest would confess his
sins, go off to a retreat and engage in serious prayer, and the
bishop thought he would be fit to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they realize there is a high danger of recidivism in the
cases of sexual abuse,'' Walsh said. ``It is very difficult to get
a re-assignment if a priest is found to have had a serious
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Joseph P. Delaney said the Fort Worth diocese is part of
the movement to be more diligent in dealing with sexual abuse
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prided ourselves during the last several years in
responding very forthrightly to any hint of any kind of
impropriety,'' he said at a recent news conference about Teczar.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth diocese officials had not received any complaints
related to Teczar by late last week. Reports can be made by calling
the Catholic Center at (817) 560-3300.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of priests sexually abusing children began making
headlines more than a decade ago. The Chicago-based Survivors
Network of Persons Abused by Priests (SNAP) estimates from various
sources that more than 800 men have been removed from priestly
duties in the past 10 years because of sex abuse complaints.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-billion dollars has been paid in civil
judgments, out-of-court settlements and attorneys fees, the
organization estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Frank Maniscalco, a spokesman for U.S. Catholic
bishops, said the church's calculation is similar. From anecdotal
evidence, it estimates that about 1,000 priests have been accused
of child sex abuse in the past decade. That is 1 percent of the
100,000 U.S. clergy who served during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Catholic bishops, Maniscalco said, have been dealing
forthrightly with the problem through educational programs and
special task forces that have recommended prompt action against sex
offenders among the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops have also made it harder for priests with records of
sexual abuse to move from diocese to diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fort Worth diocese spokesman Jeff Hensley said the
diocese is increasingly wary of accepting priests from other
dioceses and very few such transfers are made now. Applicants must
have an unqualified recommendation from their bishop attesting to
their good character and lack of any record of wrongdoing,
including sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for victims of sex abuse are skeptical _ if not
cynical _ about the bishops' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all window dressing,'' said David Clohessy, national
director of the Survivors Network, who says he was abused by a
priest.
</P>
<P>
   Most bishops, he contends, are still trying to protect fellow
clergy and the church's image by bringing problems to light only
when backed into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spent ... more energy on the problem in recent
years,'' said Clohessy. ``But their focus is on damage control and
maintaining secrecy rather than preventing abuse and healing of
those abused.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``As long as that remains their priority, you are
going to hear about case after case after case.''
</P>
<P>
   Maniscalco said the problems keep arising because victims are
periodically coming forward to report sex abuse that occurred many
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing catch-up in dealing with 30 years of cases,''
he said. ``I don't know what more the bishops can do to address
this.''
</P>
<P>
   All 194 dioceses in the United States now have strict policies
dealing with sex abuse, partially based on recommended guidelines
from a Bishops' Ad Hoc Committee on Sex Abuse established in 1993
to help them deal with the problem.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ Russia's political and economic chaos
marks the beginning of the end for Boris Yeltsin, analysts said
Monday. The Russian president also said as much in televised
remarks Monday when he suggested that acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin may be the best candidate to succeed him when his
presidential term expires in 2000. Yeltsin's political obituary has
been written and erased before. But Yeltsin's abrupt firing of the

beyond the wily president's control. An analysis. (Holmes, Cox News

OWNER'S DISORGANIZED SON-IN-LAW CAUSES CHAOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I report to the vice president of the company.
He is creative and intelligent, but totally unorganized. Several of
us always have to scramble to complete projects that he delegates
at the last minute. Unfortunately, he is the owner's son-in-law. Do
you have any suggestions? M.R.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no management guideline allowing owners' sons-in-law
to be totally unorganized. In reality, many owners are not exactly
ecstatic when their employed relatives throw the support staff into
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Your working relationship with the vice president will obviously
influence the approach that you take in this situation, but
regardless, the only way to deal with this matter is to discuss it
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the family ties, it is important to note that the
vice president's style is not highly atypical of creative people,
as they often tend to be rather uninterested in plans and
schedules. During a noncrisis period, you and several of your
associates should meet with the vice president and indicate that
you have some ideas to help the department work more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Give him specific examples of projects that could have been
handled more successfully if there had been more planning and
advance notice. You can even provide him with information on some
of the user-friendly day-timing and scheduling systems that are
available. Some actually have a creative flair, and these should be
particularly appealing to him.
</P>
<P>
   If the company owner has any interest in increasing the
likelihood of putting success in succession planning, this can be a
very important step.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I thought I was in line to be promoted into a management
position, and I was shocked when the promotion went to one of the
most incompetent people in our department. My manager said it was a
hard decision, but there will be other opportunities in the future
and I should ``stick around.'' What do you think? S.T. &QL; 
A. Being advised by management to ``stick around'' is not exactly
useful data when it comes to career planning. The fact is that you
expected a promotion, and management decided that someone else was
more qualified. Management can tell you anything about the
promotion possibilities, but nothing speaks louder than the
decisions they make.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the job went to a person who is less competent, but this
person may be more competent than you think. After all, he or she
is certainly competent when it comes to knowing how to get
promoted.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you should consider having a candid career-related
discussion with your manager, focusing specifically on your
near-term and longer-term objectives, and the realistic
opportunities that exist within the company. If there are growth
plans, educational programs, varied internal career paths, it may
be worthwhile to ``stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there should be some timetables associated with this.
After all, having benchmark dates is an important aspect of
goal-setting. If the message continues to be to ``stick around,''
be careful or you may get stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will soon be looking for work. I am a hard worker, and I
have good references. I get terrible headaches when I am around
people who wear perfume, scented powders, etc. At my last job,
everyone agreed not to wear scents and it worked just fine, but I
had to quit the previous job because of headaches from the
perfumes. Should I tell a prospective employer about this when I am
applying or after an offer has been made? A.C. &QL; 
A. If the first words out of your mouth are that you cannot work in
environments where people wear scents, that will not make much
sense. Although employers are expected to make reasonable
accommodations in these situations, such an approach may still hurt
your chances of obtaining the job before you have had any chance at
all. At the same time, this does not mean that you should conceal
this type of disability.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, you should bring it out when the employer asks you if
there are any factors that can interfere with your ability to
handle the work during the required work hours, or as a response to
an open-ended question in which you are describing your work style
or job objectives.
</P>
<P>
   At such a point in the screening process, the employer will
already know that you are a hard worker with solid references. You
can also mention the kinds of reasonable accommodations that
previous employers have made to help you be fully productive.
</P>
<P>
   In this tight labor market, it is difficult to find excellent
employees. Having the troops show real restraint when applying
colognes and powders is not too high a price to pay. In fact, many
employees would probably regard this change as a breath of fresh
air.

FRIENDS, ASSOCIATES SAY BIN LADEN FAMILY SPURNED TERROR SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUZANNE HOHOLIK and TRAVIS E. POLING  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Terror suspect Osama bin Laden had an older
half-brother who lived and worked in Central Texas until his death
in a 1988 ultralight aircraft crash.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates of Salem bin Laden say his family
disowned Osama bin Laden as the younger man's politics and world
view turned militantly anti-American. While other family members
cultivated ties to the United States, the radical son took a
different path.
</P>
<P>
   Salem bin Laden was the eldest son of a wealthy Saudi Arabian
businessman who amassed his fortune in the construction business.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Salem bin Laden's love of flying was transformed into
another business venture, Binladen Aviation, which was incorporated
in Austin and was dissolved shortly after his death at 42. His
connection to Texas began in 1973 when the young Saudi Arabian
businessman came seeking a pilot for the family airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Auerbach worked for Salem bin Laden for years, first as a
private pilot in Saudi Arabia and later as an aviation manager for
his company in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was great. He always treated me well,'' Auerbach said. ``In
fact, I was probably a father figure to him. He was very kind and
always took care of me. He came over here all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach said he never met Osama bin Laden, who is accused by
the United States of financing terrorist activities, including the
recent bombings of two American embassies in Africa. Last week,
President Clinton ordered retaliatory missile strikes against
targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan associated with Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   As Osama bin Laden became a player in the world of radical
Islamic fundamentalism, Salem and the rest of the bin Laden family
``disowned'' and refused to talk to him, Auerbach was told.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment of the family rift was echoed by Charles
Schwartz, a Houston lawyer who represented the bin Laden estate in
a 1991 lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio attorney Wayne Fagan represented Salem from 1982
until his death in 1988. He said Osama always was considered the
``black sheep of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard all of this, it just made me sick,'' Fagan said,
referring to the allegations that Osama bin Laden was linked to the
embassy bombings. ``Salem, God bless him, is turning over in his
grave. The family, they agonized over (Osama bin Laden) and outcast
him from the family since the early '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach's links to the bin Laden family have faded, but he
fondly recalls how he went to work for the head of the family,
Muhammad bin Laden, then Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach worked in Saudi Arabia as a contract pilot with Trans
World Airlines in the 1960s, when he was hired to fly the elder bin
Laden's private plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father had bought an airplane and used it in the
business,'' he said. ``He contracted with the airlines ... they had
hired a pilot and he didn't show up, so I filled in.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad died in an aircraft crash in 1967. It wasn't until 1973
that the family was able to buy another plane. That's when Salem,
the eldest of 20 sons, went looking for a pilot, Auerbach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to the States and found me because I had flown for his
father,'' Auerbach said. ``He came here to find me and took me back
to Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said the bin Laden family is very respected
internationally and Salem worked hard to earn that reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very carefree and a very fun-loving person, truly a man
of the world,'' he said. ``He was highly respected in Saudi Arabia
and so is his family.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Although he doesn't have that much in common
with Batman's Mr. Freeze, Gary Crabtree also would like the world
to ``chill out.''
</P>
<P>
   At times his Kansas City-based company, Techspec Inc., probably
is the c-c-coldest spot around. Using cryogenics, Techspec
deep-freezes all kinds of items to improve their performance. After
a treatment, golf balls sail farther, race-car engines drive longer
and brass instruments sound a little sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Cryogenics is a space-age technique that freezes items to
extremely low temperatures, changing their molecular structure,
said Crabtree, a metallurgist.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Crabtree's advertisements say: ``If you can ride it, run
it, sharpen it or wear it out,'' his company can improve it. He has
even treated wafers of metal, smaller than a period at the end of
this sentence, that were used in the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had people tell us that they've actually frozen top
designer clothes ... and that those clothes stayed cleaner longer
and don't wrinkle as easy,'' Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   Even everyday items such as pantyhose and flags last longer
after treatment, Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results of cryogenics sound amazing on paper,
musician George Robinson could literally hear the difference after
his trumpet was frozen a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard about the process when I was at a jam
session...,'' he said. Crabtree told him it would improve the sound
of his horn. ``It did.''
</P>
<P>
   After his horn was treated cryogenically, Robinson said it
played brighter, fuller and rounder and improved the action on its
valves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't want to tell anyone at first,'' he said. ``I
wanted everybody to think it was just me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the public is familiar with Hollywood's version of
cryogenics, freezing humans has not yet advanced to where they can
be brought back to life. Embryos, however, are being successfully
frozen.
</P>
<P>
   For metal or plastic materials, cryogenics can make them
stronger and more wear-resistant, Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree took an early retirement after working 31 years for the
Department of Energy at Allied Signal so he could open his own
business. Techspec is Kansas City's first on-site cryogenics
company, opening in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start my company because I felt like I had a mission
to make materials more useful in the everyday world,'' Crabtree
said. ``We can make them better, so why don't we? ... And, you
know, it feels really good to tell a business that you can save
them a lot of money, then prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the folks at Atchison Casting of Atchison,
Kan. They were skeptical at first, Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   That company uses metallic rotors to bite into steel. After just
seven cuts, the teeth of the rotors become dull and chipped,
requiring the rotors to be removed, resharpened or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   After deep-freezing, the rotors last 21 cuts and the rotor teeth
stay perfect, said Tom Wilson, quality control supervisor for
Atchison Casting. ``It's a $5 investment for big labor-saving
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Atchison Casting has saved almost $25,000 this year, just by
freezing the fist-sized rotors.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in freezing an item is to place it inside of the
cryo-processor, a coffin-sized freezer. Connected to it is a
6-foot-tall silver tank, filled with 800 pounds of liquid nitrogen.
The cryo-processor is large enough to accommodate two car engines
or several smaller items. Often the process is done with batches of
items.
</P>
<P>
   First everything is chilled mechanically to minus 100 degrees
Fahrenheit. (By contrast, a home refrigerator chills food to about
minus 34 degrees.) Next the liquid nitrogen mists the items in a
dry, white fog, chilling them one degree at a time. Every step is
controlled by a computer that reads out the numbers in red digital
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature drops one degree per minute. With each degree,
the metal contracts. Microscopic bumps and ridges disappear.
Metallic strength increases. Any stresses that were in the metal
are now in the process of becoming uniform and equal.
</P>
<P>
   After 8 1/2 hours the temperature reaches minus 312 degrees. The
items are kept at this temperature for a minimum of 20 hours, then
thawed out at the same controlled rate back to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The entire process, a one-time procedure, takes a little more
than two days. Prices vary: Scissors, $2.50; golf clubs, $12.50
each; baseball bat, $25; trumpet, $79.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is working on a standardization so that we can
keep unscrupulous folks from using smoke and mirrors,'' Crabtree
said. ``We've heard of one case in the industry where a guy was
using dry ice to give the illusion that he was freezing an engine.
That kind of stuff makes me angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although cryogenics of metals became standardized in the 1960s,
using extremely cold temperatures to strengthen metals is not a new
concept, said Mark Gonrowski, vice president of Diversified
Cryogenics in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings were the first to discover that if they buried
their swords in the cold ground in the winter, when they dug them
up in the spring they would be stronger and file down sharper,''
Gonrowski said. ``Swiss watch makers would also do the same thing
with precision watch parts, by taking them high into the mountains
and letting them be cold. ... The Russians took this one step
further during the space race, when they discovered that if they
dipped metal parts in nitrogen the parts sometimes would last
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the United States, more consumers are using
cryogenics than people realize, Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR racers are using it, but they don't like to talk about
it because it's their competitive edge,'' he said. ``Golf ball
companies advertise now about their products being cryogenically
treated. We have baseball players in colleges asking us to do this
to aluminum bats. ... Even the Missouri Highway Patrol is trying
out some brake rotors to test the results themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced.
</P>
<P>
   One skeptic is Sgt. Gerry Andref, the garage supervisor at the
Missouri Highway Patrol maintenance garage in Jefferson City.
Recently he installed cryogenically processed brakes in a new
cruiser. Andref said he will check the brakes at 5,000 miles and
remove them at 49,000 for a peek.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping the brakes will last longer, creating less
maintenance needs for the cars. But he has to be won over, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been hearing about cryogenics in trade magazines, but I
have to prove the results myself,'' Andref said. ``After all I am
from Missouri. It sounds pretty wonderful, but we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Freezing facts
</P>
<P>
   The most well-known freezing point undoubtedly is water, at 32
degrees Fahrenheit. At the local cryogenics company Techspec Inc.,
items are frozen to minus 300 degrees to add strength. Here are
some other freezing points, all in Fahrenheit:

 &HT;    Sosa an afterthought in recent Maris chase _ but he shouldn't be
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Sammy Sosa isn't exactly Brand X. He isn't generic.
He isn't some cheap
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire knock-off. It just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   This is The Year of Big Mac and for most of this season Sosa has
been a tag-a-long. If Sosa did what he is doing in any other year,
the nation's baseball attention would be focused squarely on him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the very large shadow of McGwire blots out Sosa.
Headlines scream, ``McGwire Homers, So Does Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps that is as it should be. Sosa was Sammy-come-lately
this year. McGwire started fast and at one point led Sosa in the
home run race, 27-13. But Sosa hit 20 home runs in June and joined
McGwire in dogging the ghost of Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fans don't clamor to see Sosa take batting practice.
Sosa's home runs aren't measured with odometers, as are McGwire's.
But, as Cincinnati Reds manager Jack McKeon points out, ``They all
count the same. McGwire doesn't get anything more for hitting one
475 feet than Sosa does hitting one 340 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no furor over Sosa's visit to Cinergy Field with the
Chicago Cubs tonight and Wednesday as there was for McGwire's stop.
No requests for special seats in the left-field upper deck red
level.
</P>
<P>
   To McKeon, it makes no difference. McGwire, Sosa. Sosa, McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   And his attitude hasn't changed about pitching to both. Just
because the Reds are wallowing in the muck of last place doesn't
mean Sosa can expect any favors in the form of fat, juicy pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win all the games we play against Chicago and St. Louis
and they both break the record (61 homers), I don't give a damn,''
McKeon says. ``How about some integrity in the game? Do we want to
win or see them break records? I'd like to see both do it. I'd like
us to win and for them to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the fans will be booing me again,'' McKeon said,
referring to boos in Cinergy when McGwire was walked. ``We'll pitch
to Sosa as much as possible, just as we do McGwire. We've had
pretty good success getting Sosa out, but we won't let him beat us
if the game is on the line. We will walk him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds and Cubs have played only three games and McKeon's
memory is a bit off. In those three games in Cinergy, Sosa was 5
for 12 (.417) with a home run, four RBI (three on the home run) one
intentional walk and four strikeouts. Sosa's home run off
Cincinnati's Scott Sullivan was, though, uh, McGwire-like _ an
explosion into the green seats in straight-away center.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hasn't been nearly as destructive on the Reds _ 2 for
13, no homers, no RBI, 11 walks (five intentional), two strikeouts
and one hit-by-pitch.
</P>
<P>
   There are major differences in the two.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire would like to put his hands over his face to avoid
the cameras, Sosa likes to mug and enjoys the attention.
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa dispatches another one over the fence, he thumps his
chest, blows a kiss and holds up the ``V'' sign. The kiss and
pounding of his chest are for his mother back in the Dominican
Republic, to let her know she is in his heart. The ``V'' is for
deceased broadcaster Harry Caray.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's home-run trot is pure vanilla, as boring as 10-mile
walks around a running track, but that's McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, McGwire is as disciplined as a Marine drill
sergeant. He wouldn't swing at a bad pitch if the catcher held a
Glock 21 to his head, which is why he has 31 more walks than
anybody else in the league, 137 to the 106 for runner-up Barry
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is likely to go after something not only outside the strike
zone, but outside the area code. He isn't in the Top Ten in walks
(58, 11 intentional).
</P>
<P>
   That's why pitching coach Don Gullett and McKeon believe Sosa
can be negated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either one is hot, you don't want to face either one,''
McKeon said. ``What they are doing is great for baseball, selling a
lot of tickets and creating great interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will be facing left-hander Dennis Reyes tonight and
right-hander Brett Tomko Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes says he is up and ready to face Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to work Sosa outside, then come in strong,'' Reyes said.
``You can't put the ball in the same place all the time or he'll
hit one off you, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko believes facing Sosa is the same as facing McGwire, or any
other power-laden behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approach them any differently than any other power
hitters in the league,'' Tomko said. ``You have one objective. .
.get them out. If you give it up, you give it up. And you tip your
cap.''
</P>
<P>
   What advice for the two?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to get him out,'' Gullett said. ``It's a matter of
making pitches. Home runs usually are the result of mistakes (53
mistakes to McGwire, 51 mistakes to Sosa).''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that Sosa finds it difficult to lay off high,
inside fastballs on his hands. And he doesn't like to walk, so
there is a plan for when he has three balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll chase the ball in the dirt if he has three balls on
him,'' Reds third-base coach Harry Dunlop said. ``Throw it in the
dirt or over his head and he'll chase it. Just make sure it is in
the dirt or over his head or you might injure your neck when you
snap it to catch a glimpse of the ball leaving the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you can watch Sosa thump his chest, blow a kiss, hold up
the ``V'' and see if he gained any ground on Big Mac.
</P>

<P>
   The Sunday Times of London reported over the weekend that
 &UR; Hillary Clinton  &LR; is thinking about working at the United Nations
after her husband's second term is over.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times, Secretary of State  &UR; Madeleine Albright &LR; 
has discussed the prospects of a position for the first lady with
Secretary-General  &UR; Kofi Annan &LR; . Mrs. Clinton is said to be
interested in working with refugees or on human rights issues.

   &UR; ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, despite the best of possible intentions, and some
pretty nifty gifts, too _ books of poetry and T-shirts and power
ties _ things just don't work out. But what are a guy and a gal to
do (after testifying)?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you are not alone. Whatever you've done, someone else
has been there, done that. Twist magazine includes a first-person
account: ``Sometimes we'll be kissing and things will get pretty
hot and heavy, and he'll say, Do you want to? And I'll just be
like, No, not now. He doesn't get mad about it. ... We've been
doing plenty of other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   All About You magazine advises the guy that if the girl
``spreads gossip about you,'' it's not a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Teen magazine advises the girl who's just broken up with her
boyfriend: ``Use dating downtime to focus on your studies, get
organized, deepen friendships and generally go for your goals with
renewed fervor. Look at the bright side: You're free to hang with
the girls all night, and you can flirt your fanny off whenever you
want.''

   &UR; George &LR;  and  &UR; Charlotte Mailliard Shultz &LR;  were to celebrate
their anniversary last Thursday with a day of culture that included
a personal tour by curator  &UR; Renee Dreyfus &LR;  of the ``Ancient Gold _
The Wealth of the Thracians'' show at San Francisco's Palace of the
Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   But late last Wednesday, the day before the United States bombed
Sudan and Afghanistan, former Secretary of State Shultz postponed
the Thursday festivities. Informed about the bombing on Wednesday,
he knew he'd be busy all day Thursday providing knowledgeable TV
commentary.

   It was  &UR; Chelsea Clinton &LR;  who asked that  &UR; Jesse Jackson &LR;  come to
the White House last week, reports U.S. News &AMP; World Report. The

``between the spiritual and political worlds,'' a White House
adviser told the magazine, ``and Chelsea is a very spiritual
person.''

   &UR; Angela Richards &LR;  did get married last week, at her father
 &UR; Keith Richards &LR; ' home outside London. Keith gave away his daughter,
who walked down the aisle to a recording of the Stones' song
``Angie.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Richards and  &UR; Ron Woods  &LR; made some music, neither
 &UR; Mick Jagger &LR;  nor  &UR; Charlie Watts &LR;  was there, which was probably a
result of their tax problems. If the two had entered England,
reported the Chicago Sun-Times, ``it would have cost them a ton of
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagger's wife,  &UR; Jerry Hall &LR; , and their children were there, as
well as  &UR; Kate Moss  &LR; and onetime Jagger girlfriend  &UR; Marianne &LR; 
 &UR; Faithfull &LR; , who said the wedding was ``magical.''
</P>
<P>
   (Brides magazine advises prospective brides and grooms to do
everything in their power to encourage wedding guests to mail gifts

 BY ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diego Della Valle doesn't believe in standing still.
Della Valle, the owner of J.P. Tod's , whose Italian-made shoes and
bags have in the last couple of years leapt into the high-status
category, is expanding his business on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with the four Tod's stores selling all of the
company's products in this country (in Los Angeles, Miami,
Manhasset and Manhattan), he is opening 22 in-store boutiques just
for his handbags starting next month at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman
Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. They will be designed to look like
his own stores, with glass, stainless steel and the same calfskin
used for the handbags, said Claudio Castiglioni, the chief
executive of J.P. Tod's in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also has 23 J.P. Tod's shops in Europe and
four in Asia, introduced a striking new advertising campaign in the
September issues of fashion magazines, featuring twin images of the
model Yasmin Le Bon on a dark background with her accessories in
shadow. Close-ups of the shoes or bags are on the facing page.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Della Valle has added styles like boots, ballet
flats and sandals to the classic driving shoes that put his company
on the fashion map. And he is planning to open boutiques next year
for his casual Hogan's line in Manhattan and Los Angeles. Although
there are 10 Hogan's boutiques in Europe, the line was introduced
in this country only last spring, at Bergdorf Goodman, and is now
the fastest-growing segment of the business, with 20 more stores
set to open next year in Europe and a line of men's shoes to come.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's is part of the company's strategy to appeal to a
younger, hipper customer than the establishment types who favor
Tod's. The Hogan shoes sell for $165 to $295; the Tod's range from
$245 to $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   To fuel the company's expansion, a $46 million complex has been
built in Italy near the city of Ancona, with 350 employees devoted
solely to research and design.
</P>
<P>
   There are also three company-owned factories where the shoes,
bags, belts and small leather goods are made. Annual retail sales
are now at $400 million and have been increasing by 20 percent to
25 percent a year, Castiglioni said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamali's `Celebrity' Service
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norma Kamali has only one store, at 11 East 56th St.,
where her ready-to-wear, swimwear and athletic clothing are sold.
But she is also finding new ways to expand her business. In
addition to a Web site (www.omo-norma-kamali.com), where users
anywhere in the world can find her designs, Ms. Kamali is offering
a shop-at-home service.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a customer profile obtained through e-mail or a
telephone interview, a Kamali personal shopper sends a selection of
clothes by Federal Express to the client, who can try them on at
her leisure, keep what she wants and return the rest. What she buys
is then charged to her credit card. Ms. Kamali calls the service
``Shop Like a Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been shipping things to our celebrity clients that way
for 10 or 15 years,'' she said. ``Our staff is used to working that
way. Then I thought that was really crazy. Why just celebrities? I
would like that service for myself, so I thought we'd try it first
with our tried-and-true clients. A lot of our European clients we
see once or twice a year, so we started with them. Then the sales
people in my shop said a lot of their Manhattan customers were
asking if we would send things to their offices.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``It's been a slow increasing, increasing,
increasing way of doing business, but in the last two years it's
become very important. It's part of the way we interact with the
client. We train our staff to get the right information. It's not
just a shot in the dark. Some clients we haven't ever seen in the
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers have to pay for shipping, but it costs a lot less than
a plane ticket. Or possibly even a taxi.

LIFE AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sunday Times of London reported over the weekend that
 &UR; Hillary Clinton  &LR; is thinking about working at the United Nations
after her husband's second term is over.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times, Secretary of State  &UR; Madeleine Albright &LR; 
has discussed the prospects of a position for the first lady with
Secretary-General  &UR; Kofi Annan &LR; . Mrs. Clinton is said to be
interested in working with refugees or on human rights issues.

   &UR; ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, despite the best of possible intentions, and some
pretty nifty gifts, too _ books of poetry and T-shirts and power
ties _ things just don't work out. But what are a guy and a gal to
do (after testifying)?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you are not alone. Whatever you've done, someone else
has been there, done that. Twist magazine includes a first-person
account: ``Sometimes we'll be kissing and things will get pretty
hot and heavy, and he'll say, Do you want to? And I'll just be
like, No, not now. He doesn't get mad about it. ... We've been
doing plenty of other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   All About You magazine advises the guy that if the girl
``spreads gossip about you,'' it's not a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Teen magazine advises the girl who's just broken up with her
boyfriend: ``Use dating downtime to focus on your studies, get
organized, deepen friendships and generally go for your goals with
renewed fervor. Look at the bright side: You're free to hang with
the girls all night, and you can flirt your fanny off whenever you
want.''

SPANISH HOTEL COMPANIES ARE GOING GLOBAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ A quickening battle in the domestic hotel market
and increasing competition from abroad have sent traditional
family-run Spanish hotel companies scrambling to ensure their
future, with nearly a billion dollars already committed to new
investments.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the changes came earlier this month, when the
family-owned Barcelo Empresas agreed to sell controlling stakes in
its only two properties in the United States: the Radisson Barcelo
hotels in Washington, D.C., and Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is a consortium being formed by Barcelo, a tour and
hotel company on the island of Majorca; Argentaria, a major Madrid
bank, and Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, or FCC, one of
Spain's largest construction companies. Barcelo will retain its
core businesses but is pledging the stakes in its U.S. properties,
which the consortium says are worth $48 million, as its ticket to
join the new enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium plans to invest $600 million to buy or build
hotels in the next two years in Spain and abroad, and to bolster
Barcelo's current management of 44 hotels in nine countries,
including the two Radissons operated under franchise, to about 80.
</P>
<P>
   After a generation of slow growth, several Spanish families that
started with one hotel, like Barcelo in 1962, and nudged up to
mid-size companies are now bracing for tougher global competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need more capital to grow more quickly,'' said Jesus
Garcia de Ponga, head of Argentaria's principal real estate
division. ``If not, other groups will capture the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, four family-controlled Spanish companies _
Barcelo, Occidental Hoteles, Riu Hoteles and Sol Melia _ plan to
add to their combined total of 103 hotels in the Caribbean and
Latin America, where expanding tourism and relatively low operating
costs have beckoned with 20 percent returns on investment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies have invested in hotels just across the
Mediterranean in Morocco and Tunisia. And all are on guard against
foreign challengers, like Britain's Bass PLC and its Holiday Inns,
which are poised to enlarge their small presence in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   France, the United States and Spain itself ranked in that order
as the world's top three tourist destinations in 1997, according to
the World Tourism Organization, which is based in Madrid. But
competitive tour pricing that now makes it almost as easy for
Europeans to vacation in the Caribbean as on Spain's beaches has
changed the rules for Spain's fragmented hotel market, where small
owners still predominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For survival, you need hotels in a lot of different places''
with coordinated reservations systems, Garcia de Ponga said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last May, Occidental Hoteles, a Madrid chain, announced plans
with Spain's largest savings bank, La Caixa, to invest $320 million
to build eight resort hotels in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and
Spain's Canary Islands by 2001. They will be added to Occidental's
current management of 54 hotels in eight nations.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-size companies are dwarfed by Spain's largest family-run
hotel company, Sol Melia. It started in Majorca in the 1950s and
now manages 245 hotels with 60,000 rooms in 25 nations.
</P>
<P>
   While Occidental and Barcelo are talking about selling shares on
the Madrid Stock Exchange, Sol Melia was the first Spanish hotel
company to list, in 1996, raising $275 million from the sale of a
45 percent equity stake. This year, a related real estate company,
Melia Inversiones Americanas, based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, was
listed separately on the Madrid bourse. It owns six hotels in the
Caribbean and Latin America, all managed by Sol Melia, and is
building four more in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other Spanish hotel firm, HN Hoteles, is traded in
Madrid, although indirectly, as the largest asset of the Spanish
hotel and beverage group Cofir. Last year, Cofir bought out NH's 66
hotels in Spain from its founder, Antonio Catalan, who has since
started another hotel group, called AC.
</P>
<P>
   Most Spanish hotel families still shy away from public listings
because they ``fear they'll lose control by trading on the
market,'' said Fernando Rosello, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais
Securities in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking other formulas, Riu Hoteles, a Majorca firm that manages
75 hotels in six nations, including one in Miami and another in
Orlando, Fla., continues its 22-year alliance with the large tour
operator Touristik Union International of Hanover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Hosteleria Unida, based in Barcelona, aims within five
years to double its current portfolio of 200 hotels through
franchising, which requires less capital risk.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the hotel sector is growing steadily, starting
at the top. Chains are involved in just 20 percent of Spain's 5,780
hotels, but they run 55 percent of the 766 premium four- and
five-star establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign chains manage less than 1 percent of Spain's hotels, but
some have big expansion plans. Bass, which has two Holiday Inns, a
Crowne Plaza, two Intercontinentals and a Holiday Inn Express in
Spain, will invest $30 million by 2001 for five more Holiday Inn
Express budget hotels in Spain. The French group Accor, with 12
hotels in Spain, including its upscale Novotel and Sofitel brands,
will build 50 Ibis and 30 Formule I hotels, its budget brands,
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end of the Spanish market is Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Inc., based in White Plains, N.Y. Earlier this year, it
acquired ITT/Sheraton, which operates five luxury hotels in Spain,
including the 440-room Palace Hotel in Madrid near the Prado.
</P>
<P>
   The $42 million renovation of the Palace, completed last
December, has paid off with increased business conferences and more
guests from abroad, said John H. Henderson, the hotel's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign companies shopping for hotel deals in Spain, he
added, have balked because a lot of the properties are outdated and
would require costly overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entry format needs to be a new build or an acquisition
which would require a major rehabilitation,'' Henderson said.
``That's why many haven't come in.''

JUDGE DISMISSES WORKERS' COMPLAINTS AGAINST LIZ CLAIBORNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan has thrown out all
claims contained in a lawsuit against garment manufacturer Liz
Claiborne, which was accused of improperly conspiring with union
leaders to betray the interests of workers at a Brooklyn sweater
factory. But the judge refused to dismiss two of the workers' key
complaints against the union.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, released Aug. 18 by Judge Harold Baer in Manhattan,
came in response to motions by Claiborne and the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, known as Unite,
which had sought to have the case dismissed in its entirety.
Although the judge refused to eliminate two claims against the
union, he noted that ``undoubtedly it will be difficult for the
plaintiffs to ultimately prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Unite, Jo-Ann Mort, said Baer's ruling came
``at an early stage of the judicial process,'' before the union had
an opportunity to submit evidence on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the case will be dismissed completely on
summary judgment, after we have had an opportunity to submit
evidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual lawsuit was filed last fall by employees of
Mademoiselle Knitwear Inc. in Brooklyn, once a showcase of
union-management cooperation but now in bankruptcy amid a tangle of
angry litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The workers asserted that Liz Claiborne had reneged on a
commitment to order a substantial volume of sweaters from
Mademoiselle, and that the union had improperly agreed to settle an
arbitration case aimed at enforcing that commitment. In exchange
for the settlement, the workers charged, Claiborne agreed to pay
the union approximately $20 million over three years, none of which
would benefit the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Baer dismissed all of the workers' claims against
Claiborne, those accusations ``must be considered thoroughly
discredited,'' said Roberta S. Karp, Claiborne's general counsel.
Having also won an earlier trademark infringement case against
Mademoiselle, she said, the company was confident that it would
also win a separate lawsuit pending against it by Mademoiselle.
</P>
<P>
   Baer also dismissed the portions of the complaint that accused
the union of accepting what the workers termed ``a bribe'' from
Claiborne in exchange for settling the arbitration claims. Federal
labor laws limit the enforcement of union anti-bribery provisions
to government prosecutors, not to private plaintiffs, the judge
ruled. He added that the matter was being referred to the Manhattan
District Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karp said the payment was legitimately made under the terms
of Claiborne's contract with the union and the prosecutor's office
``has been aware for over a year of the allegations the court
referred, and it has taken no action.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baer also dismissed all claims against the specific local, Local
155, that represented workers at Mademoiselle, because it had
played no role in the arbitration dispute or its settlement. The
arbitration had been undertaken on behalf of Mademoiselle workers
by another union local, Local 23-25, with support from the parent
union.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge rejected arguments by Unite and Local 23-25 that
their indirect relationship with the Mademoiselle workers barred
any claims against them for not fairly representing those workers.
``The actions attributed to Unite and Local 23-25 in initiating,
conducting and settling the arbitration claims'' provided
sufficient grounds for the workers to assert in court that they had
not been fairly represented, Baer ruled.
</P>
<P>
   To prevail, he noted, the workers will have to show that the
union's settlement of the arbitration claims against Claiborne was
``arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith'' _ a very difficult
hurdle, he added. ``Nonetheless, at this stage of litigation, the
plaintiffs should be allowed to proceed,'' he ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rhine, the lawyer for the Mademoiselle workers, said he
was encouraged by the ruling, and was confident that the remaining
claims in the complaint would move forward to trial next spring.

 &HT;    Riptides part of the dangerous hurricane package
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of all the dangers that swimmers and waders face at
the beach, rip currents - also called riptides or undertows - are
the most dangerous, say lifeguards and coastal geologists.
</P>
<P>
   And as Hurricane Bonnie spins and surges in the Atlantic, the
danger of the deadly current has increased at many East Coast
beaches. Rip currents believed to be spawned by Bonnie this weekend
claimed the lives of a 25-year-old North Charleston, S.C., man
vacationing at Surfside Beach, S.C., and a 24-year-old man at
Rehobeth Beach, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Several others had near misses. At Neptune Beach, Fla.,
lifeguards rescued two young boys who were dragged out to sea while
standing in knee-deep water. Lifeguards also reported 30 rescues in
Carolina Beach, N.C., and 100 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities at several East Coast beaches on Monday were
allowing only ankle-deep wading in the surf because of the
currents. ``Certainly the danger of rip currents intensifies with a
storm,'' says Duke University coastal geologist Orrin Pilkey. A
person caught in a rip current will quickly be pulled under or
swept out to sea. Even the strongest swimmers may be unable to
fight it, say water safety experts.
</P>
<P>
   A rip current occurs near a break in a sand bar when water
pushed onto the beach by offshore storms or strong winds escapes
into the sea through the break. As they funnel out to sea, the rip
currents gain force, fan out into a mushrooming slough and then
dissipate. The process continues as more water tunnels through the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   Storms like Hurricane Bonnie create bigger waves, which dump
more water onto the beach and result in greater volumes of water
escaping back into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Areas with piers, jetties or sand bars are especially prone to
rip currents and should be avoided, says Pilkey.
</P>
<P>
   If you get caught in a rip current, don't fight it, water safety
experts advise. Try to stay calm and afloat by letting the current
carry you away from shore until it begins to dissipate. Swim
parallel to shore until the current weakens, then head back in.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Lifesaving Association estimates that more than 36,000
swimmers were rescued from rip currents in 1997. Florida officials
say that an average 23 persons have died from rip currents per year
in Florida since 1989. No figures are available for Georgia.

 &HT;    Another victory for Coke as fast-food chain signs on for 10
years
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pepsico, fighting desperately to gain market share,
has lost another round in the cola wars to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola,
which has snared pouring rights with Wendy's International for the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed for the 10-year contract, which
Wendy's, the nation's third-largest hamburger chain behind
McDonald's and Burger King, awarded to Coca-Cola without inviting
Pepsico to the bidding table.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 soft-drink company said it was prepared to offer more
lucrative terms for the account _ and remains willing to do so even
though Coca-Cola and Wendy's have already inked the deal. But
Pepsi's comments were too little, too late, for Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a bidding war,'' said Denny Lynch, a spokesman for
the Dublin, Ohio-based restaurant chain. ``Coca-Cola has invested
heavily in learning our business and assembling an account team
that numbers more than 50 people. That's a partnership. Coke has
earned our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's already pours Coke products in 85 percent of its 4,600
U.S. restaurants and all 600 of its international locations,
through contracts going back to the mid-1980s. Pepsi brands are
served by between 700 and 800 U.S. franchisees, but will be phased
out of those locations as contracts expire in the next few years,
Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a system-wide soft drink supplier will help Wendy's make
better use of its advertising budget, which will get an estimated
$133 million infusion from Coca-Cola over the life of the contract.
Coca-Cola plans to fork over $42 million for Wendy's national
advertising in the first year, plus 32 cents for every gallon of
soft drink syrup the chain buys during the remaining nine years,
according to a letter to franchisees from Gordon F. Teter, Wendy's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   That cash contribution will surely have strings attached,
requiring Wendy's to showcase Coca-Cola products in its
advertising, said Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president of
Technomic, a food service consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke isn't going to give a check for $130 million to just let
Dave Thomas do more commercials,'' Lombardi said. ``To some degree,
that's part of Coca-Cola's advertising campaign, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pirko, a New York beverage consultant, said Coca-Cola's win
signals that its fountain soft drink business is better run than
Pepsi's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a flat-out offer to simply pay more for the account isn't
enough, that tells you there are some distinct differences. Coke is
simply the preferred brand,'' said Pirko. ``And if Pepsi was
willing to do anything to buy the business, they'd probably be
accused of predatory pricing and literally cashing in.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico filed a federal anti-trust suit against Coca-Cola May 7,
charging that it uses unfair trade practices to dominate the $15
billion U.S. fountain market. Coca-Cola argued in court last week
that the suit should be dismissed, and a ruling on that issue is
expected any day.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts estimate Coca-Cola has two-thirds of the U.S.
fountain business, compared with Pepsi's estimated 24 percent.
Coca-Cola has a 43.9 percent total share of the U.S. carbonated
soft drink market, and a 49.7 percent global share. Pepsi's U.S.
market-share is 30.9 percent, and it has a 20.3 percent share
world-wide.

MILITARY DISMISSES SUHARTO'S SON-IN-LAW, A TOP GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Ga.)   (jw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The Indonesian military, pressing ahead
with a risky housecleaning that has involved exhuming bodies and
investigating high-ranking officers, Monday discharged a son-in-law
of former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   One of Suharto's most aggressive and feared generals, the
son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, symbolized for many people
the repressive nature of the country's military.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of the special forces, known as Kopassus, which
gained a reputation for efficiency and brutality, Prabowo has been
implicated in the abduction and torture of political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Prabowo's discharge, the armed forces chief, Gen.
Wiranto, said Prabowo, 47, could still face a court-martial as more
evidence emerges about the abduction of more than two dozen
dissidents earlier this year. At least 14 are still missing and are
feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say Prabowo could also be implicated in
other acts of brutality, including instigating the riots, arson and
rape last May that precipitated Suharto's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement day was criticized for not going far
enough by a group representing the families of the missing
dissidents. Their statement illustrated the public pressure and
scrutiny that, for the first time in decades, has put the military
_ known by its Indonesian acronym, ABRI _ on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that decision, ABRI showed no willingness to
substantially or institutionally correct its repressive policies,
which include the act of kidnapping,'' said the group's leader,
Munir, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto said his decision was made ``without any pressure from
any side or person and it is clearly in the interest of ABRI and
that of the nation and the state.'' He said dismissal was a harsh
punishment for a high-ranking officer.
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto was forced from office three months ago, the
military has embarked on a painful self-analysis under the harsh
eye of a newly liberated press.
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers have been sentenced to prison for their part in the
killings of four student demonstrators that touched off the
citywide rioting in mid-May. But human rights groups say
higher-ranking culprits remain unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soldiers have been withdrawn from the disputed
territory of East Timor, where the military is implicated in
widespread killings and brutality. And in the island province of
Aceh, scores of bones of people believed to have been executed by
the army in a 1989 insurgency were exhumed during the weekend from
a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   A separate government investigation is under way into the riots
in May in which 1,200 people died and thousands of buildings were
burned, vandalized and looted.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have gathered evidence that much of the
damage was coordinated by organized groups, and Prabowo is expected
to be questioned about a possible military role in the destruction,
which also included attacks on Chinese-owned businesses and the
rapes of scores of ethnic Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto has stated his commitment to reform and his allegiance
to the new government of President B.J. Habibie. But the shape of
these reforms is still being debated within the military.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto moved quickly to consolidate his grip on the military
immediately after Suharto's resignation. Within hours, he had
removed Prabowo from his command of troops and assigned him to head
a military academy.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, like Habibie, was a close associate of Suharto. But
both men have been leading the way into a more open post-Suharto
era with pledges of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Prabowo, who is married to Suharto's second daughter, reacted
furiously, and Habibie said the general accosted him at his home,
forcing Habibie to take shelter for the night in a safe house.
Suharto and his family, meanwhile, retired to their homes in
Jakarta, where they remain, out of the public eye, reportedly
angling to secure their wealth from public investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto also announced the demotion Monday of two of Prabowo's
allies, Maj. Gen. Muchdi Purwopranjono _ who succeeded Prabowo as
head of the special forces _ and Col. Chairawan, who was in charge
of the unit's intelligence unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ten lower-ranking officers from the unit face trial in a
military court in connection with the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The actions follow an investigation by a tribunal of seven
generals known as an ``honor council,'' during which Prabowo was
reported to have admitted responsibility for the abductions, saying
he had misinterpreted orders from above.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto said the investigation showed that the special forces
unit was involved in the abductions, under orders to ``uncover
several movements then considered radical and jeopardizing
government programs and public security.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious and aggressive, Prabowo aroused the resentment of many
of his fellow officers with his quick rise through the ranks, to
become the youngest general in the history of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   He trained in the United States at the Special Forces school in
Fort Bragg, N.C., and at the advanced infantry school in Fort
Benning, Ga., and was known as a professional, if rough-edged,
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto said Monday that Prabowo's military career is over. ``He
will not be active any more within the armed forces,'' Wiranto
said.

MERRILL TO PAY $2 MILLION TO SETTLE ORANGE COUNTY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. agreed Monday to pay a $2 million fine
levied by the nation's top securities regulator to settle charges
that it led Orange County, Calif. into the biggest municipal
bankruptcy in US history.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
ends an expensive and closely watched saga for the nation's largest
brokerage, which agreed in June to pay a hefty $437.1 million to
the southern California county to resolve $2 billion in damage
claims.
</P>
<P>
   It also brings into the home stretch a raft of SEC probes into
companies and officials involved in the county's 1994 financial
collapse. ``Although there may be additional enforcement action,
the bulk of our investigations and probes related to the Orange
County case is finished,'' said Elaine M. Cacheris, director of the
SEC's Pacific regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has been under a cloud since mid-1994, when it
sold Orange County $875 million in risky, interest-sensitive
securities that soured into a shocking $1.6 billion loss when
interest rates rose later that year.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis led Orange County, just south of Los
Angeles, to declare bankruptcy in December 1994, and made
derivatives, a complex form of security that is lucrative for the
companies that sell them, a dirty word. It also cast a pall over
Merrill Lynch, which officials accused of not providing necessary
information to county officials and investment bankers about the
derivative-linked bonds it was underwriting for Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   While among the larger fines ever levied by the SEC for
unintentional fraudulent conduct, the penalty did not require the
Wall Street investment behemoth to admit wrongdoing. Instead, the
settlement reproached Merrill Lynch for lax disclosure about its
investment strategy for the county's investment pools. In 1995
Merrill Lynch paid $12 million to various Massachusetts authorities
to settle charges of irregularities in its municipal-bond work for
the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that in an era of rapid consolidation in the
financial services industry, Merrill Lynch had desperately wanted
to put the debacle behind and move on. ``They had been spending
millions on this and wanted it out of their hair,'' said a New York
banking analyst who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``As far as the government is concerned, the case
against Merrill is closed, and this (the civil penalty) was a slap
on the wrist.'' The SEC settlement did not name Michael Stamenson,
the whiz-kid Merrill Lynch broker in San Francisco who carried out
the ill-fated securities sales.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch nudged up 13/16 to close at 84 15/16 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County saga may be over for Merrill Lynch, which
played the largest role in the episode, but it is not finished for
the California municipality. The nation's fifth-largest county has
so far recovered around $739 million via lawsuits against banks,
brokerages, accountants, and law firms that helped sell the
ill-fated securities. The county has since gotten back on its feet
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding cases include an SEC lawsuit against Minneapolis
investment firm Dain Rauscher Corp. charging fraud in selling $1
billion in Orange County notes.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch's June settlement with the county came one month
after CS First Boston agreed to pay $52.5 million. Last month,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Nomura Securities, the
Japanese brokerage, settled for $117.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, the securities industry watchdog, reached its own
settlement with CS First Boston in January. An investigation by law
enforcers into former Orange County treasurer Robert Citron led to
his conviction in 1996.

 &HT;    MEDIA FACES QUANDARY OVER GRAPHIC DETAILS OF WHITE HOUSE SEX
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Internet and talk radio abuzz with rumors
of kinky sex in the Oval Office, increasingly graphic accounts of
the relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are
making their way into the mainstream news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standards are in the toilet, and not just in the White
House,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor who teaches about politics
and the media at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Salacious reports sometimes percolate up through the tabloid
press and online sites such as the Drudge Report, and often are
first printed in general circulation newspapers abroad. When they
reach a critical mass, American newspaper editors and TV producers
feel pressured to deal with the story, explained Sabato, who
criticized the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justification is that 'our readers expect us to explain
what's already out there','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato noted that one rumor about an unusual act involving
Clinton and Lewinsky was sweeping the country on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it originated,'' he said, saying he had
received dozens of phone calls and e-mails about the report. ``It
could be a top-down rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of ``unusual'' sexual activities in the Clinton scandal
are not appearing just in the non-traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``More rude shocks await. Mrs. Clinton, the U.S. Congress and,
ultimately, the American people may learn the details of the sexual
relationship between the president and the former intern _ more,
perhaps than anyone wants to know,'' Newsweek magazine reports in
this week's edition.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress ``will
include graphic vignettes of sexual encounters in the president's
small study off the Oval Office,'' Newsweek said. ``Starr is known
to believe that the public will be deeply offended by some of the
kinkier details. 'When people read his report, they'll want to
throw up,' said a knowledgeable source.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's edition of the Hotline, an electronic insider's guide
to politics, contained a roundup of media reports of sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline reported that radio talk show host and former
Republican political strategist Mary Matalin appeared on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' and urged Clinton to resign before Starr's
report goes to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know inside the Beltway what's in that report,'' she
said. ``And I don't think (Clinton) wants his family to know any
more about what's in that report, or the country needs to hear any
more about tissue, dresses, cigars, ties and anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NBC correspondent Lisa Myers reported that Lewinsky
had told the grand jury that ``the sex was mutual, involved unusual
practices and included the president touching her in very intimate
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the serious charges facing Clinton involve perjury and
obstruction of justice, it is impossible to report the story
without delving into the relationship. And Clinton has helped
legitimize the detailed coverage by engaging in semantics over what
constitutes sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post has not held back any relevant facts, said
Executive Editor Len Downie, but has been careful in its use of
language _ using the phrase ``DNA material'' or other euphemisms
rather than the word ``semen,'' for instance. The Post, as well as
The New York Times, did report the body parts that Lewinsky told
the grand jury the president fondled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information that our readers should know about the
president of the United States, we're going to publish,'' said
Downie. ``We'll try to do it tastefully.''

CHEMISTS PROMISE HEALTHY COOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They're the words you've been waiting to hear: Go
ahead, eat that cookie _ it's good for your heart.
</P>
<P>
   You may not have to wait much longer. Cookies, cakes, and other
treats that are beneficial for health are not on the market yet,
but food chemists said Monday they may be available within about a
year. They will be made with a fat substitute derived from oats
that not only may reduce calories, but also may help lower
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   George E. Inglett, a scientist with the US Department of
Agriculture, said the new fat substitute he developed is the first
such additive that meets federal standards for being advertised as
beneficial for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The additive &UR;  &LR; will be sold under the name Nu-Trim, said Inglett,
and all proceeds from its sale will go to the federal government,
which funded the research.
</P>
<P>
   The additive is more effective at lowering both total
cholesterol and the ``bad'' form of cholesterol, or LDL, than
natural oatmeal or barley, said Wallace Yokoyama, a scientist at
the USDA research center in Albany, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the processing involved, which removes most of
the cellulose material from the oats' husk, makes it easier for the
body to absorb the beneficial chemicals, called beta-glucans, from
the oats, Yokoyama said. In his laboratory studies, he said,
Nu-Trim lowered cholesterol levels in rats by 27 percent,
substantially more than unprocessed oats did. And LDL cholesterol
was reduced by 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The processing, Inglett said, involves ``taking out the coarse
stuff that makes (oats) tough, rough, and gritty and hard to add to
other products.''
</P>
<P>
   Inglett, of the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Peoria,
Ill., said that it is not yet clear how beta-glucans lower
cholesterol, but tests have clearly shown their effectiveness. He
said a manufacturer must file a formal petition before the FDA
approves the product, but since it is derived entirely from oats it
should qualify as a ``generally recognized as safe'' product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a new ingredient,'' Inglett said. ``People have been
eating oatmeal since Adam and Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Inglett has spent the last 10 years working on deriving fat
substitutes from oats and barley, and two of his earlier products,
called Oatrim and Z-Trim, are either on the market or in the
process of being licensed. But this is the first product of his
research that actually provides positive health benefits in
addition to lowering fat intake.
</P>
<P>
   David Busken, a representative of Oak State Products, which
makes cookies that are sold under various manufacturers labels,
said his company has tried the product and found it could be used
to produce a low-fat cookie with the smooth consistency of treats
that contain at least three times the fat.

   RUSSIA-CURRENCY (Moscow) One middle-aged woman wiped a tear from
her eye as she emerged from the MOST Bank a block from Red Square,
having just found that Russia's currency crisis had prevented her
from withdrawing savings. At a nearby subway entrance, an old woman
leaned heavy against the railing, carrying two weighty bags filled
with bootleg beer that she would soon sell for a few rubles' profit
to well-off visitors. The ``new'' Russia was replete with such
scenes last week, as devaluation of the ruble threatened to send up
prices once more and lower a standard of living that has already
plummeted through the 1990's. Nearly seven years after the Soviet
Union's fall, ordinary Russians are embittered at their president
and at a government dominated by a new class of bosses. They see
the poverty of pensioners while watching the massive consumption
habits of their country's nouveau rich.

   BOEING-BRITISH-AIRWAYS (Undated) British Airways is expected to
announce a $2.7 billion order for 59 short-haul Airbus planes, with
options that could bring the overall order to as much as $11
billion. While Boeing also will land an order for 17 Boeing 777s
worth $2.67 billion, the Airbus order is significant in that it's
the first time British Airways has ordered anything but a Boeing
jet. We have off-the record confirmation that the Airbus orders
will be announce tomorrow, and that British Prime Minister Tony
Blair will be on hand. Boeing order may come later.

DRUG CZAR CALLS FOR NEW ENFORCEMENT COORDINATORS ON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's point man on drug
policy plans Tuesday to propose changes in the nation's strategy to
stem narcotics trafficking, including deploying a new corps of
federal officials to coordinate drug interdiction along the
U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, who heads the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy, is expected to unveil the plan in El Paso,
Texas, where he begins a two-day tour of facilities and meets with
federal, state and local officials involved in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the retired Army general called for the
creation of a federal coordinator of law enforcement activities
along the 2,000-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the United States needs ``a coherent, coordinated effort
to stem the flow of drugs,'' he will press for a federal official
at each of the two dozen land ports to manage resources and
suppress rivalries among law enforcement agencies on the Southwest
border.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also wants a federal officer at all 39 crossing points
on the U.S.-Mexico border to coordinate efforts of the U.S. Customs
Service, Border Patrol, state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, those officials would answer to an overall
coordinator, who would be stationed in El Paso, one of the nation's
busiest ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only by working together, utilizing the strengths of all of
our agencies, can we build a border infrastructure that will defeat
the flow of drugs,'' McCaffrey told a San Diego audience on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey is expected to detail his proposals in a report to
President Clinton this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional reaction to McCaffrey's idea has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, applauded a new approach to the
current anti-smuggling and trafficking efforts that he said have
failed to stop narcotics from streaming into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, a former Border Patrol sector chief in El Paso, has
called for increased manpower and resources for federal agents
stationed in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, questioned creation of another
layer of federal bureaucracy in the battle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated,'' Rodriguez said earlier this month. ``There
is a serious situation in this country, and the problem is those
that want to consume this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, have called the Clinton administration
strategy against drug trafficking a failure. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia outlined a GOP blueprint earlier this year to
strengthen laws and penalties for those caught smuggling drugs into
the country.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey concedes the current federal effort lacks the cohesion
and coordination to stop drugs from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
   He said 60 percent of all cocaine coming into the country and
more than 50 percent of all marijuana and methamphetamine enter the
southwestern United States by airplane, boats, vehicles and
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   While resources at the border have been increased in recent
years, the process still allows far too many drugs to sneak through
because of overlaps in coverage, redundancy in efforts and lack of
central coordination, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   He has called for increased cooperation between U.S. and Mexican
law enforcement agencies and is scheduled to meet with Mexican
Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Tuesday night. That meeting will be
preceded by a tour of the border port and the Bridge of the
Americas in El Paso and briefings with officials from various
federal agencies.

 &HT;    Life's just ducky _ even though she's really a he
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_This is the story of a woman _ and her duck.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Carolyn Wallace, and the duck, Ethel, live in a large
red brick house with Carolyn's husband, Nathan, another duck,
Ricky, and a white Maltese dog named Arthur Deco.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering: Ethel? Ricky? Where are Lucy and
Fred?
</P>
<P>
   There never was a Fred, but there used to be a Lucy until she
got eaten by a hawk in front of Ricky, an act that so traumatized
Ricky, he stood in the Wallaces' basement for 10 months staring
into a corner. (He's fine now, but mean! Which is where Ethel comes
in, but more about this later.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, this story really began two years ago at a 92nd birthday
party for Carolyn's grandmother. Carolyn's uncle Albert, who owns a
farm in Ellijay, Georgia, said he knew some people who were selling
ducklings.
</P>
<P>
   Like Marcel Proust's redolent madeleines, the word ``duck,''
says Carolyn, opened a cache of fond memories of her favorite
childhood pet, a particularly affectionate mallard named Herbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``And without thinking,'' she says, ``I sprung from my chair and
said, `Yes!'''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, not nearly as excited about the idea as Carolyn, began
pondering how to dissuade his wife of two years from becoming a
duck owner. Within minutes he had a plan _ he'd just say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going home after the party, just as I figured she would,
Carolyn asked me if we could have ducks,'' recalls Nathan, 30. ``I
said no. And the next day we had ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward nine months: The hawk eats Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, Ricky just wasn't the same bird,'' says Carolyn,
36.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the couple didn't know what to do about the grieving
Ricky. Like swans and other waterfowl, ducks mate for life. And
Ricky, well, he loved Lucy. Then Carolyn saw an ad for ducklings in
a newspaper. Enter Ricky's new mate, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethel turned out to be male. Ricky attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling sorry for Ethel, Carolyn, who still refers to the fowl
as a she (don't ask), took the little duckling under her wing. And
on top of a towel, especially when they watch TV together _ Ethel
isn't totally housebroken yet.
</P>
<P>
   It's been six months since Ethel came to roost at the Wallaces'
home. And life is good. Ethel has his own little plastic pool to
swim in, eats spinach by the handful and entertains the
neighborhood children. Ethel particularly likes to sit in Carolyn's
lap while she drives around town, running errands. He even has gone
to work with Carolyn and Nathan at a family paper supply business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People point at her and say, `Is that a duck?''' Carolyn says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as the saying goes, if it walks like a duck and quacks
like a duck ...

 &HT;    Loveless embrassed about being in the spotlight
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patty Loveless doesn't like talking about herself, which is an
interesting dilemma for someone who is famous.
</P>
<P>
   After selling millions of albums and racking up a mantle-full of
awards, the country singer still seems a little embarrassed of the
spotlight, kind of like the shy valedictorian forced to pose for
pictures after the commencement speech. When she talks about her
near-two decade career in country music, she calls it ``The Patty
Loveless Thing,'' as if she's referring to someone else who's
onstage and tossing back a mane of red hair and posing for album
covers in Armani.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while for her to relax in an interview, but
eventually she lets he guard down to laugh and admit the ``real''
Patty Loveless cleans her own house, washes her own clothes, buys
her own groceries, and drives a Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to wear both hats. I have to be onstage and be Patty
Loveless, and there are times I'm able to break down and just be
Patty, wife and homemaker,'' she says, calling from a sound check
just before a show in Indianapolis. ``When I'm offstage, I want to
be in blue jeans and real casual clothes, which throws people off.
People come up to me and say 'you almost look like Patty Loveless'.
It's hard to pinpoint me or pick me out, and I prefer to be that
way. I like to be treated as just another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's this authenticity that makes Loveless perhaps the
best singer in country music today.
</P>
<P>
   When she rolls into Atlanta's Fox Theatre Wednesday night, the
41-year-old entertainer will unleash songs that have proven to be
the answer to the traditionalist's prayer _ ``lead us not into
temptation'' of pop. While Nashville has spent most of the '90s
signing acts that look and sound like commercial lightweights,
Loveless has never deviated from the mockingbird-pure sound she
honed singing Loretta Lynn tunes when she was a kid growing up in
Pikeville, Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty is the last of the breed that got signed because of her
talent, and not because of how she looks on a album cover or how
she struts around onstage,'' says country disc jockey Rhubarb Jones
of Y-106.7. `` I actually go out and buy her records, mainly
because I love her voice and her choice of material. She has a hurt
in her voice, a genuine honest ache.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveless' ability to wring the guts out of a tune has earned her
a jukebox full of hits: ``Timber (I'm Falling In Love),''
``Chains,'' ``I'm That Kind of Girl,'' ``Jealous Bone,'' ``The
Nights Too Long,'' ``You Can Feel Bad,'' ``I Try To Think About
Elvis,'' ``Blame It On Your Heart,'' and ``How Can I Help You Say
Goodbye.'' Though first signed to a recording contract in 1985,
Loveless didn't become a power player in the industry until a
decade later, when her album, ``When Fallen Angeles Fly,'' was
named the Country Music Association's album of the year. The
following two years, she walked away with the trophy for female
vocalist of the year, then nabbed a Grammy last February for
country album of the year for her current release, ``Long Stretch
of Lonesome.'' She's nominated for four awards at the upcoming CMA
ceremonies on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But like a pair of sensible shoes, Loveless has perhaps never
been fully credited for her long and consistent contribution. While
critically acclaimed, ``Lonesome'' hasn't produced the No. 1
singles she's used to. The album's duet between Loveless and George
Jones, ``You Don't Seem To Miss Me,'' was perhaps the most powerful
collaboration to come out of a Nashville studio in years, yet was
shunned by some country stations as being ``too country.'' Imagine
that.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Benson, executive director of the CMA, thinks Loveless will
transcend the current choppy waters of Music City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty Loveless is a timeless artist,'' he says. ``She's gonna
have the enduring power of some of her forebears like Tammy
Wynette, Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn _ people where the
credibility and depth of talent will transcend all that's going on
now.''
</P>
<P>
   When dissecting Loveless's sound and success, many in the
industry point to her partner/producer/husband, Emory Gordy, Jr. A
native Atlantan, Gordy has been a fixture on the music scene for
years. Back in his Georgia days in the '60s, he played with the
Classics IV, and even co-wrote the hit ``Traces'' with Buddy Buie .
After heading to Music City, he played bass in several bands,
including the penultimate ?? experience of touring with Elvis
Presley. Along the way, Gordy earned a reputation as a musician's
musician, and wound up playing with Loveless. The two fell in love
and were married, which formed the beginning of what is one of
Nashville's richest creative pairings.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Gordy, 51, began producing his wife's music,
sheparding her into a more mature and compelling sound. Loveless
material began exploring complex, adult themes, starting with the
hit ``If My Heart Had Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always involved, and ninety percent of the time he's
right,'' Loveless says of Gordy. ``He's just amazing, he blows me
away. I think he's a genius, but he always takes the back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordy has been instrumental in helping Loveless with one of the
most difficult tasks a vocalist faces: selecting material. For
example, he found the Gary Scruggs/Tony Arata tune ``Long Stretch
of Lonesome,'' which Loveless
</P>
<P>
   says is the perfect example of the type of lyric-driven song she
craves: ``Where the memories that haunt me/are gonna someday be my
friend/when that long stretch of lonesome/comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Says the CMA's Benson: ``Emory is a great partner for her in
helping her pick those songs, and managing to get her to deliver
what he thinks is the best Patty Loveless performance in that song.
The songs they have been able to find for her records are just
incredible. She's one of those people who can take a song and make
it more than it is through her vocal interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveless's tunes are often dark and brooding, choking on the
heartache of loss. She says much of the mood of the last album came
from ``the year from hell,'' which is what she calls 1996. That was
the year an older sister died of emphysema, and Gordy went into the
hospital with pancreatitis.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she was drawn to songs ``that moved me in some kind
of way. I want my songs to move people, whether they're going
through a bad situation or something that makes them feel good
about life. We all go through the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveless says she is drawn to simplicity _ ``we tend to forget
that simple is very good. A song doesn't have to have a bunch of
fancy lyrics, just say things that are subtle that get to the heart
of things we have all felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveless spends most days on the road, on the bus, traveling
from one show to another. She and Gordy rarely have time to visit
the lakehouse they own in Dallas, Ga., although she recalls how
they spent their last visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode around and took in all the old places he used to
play,'' she says. ``There's something about Atlanta that I love. It
makes me feel like part of him. He has a whole lotta family there.
I hope some day we can make it our home.
</P>
<P>
   A Snapshot of Patty Loveless
</P>
<P>
   -- Age: 41
</P>
<P>
   -- Hometown: Pikeville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   -- Influences: A distant cousin of Loretta Lynn, Loveless grew
up to the sounds of traditional country music. One of her first
professional jobs was as the ``girl singer'' with the Wilburn
Brothers. She says a short stint as a rocker in a cover band in the
late '70s helped her with her range and phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   -- The name: At 19, Loveless married drummer Terry Lovelace. The
marriage didn't last, but she kept _ and altered _ his name.
</P>
<P>
   -- Married to: Her producer, Emory Gordy, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   -- What a year: In February, she was nominated for three 1998
Grammy Awards for country album of the year (``Long Stretch of
Lonesome''), best country female performance (``The Trouble With
the Truth''), and best country vocal collaboration (``You Don't
Seem to Miss Me'' with George Jones). The Academy of Country Music
also named her top female vocalist. On Sept. 23, she's up for four
Country Music Association awards.
</P>
<P>
   -- Favorite movie: ``Contact,'' because _ like the heroine in
the film _ Loveless maintains a ham radio license.

   What do a vampire slayer, a birth control activist, and a
cybersex editrix have in common? They're all women, for one thing.
For another, they're on George ($2.95) magazine's list of the ``20
Most Fascinating Women in Politics.'' Guest contributors including
Bob Dole, Lindy Boggs and Dennis Rodman (yes, Dennis Rodman) offer
their views on Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer),
Jane Fonda (activist) and Lisa Palac (cyber siren). Others include
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Venus Williams, Mary Bono, Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson, Tina Brown and Monica Lewinsky. Ronald Reagan's
daughter Patti Davis speculates why the former White House intern's
15 minutes of fame have lasted for months. ``We don't care that a
young woman is apparently being manipulated by every man in her
life,'' Davis writes. ``We watch her like we watch a soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in George, Rosalynn Carter makes the list of the ``Top 10
Most Forceful First Ladies,'' and excerpts from a new book, ``Empty
Without You,'' details the love affair of another first lady _
Eleanor Roosevelt _ and the cigar-smoking journalist Lorena Hickok.
</P>
<P>
   DOING AFTER DI: A year after Princess Diana's death, People
($2.79) revisits the royal family and others to find out how their
lives have changed. The young princes are thriving, Charles and his
mother seem more human, and Camilla Parker-Bowles can now enter
through the front door. And what of Di's brother, Charles Spencer?
Apparently his finest moment was his eloquent eulogy. The British
public no longer has a taste for the man known as Champagne
Charlie, particularly after an acrimonious divorce.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEWSWEEKLIES: Sometimes the best-laid plans go awry.
Immediately following President Clinton's sort of mea culpa last
Monday, Time ($2.95) rushed to press with a special midweek
edition. Unfortunately, the magazine missed the other big story of
the week: the U.S. missile strike on terrorist strongholds in
Afghanistan and Sudan. Newsweek ($2.95), following its usual
schedule, scores a bull's-eye with a detailed article on the attack
and the U.S. war on terrorism. Meanwhile, back at the White House,
Newsweek reports that Hillary Rodham Clinton was said to have been
furious at her husband's ``foolishness'' with Monica Lewinsky. So
were some of the celebrity experts Newsweek polled about the
president's speech. ``The whole thing was pitiful to watch,'' says
Atlanta's Dr. Frank Pittman. Feminist author Camille Paglia agreed.
``I am completely disgusted,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ALLY AND THE FAMILY: In a 556-page issue as heavy as a fat
feline, Harper's Bazaar ($3) manages to wedge a fluffy but
entertaining article on Calista Flockhart between the fashion and
fragrance ads. Cute and flaky as lawyer Ally McBeal, the poster
girl for postfeminism talks about the choices she faces in her
career and private life. One of them is related to the dancing
cyberbaby that appears on the show occasionally. And, in a
companion article, James Servin writes about how TV newswomen such
as Hannah Storm and Katie Couric view themselves as style-setters.
It's not enough to be good, Servin says _ they have to look good.
And that means no more helmet hair.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD ADVICE: In a truly educational article, Life ($3.99) asks
dozens of Americans from Tony Bennett to Frank McCourt to name the
best or worst thing they learned in school. The most valuable
lessons pertain to life skills rather than names and dates of
historical events. Sam Pickering, the model for the teacher in
``Dead Poets Society,'' recalls his terrible record as an athlete.
``I struck out seven straight times when I played baseball. Sports
taught me that my days were going to be ordinary, and instead of
dreaming about the extraordinary and faraway, I learned to
appreciate, and love, the familial and the neighborly.''

 &HT;    Second Titantic soundtrack proves that ``My Heart Will Go On''
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Titanic'' sails again today _ only this time it's not the
ship, the Oscar-winning movie or the home video. It's ``Back to
Titanic,'' the followup to the first soundtrack, which Sony Music
says has worldwide sales of 25 million CDs and cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   The album contains music conducted by James Horner, who won two
Academy Awards for his ``Titanic'' score, and the radio-mix version
of Celine Dion's hit ``My Heart Will Go On,'' which features
dialogue between the film's Jack Dawson (Leonard DiCaprio) and Rose
DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). Also included are two takes of
``Nearer My God to Thee'' and some Irish dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Paramount Video, which has announced plans to ship 20
million copies of the ``Titanic'' video to retailers Sept. 1, Sony
won't say how many copies of the soundtrack are going to stores.
Calvin Thorbourne, a manager at a HMV Music in Atlanta, said the
store will have ``a lot'' of copies of ``Back to Titanic.'' HMV
will sell CDs for $13.99 and cassettes for $10.99. The Best Buy on
U.S. 41 in Atlanta says the CD will be $11.99, the cassette $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much demand there will be is the question. ``I have no
idea what to predict,'' said Geoff Mayfield, Billboard's Los
Angeles-based pop chart expert. ``The 'Titanic' sequel has a better
shot than most followup soundtrack albums. But people who bought
the first album already have an aural souvenir of the movie, so
will they buy the second?''

 &HT;    Doherty plays another modern witch
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new fall TV season has stars from past series who are
starting over with new characters and shows. This week, we're
taking a look at five of them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who: Shannen Doherty
</P>
<P>
   -- Best known as: Brenda Walsh, one of the original teens of
``Beverly Hills, 90210.'' A vixen on-screen with a reputation
offscreen as troubled and a troublemaker, Doherty left in 1994 amid
``I Hate Brenda'' clubs and much bad press.
</P>
<P>
   -- Next known as: Prue Halliwell, one of a trio of reluctant
witches who are also sisters in the campy WB drama ``Charmed,''
which debuts Oct. 7 after ``Dawson's Creek.'' (Holly Marie Combs of
``Picket Fences'' and Alyssa Milano co-star.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Dramatic stretch: This time she's literally a witch.
</P>
<P>
   -- Between shows: Did a bunch of TV movies, ranging from ``The
Margaret Mitchell Story'' to cheesy erotica such as ``Blindfold.''
Also did the feature film ``Mallrats.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Behind the scenes: Aaron Spelling, who produces ``90210'' and
``Charmed,'' says he talked to Doherty about returning to ``90210''
this season, but she wanted a new show. She says she still might do
a guest shot as Brenda on some unscheduled finale episode.
</P>
<P>
   -- Looking back: One line in the pilot has been getting laughs:
when Doherty says, ``You made me a witch,'' and Combs replies,
``You were born one.'' ``It was definitely not a play on my image
at all,'' Doherty says. ``Unfortunately, there are quite a few
journalists who refuse to be more imaginative and go with something
else. And if they choose to stick me with that, then that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Why she's back: ``Oh, maybe the weekly paycheck,'' she jokes.
``I once joked that there are film snobs and that I was going to be
a TV snob that would only do TV.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Preparing for the role: ``I did in fact go out and I bought
about 10 books on witchcraft. I walked in and said, `OK, I need
everything you've got on witchcraft.' I'm sure that somebody at a
bookstore thinks I'm just a complete freak.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Coming Wednesday: Jerry Stiller

 &HT;    Georgia's capital filling in for ``The Big Easy''
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta isn't exactly New Orleans but that won't stop TNT
from making a movie there with Andre Braugher starting next month
that's set in Lousiana's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
   The cable network is scouting locations in metro Atlanta for
``Passing Glory,'' based on a true story about a young black priest
who challenges segregationist conventions in New Orleans by
organizing a basketball game between an undefeated black team and
an all-white prep school squad.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher, an Emmy nominee this year for his final season on
NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' will portray Father Paul
Verrett.
</P>
<P>
   The film's producers is a heady list of big-name celebs,
including Quincy Jones and Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson. Directing will
be Steve James (``Hoop Dreams,'' ``Prefontaine'').
</P>
<P>
   Filming is tentatively scheduled to start Sept. 22 and will
likely last from five to six weeks.

IRAQ AND U.S. HARDEN DEMANDS IN U.N. WEAPONS STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States and Iraq hardened their
positions Monday over Baghdad's decision to end cooperation with
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have begun pressing for an end to
periodic sanctions reviews, which would have the effect of keeping
Iraq permanently under a crushing embargo ``until they're back on
the reservation,'' a Western diplomat said. The last review was in
April; the next is scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq insists on a more friendly inspection system and perhaps
another visit, or at least a new initiative, from Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, bypassing the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The new statements of resolve _ stopping well short of any kind
of military threat on Washington's part _ followed a report to the
Security Council on Monday morning by Annan's special envoy to Iraq
on his unsuccessful attempt last week to persuade the Iraqi
government to resume cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Prakash Shah, an Indian diplomat, told the council
members that in two essentially perfunctory meetings with Iraqi
officials in Baghdad earlier this month he had been told that the
United Nations was offering nothing new and therefore there was
nothing to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the deputy U.S. representative said that Shah
``basically said to the council that he's gotten nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. position is that we will be consulting this week,
looking toward a council resolution on Iraq,'' Burleigh said.
``We're suggesting the suspension of sanctions reviews until Iraq
comes back into cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative to the United Nations, said
Baghdad still wants a new body of inspectors to replace the
existing U.N. Special Commission, known as Unscom, which is
responsible for dismantling biological and chemical weapons,
missile systems, and the means to produce them. Iraq has also
stopped cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which monitors nuclear developments.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon also did not rule out shutting down all future technical
monitoring and surveillance of Iraq in addition to ending surprise
visits by U.N. inspectors, which were terminated on Aug. 5. He said
all options remained open to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stopped all cooperation with Unscom,'' Hamdoon told
reporters, ``and we are waiting the genuine move on the council's
part to address Iraq's concerns.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Most important is the restructuring of Unscom as a body,''
Hamdoon said. ``Unless this restructuring takes place, Iraq finds
it very difficult _ almost impossible _ to have any meaningful
cooperation with Unscom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon's pitch to bring the secretary general into direct
negotiations with Iraq again is meeting a cooler reception from
Annan's aides this time, diplomats said. He reached an agreement
with Iraq at meetings there in February, averting a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which was not enthusiastic about the involvement of
the secretary general earlier this year, now seems intent on
keeping him in the forefront of the debate with Iraq, some council
members say. Iraq has violated its agreement with Annan as well as
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Another trip to Baghdad by Annan has been discussed only in
general and preliminary terms, diplomats say. Iraq has not invited
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the Security Council, Iraq is growing more isolated,
diplomats said Monday. More countries are demanding that Iraq
resume cooperation before there can be any effort to re-examine
sanctions.

PAKISTAN SAYS U.S. MISSILE LANDED THERE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ An unexploded American missile, believed
to be a stray from last week's attack on suspected guerrilla
training centers in Afghanistan, has been found in a remote area of
Pakistan, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This proves that Pakistani airspace was violated during the
missile barrage, the ministry said in a statement, adding that a
formal complaint would be made to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The government's accusation seemed to confirm earlier reports
that a missile had been found Saturday near Kharan, in a sparsely
inhabited area of the Baluchistan desert.
</P>
<P>
   Panic-stricken villagers discovered the long object lodged in
the sand and informed local authorities, press reports said, and a
precautionary evacuation was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The missile was handed over to the military, the Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials here had little to say about the allegation.
``The government of Pakistan brought this story to our attention,
and we are looking into it,'' said Richard Hoagland, spokesman for
the American Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   If the missile did indeed come down within Pakistan, it gives
the government another opportunity to express its indignation about
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the attack on the camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan had
said that a missile had fallen within its soil, killing several
people. To Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's embarrassment, this charge
was then deemed incorrect and had to be withdrawn. Sharif fired his
intelligence chief for passing along the faulty information.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pakistan's protests about the American attack have been
delicately measured, attempting to mollify its angry citizens while
at the same time not distancing itself unnecessarily from the
United States, whose influence might be needed to help Pakistan out
of its economic crisis. The country is close to defaulting on
billions of dollars in international loans.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's quandary, partly resulting from economic sanctions
imposed after Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in May, was addressed
in an editorial in Monday's issue of the newspaper Dawn: ``We know
that the United States has a major role to play in any softening or
lifting of sanctions, and yet we now find ourselves in a position
where we cannot in any stretch of diplomatic cleverness condone the
U.S. moves against Afghanistan and Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   The country is rife with conflicting rumors: that the government
had advance knowledge of the attack and betrayed its allies in
Afghanistan; that the government tipped off the main target, Osama
bin Laden, who is accused by the United States of financing
terrorist attacks, thus saving his life, and that the government
actually attempted to finger bin Laden and pinpoint his
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants here have insisted that Pakistan was a willing
helpmate for the United States' attack in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   One group, the Jammat-I-Islami, has charged that, in preparation
for the attack, American warships breached Pakistani waters in the
Arabian Sea and that the Pakistani navy chose to ignore this
menacing military presence.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Foreign Ministry was complaining Monday about
American violations of Pakistani airspace, the Defense Ministry
dismissed any notion of American encroachment in its seas, saying
the warships were ``well clear'' of its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that national interests not be compromised by
making wild statements,'' said a Defense Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, the Taliban leader, Mohammad Omar, continued
what has become a running commentary on the behavior of his
country's guest, bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Omar was quoted by the Afghan Islamic Press as saying that bin
Laden had contritely accepted Omar's rebukes of the day before,
promising to make no more threats against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him to refrain from such activities and Osama bin
Laden has accepted our advice and promised to abide by it,'' said
Omar, according to the Pakistan-based news agency.

GERMANY FINDS RUSSIA'S PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY WORRISOME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As Russia staggers through its financial
crisis, few countries are watching with more anxiety than Germany.
</P>
<P>
   German banks are by far the biggest lenders to Russia, with
about $30 billion in outstanding loans. The German government has
guaranteed repayment of most of that money, and stands to lose
billions if the loans go completely sour.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the economic concerns, Germans worry about the political
fallout. Having fought Russia in both world wars and having been
trapped for decades at the epicenter of the cold war, many Germans
are deeply troubled by prospects of a Russian meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern of the government is on the political side,''
said Per Fischer, vice president of Commerzbank in charge of
lending to Russia. ``We cannot let Russia, a superpower so near to
Germany, fall deeper and deeper into crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   German political and business leaders did what they could Monday
to calm the markets and the public. Gunter Rexrodt, minister of
economics, quickly announced that the government would continue
guaranteeing loans to Russia as long as Russia carries out the
reforms it has promised the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a strong interest in a sustained stabilization of
the situation in Russia,'' Rexrodt said. He quickly endorsed the
``experience and recognition'' of Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was
re-appointed as Russian prime minister after having been dismissed
in March.
</P>
<P>
   But others were grim. Jurgen Stark, a senior official in the
German Finance Ministry who is becoming a director of the central
bank, warned Monday that the crises in Russia and Asia had
increased the risks of a global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a phase in which the global financial system is
highly vulnerable to a crisis,'' Stark said, adding that they could
present the ``greatest challenge of the last 70 years.''
</P>
<P>
   German banks have played an important role in Russia for many
years, but that role grew considerably after the Berlin wall fell
in 1990. As Communism collapsed throughout Central Europe and the
Soviet Union, German manufacturers turned eastward to capitalize on
their central geographic position as well as their ability to
supply the material and equipment for rebuilding those countries.
</P>
<P>
   German banks provided the financing for German exports to Russia
as well as for investment in development projects. And the German
government, primarily through an export-promotion agency called
Hermes, guaranteed the vast majority of the debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the German Ministry of Economics, Hermes is
guaranteeing more than $30 billion in debt to Russian projects.
Although the Russian government has imposed a 90-day moratorium on
repayment of foreign debts, it has said it will continue to honor
government debt.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, industry analysts believe the Russian loans
could have a negative impact on the German budget. But many of the
loans don't come due for years and no one knows how many of them
may go into default.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The uncertainty undercut the German stock market last week,
particularly bank stocks like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. But
the banks insist they are fairly secure because the government is
backing so many of the loans. Deutsche Bank has said its
``exposure'' to Russian loans is about $750 million and Commerzbank
has said its exposure exceeds $100 million. But bank executives say
they have already taken loan-loss provisions for about half that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this long record of support, there was a suggestion
Monday that Germany might have done more to avert the current
crisis. Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington, told the newspaper
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Russia's problems might have
been mitigated if Chancellor Helmut Kohl had lobbied fellow
European leaders forcefully to supply aid last week.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Hauser, the German government spokesman, said those remarks
were baseless.
</P>
<P>
   For many years Kohl had political as well as economic reasons to
support relations with Russia. It was Mikhail Gorbachev who let it
be known that Russia would not block the reunification of Germany,
a moral debt that Kohl highlighted on Sunday as he talked about the
reunification of Germany in a campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, German bankers and government officials found
themselves scrambling just to find someone to talk to in Moscow.
Monday was supposed to be the day that Russian government leaders
sat down with Western banks, led by Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan,
to discuss a restructuring of payment on Russian bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But bankers said it was impossible even to begin discussions,
because Russia didn't have a real government in place. The Russians
were represented by the deputy chairman of the Russian central
bank, and European banks generally sent local representatives
rather than top executives from their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, of Commerzbank, said German bankers were worried about
an absence of capable financial managers in Russia and had even
contemplated offering to lend Russia some of their own experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is that the Russians find the necessary
managerial skills,'' he said. ``We feel the Russians are lacking,
to a certain extent, the competence and the good people to manage
the massive problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, European political leaders divided their time Monday
between insisting that Russia follow through on its economic
reforms and declaring that the Russian crisis would have no severe
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian crisis will have no decisive impact on European
growth,'' asserted Jacques Santer, president of the European
Commission, speaking at a symposium in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl spoke with Yeltsin over the weekend, aides told reporters
in Bonn, and told him that he had to follow through on reforms. The
most important reform is the tax system, which has become
increasingly incapable of collecting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in a frank admission of the limits to outside pressure,
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Monday that Western
governments would ultimately have to deal with whomever ends up in
power in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it makes any sense for us to get mixed up in
creating the Russia government,'' Waigel told German news agencies
Monday. ``We have to work together with the people that are
named.'' &QL;

MOB INFORMANT INVOKES FIFTH AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Repeatedly confronted on the witness stand with an FBI
paper trail detailing his years informing on the Mafia _ including
dinner meetings with mob bosses in the North End and a personal
introduction to the head of the Patriarca crime family _ Stephen
Flemmi had a ready response.
</P>
<P>
   He took the Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In his third day of testimony in US District Court, Flemmi
invoked his right against self-incrimination more than 70 times,
refusing even to admit to the inside information he'd given his FBI
handler, H. Paul Rico, in series of informant reports filed by Rico
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, who helped the FBI bug mob hangouts and dismantle the
Mafia hierarchy during three decades of sporadic informing, refused
to acknowledge his dealings with the crime family he infiltrated,
and would not talk about his role in several murders, dating to the
late 1960s, with which he is currently charged.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a wide-ranging racketeering indictment that charges
him with four killings and accuses his Winter Hill Gang with a
decades-long conspiracy with the Mafia, Flemmi wouldn't say
anything too incriminating _ even though federal prosecutors
promised it wouldn't be used against him when Flemmi is tried on
those charges, which stem from a series of indictments in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Only reluctantly did Flemmi admit to running a gambling and
loansharking operation in Boston's Roxbury section in the 1960s;
``It was a way of life in them days,'' he said. But he preferred to
portray himself as someone ``mainly involved in real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi dodged questions from federal prosecutor Fred M. Wyshak
Jr. about his early contact with Rico, and was evasive about Rico's
rationale for asking him to visit the North End. ``He wouldn't send
me down there to play whist,'' said Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trusted you because of the level of criminal activity
that you were involved in with them?'' Wyshak asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' Flemmi replied.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi refused to answer questions about the murders of brothers
Edward Bennett, Walter Bennett and William F. Bennett, who were
killed within months of each other during a gangland war in 1967,
or the murder of Richard Grasso that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi was more talkative, however, about the core claim
underlying pretrial hearings before US District Judge Mark L. Wolf:
that he was promised immunity from prosecution in exchange for
information he provided the FBI on the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never convicted for anything in the '60s _ nothing _ and
I was involved in criminal acts,'' Flemmi said during nearly four
hours of cross-examination by Wyshak.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically what Rico did to keep him out of jail, Flemmi
answered, ``He never really spelled it out for me who he would go
to. I just expected it. ... I was looking for results, I got the
results I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claims he escaped prosecution because of his deal with
the FBI and is asking Wolf to throw out the 1995 indictments
charging him, his fugitive criminal partner James ``Whitey''
Bulger, New England Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme and two others
with a decades-long criminal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   A string of present and former FBI agents and supervisors,
including Rico, &UR;  &LR; has denied that Bulger and Flemmi were given
permission to commit any crime short of murder, as Flemmi contends.
The government argues that even if rogue agents made such a promise
it would not be legally enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claims that when he returned to Boston in 1974, after
five years on the run from charges that he bombed the car of a
Boston attorney, Rico got a fugitive warrant dropped and helped him
get released on bail. Flemmi was never tried for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Rico, now retired from the FBI, testified in January that he
never engineered Flemmi's surrender or played any role in getting
the charges against him dismissed. He also denied tipping Flemmi
off to the car-bombing indictment so he could flee.
</P>
<P>
   But Rico also acknowledged that the FBI never launched an
investigation into Flemmi's criminal activities, even after he
reported to them that he had severely beaten a man.

BBO-HOMERS (Los Angeles) _ Baseball has had an understandable
fascination with the pursuit of its home run record this season.
Questions of ``if'' have begun to give way to ``when.'' Unlike some
other hitting standards in baseball _ Ted Williams' .400-plus
average, Hack Wilson's 190 RBI _ the direct assault on Roger Maris'
61 home runs has generated a sense of inevitability. And raised the
bar in baseball. It wouldn't be startling if St. Louis' Mark
McGwire finished with 60 home runs this year only to have the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa whack 62 next year. Or to have McGwire get
63 this year and have Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. put up 61 next
year. ``After McGwire and them finish this year,'' said former
Cincinnati and Detroit manager Sparky Anderson, ``I think the
standard will be set there, and somebody's got to be 55 or 60 every
year. I don't believe we'll ever have the top dog under 55. It's
just there... Twenty years from now, it could be 60 every year.'' &QL;

STRIP PINGPONG (Peoria, Ariz.) - Two Peoria firefighters, a male
and female, have been reprimanded by the city for playing strip
pingpong while on duty, but some firefighters complain the pair
should have been fired. They accuse the city of granting special
treatment to the female, Jacqueline Verdone, who pocketed a $68,250

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In all of Mexico, no place has been shaped by
destiny or scarred by history more than the enormous concrete
square in this city's heart that is known by some as the ``gran
tortilla'' and most simply as the Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   This is the very spot where Cortes sweet-talked the Aztec
Emperor Montezuma into believing his intentions were noble; where
Gen. Winfield Scott triumphantly declared the American victory over
Mexico in 1847; where one Mexican president after another has come
to receive the adulation _ or scorn _ of masses of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a potent symbol as much as a physical space, the
Zocalo often succumbs to the ambitions of politicians who impose
their own touches on the long stains of its history. Over the
centuries, successive leaders have arrived and undone the work of
their predecessors so their own efforts can be better seen.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's new mayor, who is expected to be a candidate for
president in 2000, is no exception. What is very different is the
process he intends to use to remake the Zocalo, and the message
that underlies the project.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is Mexico City's first elected mayor. A
former member of the long-ruling government party who bolted to the
opposition a decade ago, Cardenas has struggled throughout his
first year in office to bring a new, open style to what had been a
rigidly autocratic government. Mexico City residents are still
waiting to see if anything really changes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs. Just over a month ago, to celebrate a
Mexican Arbor Day, an environmental fair was held in the Zocalo, a
first.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was as significant for Mexico City as the issue. The
city is one of the most polluted on earth. Many of the mayor's
supporters combine environmentalism with left-leaning politics, and
they want him to do something about the foul air.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal called for the use of ethanol in the city's
enormous car fleet, which will happen soon. Another was to raise
consciousness about the environment by planting trees in the
860,000-square-foot Zocalo, where the only shade now is the dark
sliver projected by an enormous metal flagpole directly in its
center.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new Environmental Secretary, Alejandro Encinas
Rodriguez, liked the idea. But this being an administration made up
of former radicals, a radical decision was made: The people of
Mexico City would actually be asked what they wanted done with the
Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   A display was set up in the square showing old lithographs from
the many times in the past that the plaza had trees, walkways and
benches. There also were photos taken after 1958, when a strongman
mayor, Ernesto Uruchurtu, decided that an open plaza would
emphasize the monumentality of the surrounding landmarks _ the
brooding 16th-century Metropolitan Cathedral, the immense National
Palace and the grand City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the survey were three-to-one for trees, and for
the first time in a long while, Mexico City buzzed with talk about
something other than crime, pollution or the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we effectively touched the most sensitive nerves of
the country,'' said Encinas. ``The reaction was far greater than
anyone expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the survey, newspapers, magazines and television programs
have been filled with discussion of the Zocalo, not all favoring
the city's proposal. ``A farce and a useless expense,'' a
forestation specialist, Silvia Loera, told one columnist. In
another article, Jesus Galvan, a local congressman, called the
project cosmetic and said its only purpose was to flatter Cardenas'
image.
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey of Mexicans in the Zocalo on a recent weekend
found varied opinions. ``I don't like the idea at all,'' said
Patricia Alcantara, a 35-year-old homemaker. ``They're going to
turn the Zocalo into a rat's nest, a garbage dump.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ramirez Fuentes, 31, called the plan ``a magnificent
idea,'' because it would restore some of the city's splendor.
Ismael Ibanez, 69, said he remembered when the Zocalo was green.
``It was very nice, with benches and fountains,'' he said. ``If
they are going to put trees in again, I think it will be very
popular, if there are no demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Encinas says that raises a sore point, as many people are
concerned that the only thing trees would clear the air of is civic
expression. Traditionally, as many as 30 groups a day have come to
the Zocalo to protest. Some rallies are huge. Others are as small
as the little tent in which Don Pedro Jaso and his donkey, El
Chaparro, have been camped for the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Don Pedro, 87, is involved in a land dispute in his home state
of San Luis Potosi, 265 miles north. He and El Chaparro walked to
Mexico City and have camped in the Zocalo because he wants
President Ernesto Zedillo to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   His banner facing the National Palace says as much, but no
president has had an office in the palace for decades. That does
not dissuade Don Pedro, who believes that simply being in the heart
of Mexico fortifies his demands even if the president only ``comes
by for a ceremony every once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Encinas, who in his 22 years in the opposition helped organize
mass meetings in the Zocalo, said the city planned to keep open
areas in front of the National Palace and City Hall to accommodate
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks that maintaining the entire Zocalo as open space
supports the way of thinking that was prevalent in Mexico in the
late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they made this big tortilla of concrete,'' he said, ``the
imperial presidency had reached its height. They took away the
trees to have one huge field from which to adulate the president
when he stood on the balcony of the National Palace during parades
and celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, presidents do preside over a crammed Zocalo during
celebrations for Independence Day and Labor Day, among others. But
to a populist like Encinas, monumental plazas belong only in
countries with a cult of power _ Red Square in Moscow and Tiananmen
Square in Beijing _ and not in today's Mexico, even though Cardenas
hopes to stand on the same presidential balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Encinas said there would be a public competition to select a
landscaping design. He expects to have a winner by the end of this
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He had no estimate of the cost but said he was sure he could get
big businesses to sponsor the work. He said the city might also
take advantage of the renovation to undertake deep archeological
digs for the remains of Montezuma's city, which are about 20 feet
below the surface. One idea is to open permanent tunnels into the
site for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   When the former radicals in City Hall used to fill the Zocalo
with protesters, they understood well the plaza's importance to
Mexico. Now they want to fill the gran tortilla with trees, and
they want something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is all about in the end is not whether to plant a
couple of precious trees and install a few fountains,'' Encinas
said. ``What we've opened up for discussion in Mexico is how we are
going to get the people to take back control of their own city.''

TREASURER SAYS STOREOWNER WON'T BE ALLOWED TO COLLECT BONUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Treasurer Joseph D. Malone vowed Monday that variety
store Nick Havan, who claimed ownership of a $21 million winning
lottery ticket, will not get his lottery license back or collect a
standard bonus from the state for selling a jackpot winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I have anything to say about it, we will work to
prevent Mr. Havan from turning back on his lottery machine or
collecting the $25,000 commission,'' the Massachusetts official
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Laurence Johnson, Havan's lawyer, said Monday he has a suit
pending in Superior Court seeking payment of the $25,000
commission. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's pledge came as he handed a $704,597 check to Paraskeve
Kantges, the 72-year-old Watertown woman who was ruled the winner
of the Mass Millions jackpot. The check is the first of 20 annual
payments that will be issued to the widow.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also presented Kantges with a second check Monday for
$25,501, the amount of interest earned on her winnings while the
dispute was pending.
</P>
<P>
   She was formally declared the winner last week after Havan
withdrew his claim to the jackpot when Kantges agreed to give him
part of her winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Havan and Kantges agreed to ``apportion'' the prize
but keep the details secret. A source familiar with the settlement
said Havan will receive $1 million to drop his claim, which could
have dragged on for years in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, it has been clear to me that Mrs.
Kantges has been telling the truth and it's nice that good things
happen to honest people,'' Malone said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the dispute erupted in February, Malone accused Havan of
``lying shamelessly'' and said the store owner was trying to
defraud Kantges.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges said she phoned in the winning Mass Millions bet to
Havan at Coolidge Provisions &UR;  &LR; in Watertown on Feb. 5, along with 95
other bets. But when she went to pick up her tickets at the store
the next day, the winning ticket was not among the pile.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Havan insisted he bought the winning ticket himself after
Kantges changed her mind and canceled the bet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Lottery Commission declared Kantges the winner, after
retired Superior Court Judge Robert Steadman, who heard the
evidence in the case, recommended that they do so.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges has records showing that she has played the winning
combination, &UR;  &LR; 4-6-10-16-19-25, for years. She said the number
signifies her birth, at 4 a.m. on the sixth day of the week Oct.
16, 1925. She says she never canceled the winning bet.
</P>
<P>
   Steadman told the commission it should reject the claim of a
third person, Sonya Bardakjian of Watertown, and award Kantges the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Bardakjian, the third claimant, gave the same story as
Kantges. She said she phoned in a bet with the winning number to
Coolidge Provisions along with 36 other bets Feb. 5, and the next
day Havan gave her all the tickets except the winning one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But Steadman said a review of Bardakjian's bets established
that she never played the winning number.

FIREFIGHTERS DISCIPLINED FOR STRIP PING PONG SESSION

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. - Two firefighters, a male and female, have been
reprimanded by Peoria for playing ``strip Ping Pong'' at a Peoria
fire station.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters, Mario Bravo and Jackie Verdone, were the focus
of a heavily edited investigative report that was released Monday
by City Attorney Steve Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the written reprimands, some Peoria firefighters
complained that Fire Chief Mike Fusco should have handed pink slips
to the pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody else would have been fired,'' said one firefighter,
who asked that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fusco said he took the steps that were appropriate,
saying he did what was reasonable under the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as firefighters wanting more, we're not going to be
intimidated by vigilante tactics,'' he said. ``I have not been
contacted by any firefighter in the field about the level of
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusco said no special favors were granted to Verdone, 37, who
rocked the Peoria Fire Department last year by complaining she was
secretly videotaped while changing her clothes in a dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Her allegation led to the resignation of Jerry Franzmeier, a
Peoria fire captain accused of sparking the scandal by setting up
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Verdone had stripped down to her panties and bra before she
discovered the camera, according to a lawsuit that Verdone filed
against Franzmeier earlier this year, seeking $1.5 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   She later agreed to drop the action after Franzmeier and his
lawyer, Tom Crowe, filed court papers accusing her of defamation,
according to documents in Maricopa County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Verdone was paid $68,250 by Peoria to settle a
civil-rights grievance filed against the city over the camera
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's investigative report said that while on duty earlier
this year, Bravo and Verdone engaged in a round of table tennis in
which the loser of a point or game agreed to remove an item of
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't strip down to their underwear, but their conduct
warranted disciplinary action under city regulations, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators failed to reach a conclusion on another allegation
accusing Bravo and Verdone of engaging in ``phone sex'' while on
duty at a fire station.
</P>
<P>
   They were accused of using their personal cellular telephones to
engage in sexually explicit talk with each other while in different
rooms at the station, but the report said the allegation could not
be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Verdone, who joined the Fire Department in May 1996, refused to
discuss the matter when reached on her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment and that is my official comment,'' Verdone
said. ``And I don't want to be bothered with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravo, a 14-month Peoria employee, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tellef, a Fire Department spokesman, said he understands
how firefighters may be unhappy about the reprimands, but added,
``The matter is essentially over.'' &QL;

 POZZI SERVES SANTORO AN UNEXPECTED DEFEAt  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ You're never too old to be on a tennis court,
or so it seems. Take Gianluca Pozzi of Italy. He makes a habit of
defying the odds and rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Pozzi, 33, did that Monday with a first-round
victory over sixth-seeded Fabrice Santoro that got the weeklong MFS
Pro Championship off to a rousing start. Pozzi, ranked No. 62 and
the oldest player on the ATP Tour, had little trouble in a 6-2, 6-2
victory at Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   There were other significant casualties on day one, not the
least of which was Vince Spadea, the No. 8 seed, who withdrew at
the last minute because of an injured right wrist. That opened the
door for ``Lucky Loser'' Steven Campbell, who had lost in the
qualifying round but was reinstated to fill Spadea's vacancy.
Campbell lasted only long enough to lose in straight sets to
teen-ager Xavier Malisse, 6-3, 6-1. Malisse, ranked 411th, was
playing in his third career match as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Cedric Pioline survived his opener, beating Adrian
Voinea, 6-4, 6-0. Big guns Michael Chang and Karol Kucera make
their debut today.
</P>
<P>
   Pozzi didn't play like a 33-year-old. He patrolled the baselines
and returned most of Santoro's deep volleys. When Santoro tried to
chip and charge, he couldn't execute and Pozzi took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play as long as I feel good,'' said Pozzi, ``and as long
as I'm in the rankings. I'm not looking towards the senior tour. I
can't get there for a couple of years. You have to be 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've faced highly ranked players before, and even beat some of
them in important matches. It's not like I'm ranked in the
hundreds. In 1993, I beat both Ivan Lendl and Andrei Medvedev. This
year I beat Marcelo Rios in Great Britian.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 13 years on the tour, Pozzi has seen America's best, but
he hasn't always found a way to win. He is 0-4 against Pete
Sampras, 0-2 against Jim Courier, and 0-1 against Andre Agassi. But
on any given day ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a solid match today,'' said Pozzi. ``I stayed quite
deep and didn't make as many mistakes. That's what I have to do. I
know I'm getting older and I see a lot of young players around.
Experience doesn't always help. But you keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Santoro wasn't happy with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to go to the net on hardcourt,'' he said. ``But today I
wasn't good enough to play an aggressive game. I was very slow on
the court. No energy. I had trouble making a point because I had no
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, a wild-card entry, made quick work of Voinea in a
morning match. The first question asked didn't concern his victory
but his appearance in this tournament as a last-minute entry. In
the MFS Pro field, only Kucera (9) and Jonas Bjorkman (12) are
ranked higher than Pioline (17).
</P>
<P>
   ``With the US Open coming up, I came here rather than take a
week off,'' said Pioline. ``I called Friday morning and asked if
there might be a spot. There was, thankfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play sets and get ready for the Open. In Cincinnati
and Indianapolis, I lost each time in the second round. I think I
can play very good. But sometimes I have bad results. I need to be
more consistent during the year and play some very good
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   One qualifier who did well was Sebastien Grosjean, who
eliminated John van Lottum, 6-2, 6-0. In the closest match of the
day, Kenneth Carlsen beat Jerome Golmard, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

SUDANESE SCHOLAR SAYS U.S. HAS MADE BIN LADEN A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: ATTACK-RDP, ATTACK-U.N., ATTACK-PAKISTAN) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ A normally serene scholar of Islam named
Abdulrahman Abuzayd, who believes passionately in the wisdom of his
religion and its values, is furious at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He is no friend of the National Islamic Front's government in
Sudan. Indeed, two years ago, it burned his office at the
university he led and forced him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   He also is unhappy that the government invited Osama bin Laden,
considered a top financier of terrorism by the United States, to
take refuge in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But sending cruise missiles, he says, is no way to deal with
extremists _ and no way to deal with a government that may or may
not have allowed a factory to make a compound of a nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Sudanese I'm mad,'' said Abuzayd, as he sat on his
veranda, which looks over the urban landscape of low-slung,
khaki-colored homes, a sun-bleached dusty road and an occasional
wandering goat. ``OK, we have problems with this regime. But we
solve them ourselves. Now the Americans have come and given it a
big shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   He has the same concern about bin Laden, whose image _ with a
long black beard and varying styles of headgear _ is now flashed
around the world. ``The Americans have suddenly created a Muslim
hero out of him, whereas last week he was considered a fanatic
nut,'' Abuzayd said. ``Now he is a hero in Saudi Arabia, in
Islamabad, in Cairo, in all capitals of the Muslim world.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made serious missteps, he said, first by
failing to convince the Muslim world that bin Laden was responsible
for the bombings of American embassies in East Africa and then by
attacking Afghanistan and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``By its strikes in Afghanistan and here, America did not
eliminate terrorism,'' Abuzayd said. ``This is not terrorism _ this
is a resurging Muslim world. You don't deal with it with cruise
missiles, you discuss it. You don't rub the entire Muslim world's
nose in the dirt and make it kneel.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuzayd is upset because he has long articulated an Islam that
is tolerant and free of corruption. At Omdurman Ahlia University, a
private institution largely financed by the Kuwaiti government, he
introduced a wide range of courses for male and female students and
tried to keep the radical influence of the governing Islamic Front
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   After being forced out, he was hired by the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees for an unusual task: to travel as a
Muslim scholar among the Taliban in Afghanistan to talk about
questions of justice and education.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that most of his countrymen believe in his kind of
Islam, too. But now he and others here complain that the unilateral
American action will be likely to reinforce anti-Western sentiment
in Sudan, which has become increasingly isolated in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy closed here nearly two years ago, after the
United States contended that the Sudanese government had not done
enough to close down camps for training terrorists. Many European
embassies have scaled back and cut their aid.
</P>
<P>
   Before, it was not uncommon to see a European face on the
ramshackle streets of the capital. Now it is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most Western officials now concede that the training camps have
been closed down. Abuzayd also said he believes that the camps have
been shuttered _ in part, he said, because the government had
established a network of domestic security services and did not
feel the need for the extra security that the training camps
provided.
</P>
<P>
   The government also acquiesced to demands from the United States
and some moderate Arab countries that bin Laden be expelled from
here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats have said that even though the government
here persists in fighting a pernicious civil war in the south and
precludes any real pluralist politics, it was a mistake not to
reward it for the attempts at change.
</P>
<P>
   For many in Sudan and the rest of the Muslim world, this lack of
response, and now the attack on the pharmaceutical plant, contrasts
sharply with the American attitude toward Israel, Abuzayd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't help but be compared to what is going on in Israel,''
he said. ``They kick out Arab settlers, uproot their homes and
nothing happens. I believe that almost all young Muslims are
radicalized by the Israeli behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel,
he said, ``Netanyahu is the ugliest face of arrogance caused by
unflinching levels of American support.''
</P>
<P>
   The historical reasons for the violence of bin Laden and other
Muslim radicals was also important for the United States to
consider, Abuzayd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden is not an aberration,'' he said. ``He is part of a
long thread that goes back to the 18th-century Western occupation
of the Muslim world.'' In many of the contemporary
reinterpretations of Islam in Saudi Arabia, in Asia and in Africa,
he said, anti-foreign attitudes and severe puritanism are
uppermost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden is a young businessman who was terribly radicalized
by his experiences in Afghanistan,'' when he helped fight against
the Russian-backed government there, ``and by the Gulf war,''
Abuzayd said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the strong anti-foreign sentiment among Muslim
radicals, Abuzayd said, violent leaders only find ready support
when they are attacked by the West. This was why it is so
frustrating to watch the United States play into bin Laden's hands,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Abuzayd said, he understood that the American
strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan were motivated by Clinton's
need to ``do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``If you have a long arm, as Mrs. Albright says,
you go in and get bin Laden. The Israelis did it in Entebbe.''

LEARNING CO. SHARES OFF 16 PERCENT ON SALES REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a rough ride for shareholders of The Learning Co.
lately.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. educational software company's stock has
been on a roller-coaster over the past week, and Monday, it plunged
again. This time, shares were down 16 percent as investors fretted
over news of a modest sales slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. stock fell 3 5/8 to 19 3/8, as 2.39 million shares
traded hands, more than three times its three-month daily average.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts such as Stephen Fleming of BancAmerica Robertson
Stephens, said the market overreacted Monday, partly as a result of
some confusion last week over whether the company would be able to
collect on unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``With last week's confusion, a lot of people have got The
Learning Co. under a magnifying glass,'' said Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   So when new figures from PC Data, a Reston, Va.-based market
research firm, showed a slight drop in The Learning Co.'s market
share, investors panicked, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PC Data said retail software sales declined to $328.1 million in
July from $442.0 million a month earlier, and Learning Co.'s share
of the market, in terms of dollars, fell to 5.9 percent from 6.1
percent. Measured in units sold, Learning Co.'s share fell by a
similar margin, from 10.6 percent to 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the educational software category, where The Learning Co. is
dominant, its share slipped from 32.2 percent to 31.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very minor negative development,'' Fleming said,
noting that July is traditionally a slow month for software sales
and The Learning Co. didn't introduce any major new products during
the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extrapolating the results from one month, after six
consecutive months of very strong performances, would be foolish,
particularly because July is the weakest month of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Getgood, a Learning Co. spokeswoman, declined to comment
on Monday's stock activity, but noted that the company is headed
into the strongest sales periods of the year, the back-to-school
and holiday seasons. ``We have a lot of great new titles ahead,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said he believes The Learning Co. was ``unduly
punished'' because of confusion last week that caused the stock to
gyrate wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. shares plunged 20 percent last Wednesday after an
analyst apparently misinterpreted a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing and raised questions about the status of the
company's accounts receivables _ or bills outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose 17 percent the next day after company officials
allayed concerns about the accounting issue.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co.'s shares tripled to a 52-week high of 32 3/8 on
July 16 from a year earlier, before falling during the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., which makes Reader Rabbit and other
educational software, has announced plans to buy Broderbund
Software Inc., maker of the popular puzzle game Myst and the Carmen
Sandiego line of educational software, for $417 million.

 &HT;    CNNI to leave Amsterdam system
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting System has decided to pull the
international edition of CNN from an Amsterdam cable operator
rather than pay it high fees for carrying the programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's a first for Turner Broadcasting but company representatives
said they felt they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions for renewal are so disproportionate with those
negotiated with every other cable and satellite platform operator
anywhere in the world that we had no option but to withdraw the CNN
International service,'' said Phil Kent, president of TBS
International, which markets the channel.
</P>
<P>
   The channel, called CNNI, is a version of Atlanta-based CNN
marketed in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It has 140 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   CNNI has been in Amsterdam for more than a decade and has
developed a devoted following, said a company spokesman Nigel
Pritchard in London. The channel had some 500,000 subscribers in
the Netherlands, representing about 8.3 percent of the country's 6
million cable TV households.
</P>
<P>
   CNNI has been in the Netherlands for years without incident. But
that changed when Amsterdam cable operator A2000, owned by United
International Holdings Inc.'s United Pan-Europe Communications NV
and MediaOne International, began charging all its programmers.
</P>
<P>
   A2000 has argued it has no choice but to charge programmers
because the Amsterdam City Council refuses to let it raise
subscriber rates.
</P>
<P>
   Under A2000's rate schedule, CNNI would have to pay $357,000
annually. That represents a stark reversal for the channel. It has
been carried without charge. And in most countries worldwide,
including the United States, cable operators pay to carry
programming.
</P>
<P>
   That A2000 would ask for payment instead is ``a very rare
occurrence,'' said a CNNI spokesman in London.
</P>
<P>
   CNNI is not alone in leaving A2000. MTV Europe, a unit of the
New York-based music channel, left the cable operator this summer
in a dispute over fees.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting will pay to keep a Dutch version of its
Cartoon Network on A2000. Also staying will be the company's TNT
channel, which is part of a premium package exempted from fees.

MYANMAR OPPOSITION LEADER ENDS LATEST PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Story budgeted earlier as BURMA-DISSIDENT) 
(js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Myanmar's opposition leader, Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi, returned to her home in her country's capital Monday after
staying in her car for 13 days, surrounded by soldiers who blocked
her from traveling to meet supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But her political standoff with the military government in the
former Burma continued as she pressed her demand for the convening
of a Parliament, dominated by her party, that was elected in 1991
but was never allowed to take office.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat based in Myanmar said that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had
been driven home from her roadside protest in a Red Cross ambulance
escorted by police motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat said he had no information about the state of her
health.
</P>
<P>
   Members of her party, the National League for Democracy, had
issued a statement urging her to return home to protect her health.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who visited her on Friday said she was suffering from
low blood pressure, dizziness, and kidney and urinary tract
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The government said she had returned of her own free will to her
home in the capital, Yangon, the former Rangoon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the city had witnessed its first street protest
in nearly two years as more than 100 young demonstrators holding
the red-and-yellow peacock flag of her party staged a brief rally
before being chased away by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The street protests in December 1996 involved hundreds of
students and led to the closing of the nation's universities, which
still remain shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   As the protesters sat in the street at a major intersection,
about 500 onlookers cheered them on, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the demonstrators dispersed without violence and without
any reported arrests.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in an atmosphere the diplomat described as
``fluid and confused,'' the military government's minister of home
affairs met with two members of the executive committee of the
National League for Democracy, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   No details of their talk were released, but the meeting itself
was significant. It followed a meeting earlier this month between
the party's chairman, U Aung Shwe, and one of the government's most
powerful ministers, Gen. Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
   The party had been pressing for months for talks but had refused
an earlier invitation that specifically excluded Mrs. Aung San Suu
Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   Her confrontation with the government has intensified as the
deadline she set for the convening of Parliament passed last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As she continued to sit in her car 20 miles east of the capital,
her party announced that it would call its members to a
parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there is no reason to continue to ask the
military for democracy and that the only way forward is through a
people's movement,'' said the All Burma Students Democratic Front,
an opposition group based in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would be likely to be met by arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The government warned the opposition Monday that any move to
convene could curtail further talks.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 election followed a crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in 1988 in which thousands of people were killed. The
government annulled the election when the opposition won in a
landslide, taking 392 out of 485 seats.

THESE INDIANA JONESES RELAX WITH HARD WORK, ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Picture your dream vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's trekking across Zimbabwe scouting for piles of
elephant dung, then meticulously tabulating the thousands of
pea-size camel-thorn seeds within each pile of poop _ all to better
determine how elephants spread plant life across a savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might prefer excavating the grounds of czarist Russia's
answer to Versailles, the Catherine Palace: shoveling and rolling
away huge clumps of dirt to investigate rumors of underground
passageways and buried sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you would favor the sweltering swamps of French Guiana,
where you would slog through low waters in thick rubber waders,
surrounded by a droning cacophony of tropical insects and fortified
only by your daily feast of fried Spam. Your fantasy is not
complete until you net your quarry, an 18-inch-long giant leech.
</P>
<P>
   If ``vacations'' like these sound as enticing as a spinal tap,
count yourself among the Americans who opt for the beach,
Disneyland or a Carnival Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   But if you feel an inexplicable attraction to the adventurous,
you're a candidate to join the tens of thousands of Americans
annually who volunteer their vacation time for what they believe to
be a righteous cause: be it constructing a library in Kenya,
unearthing dinosaur fossils in Montana or conducting a research
census of humpback whales in California's Monterey Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are participants uncompensated for their efforts _ they
actually pay a pricely sum for the privilege of working like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations such as the University of California's
Research Expeditions Program, Earthwatch Institute and the Oceanic
Society charge $500 to $2,500 per person to participate in a
volunteer vacation _ and that doesn't include travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   So why do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably no good way to explain the `why' of it to
most people,'' admitted retired school psychologist Betty Spicher
of Campbell, Calif., as she laundered her clothes for the third
time, hoping to extract the grime gathered on the St. Petersburg
dig of the Catherine Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so tired or done such heavy physical labor day
after day. And I said to myself, `Wouldn't my friends laugh to see
me, paying big bucks to roll dirt balls?''' she said. ``But it
opens up new facets of your personality and your being. You get to
know yourselves in ways you hadn't before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just more meaningful to me than Club Med.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We give people the chance to fulfill a dream, to actually live
another life,'' said Jean Colvin, founder and director of UC's
Research Expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   While pure wanderlust has propelled the growth of scores of tour
companies touting ``thrill travel,'' volunteer vacationers insist
that thrills for the sake of thrills are not enough. They want an
exotic adventure that also contributes to the community or the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Participants, who range in age from 16 to 91, tend to be
well-educated and well-traveled but come from all walks of life.
Their motivations are uniquely personal.
</P>
<P>
   Many volunteer vacationers echo the desire to better the world _
not minding that their tax-deductible payment helps underwrite the
costs of research, tools and other expenses beyond food and
lodging.
</P>
<P>
   They also desire to leave behind the daily routines of a desk
job and briefly become more than a frustrated armchair
paleontologist, archaeologist or anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Jones would find a soul mate in Marstin Tallant. During
the school year, Tallant teaches biology to prep students at the
Branson School in Ross, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But when school's out, his own field education begins.
</P>
<P>
   There was an expedition to Costa Rica, where his team tagged and
observed a certain type of pepper plant to explore its symbiotic
relationship with a small genus of tiny ants. Another was to Kenya,
where his team made camp in mud-and-wattle houses and went to work
before daybreak helping a graduate student monitor the behavior
patterns of the yellow-shouldered widow bird.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Costa Rica, on a project to capture and
identify scores of grasshoppers by genus and species. The long-term
goal: to build a diversity database environmentalists can use to
fend off development on sensitive land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trips gave me an idea of the excitement of research work,
but also the tedious nature of it,'' Tallant said. ``It was
thrilling to be in Kenya up close to see the birds come in and
bathe in the morning dew ... and then just when you started to
think, `Oh, God, I gotta go watch another widow bird,' we'd take a
break and head to town to have a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallant has returned to his classroom with piles of photos,
connections that allowed him to arrange exchange programs, and a
reservoir of tales guaranteed to snare his students' attention.
</P>
<P>
   The final common allure for volunteer vacationers is the
possibility of making history.
</P>
<P>
   University Research teams in Egypt supported the archaeological

   Volunteer vacation trips are not without critics. Occasionally

they considered a ``boot camp'' mentality.

   ``They may spend the first day out seasick, and they may not
know much of anything about whales going into this, but they learn
a lot and help us in the process,'' said marine biologist Nancy
Blake as she led Oceanic Society volunteers on a clipper ship
excursion to survey whales and dolphins in Monterey Bay. ``They
make a lot of valuable scientific work possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some environmentalists worry that certain expeditions may
be done more for the employment of the researcher and the
entertainment of participants than to further science. Organizers
and participants insist they take care to ensure that does not
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Bea Ogden, 17, of San Francisco had second thoughts this summer
after she arrived in Crete on an Earthwatch project to study wild
agrimi goats.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted her doubts was not the sweltering heat, not the 20
pounds of cucumbers and tomatoes she was required to add to her
50-pound backpack for the slippery 6 1/2-hour hike down to the
Samaria Gorge _ not even the grueling work of grabbing, straddling
and blindfolding the goats while researchers extracted DNA samples
and tagged them.
</P>
<P>
   But when passing tourists spooked a female goat in the corral,
sending her into a frenzy that culminated in a fatal heart attack,
Odgen said, ``that made me question why I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   She reaffirmed her commitment to the project (researchers
stopped using that corral) after concluding that the study to map
the agrimi's DNA was the best hope for earning them classification
as a subspecies eligible for protection by the Greek government.
Without that, the agrimi may be lost forever to inbreeding with
domesticated goats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals really have no other hope besides us,'' she
said.

   ``I guess the ultimate question is, what separates people who do
these sorts of vacations from those who don't? And I firmly believe
it all comes down to an inner need,'' said Susan Gerke, a San
Rafael oil painter just back from an excursion to China to record
an otherwise undocumented ritual Buddhist music of a tribe known as

   ``Those of us who do this are really seeking, searching for
something more than the ordinary life around us. We want to connect
with the world, as opposed to just observing it. And the Dai have
such a beautiful way of life, it would be a horrible loss to lose
that culture. There is so much we could learn from them ...

someone,'' Gerke said, ``and you come back having received so much
more than you ever gave ...''

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Lockhart looking to return after hiatus
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The schedule works in Keith Lockhart's favor.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves in a stretch of three opposing left-handed
starters in a row _ including Houston's Mike Hampton tonight _
Lockhart has able to rest a strained right hamstring sustained
Saturday. With inactivity the best therapy, Lockhart will not be
called upon to start again until the Braves face Sean Bergman in
Houston Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``We could bring
up Marty (Malloy, the Class AAA Richmond shortstop) in a heartbeat
but they say it'll be okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart sustained the injury in Saturday's fifth inning, when
he was running from second on a grounder to third by Greg Colbrunn.
Lockhart left his feet to get around L.A. third baseman Adrian
Beltre, and ``it just felt like a cramp,'' he said. ``They're
telling me it was way better than running full out and doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest helps, there is a downside; Tony Graffanino's
game has fallen off. The right-handed second baseman who has
started 52 games to Lockhart's 79, is in the middle of a 4-for-35
(.114) slump that has dropped his average to .220. Cox let him hit
lead-off Monday, given his performance record against Los Angeles
starter Brian Bohanon (4-for-4 lifetime with a homer). But
Graffanino went 0-for-5 with four strikeouts. In both the seventh
and eighth, he came to the plate with runners in scoring position
and took strike three.
</P>
<P>
   It has gone even worse in the field, where he committed his
fifth error in four starts, ranging deep in the hole to get to a
Eric Young grounder in the ninth and then dropping it. Graffanino
now has 11 errors, which ties him with Chipper Jones for the team
lead. But Jones' 11 have come in 340 total chances. Graffanino's
came in 285.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino's fielding percentage dipped to .952, compared to
Lockhart's .984.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz good for Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   After a strong off-day session in the bullpen Monday, John
Smoltz pronounced himself fit to make his next start in Houston
Wednesday. Smoltz, who has won seven in a row, questioned over the
weekend whether it was time to skip a start to give his elbow a
break, but Monday's work was strong enough to persuade him
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the Big Unit
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will not see Randy Johnson, the newest Astro, on
their short two-night stand in Houston. But if the Astros stick
with their rotation after their off-day Thursday, Johnson will
pitch against the Braves on Sept. 2 at Turner Field. There is a
reason the club would like to face him, just to get an idea of what
it would be like if the Braves and Astros meet in the postseason.
Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a nice story,'' Cox said. ``But he might not throw
the same against us now (that) he would later. It doesn't make any
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Saving grace
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg's 23rd save Monday gave him 17-straight
conversions, dating to May 27. Since the All-Star break, he has
thrown 19 1/2 scoreless innings while allowing just six hits and
striking out 18.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of Ligtenberg, left-hander John Rocker and set-up man
Rudy Seanez have had an excellent August, posting a 1.75 ERA. The
three have struck out 30 while allowing 13 hits in 25 1/3 innings
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Every day
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones is the only Brave to appear in all 131 games this
season and has started in a team-high 130. He missed a June 19
start because of illness and made a pinch-hitting appearance but
otherwise has played in every inning except the ninth of a May
6victory over Los Angeles. That field time will not last, he has
already been informed, once the September call-ups and Richmond
third baseman Wes Helms arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like (to play every game), and Bobby knows that,'' Jones
said. ``'I'd just like some time off at the end of the game, like
the seventh or the eighth, give me a chance to come in and sit in
the whirlpool.''

 &HT;    Lopez breaks HR drought
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Javy Lopez wasn't thinking home run.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been unreasonable for someone who hadn't hit one
in his last 39 at-bats, whose batting average for the past 10 games
before an eighth-inning at-bat Monday afternoon was a meek .143
(6-42).
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I hadn't hit a home run was because I was
looking for it,'' the Braves catcher admitted. ``It's hard not to
think about it when you're at the plate. Every time I go up, I look
at home plate and see home run. When I'm not looking for it, I
guess I hit better.''
</P>
<P>
   So with two runners on, one out in the eighth and the Braves
trailing 3-0 to the Dodgers, Lopez tied the score with a home run.
Andruw Jones followed with a home run to win it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 11th time this season the Braves have hit
back-to-back homers. They may have to add that stat to the record
book. In 1997 and again in '96, the team did it six times.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has been in on six of the back-to-backs, and this one was
special: It was the 100th homer of Lopez's five-year major-league
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I didn't even know it was the 100th one,'' Lopez
said. ``All I know is I hit it at the right time. That was the
perfect situation for me to hit a home run, tie the game, and
Andruw takes care of the rest. Now that I know that it's a hundred
home runs, I'm kind of happy.''
</P>
<P>
   So are Earl and Ann Smith of Knoxville. They were sitting out in
left field when the Lopez homer flew over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bounced once behind me and I caught it,'' said Earl Smith,
a switchman for the Norfolk Southern Railroad. ``Javy's her
favorite player. I would have been in the doghouse if I hadn't gone
after it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths didn't get to keep the souvenir for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent somebody down and said that Javy wanted the ball,''
Earl Smith said. They posed for pictures with Lopez after the game,
then swapped the milestone home-run ball for two autographed balls,
a signed bat and four tickets to a future game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to get the ball,'' Lopez said. ``I know I've been
struggling the last couple of weeks. I knew sooner or later I was
going to come out of it. What a perfect chance to hit it. I've been
thinking that one at-bat probably was going to help me get out of
it, and hopefully this was the at bat I was looking for.

 &HT;    Not many surprises as Falcons go to 60
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons cut their roster from 78 to 62
players Monday, and will waive two more players today to meet the
NFL's 60-man roster limit.
</P>
<P>
   There were few surprises. Atlanta cut three offensive linemen,
four wide receivers, three defensive linemen, three defensive
backs, a fullback, a kicker and rookie quarterback John Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's final cutdown is Sunday, when rosters must be reduced
to 53.
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Georgia lineman Scott Adams, an eight-year
veteran who has spent time with nine different teams, was the most
experienced player cut. Third-year wide receiver Mercury Hayes,
picked up last year after being waived by New Orleans, also got
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 16 players were rookies, and another five had one
year of experience, either on Atlanta's practice squad or in a
training camp last year.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Slay, a 6-foot-1, 290-pound seventh-round pick from West
Virginia, was the only 1998 draft pick cut. The Falcons drafted
nine players during the April draft.
</P>
<P>
   Backup free safety Marcus Wimberly, the Falcons' fifth-round
choice last year, was waived, moving rookie fourth-rounder Omar
Brown into a backup spot behind Eugene Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fun day for a coach,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves
said. ``It's probably the worst day of the year. We had some tough
decisions to make, which is nice. We just think we got some people
that were playing a little bit better, guys with a little more
upside (potential).''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons waived fifth-year defensive tackle Williams Gaines
(knee/back) and defensive end Barry Mitchell (elbow/quad) after
reaching injury settlements with them. Mitchell, who was on the
team's practice squad last year, missed 21 practices with
quadriceps and elbow injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't come back (from injury) fast enough,''
Mitchell said. ``I'd give back everything in this envelope (with
his settlement) to practice (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have three quarterbacks (Chris Chandler, Tony
Graziani, and Steve DeBerg) and four defensive tackles (Travis
Hall, Shane Dronett, Esera Tuaolo and Shawn Swayda) and probably
will keep those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves said that doesn't mean the faces won't change. Team
officials were searching the waiver wire on Monday.
</P>
<P>

BAD NEWS FOR BOEING FROM BRITISH AIRWAYS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ British Airways, in a blow to the Boeing Co., is expected
to announce its first purchase from the rival Airbus Industrie,
awarding a contract this week for as many as 259 medium-range,
single-aisle planes worth $11 billion, according to managers at one
of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The order, if all options are exercised, would be the largest
awarded to Airbus by any European carrier, as well as British
Airways' first break with Boeing, its main supplier.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, which is the largest European carrier, is also
negotiating to buy long-haul Boeing 777 jets. The combined
purchases are expected to represent the basis of an overhaul of the
British carrier's routes, which will emphasize point-to-point
flights, rather than using feeder aircraft to bring passengers to
major hubs, like Heathrow, London's principal airport.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, British Airways is expected to order 59 planes in the
Airbus A320 family, with options for as many as 200 more. The value
of the orders reflects the list price of the planes, but airlines
usually receive a discount on large and long-term agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The order _ which could be announced as early as Tuesday, when
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain is to visit Airbus
headquarters in Toulouse, France _ would be especially welcome to
Airbus at a time when the Asian economic crisis has taken a toll.
The big Asian carriers had been the mainstay of its business in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had no immediate comment on the report, but
airline-industry analysts called the decision a defeat for Boeing
in its effort to sell an updated version of its 737. It was the
second major European victory for Airbus this year; in February
Iberia, the Spanish airline, decided to order as many as 76
medium-haul jets worth $4 billion from Airbus, instead of the 737.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this segment, Airbus has put not only its foot in the door,
but its whole leg,'' said Raymond Neidl of Furman Selz in New York.
``It's a big loss for Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither company would confirm the reports, rumors had
circulated for some time that British Airways would place its first
order with Airbus, because of the European consortium's aggressive
pricing and its political access. British Airways said in February
that it would ask Boeing and Airbus for bids for short-haul planes
to replace aging ones for regional European subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, British Airways executives said they wanted to buy
about 30 medium-range planes, worth about $975 million, with
options on 70 more, which would have taken the order up to roughly
$3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The much larger order appears to reflect the rapid pace of
deregulation in Europe, and the challenge posed by heightened
competition, both from strengthened mainstream carriers, like
Lufthansa, and from newer, no-frills airlines. Earlier this year,
British Airways joined the no-frills battle, with a low-fare
affiliate called Go.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus family of single-aisle A320s, which began chipping
away at Boeing's 737 about a decade ago, comprises the A320, which
carries as many as 150 passengers; the A319, with up to 126
passengers, and the A321, which also carries up to 150.
</P>
<P>
   If British Airways takes delivery of all 259 planes, Airbus
would be likely to outstrip Boeing as the carrier's leading
provider of aircraft. British Airways has about 350 planes in its
fleet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, it appeared that Boeing would not be a total loser.
Earlier this month, Robert Ayling, British Airways' chief
executive, said the carrier would also order long-haul, wide-bodied
jets to meet its future needs as airline deregulation progresses in
Europe, and many industry experts expect it to choose Boeing's 777.
In the past, British Airways has mainly flown Boeing 747s, 757s,
767s and 777s.
</P>
<P>
   The driving forces behind the British fleet overhaul are moves
by Europe's airlines to deregulation, and British Airways' proposed
alliance with American Airlines. Under conditions set by the
European Commission for the alliance with American, an AMR Corp.
unit, British Airways will have to rely heavily on wide-bodied
planes like the 777 for point-to-point flights, while the
short-haul Airbus fleet will be used on domestic British and
European routes.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is working to transform itself from a consortium of four
European aircraft makers _ Aerospatiale of France, Daimler-Benz
Aerospace, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas of
Spain _ into a single corporation that would be a linchpin of a
restructured European aerospace and arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   In July, giving in to British and German pressure, France
announced it would relinquish full government control of
Aerospatiale, the nation's largest aerospace company, by selling a
big stake to Groupe Lagardere and offering shares on the stock
market.

FIGURES ON TRAFFIC DEATHS SHOW PROGRESS ON DRUNKEN DRIVING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New figures on traffic deaths, released Monday by federal safety
regulators, showed that campaigns against drunken driving are
producing some success even as the overall number of deaths on the
nation's roads remains stubbornly high.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol-related traffic deaths in the United States dropped by
1,029 last year, a 6 percent decrease from 1996. But the overall
number of traffic deaths was virtually unchanged as 931 more people
were killed in crashes that did not involve alcohol, a 3.7 percent
increase, according to statistics released Monday by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic deaths involving alcohol plunged in the 1980s but had
been showing signs of leveling off until the release of Monday's
data. Alcohol was involved in only 38.6 percent of all traffic
deaths last year, the lowest percentage since the federal
Government began keeping records in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyn Nunnallee, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
said that the decrease in 1997 appeared to reflect a public
reaction to the Princess of Wales' death in a car crash on Aug. 31
last year, and to a long-running fight in Congress over whether to
require states to lower the minimum level of alcohol in blood at
which a driver is considered legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Tests after the crash that killed Diana found that her driver
had consumed several times the quantity of alcohol necessary to be
considered drunk in the United States. Congress ended up passing
legislation recently that gives extra highway construction money to
states with lower alcohol minimums but does not require states to
adopt such rules.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater attributed last year's
decrease in alcohol-related deaths to a steady toughening of state
laws against drunken driving and growing public awareness of the
problem. The statistics on alcohol-related deaths include drunk
pedestrians who are hit by automobiles, as well as drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in deaths not involving alcohol has proved troublesome
for safety experts. Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the highway safety
agency's administrator, said there were more fatal crashes in
daytime, when alcohol is seldom a factor. The increase probably
signals that Americans are driving farther each year because of the
strong economy, Martinez said Monday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report estimated that the number of Americans killed
for every 100 million miles driven had been steady at about 1.7
since 1992, after falling steeply for decades before then.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency said that the number of traffic deaths
involving alcohol had fallen to 16,189 last year. The number of
traffic deaths that did not involve alcohol rose to 25,778, leaving
a drop of 98 in the total number of deaths, to 41,967.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal regulators have been increasingly worried in recent
months that more deaths might be result from soaring sales over the
last several years of so-called light trucks. These include sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which roll over more often.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report found that 36 percent of the sport utility
vehicles involved in fatal crashes last year had rolled over,
compared with 24 percent of pickups, 20 percent of vans and 15
percent of cars. The agency also released separate statistics
showing that light trucks were involved in an unusually large and
growing number of fatal, two-vehicle collisions last year, although
most of the deaths occurred in the cars they hit.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that the very different designs of cars and light
trucks were a subject of regulatory concern, but that his agency
was looking at data from many years rather than drawing conclusions
from a single year's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an emerging trend that we want to get ahead of the
curve on,'' said Martinez, a former emergency room physician.

CHANG ON THE COMEBACK COURT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It hasn't been a good year for the boys from
Hoboken. Sinatra, the singer, died. Chang, the strings player, has
taken a big slide on the charts. At least Michael Chang has a shot
at a comeback, which he hopes begins with this week's gig at a
Chestnut Hill club called Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   This is outdoor work, the MFS Pro Championships, at the leafy
corner of Hammond and Route 9, and Chang has been engaged as the
featured entertainer, with 31 other guys doing the backup chores.
He is the high-priced name for the big room, seating 7,500, not a
lounge act even though declining from No. 2 in the business to No.
22, and trying to stop a free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my best days are ahead,'' says Chang. Like his Hoboken
predecessor, Frank Sinatra, he got outta there at an early age and
made his rep all over the planet. Such places as Paris, New York,
London, Melbourne. Especially Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Longwood, where international strings concerts have
taken place since 1890, hope those ``best days'' commence Tuesday
night when Chang makes his Boston debut in the company of a
24-year-old Romanian named Andrei Pavel. Pavel shouldn't be on the
same green hard-rock stage with Chang, you might say, since his
chart listing is No. 75.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the beauty of tennis. You put two guys on a court,
shooting at each other at 25 paces, and the better one may go down.
Ask Pete Sampras. He's been drilled this year by three lesser
lights who were on the property Monday _ Ramon Delgado, Karol
Kucera, and Fabrice Santoro _ and several others, including Chang.
</P>
<P>
   It happens, and it's been happening to Chang with greater
frequency in 1998 than either he or the promoters at Longwood would
care to think about. You can understand why he'll have a cheering
section in the officials stand upon learning that Chang collects
$200,000 whether he lands in Jail or on Baltic Avenue. That's a
guarantee merely for showing his face in our town, monopolizing the
cash that the MFS Pro parcels out to lure a better type of
entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is a million-dollar baby ($16,557,647 in official prize
money at last count), and you don't find them any more in a
five-and-ten store. Ever since he astounded the sporting world by
winning the French Open as a currency-green 17-year-old in 1989,
Chang has risen in ranking and esteem _ and asking prices, possibly
exceeding his prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Such up-front transactions are within the rules of the ATP Tour
for some tournaments (not the majors), the MFS one of them. When
Longwood made the deal early in the year, Chang, a top-10 resident
for six straight years, had slipped only a notch, to No. 3. He
seemed a very good buy then, and maybe will turn out to be,
although injuries (ankle, wrist, knee) have jammed him up.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kramer, a founder of the Association of Tennis
Professionals a quarter-century ago, preached against guarantees,
feeling that money should be earned as in golf _ only by
performing. I agree, but it didn't work. Too many promoters were on
the prowl, with monetary inducements to corral ticket-selling
somebodies for their diversions. Agents twisted their arms and
wallets. ``Announced prize money'' became only the tip of the
mother lode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm fully fit now,'' says Chang. Arriving on a 24-11
record, and no tourneys won, he's trying to break out of his first
bare-cupboard season since he started amassing 31 career titles in
1988. ``Boston is what I need right now as I head for the US Open.
I'm getting my confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I disapprove of guarantees because too often eminenzas
_ Sampras and Andri among them _ have taken the money and
not run enough, Chang is a different case. Chang does not know how
to play tennis without leading with his heart.
</P>
<P>
   He is the greatest runner and retriever the game has known. He
resuscitates points that had long been pronounced dead, extends
them as though he were pulling taffy, and finally wins them. He
never met a tennis ball that he didn't stalk like Inspector Javert
hounding Jean Valjean, making his foes feel like one of Les
Miserables.
</P>
<P>
   He treats each point like an Olympic marathon _ except for him
it's a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is the Napoleon of tennis, the little guy who outsmarts
and outhustles the enemy and conquers big countries. Though he's
but 26, his odometer may reveal too much mileage, too many battles
of attrition. Chang doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   And when you watch him, you think of townsman Sinatra declaring,
``You make me feel so young ... runnin' across the meadow ...
pickin' up lots of forget-me-nots ...'' Plus pickin' up lots of
forget-it shots.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra made his big comeback as the soldier Maggio in ``From
Here to Eternity.'' Perhaps Chang's will begin Tuesday night,
because he has no intention of not running from here to eternity.

EVEN STOIC RUSSIANS MAY NOW BE LOSING PATIENCE WITH THEIR
GOVERNMENT

(js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Nina Kostina cheered Boris Yeltsin's ascension to the
presidency in 1991. She voted to re-elect him in 1996. She expected
to be comfortably into her retirement by now. Instead she is a
cleaning woman at the Old Moscow Circus, working 11-hour days and
taking home $70 a month _ maybe _ after last week's ruble
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Better not to ask what she thinks about Yeltsin's promise Monday
that his latest government shakeup will bring stability to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would live normally,'' she said bitterly,
trudging toward a Moscow metro station as dusk fell Monday evening.
``He said to wait half a year; wait a year; wait another year. Now
I've waited seven years _ and nothing. We don't expect anything
better, because there's nothing good. I only count on my own
self.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians have waited seven years for Yeltsin's capitalist
revolution to bear fruit, only to be confronted this month with the
certainty that life will again become more expensive, and probably
harder, before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are famous for their stoicism. But there are hints that
the country's legendary forbearance _ with Yeltsin's bureaucratic
pirouettes, with their hard lives _ may be eroding.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide poll of 6,000 Russians conducted shortly before the
latest economic crisis registered a marked increase _ from 50
percent in March to 65 percent in mid-August _ in the share of
respondents who said Yeltsin's government could ``no longer count
on the people's patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve percent of respondents said they were ready to join a
strike, and 11 percent said they supported an armed uprising
against the government _ figures that have roughly doubled in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 percent had any faith that Yeltsin's program of tax and
economic reforms would improve their lives. The poll has a margin
of error of plus or minus two percentage points, according to
Nuzgar Betaneli, head of the Sociology and Parliamentarianism
Institute, which conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Betaneli said that Russians' dwindling
hope for economic improvement is directly tied to their increased
willingness to protest. He also predicted that the public will see
Yeltsin's latest reshuffling of his government in a poor light
unless the president can better explain his motives for the change
in leadership. Polls can be conducted or interpreted wrongly of
course, and Russia is so vast and diverse that snapshots of the
public mood are difficult to take well.
</P>
<P>
   But Betaneli has a reputation as one of the nation's more
accurate pollsters. In interviews with citizens and journalists
around Russia on Monday, little surfaced to suggest that he might
be wrong this time. Reaction to Viktor Chernomyrdin's resurrection
as prime minister ranged from lukewarm to hostile; Yeltsin fared
little better.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, for example, the deputy editor-in-chief of
the newspaper Smena, Marina Goncharenko, said city officials regard
Chernomyrdin's return ``without particular optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any big city fears that games in Moscow will make the
situation _ which is already bad _ worse,'' Ms. Goncharenko said.
``There are games, and there are the true values of democracy. As
in all regions, we are skeptical about the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Moscow, a young woman tending a downtown hot-dog stand,
Yelena Timofeyeva, said she had no faith in either Chernomyrdin or
the economic reformer he replaced, Sergei Kiriyenko, or, for that
matter, Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tortures them _ appoint, remove, appoint, remove,'' she
said of Yeltsin's administrative changes. Meanwhile, life goes
``very badly,'' she said, with sub-minimum wages and rising prices.
``We need stability. I'm always afraid things will get worse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That does not sound especially revolutionary, and in fact,
several political analysts interviewed expressed confidence that
Russians' legendary patience will see them through this bout of
suffering as it has through the hyperinflation, joblessness and
unpaid wages of the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The economic events of the last week might have produced riots
in other nations but in Moscow, the outward signs of distress so
far have largely consisted of slightly longer lines at
automatic-teller machines and cryptic ``closed'' signs on some bank
doors. Things were much, much worse early this decade, the analysts
stressed, when inflation consumed peoples' life savings and tanks
rolled in the streets. But things are not good in Russia now,
especially outside comparatively prosperous Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In Chernomyrdin's home region of Orenburg, far from Moscow in
the southern Ural Mountains, the copper-mining town of Gai is
locked in a depression and the situation, Vera Maltsev says, is
desperate. Speaking by telephone, Ms. Maltsev and her husband
Gennady said doctors in their city of 50,000 have been on a hunger
strike for two weeks and that teachers plan a strike in September
for back wages; they were last paid in February.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Maltsev, a mine worker, is finishing a two-month vacation
ordered by the head of the privately owned mine. In the wake of
last week's devaluation, Ms. Maltsev said, ``prices here have
doubled. I never thought we would live like this. We're even
sensing panic.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Yeltsin's reshuffling, Mr. Maltsev said he feels sorrow
for Kiriyenko and disdain for Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for someone else,'' he said. ``They say they've
fired the government, but they always stay. As usual, one or two
leave, and the others stay. If they all leave, it will be a real
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has not been much talk of Yeltsin's new regime, he
said, because ``the city is at a standstill. No one is working.''
Another well-regarded polling firm, Public Opinion Foundation,
concluded after a mid-June poll that confidence in Yeltsin's rule
was at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Among other results, 11 percent of respondents viewed Yeltsin's
presidency positively, versus 55 percent who were negative, and 72
percent wanted the next president of Russia to change the course of
policy.
</P>
<P>
   A July poll of public views of Chernomyrdin was even more
dismal: only 5 percent of respondents viewed him as honest, and a
bare 2 percent said he knew what he was doing and could lead
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the foundation, Alexander Olson, said he had not
conducted a recent sample of opinion about Yeltsin. Then again, he
said, he really does not need to. ``It's unlikely to get worse,''
Olson said, ``because it can't possibly get any worse.''

MARKET PLACE: BAD TIDINGS WHEN THE SHOPPING STARTS DROPPING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They've shopped, and they've shopped. Now are they
starting to drop?
</P>
<P>
   The marathoner of the moment, as far as Wall Street is
concerned, is the American consumer, one of two prime movers behind
the booming economy of the last four years. Shop-happy consumers
brought the nation out of the recession back in 1991 and, together
with corporations investing in capital equipment, have kept gross
domestic product growth perking far longer than in any other
economic cycle. These same free-spending consumers are needed to
snatch up foreign goods and pull the world's faltering companies
back from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there are signs that the marathoner may be tiring.
And since capital spending by corporations is also declining, a
prolonged weakness among consumers could add insult to an already
injured stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Straws in the wind on consumer spending come from surveys
conducted by International Strategy and Investment, a brokerage
firm in New York specializing in economic research. Every week, the
firm surveys almost 100 companies, including retailers, auto
dealers, manufacturers, home builders and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting indications that consumer spending is starting
to soften,'' said Jason Trennert, firm vice president. ``We're not
counting the consumer out. And no question, lower interest rates
are going to provide a fairly strong backdrop for consumer
spending. But some of the headwinds on the economy are starting to
affect consumer spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at ISI often identify significant economic trends well
ahead of the rest of Wall Street. For instance, the firm spotted
the Asia debacle and warned of its consequences in the spring of
1997, when most Wall Street firms still considered the Asian
economies a picture of health. Ed Hyman, a founder of the firm, has
been named the top-ranking economist by Institutional Investor
magazine for 18 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data from ISI show the lowest reading on overall
economic strength since January, an indication that the economy is
cooling. The index, in which 100 represents strong growth, stood at
48.8 as of Aug. 21, down from 50.3 in July and 55.9 in May. The ISI
numbers are not seasonally adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found a whiff of weakness in consumer spending at
retailers and auto dealers. For two weeks now, retail sales have
slowed at the six large, national retail chains interviewed by ISI.
The weakness was broad based, showing up at both a discounter and a
department store chain. ISI's retailer index fell to 39.6 last
week, down from a reading of 54 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers reported strong sales in the first week of August,
giving hope for a bang-up back-to-school season. But the sales
growth fizzled; subsequent weeks have been dismal.
</P>
<P>
   ISI sees a similar trend in auto sales. Although new-car sales
rose slightly last week, Japanese and luxury models were
responsible. Many dealers in the survey reported significantly
fewer car shoppers on their floors, Jennert said. ``A couple of
weeks ago they thought inventory problems were behind slow sales,
but now they say floor traffic is off,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   What the consumer does is important because consumption accounts
for two-thirds of the gross domestic product and because a host of
weak countries are counting on Americans to buy their goods while
Asians and others cannot. Most forecasters expect that growth in
consumer spending will drop from the 6 percent reported earlier
this year to about 3 percent by year-end. If this number turns out
to be too optimistic, the economy will feel the pain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Further clues to the shopper's mindset come Tuesday when the
Conference Board releases its consumer confidence figures. On
Friday, the University of Michigan publishes its confidence report.
In early August, the Michigan sentiment figures showed only a
slight decline from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Trennert wonders if the consumer pullback that his firm is
beginning to see is a result of the summer squalls in the stock
market. Are consumers spending less because many of them have lost
money, at least on paper?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work has shown a strong correlation between retail sales
and the performance of stocks,'' Trennert said. ``Stocks tend to
lead by about four weeks. Every time we've seen the stock market
move up or down signficantly, the moves tend to influence consumer
spending.'' Since the value of the average stock portfolio is
probably down anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent from the
highs, it would not be surprising if consumers reined in their
spending a bit.
</P>
<P>
   One thing consumers still have going for them, of course, is
declining interest rates. With Treasury yields near historic lows,
home-mortgage refinancings will put additional income in consumers'
pockets. So even if stocks continue to drift lower, American
investors will have some good news to balance out the bad.

ALBRIGHT TELLS LIBYA TURN OVER SUSPECTS TO NETHERLANDS OR FACE MORE
SANCTIONS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi with a ``take it or leave it
proposition'' Monday, warning him to turn over two men charged in
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 for trial in the Netherlands
or face further international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook announced simultaneously that the United States and Britain
have agreed to a previous proposal by Libya that the men suspected
of blowing up the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, be
tried at The Hague in the Netherlands under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marked a dramatic change in the 10-year-old
U.S.-British position that the two Libyans would have to be tried
either in the United States or Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has refused all demands to expedite the men to face
charges, insisting that any trial would have to be held in a
neutral third country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libya has repeatedly stated its readiness to deliver the
suspects for trial by a Scottish court sitting in a third country.
We now challenge Libya to turn promises into deeds,'' Albright said
at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan the U.S. and the U.K. are putting forward is a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition. It is not subject to negotiation
or change, nor should it be subject to additional foot-dragging or
delay,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a trial in the Netherlands has been brought up from
time to time ever since the two men were indicted in the United
States and in Britain on charges of murdering all 259 people aboard
the Boeing 747 and 11 others, who were killed on the ground by
falling debris from the explosion. An exhaustive investigation
linked the bombing to a Libyan intelligence officer and a Libyan
airlines manager in Malta, both of whom are believed to have been
agents of Gadhafi's government at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Cook said that United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan has been asked to help arrange the extradition of the
Libyans, who were identified as Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah. There was no response Monday from Gadhafi on
whether he would allow the men to be transferred to the custody of
Dutch authorities at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they are handed over for trial, we will support
action in the (U.N.) Security Council to suspend the international
sanctions against Libya,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright raised the possibility of a tightening of international
sanctions, including an international oil embargo against Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The United States banned U.S. imports of Libyan oil years ago
but has not been able to persuade many other countries to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also hinted at further action aimed at achieving
``accountability'' for the brutal bombing, noting that the United
States had demonstrated its determination to seek justice for
terrorist attacks with the military action last Thursday against
suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or the other, terrorists must answer for their crimes.
As the events of recent days illustrate, America is determined to
see that perpetrators of terrorism past are brought to account, to
respond swiftly and firmly to present acts of terror, and to deter
and prevent such crimes in the future,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe that to the families of Pan Am 103, to other victims of
terror, to all Americans and to decent and law-abiding people
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the announcement, Albright spoke with relatives of the
victims in the Pan Am bombing. She said most seemed willing to
accept a trial in The Hague conducted by a panel of Scottish
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives called the U.S.-British decision ``a very
positive step.'' But others said they were upset about the
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Wolfe, who lost a stepson in the Flight 103 explosion,
told CNN that Libya will never turn over the men, despite what it
has said in the past about holding the trial in neutral location.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agreement will lead to nothing except ``another
kick in the face from Gadhafi.'' Wolfe also expressed doubts about
the effectiveness of sanctions, noting that many U.S. allies are
ignoring them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that this country look at unilateral ways of getting
(the Libyans) to trial,'' she said.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tom Gordon needs five saves to break Jeff Reardon's
club record for saves in a season set by the bearded one in 1991,
when he saved 40 games, and the record could fall on the nine-game
Red Sox homestand that opens Tuesday night in Fenway Park against
the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has eight saves in nine chances against the A's and the
two teams that follow Oakland into Fenway Park, the Anaheim Angels
and Seattle Mariners. His only blown save this season came against
the A's on April 14, but he eventually won that game and has saved
33 straight since then, the longest current streak in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon leads the American League in saves with 36, five behind
the major-league leader, the Padres' Trevor Hoffman, younger
brother of former Sox shortstop Glenn Hoffman, who now manages the
Dodgers. He also has a 6-3 record and 2.81 ERA, but take away the
21 games (15 runs in 23 1/3 innings) in which he pitched that were
nonsave situations, and Gordon's ERA becomes a microscopic 1.09.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a September collapse, Gordon is on track to have the
greatest season by a Red Sox reliever since 1964, when the man out
of the bullpen didn't point at the heavens in thanksgiving, as
Gordon does after every save, but thrust two giant arms overhead in
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Radatz did that for the first time the day he struck out
Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Elston Howard of the Yankees on 10
pitches with the bases loaded and nobody out in the ninth inning.
That became the calling card of ``The Monster,'' as the 6-foot-6,
240-pound Radatz would become known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed with Gordon, he's been very good,''
Radatz said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at relief pitchers, I do compare guys to those
back in my day--Stu Miller, Hoyt (Wilhelm), Johnny Wyatt, a couple
of other guys. The table is set a lot differently today for
relievers; it's easier to get a save.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from the beginning of the season, to me Tom Gordon has
been successful for one reason more than any other: He wanted the
job. It wasn't like he was going to try it. You either want it or
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he got a little tired of the mediocrity he had had as a
starter. He knew he wasn't going to be the No. 1 starter. Maybe he
had the feeling he could be the No. 1 man in the bullpen, the
savior. It was something he really wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gordon, Radatz, a college star at Michigan State, was a
starter, until Johnny Pesky made him reliever in 1961, the year
before he broke into the majors. Radatz had his doubts about the
switch, but as a rookie in 1962, he was American League relief
pitcher of the year, with a 9-6 record and 24 saves. A year later,
he was an All-Star and in 1964, he had the season of his career:
16-9 record, 29 saves, a 2.29 ERA and 181 strikeouts in 157
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Kansas City, Royals closer Jeff Montgomery, who
broke into the big leagues with Gordon, said that he learned a
valuable lesson from former Royals closer Dan Quisenberry. ``Quiz
told me the best thing a closer can have is a very short memory,''
Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz laughed in agreement. ``I don't know if my line was
original or not,'' he said, ``but what I always said was, `What are
they going to do if I give up a home run, take me to jail?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem was that there were so many doubleheaders.
If you screwed up in the first game, you still came out for the
second game, when what I wanted to do was go for a cold one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has pitched as many as three innings just once this
season, more than one inning on just 14 occasions. Radatz, of
course, pitched in the era before the micromanaging of bullpens,
and the age of specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on call from the seventh inning on,'' Radatz said. ``I
had a setup man, though they weren't called that back then, and
that was Jack Lamabe. Jack had nine wins that year ('64). He'd come
into the game in the fifth or sixth, and if he was pitching well,
they would leave him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz recalled blowing a save against the Yankees in the
seventh inning of one game in Yankee Stadium. ``Marshall Bridges
and I were out there until the 17th inning,'' Radatz said. ``We won
it in the 17th when Bob Tillman tripled, and that was the only park
he could have tripled in, and Billy Gardner, who was hitting for
me, squeezed him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to blow saves. I'd go up to a starter and say, `I'm
sorry.' But Bill Monboquette pulled me aside and said, `Listen,
you're going to save a lot of wins for me that I wouldn't have
gotten, so don't worry about it. Nobody else in here is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been used on back-to-back dates 13 times this season,
including the Aug. 18 split doubleheader against the Rangers in
which he saved both the matinee and evening affairs. He has pitched
three days in a row just once this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pesky, who managed the Red Sox in 1964, wasn't as shy about
using Radatz day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story sounds almost fictitious,'' Radatz said, ``but
after Johnny pitched me six or seven days in a row, he told me not
to come to the ballpark. `If you do,' he said, `I might be tempted
to use you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the first three innings at home on TV in Milton, and
then I told my wife, `I can't watch this, I'm going to the
ballpark.' I got there in the sixth, and Johnny used me in the
13th, and we won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be the only guy in baseball history to win a game
after watching the first three innings at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz recalled pitching 6 2/3 innings on a Sunday against
Baltimore, then going to Detroit the next day for a makeup game.
``Johnny looked at me and said, `Can you give me an inning?' I went
into the game in the seventh, and I pitched until the 16th. Fifteen
and two-thirds innings in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz, who does sports radio and TV, has not spoken with Gordon
this season. He's only been to the ballpark a handful of times,
preferring to watch most games on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it looks like he's tightened up his curveball a lot, to
the point where it works almost like a slider,'' Radatz said. ``In
the past, when he'd get beat, 80 percent of the time it was on a
hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has a lot better fastball than I think he thought he
had. And he throws it for strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz never had another season like '64. The following season,
1965, he was 9-11 with 22 saves, and in 1966, he was traded to the
Cleveland Indians for Don McMahon and Lee Stange, two pitchers who
played vital roles in the Impossible Dream season of '67. Stange
won eight games for the Sox en route to a pennant, while McMahon
was traded to the White Sox for Jerry Adair, the Mike Benjamin of
his day.
</P>
<P>
   By 1969, Radatz was out of baseball, his career ending at the
age of 32 with the original Montreal Expos expansion team.
Interestingly, despite a workload that would be considered criminal
by today's standards, Radatz's career wasn't curtailed by arm
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had arm problems,'' he said. ``I had control trouble.
I went to spring training with the Cubs in 1968, and I walked six
guys on 24 straight pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of wildness is reminiscent of the struggles Braves
closer Mark Wohlers is now enduring. But Radatz, on the
recommendation of catcher Randy Hundley, who once had trouble
throwing the ball back to the pitcher, overcame his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a psychiatrist who hypnotized me,'' Radatz said,
``and doggone if it didn't work.''

COURT BARS `SAMPLING' METHOD IN NEXT CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y)  (Eds: See also CENSUS-SAMPLING) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal court ruled unanimously Monday that the
Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to supplement the
2000 census violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was welcomed by congressional Republicans, who
contended sampling would lead to new sets of errors and be subject
to political manipulation. But it dismayed Democrats, who thought
the system would count minority voters missed under recent censuses
and that counting them would produce new congressional and
legislative districts likely to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The special three-judge panel, specifically charged by Congress
with hearing census issues, ruled that the scheme was not permitted
under the 1957 and 1976 laws that govern how the census is to be
conducted. The unanimous decision stressed that the court found no
need to decide whether sampling was constitutional because the
ordinary federal law already barred its approach.
</P>
<P>
   The decision can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, and
the Clinton administration is expected to do so. The three-judge
panel was composed of Judge Douglas Ginsburg, an appellate court
judge, and Judge Royce Lamberth, a district court judge, both
appointed by President Reagan, and Judge Ricardo Urbina, who was
named by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The panel issued an injunction Monday prohibiting the Census
Bureau from using any form of statistical sampling in the next
census. In the meantime, however, the ruling is expected to provide
ammunition to the Republicans who have been waging a protracted
political and legislative battle against sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this gets the adminis's attention,'' said Rep.
Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Subcommittee on the
Census. ``This is a unanimous decision _ one judge appointed by
Clinton. The wise thing to do is put all their resources into a
full enumeration.''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of sampling said Monday they stil hoped for a
favorable decision from the Supreme Court. ``Ultimately, it will be
before the Supreme Court,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
``Nothing has really changed. The nation needs an accurate count,
that includes everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau had counted on using sampling to avoid a
repetition of the 1990 census, which missed more than 8 million and
counted about 4 million either twice or in the wrong place. The
Census Bureau's planned methodology is loosely similar to that of
public opinion polls in that it extrapolates information about the
population from partial data.
</P>
<P>
   But the bureau's plans are far more sophisticated than polls.
They involve using traditional methods to count everyone in 90 per
cent of the households in a census tract _ a neighborhood of about
1,700 dwellings. Data from the 90 per cent would be used to
determine the number and characteristics of the remaining 10 per
cent, and a further adjustment of the population would be made on
the basis of a survey made up of 750,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision was particularly galling to representatives of
minoritiy groups that make up a disproportionate share of those
missed by traditional head-counting methods. ``It's inexplicable. I
don't understand it,'' said Eric Rodriguez, senior policy analyst
with the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy
organization. ``We had an undercount of five per cent of the Latino
population in 1990. If this ruling is upheld we have no reason to
expect anything but a five per cent undercount this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling turned on an interpretation of two seemingly
contradictory provisions in the Census Acts of 1957 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The 1957 act said that ``except for the determination of
population for apportionment purposes,'' the secretary of Commerce
``may, where he deems it appropriate, authorize the use of the
statistical method known as sampling.'' The wording codified the
practice of sending the census long form _ the questionnaire that
asks about items such as how many bathrooms one has in one's home _
to one in every six households.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Congress changed the language of the law, saying that
except for purposes of reapportionment, the Commerce secretary
``shall'' authorize the use of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had argued that by by changing the
wording to make sampling mandatory, rather than optional, Congress
had effectively removed the prohibition against it for
reapportionment purposes. Further they argued that in 1976 Congress
added amendments _ Section 141 _ to the act that directed the
commerce secretary to conduct a census every 10 years ``in such
form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling
procedures and special surveys.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, written by Lamberth, the three-judge panel
disagreed with the Justice Department's line of reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though defendants' interpretation of the except/shall sentence
structure is proper in some instances, the court finds it to be
strained and incorrect when applied to the amended section 195,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth stressed the importance of the census to the balance of
power in Congress between parties and between states, and said it
was hard to imagine that Congress would change the rules without
explicitly saying so. He quoted from then Justice Rehnquist in a
1980 decision:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case where the construction of legislative language such
as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as
that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into
consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit that produced Monday's ruling was brought by Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who during bargaining over the spending bill that
covered the Census Bureau last November won administration
agreement to allow general tax revenues to pay for the litigation,
a deal that enraged many House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought him the gun and said, `shoot me,''' said a
Democratic staffer who asked not to be identified, ''and the court
did.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the White House was confident that the court would
rule that Gingrich lacked standing to bring the suit since he could
not show how the Census Bureau's plans would cause a specific
injury to the House. White House lawyers were also confident that
the court would decide that because the administration and the
House Republicans were still haggling over the issue, the case was
not yet `'ripe'' for a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling went against the administration on both counts.

STATISTICAL ACCOUNTING SUPPLEMENT TO CENSUS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal court on Monday struck down President
Clinton's plan to use a statistical accounting method to supplement
the traditional head count of the U.S. population in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling Clinton's proposal unconstitutional, the U.S. District
Court here handed a victory to the Republican-controlled House,
which sought a court order invalidating the president's plan.
Republicans fear a statistically enhanced census would increase
population figures for minorities, a traditionally strong
Democratic voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department, which conducts the count through its
Census Bureau, tried to defend Clinton's plan as the most effective
way to get an accurate figure for the U.S. population. The
department said as many as 8 million people, including 66,748 in
Houston, were not counted in the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   However, House Republicans successfully countered that the
Constitution's call for an ``actual enumeration'' of the U.S.
population every 10 years requires a head count and prohibits other
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The battle before the district court was both legal and
political, with the fate of congressional seats and federal funds
for communities hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress relies on census data for apportioning the 435 seats in
the House. In addition, the U.S. government uses the data in
deciding where to distribute federal funds for social welfare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration could appeal the decision directly to the
Supreme Court. The Commerce Department had no comment, saying the
case was still under review.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's nominee to head the Census Bureau, New York social
scientist Kenneth Prewitt, said in June that statistical sampling
yields the most accurate population data by accounting for people
census takers might miss. Prewitt said then that, if the courts
prohibit the use of statistical sampling, he would still press
ahead to ``conduct the most accurate and cost-effective census
possible'' within the legal constraint.
</P>
<P>
   The top Democrat in the House, Minority Leader Richard Gephardt
of Missouri, said he was ``disappointed'' by the court's decision
and expressed his hope that the Supreme Court would reverse the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Census Bureau's plan will guarantee a fair and
accurate count,'' Gephardt said. ``If its plan is not implemented,
nearly 6 million plus people will disappear for all practical
purposes when a host of government decisions based on the 2000
Census are made.''
</P>
<P>
   However, several Republicans who joined the lawsuit against the
Commerce Department hailed the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the Clinton administration to abandon
their population polling plan,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla. ``I
have said all along that their plan is too complicated, unreliable
and untrustworthy. Now sampling has been found to be illegal.
Congress will not allow the Clinton administration to waste $4
billion on an illegal census scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called the court's decision a
``huge blow to the political handlers at the White House'' and
questioned the accuracy of statistical samples. ``People need to be
counted, not guessed,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous, 71-page decision, the three-judge panel cited
the constitutional requirement for a census every 10 years as well
as the federal Census Act in concluding that U.S. law calls for a
head count of the population. The act, which Congress passed in
1957 and amended in 1976, limits the Commerce Department's use of
statistical sampling to the gathering of population information not
related to the decennial census, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges also went to great lengths to say the
Constitution's call for a separation of powers between the
legislative and executive branches of government does not prohibit
Congress from suing the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   House members have a legally protected interest in ensuring that
they receive constitutionally valid information about the U.S.
population every 10 years, the court said in rejecting the Commerce
Department's separation of powers argument. Valid census data
enables Congress to apportion the House's 435 seats properly, with
each seat representing about 500,000 people, the court added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent that a legislative body has a judicially
cognizable interest in matters affecting its composition,''
District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote in the court's decision. ``And,
most critically, if the executive's interpretation of the statute
is, in fact, contrary to the law or the Constitution, the most
directly affected entity is the institution of the House of
Representatives, because of its mandatory duty to apportion
representatives based upon a lawful and constitutional decennial
census, and because of its ... interest in its lawful
composition.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Lamberth's opinion were U.S. District Judge Ricardo
Urbina, a Clinton appointee, and Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Lamberth and
Ginsburg were appointed by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The participation of an appellate judge in a three-member
district-court panel enables the losing party in a case between
governmental branches to appeal the decision directly to the
Supreme Court under federal law. &QL;

CLINTON AIDES DEBATE WHETHER OUTSIDER NEEDED TO BLUNT STARR
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton's worries shifting from the
grand jury room to Capitol Hill, his senior aides are considering
proposing that he hire an outside expert to help blunt any
Congressional inquiry into a report by independent prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The move is one of several measures debated inside the White
House over the last week, as Clinton's political strategists
searched for ways to help him rebuild public confidence, retain the
support of Congressional Democrats and begin to campaign again for
his policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Other options that were under discussion have been set aside, at
least for now, White House aides said. Some of Clinton's friends
and advisers have been pressing him to give another, less formal
public address about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, after
sharp criticism, even within the White House, that his speech last
Monday was not apologetic enough.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials say that the president is unlikely to
do that. Instead, they expect him to address the matter again when
he travels to Russia next week. He is planning to hold a joint
press conference with President Boris Yeltsin, and is certain to be
asked about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been said by friends to be worried about the
critical reviews of his previous speech. But his aides say they
have taken heart from public surveys showing that most Americans
continue to approve of the job he has done. To encourage that point
of view, they have been planning for him to interrupt his Martha's
Vineyard vacation this week to hold at least one public event,
probably on the subject of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism in Washington, White House officials said,
they have not detected any public desire for a fuller apology. One
White House adviser said that Clinton had received several letters
of support and encouragement from Congressional Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has come under heavy fire from Republicans and some
Democrats on Capitol Hill. His aides are worried that his existing
legal team does not have the expertise to handle potential
impeachment hearings. Many of them have complained that David
Kendall, the president's private lawyer, has not paid enough
attention to the politics of his legal predicament.
</P>
<P>
   But one senior Administration official said that any new faces
would not supplant Kendall. ``We've known for some time that as
this thing entered a new phase, we would want to supplement
Kendall's team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One outside lawyer familiar with the White House planning said,
``The Congressional beast is different than the independent counsel
or your typical criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has apparently not yet approached anyone for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is preparing a report for Congress on his investigation
into Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former intern. He
may also address other subjects he has examined during his
four-year investigation, which originally focused on the Clintons'
Whitewater real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sorts of issues a new adviser might be expected to
decide is what protected information the White House should release
in advance of any hearings, to defuse revelations that might
otherwise be bombshells. That is a technique the White House has
used repeatedly during such Congressional investigations as the
inquiry into donations during the 1996 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall and members of the White House Counsel's office have
been reluctant to release any information about the president. Just
last week, they infuriated other White House advisers by refusing
to disclose a request by prosecutors that Clinton supply a sample
of his genetic material. Prosecutors want to determine if a dress
belonging to Ms. Lewinsky was stained during a sexual encounter
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Kendall met with White House chief of staff
Erskine Bowles and other White House officials to discuss their
concerns, in what was described by participants as a tense meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One ally of the president's who is knowledgeable about White
House deliberations said that he was concerned that any new
outsider would be stymied by the existing team. ``You cannot have
this current structure and bring someone in,'' he said. ``It's the
mindset, and that's what's got to change now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House officials have reached out in recent days to
numerous Democratic political strategists, as they try to devise a
plan to secure Clinton's political standing. One fundamental issue
they have been discussing is what the president's posture should be
as Congress takes up legislation on the budget, education, and
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some White House advisers said that Clinton's political
interests might be best served by compromising with Republicans, to
demonstrate that he can still get things done despite the furor
over Ms. Lewinsky. But that may not be an option, they said,
because House Democrats might prefer confrontation, to sharpen
their differences with Republicans going into the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility of impeachment hearings hanging over his
head, Clinton cannot afford to alienate Democrats in the House,
said one adviser who has been consulted by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to to blow up the Democratic caucus with the
kind of compromise he's prepared to reach,'' he said.

 &HT;    Meredith sees growth in purchase of Atlanta affiliate
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Meredith Corp. is better known for magazines than
television stations. But that may change now that the company has
agreed to purchase Atlanta's WGNX.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition represents a unique strategic opportunity for
Meredith,'' said William T. Kerr, the company's chairman and chief
executive. ``A chance to acquire a station in a top 10 market is
rare, let alone in one of the nation's fastest growing television
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   While not among the biggest players in television, Meredith has
other strengths. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company publishes 21
magazines. Its holdings include such popular titles as Better Homes
&AMP; Gardens, Ladies' Home Journal, Family Money and Crayola Kids.
With nearly 8 million subscribers, Better Homes &AMP; Gardens is the
third largest magazine after Reader's Digest and National
Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to its magazine holdings, TV stations are a small
part of Meredith's business. The company owns 11 stations, four of
which are CBS affiliates like WGNX. None of the 11 is in a top 10
market.
</P>
<P>
   These stations generated $156.4 million in revenue last year, or
about 18 percent of the company's total of $885.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among Meredith's stations are KPHO in Phoenix, WOFL in Orlando,
KPDX in Portland, Ore., KCTV in Kansas City, Mo., WSMV in Nashville
and KVVU in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith's stake in television is small compared to that of a
company like Tribune which owns 18 stations that generated $1.1
billion in revenue last year. That represents about half of the
company's total revenues of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kerr's leadership, Meredith has been upping its TV
holdings. It bought four stations in 1997 for $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company is exploring creating TV programming based on its
magazines. It launched ``Better Homes &AMP; Gardens,'' a syndicated
show, last year.

YELTSIN GOVERNMENT PROMISES TO SHARE POWER WITH COMMUNISTS IN
PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>

(sw) 
 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW As Russia struggles to form a new government, top Yelstin
administration officials promised on Monday to share power with the
Communist-dominated Parliament that has sought to frustrate the
nation's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The new power-sharing arrangement is designed to build support
for President Boris Yeltsin's new choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   But the move raised fresh questions about whether the Kremlin is
retreating from the urgent economic reforms demanded by
Chernomyrdin's predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, who was ousted over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia in the grips of an economic crisis and the nation
still reeling from yet another government shakeup, Yeltsin's new
strategy for extricating the nation from its economic crisis
remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   There were no details about new economic policies. Chernomyrdin
said he would not even announce his new cabinet until his
appointment was approved by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of the Kremlin's message seemed clear. Under
Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister who enjoys good political
relations across the political spectrum, the Russian government
would be more receptive to appeals by the Communist opposition and
more solicitous of the demands of Russia's powerful bankers and
financiers.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 year-old Kiriyenko used to sermonize about the need for
Russians to tighten their belts. Had he continued in office,
Kiriyenko planned to press this week for the Parliament's approval
of an unpopular package of measures to reduce the looming budget
deficit and bring order to the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, however, is not talking about ramming a demanding
reform program through a recalcitrant Parliament. Instead, the
Kremlin's emphasis Monday was on giving the Parliament and other
influential groups more of a voice over the Kremlin's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Aleksandr Shokhin, a key Chernomyrdin aide, put it on
Monday, the aim is to form a new government, ``backed by the
majority of political forces in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said that
Chernomyrdin would support the general effort to develop Russia's
version of capitalism. But he added pointedly that under
Chernomyrdin ``we should expect serious changes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no way Chernomyrdin can wish away Russia's
mountain of troubles. Russia's banks remain on the brink of
insolvency. Moscow has yet to announce a plan to restructure its
short-term debt. Its currency may continue to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also major constraints on Chernomyrdin's freedom of
maneuver because there is simply not enough money to go around.
Russia needs to slash spending to shrink the federal budget
deficit. And Chernomyrdin conceded on Monday that the government
did not have enough funds to bail out all of its troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
   But some free-market proponents expressed concern that
Chernomyrdin would still yield too easily to the tycoons, such as
Boris Berezovsky, who helped engineer his return to power.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, the senior Kremlin aide and former governor of
Nizhny Novgorod, said on Monday that he would not serve in a
Chernomyrdin government because he had concluded the Chernomyrdin
lacked the will to challenge powerful financiers and monopolists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are not likely to be solved in the Chernmyrdin
government,'' Nemtsov said. ``And since this is the situation there
is no point for me to work in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some investors seem to have concluded as much. Shares
in Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas monopoly, rose almost 20
percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Yeltsin government six years ago,
Chernomyrdin served as the head of the gas giant. And many
investors believe the oil and gas companies will now be treated
more leniently. In contrast, Kiriyenko had sought to squeeze the
energy sector for back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin aggressively courted the Parliament before his
recent return to power and continued to do so on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage Parliamentary approval of Chernomyrdin's
appointment as prime minister, the Kremlin announced on Monday that
a new commission would be consist of Yeltsin government aides and
members of the upper and lower houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the panel would be ``to develop an anti-crisis
program'' and perhaps discuss appointments to the new government,
Yastrzhembsky said. Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin had discussed
the arrangement on Monday with Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist
speaker of the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commission ``will become a very important
institution in our political and social life. It will scrutinize
the main content of our anti-crisis program. Different views will
clash at its meetings, different versions of this anti-crisis
program will be proposed. These battles will produce the contours
of the future anti-crisis program.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision led the Communists to boast they had won a seat at
the table in a new ``coalition government.'' It is too soon to tell
if the weakened Kremlin will actually cede substantial power to the
Communists and other opposition groups. The newspaper Izvestia,
however, speculated on Monday night that the Communists would gain
some key posts and that the government would back away from some
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can expect that some of the urgently needed anti-crisis
measures will not be enacted,'' Izevestia said.

   NEW YORK _ Imagine, if you can, a shopper wandering into Barneys
New York, walking past the Gucci bags and the glittering John
Galliano gowns to cozy up to a size 14 designer suit. A clerk comes
running over and offers to help her with the garment, fits her for
some shirts to match and then orders up three more suits in that
size.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes for the larger-than-skinny? Solicitous service? Barneys?
</P>
<P>
   Barneys, the luxury retailer with a reputation for snootiness
that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection more than two years
ago, is not about about to turn into a Lord &AMP; Taylor, catering to
the masses. But it has undergone enormous business changes in the
last six months, some designed to alter its image subtly but many
of them invisible to its usual customers, who still come for the
one-of-a-kind necklaces and designer suits.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Barneys is making a transition from a clothing art
gallery _ creative but unprofitable _ to a more traditional
retailer, with all the disciplines, back-office controls and
service standards that the rest of the industry tries to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Removed from daily responsibilities as part of the
reorganization of Barney's Inc., the company that owns the stores,
are the Pressman brothers, Bob and Gene, who once ran it as
co-chief executives. Both remain involved, though, with generous
consulting contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, Thomas Shull, the company's new chief executive,
is doing everything he can to get more customers in the door, from
rewarding them for using the Barneys credit card to training clerks
to be nicer to browsers who don't look like models.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Barney's, which intends to emerge from bankruptcy
sometime this fall with the help of a plan put together by its
creditors, needed a new business plan to make its stores more
profitable and to generate growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barneys is still a huge destination for a wealthy, hip
customer,'' said Faye Landes, a retail analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``Layering on some business traditions should help them
return to profitability, as long as they don't kill the goose that
laid the golden egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in reorganizing, Barneys is faced with a special
challenge: how to apply the business practices standard in the
retail industry while at the same time preventing itself from
becoming like the stores that are standard in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been the special merchandise and creative displays
that have set Barneys apart from the retailing mainstream. The
store carries many brands and styles that are not easily available
elsewhere, in everything from dresses to men's shirts to perfumes
to vases.
</P>
<P>
   And while other stores place millions of dresses and shirts on
round racks and leave it to shoppers to unearth the goods, Barneys
displays everything in a spare, attractive way with whimsical
mannequins, unusual fixtures and the occasional original work of
art.
</P>
<P>
   But adding a hint of business strategies from Macy's, where he
was executive vice president for two years, Shull insists that none
of the creativity will be hurt. ``We believe strongly that there is
not a dichotomy between creativity and discipline,'' he said in an
interview. ``Clearly we have been world-class in terms of
merchandise. Now we want to elevate the company to the level of our
brand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the store in returning to its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys was founded as an off-price men's suit business in 1927
by Barney Pressman, who paid for the lease of his store on Seventh
Avenue and 17th Street by hocking his wife's engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change in the 1950s, when Barney's son Fred
became active in the business, adding a high-end touch to what
traditionally had been a sort of Loehmann's for men. Fred
introduced Giorgio Armani and other designers from such fashion
centers as Milan, Italy, and London's Savile Row to American
consumers. His penchant for counting threads on ties and arranging
shirts just so on a display table took the store far from its
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Gene, Fred's sons, joined the company in the 1970s, and
in the 1980s, the family began to open stores around the country
with the help of the Isetan Co. of Japan. The chain's eventual
bankruptcy resulted in part from a fight between the Pressman
family and Isetan over who actually owned stores on Madison Avenue
and in Chicago and Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Much had changed since the company tried to move beyond the
original store that Barney Pressman opened on 17th Street, whose
doors were shuttered last summer. The women's businesses never ran
quite as smoothly as the men's. Half of the 14 big anchor stores
failed, and the survivors, including those in Los Angeles and
Chicago, have needed serious rethinking to accommodate regional
tastes. The company now runs seven Barneys and 13 outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' said Shull, ``Barneys had taken a New York store
and placed it in other cities without really appreciating the needs
and wants by market.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up stores with a regional focus means much more than
making sure there are more wool sweaters in stock in New York than
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kalenderian, general merchandise manager for the men's
department, said he was surprised, for instance, to find that in
Los Angeles men tend to buy more luxury robes and silk pajamas,
largely because they wear them outdoors, whereas in New York, those
are mostly Christmas items.
</P>
<P>
   There were similar discrepancies throughout the store. Jewelry
fashioned from leather cord sells well on Madison Avenue but runs
cold in Beverly Hills. Los Angeles longed for more colorful
garments. The Chicago store needed more size 10s.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Pressman supposedly once proclaimed, ``I don't want fat
people shopping in this store,'' and Barneys has always had a
reputation for carrying nothing bigger than a size 6 on its women's
floors. While that is an exaggeration, larger sizes are hard to
find, with the result that many baby boomer shoppers leave the
store empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the Barneys mystique is that it is a little
intimidating to shop here,'' Shull said. ``We have to minimize that
and increase the warmth of the experience. If you walk into the
store and you're a size 14 and there is limited merchandise, that
is not warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that intimidation came from the sales staff. Known for
being chilly and snobbish, Barneys clerks became the model for
parodies of the rude New Yorker. That too, is coming to an end,
Shull said. He said better training of sales clerks and more
involvement of merchants on the sales floor will help to make
Barneys more welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The new mantra _ ``customers are guests in our home'' _ is
borrowed not from Neiman Marcus, the leader in customer service
among luxury retailers, but from Target, the discount store owned
by the Dayton Hudson Corp., which for years has referred to
shoppers as ``guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting into shoppers' hearts _ in a profitable way _ is also
part of the game plan. Barneys is launching a customer loyalty
program, similar to one offered by Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman
Marcus, which enables big spenders to get rebates at the end of the
year in the form of gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The program rewards shoppers who spend $3,000 to $4,999 on the
store's credit card each year with a 3 percent gift rebate, with
much higher rates for bigger spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys has never really tried to leverage its credit-card
business before; only 15 percent of its shoppers use its card,
compared with rates closer to 50 percent at Neiman Marcus and Saks.
What's more, Barneys plans to mine the data base provided by credit
card use to improve its sometimes-scattered marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Shull also wants to expand the company's private-label line to
25 percent of sales from 17 percent now, and to add co-branded
lines with companies like Battistoni, an Italian maker of men's
clothing. He believes those lines also have potential for
wholesaling to other retailers abroad, the company's best global
growth possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Shull's efforts have already helped the bottom line. For the
fiscal year ended July 31, the company earned somewhere around $17
million before taxes and professional costs associated with the
bankruptcy costs, compared with a loss of $2 million in the same
period last year. In the same period, sales dipped to $343 million
from $361 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bob Pressman said he is in favor of the reorganization
plan. ``I am totally supportive of Tom and his team,'' Pressman
said. ``I look forward to a close relationship to his team now and
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cost-cutting is behind the company now. Clothing
allowances have been eliminated for executives, staffing has been
cut in Los Angeles and suppliers have started to kick in for
advertising costs. So now, the company is faced with trying to make
the top line grow.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sold. ``They are just too expensive,'' said
Barry Bryant, managing director of R&AMP;R Capital Group Inc., a
boutique investment bank. ``How many people can pay $140 for a
sport shirt? The retail concepts that are the most successful are
the ones that deliver more fashion value than the price they're
charging.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pressmans are now largely disengaged from the
business, Judy Collinson, the general merchandise manager for
women's; Simon Doonan, the company's valuable creative director,
and Kalenderian have all been with the company for well over 10
years. Each is a disciple of one Pressman or another; in Ms.
Collinson's case, it's Bonnie, Gene's wife, who left the company
this week to work for Polo Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not to wipe out the Pressman legacy, but to
eliminate the troublesome parts of it, particularly the reckless
spending and family infighting that marked the company's recent
financial past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in cleaning house,'' said Shull. ``The people
who built this company should inherit it.''

INVESTORS ARE OPTIMISTIC, BUT CAUTIOUS, ABOUT RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors around the globe were cautious, though
optimistic, on Monday in light of the latest moves by Russia to
reverse its recent economic slide.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, stocks ended mixed as investors expressed some
skepticism that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's moves to dismiss
the country's five-month-old cabinet and reinstate the former prime
minister would stem its economic free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, moves by acting Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
allowing the Russian ruble to devalue and the country to default on
$40 billion of government debt, sent world equity markets reeling.
Russia's slide, and expectations that a currency devaluation in
Venezuela was next, ignited fears that the financial crises
enveloping Asia's emerging markets was spreading to other
developing regions.
</P>
<P>
   And while Russia's benchmark equity index rose more than 5
percent, most of the gains were limited to big energy companies and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even though U.S. investors were relatively calm, they were
showing growing signs of cautiousness, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.96 points, to 8,566.61,
but increases in three stocks _ Merck, American Express and
Wal-Mart Stores _ accounted for the bulk of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index added 6.90 points, closing
at 1,088.14, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell
6.79 points, to 1,790.82 _ led by declines in Tellabs, Worldcom,
Oracle and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 2.03
percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index increased 4.2 percent, propped
up by continued government buying of blue-chip shares. Stock
indexes in Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks closed higher in London for the first time in three days,
rising 1.4 percent, and German investors pushed that benchmark
index up 1.2 percent, as a belief that previous declines may have
been overdone pulled investors into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico and Venezuela were little changed, but markets in Brazil
and Chile fell more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're seeing a global re-evaluation of assets,'' said
Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers Trust Global
Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should still be concerned about Russia and Latin America,''
he said, adding that Hong Kong could fall again once the government
ends its buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   Since world stock markets may continue to be volatile, investors
should remain cautious, he advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, buying on the dips is going to be the wrong
thing to do,'' because markets may continue falling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent decline in stock prices and with Treasury
bond yields at their lowest levels in more than 20 years, Douglas
Cliggott, the chief investment strategist at J.P. Morgan, is
reluctant to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations that corporate earnings will be lackluster through
the end of the year and increasing volatility, characterized by
global market gyrations, mean investors are not going to be
compensated for the added risk of buying stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy
committee at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company, called investor concerns
about the impact of global economic problems on American corporate
earnings and the perceived increased riskiness of U.S. stocks
``overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, global investor attention has focused on Russia,
Brazil and Venezuela, Ms. Cohen wrote in a market commentary. Most
of those countries, however, are relatively small and have only
limited trade impact on the United States, she argued. Less than 1
percent of the total U.S. exports flow to Russia; exports to
Venezuela equal about 1 percent, while total exports to Brazil are
about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the S&AMP;P 500 is currently 5 percent to 8
percent undervalued,'' Ms. Cohen wrote, adding that she contends
the Dow could hit 9,300 by the end of the year and the S&AMP;P 500
could increase to 1,150.
</P>
<P>
   Still clients of some mutual fund firms, like the Vanguard
Group, are growing slightly more cautious, as evidenced by a
moderate pickup in inquiries about and cash flows into money market
mutual funds, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three weeks, investor requests for information
about money market funds has increased, said John Woerth, a
spokesman. Flows into money market funds in August are expected to
top the $900 million that entered the funds in July, he said. And
recently, flows into equity mutual funds have been slowing a bit,
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It doesn't take much to spark a rumor in Moscow these
days, as governments and policies are flipped around like flapjacks
on a griddle.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough for Boris Berezovsky, a 51-year-old
multi-billionaire financier with an unquenchable political
appetite, to be ``sighted in the vicinity of the office of the head
of government'' Monday to prompt a headline in an evening newspaper
Monday night and a new round of talk about the master intriguer's
possible return to power.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when President Boris Yeltsin last switched
governments, Berezovsky, who months before had been ousted as
secretary of Russia's Security Council, was put further out on the
sidelines with a job at the Commonwealth of Independent States,
which has its headquarters in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Berezovsky wins a post in Russia's new government is
still not certain, but it is not improbable given his close ties to
Viktor Chernomyrdin, a figure whose power base includes both
Russia's old ``red'' establishment and its new monied elite.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who first came to government as the head of
Gazprom, Russia's giant gas company, has much in common with the
small coterie of financiers and corporate magnates who in the last
few years have accumulated enormous wealth by mixing politics and
business.
</P>
<P>
   These men _ known here as the oligarchs _ are widely seen as the
beneficiaries of the returnrnomyrdin, who is expected to
lend a sympathetic ear to their complaints about his predecessor's
tough tax collection and tight money policies.
</P>
<P>
   They own oil companies, newspapers, television stations, and
metal factories but, above all, they own Russia's major private
banks _ many of which have been caught dangerously short by
Russia's current financial crisis. Many profited from Russia's
privatization program by buying state assets on the cheap, and
leveraging them to get access to state credits.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, however, is not a banker, but a deal maker whose
power derives from the fortune he has made buying and trading
assets of former state-owned oil, automobile, airline and
television companies. Another key asset is his friendly relations
with the Yeltsin family, in particular the president's daughter
Tatyana Dyachenko, who serves as her father's image maker and
political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In this crisis, Berezovsky is seen to be taking advantage of a
power vacuum to propel himself back to the center of power. Some
analysts note that he himself may be the primary source of rumors
of his pending comeback. Like other oligarchs, he hopes to
influence Russia's next presidential elections in 2000, and has
kept a line open not only to Chernomyrdin but also to Alexander
Lebed, the former general and aspiring presidential candidate who
is now governor of a Siberian region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The political ambitions of Russia's other oligarchs are more
muted, and more directly tied to their business interests, whether
it be oil or media. As chairman of the Media-Most holding company,
Vladimir Gusinsky, 45-year-old founder and former chairman of MOST
bank, controls a newspaper, a magazine and a network of private
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Potanin, the 37-year-old chairman of Uneximbank, is a
member of the board of directors of the Sidanko oil company, and
the Norilsk Nickel joint stock company.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia's banking system still teetering on the edge of
collapse, attention this week is focused primarily on Russia's
major bankers - including Alexander Smolensky, chairman of
SBS-Agro, and Vladimir Vinogradov, president of Inkombank, two
banks that engaged in aggressive trading in Russian treasury bills
and in foreign loans secured with Russian bonds as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   When the value of Russian bonds fell in recent weeks, the banks'
foreign creditors demanded payment - causing several banks earlier
this month to default on payments.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as part of its anti-crisis program, the government of
ex-prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko imposed a 90-day moratorium on
Russian commercial debt, a move that amounted to a short-term
bail-out for the banks. Some banks have sought more help from the
government, both in the form of credits and guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   According to some analysts, even the Chernomyrdin government may
be powerless to prevent the failure of one or more Russian banks.
An attempt by the Central Bank of Russia to form a pool of 12
leading Russian banks, banded together to share debts and protect
private depositors, is already cracking under the strain of the
crisis.

A LOOK AT PROPOSED STATISTICAL SAMPLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with CENSUS-2000) 
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A plan proposed by the Census Bureau to use statistical sampling
to augment the 2000 Census would use three sets of samples. The
first set would check a selection of houses in a given census tract
_ about 1,700 households _ that are presumed to be vacant. The
second would check a proportion of residences from which forms were
not returned. And the last would be a random nationwide sample to
check for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service in 2000 will probably estimate that 5 percent
of the 119 million residential addresses in the country are vacant,
the Census Bureau said. Normally, census forms are not sent to
those addresses. But studies have shown that at least 11 percent of
the homes the Postal Service said were empty were, in fact,
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, rather than sending forms, would send counters to
one in 10 of the houses that Postal Service records show as vacant.
The number of those dwellings found to be occupied, and the number
of people living in them, would then be used to estimate the
population in housing units that were thought to be vacant
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the bureau sent enumerators to the 35 percent of all
addresses that did not return their mail-in census forms. In 2000,
the percentage visited would depend on how many households in each
census tract mailed in their forms. If 80 percent of the households
in a tract returned a form, the bureau would visit half of those
houses that did not respond. If 30 percent of the addresses mailed
the forms, census takers would visit six out of seven of those
households that did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's goal was to have a response by mail or visit from
90 percent of the dwellings in each of the country's 60,000 census
tracts. Using the information gathered, the bureau would estimate
the number and characteristics of the remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the bureau would randomly select 750,000 households
nationwide, making sure that each state and all racial, age,
economic and other demographic groups were represented. This sample
would be used as a ``quality control'' to check the accuracy of the
bureau's efforts and to make adjustments where necessary.

COMMENTARY: CAN CLINTON STILL GOVERN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the moment the whole focus of the debate around Bill Clinton
is ``should'' he be president anymore. But equally important is the
question ``can'' he be president anymore.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of should he be president, the public is divided,
but a substantial majority still feel that Clinton should remain in
office. They may think less of him, but they still think a lot of
his agenda. Whether that majority holds up in the face of the
sordid details that will come out from Ken Starr's investigation is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What might actually influence the public most is the question of
``can'' Clinton still govern in any reasonably effective manner. In
this regard, I am struck by the depth of anger among mid-level
officials who came into government to work for Clinton. In recent
days I have heard variations of the following sentiments from them:
``I really wanted to forgive the guy and move on. I really wanted
to be able to defend him to my friends. But he gave me no
ammunition. What he did with Monica said to me that satisfying his
own sexual urges was more important than accomplishing his own
agenda, because he was obviously ready to risk his whole agenda for
that. I know Ken Starr is awful, but I just can't think of the
president the same way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is hard to listen to what your president is saying
when you can't even look him in the eye, and right now there are an
awful lot of officials and lawmakers who just can't look this
president in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they wanted to see the president cry in his
nationwide address. It is not that they wanted to see him beg for
mercy. It is that they wanted to see him do everything possible to
be able to govern again and pursue something close to the agenda
that enlisted their support in the first place. They wanted him to
draw a clear line between how he behaved before and how he intends
to behave in the future _ even though it may be fanciful to believe
that he could ever change. But instead of drawing a line between
who he was and who he intends to be, he just underlined his old
self _ blaming others, never quite apologizing and showing little
sign that he recognized that his misbehavior had created a problem,
not just for his family, but for everyone who served with him and
believed in him.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Clinton can repair that damage, it is going to paralyze
his ability to govern, whatever Starr does. Look at last week: The
U.S. attack on Osama bin Laden was an open-and-shut case. All the
official experts agreed that retaliation was warranted and
necessary. Nevertheless, the U.S. retaliation was questioned, at
home and abroad, as possibly having been motivated by the
president's need for a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   That tells me that even the most necessary things Clinton will
do during the next two years will be challenged as never before.
And it tells me that the voluntary things he chooses to do _ the
legislation and foreign policy initiatives he puts forward that are
not open-and-shut cases but rather his judgment calls, the hard
calls _ will be that much more difficult to accomplish, with his
allies keeping a distance and his opponents more skeptical than
ever. Saddam Hussein has again halted all U.N. inspections. How
would the country react if tomorrow Clinton announced that his
judgment was that we must now bomb Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   That is why for all those out there who would prefer to put this
affair behind the country because there are simply more important
problems to deal with. For all those who voted for Clinton because
they didn't want to see a ban on abortions, or have their public
school system gutted by vouchers or distorted by school prayers.
For all those who want to see campaign finance reform, education
reform and Social Security reform. For all those who care about
programs like Head Start and welfare reform. For all those who
preferred a philandering Bill Clinton over the second-rate
Republican alternatives. For all of them, Clinton needs to do
whatever it takes to prove that he ``can'' still be president, if
it is not too late.
</P>
<P>
   Because to have Clinton without any hope for Clintonism, well,
that's not a pretty picture. He alone is just not worth the trouble
anymore. His supporters, indeed a majority of Americans, were
always ready to overlook the failings in the man because of the
virtues of the agenda. But if there is no hope for the agenda, what
need is there for the man?

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surfers rejoiced Monday while anxious coastal
residents from Florida to Virginia kept a wary eye on Hurricane
Bonnie, a sluggish but powerful Atlantic storm that is confounding
forecasters with a wobbling track toward the southeastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., the National Weather Service declared a hurricane
watch from Savannah, Ga., to the border between North Carolina and
Virginia, meaning that hurricane conditions were possible anywhere
along that 450-mile stretch within the next 36 hours. But because
the hurricane was moving so slowly _ about 5 miles per hour in a
generally northwestern direction _ hurricane trackers had great
difficulty predicting where, when, or even if the storm would come
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel terrible because we know we've got all these people
hanging on and we're not being able to be very definitive for
them,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. ``And there's no quick end in sight. It may be
Wednesday before we get a landfall, or even later if it doesn't
start moving a little faster.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, the hurricane was sliding past the
northeastern side of the Bahamas. The center of the 400-mile-wide
storm was about 640 miles southeast of Savannah and about the same
distance south of Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum winds reached 115 miles per hour, placing the storm
within Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. By
comparison, Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in
1992, carried winds of 145 miles per hour, while Hurricane Hugo,
which struck Charleston, S.C., in 1989, had sustained winds of 135
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said that Hurricane Bonnie's size and strength ``makes
this hurricane a potential disaster sitting out there waiting to
fall on somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Eastern Seaboard, emergencyment teams began to
dust off plans for evacuating barrier islands and for housing
people with nowhere to go. In South Carolina, which harbors painful
memories of Hugo, Gov. David Beasley placed 1,000 members of the
National Guard on alert and asked them to move to their armories.
</P>
<P>
   But in most places, sunny skies and light winds provided at
least a temporary sense of reassurance, if not complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers enjoyed a day blessed with 6-foot waves, with some
skipping their first day of school and braving swells well after
nightfall. On Hilton Head Island, S.C., Nanci Polk-Weckhorst, the
owner of Nan-Seas Custom Canvas and Surf Shop, found herself torn
between the heightened demand for surfboards and her own desire to
ride the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is we all want to be out surfing so the shop's
been closed a lot of the time,'' Ms. Polk-Weckhorst said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Buxton, N.C., on Hatteras Island, John R. Hooper, the owner
of the Lighthouse View Motel, said surfers ``are having a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the hurricane's path was so uncertain, relatively few
coastal property owners were taking protective measures like
boarding and taping windows. Nancy Y. Peacock, a closet designer in
Neptune Beach, Fla., near Jacksonville, spent $300 on 20 sheets of
plywood, but left them piled in her driveway for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't usually have hurricanes in Jacksonville,'' Ms.
Peacock said. ``But I thought, as an added good luck charm, if we
buy all this stuff it will certainly not hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said his current forecast called for the hurricane to
land on the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Wednesday or Thursday.
But he said he had ``low confidence'' in that prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is the hurricane's lethargic pace makes it
susceptible to relatively minor atmospheric forces. ``If you think
about a ball that's moving very fast, it's harder to change its
direction or to stop it,'' he said. ``But if it's moving very
slowly, it's fairly easy to change its direction or stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it moves sharp, closer to west, then it goes into north
Florida,'' Jarrell said. ``If it moves almost straight north, it
goes into the Outer Banks. That's a horribly wide zone to be
talking about, but unfortunately that's sort of where we are at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Powerful riptides, possibly generated by the hurricane's
offshore winds, were blamed for the drowning deaths on Sunday of a
24-year-old man in Delaware and a 25-year-old man in South
Carolina. Some 100 people were rescued from the dangerous surf in
Atlantic City, N.J., on Sunday, and 30 were saved in Carolina
Beach, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlantic City Monday, as elsewhere along the coast,
lifeguards restricted bathers to waist-deep water and few swimmers
found themselves in trouble, said Robert Levy, that city's beach
patrol director.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Idaho third-grade teacher Barbara Morgan is back in line, albeit
a long one, for a trip to space.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old educator was one of 31 people from seven
countries and from backgrounds as varied as medicine, engineering
and the military who gathered Monday at the Johnson Space Center as
members of NASA's latest class of astronaut candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan gained notoriety more than a dozen years ago as the
backup to Christa McAuliffe, the New Hampshire schoolteacher who
perished with six others in the explosion of the shuttle
Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the space agency announced an end to its
lengthy deliberations over whether Morgan, the mother of two young
boys, would get the opportunity to fly. Morgan would, NASA
administrator Dan Goldin decided in January, but only after
qualifying as a full-fledged NASA mission specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure glad I'm here,'' beamed Morgan, who is eligible
because NASA has decided to include teachers in the list of
professions eligible to become astronauts. ``Training with this
class and having education fully integrated like this is a big and
important step. I'm glad to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As McAuliffe and Morgan prepared for their much heralded mission
in the mid-1980s they were considered ``payload specialists,''
professionals invited by NASA to fly in space because their
expertise was needed for a particular mission. They did not intend
to make a career of spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, like her colleagues, faces a year of instruction before
she is eligible for a flight assignment. Once eligible for flight,
most mission specialists are assigned to ground-based
responsibilities for a year or two before they are named to a
flight crew. The training for a specific mission can take another
year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan intends to weave her passion for education with an
opportunity to help assemble the new U.S.-led international space
station or to conduct scientific research in space. At the same
time, she plans to remain a liaison between the nation's educators
and the space agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is really important to NASA, and it's certainly
important to our country,'' said Morgan, who left a third-grade
classroom in McCall, Idaho, to join NASA full time. ``All of these
folks are here because of a good educational system. We are all
here to learn and work together.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,600 U.S. citizens applied to NASA for a slot in the
astronaut corps. Less than 5 percent qualified for an interview,
and only 25 were hired.
</P>
<P>
   The new class was expanded by six to include astronauts from
France, Italy, Germany, Canada and Brazil. Eight Houston-area
professionals are among the new class: Patricia Hilliard, 35, of
Seabrook; Gary C. Johnson, 44, of Friendswood; Clayton Anderson,
39, of League City; Timothy Creamer, 38, of League City; Gregory
Chamitoff, 36, of Houston; Michael Fossum, 40, of Houston; Steven
Swanson, 37, of Friendswood; and Douglas Wheelock, 37, of Seabrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolute thrilled to be a part of this program, with the
space station around the corner,'' said Hilliard, a NASA flight
surgeon. ``I think that provides a stepping stone for future
exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been flying air planes for over 20 years,'' said Johnson,
a former military aviator who serves as a research pilot and chief
of maintenance for the NASA aircraft based at Ellington Field.
``This is the best flying job in the universe.''

CANCER PATIENT ARRESTED IN PLOT TO MAIL SODIUM CYANIDE PACKETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A woman stricken with cancer who lives in a van
was arrested here on Sunday in what authorities said was a plot to
mail packets of sodium cyanide to at least 100 people, including
medical professionals and a dozen or more New York residents, by
disguising the contents as nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Kathryn Schoonover, 50, was seen by a witness in the
lobby of a post office in Marina del Rey on Sunday afternoon
wearing protective gloves and filling the packets from a container
marked as poison, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and
postal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, who was getting mail from a post office box, went
outside and called authorities, who found the woman in a van parked
in front of the post office. At least 100 envelopes, containing
about a teaspoon each of sodium cyanide and a health supplement
brochure, had not been mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schoonover, who appeared bald and gaunt in a photograph on
television news programs, was booked on suspicion of attempted
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sodium cyanide can be lethal in doses as small as a few
milligrams, said Brent Ekins, the director of the division of the
California Poison Control System in Fresno. People who ingest it
often collapse, vomit, suffer convulsions and seizures and pass
out, Ekins said, and they can die within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department said detectives had confirmed that four
people on the list, New York residents, have received similar
correspondence from Ms. Schoonover in the last two months, though
it was unclear if those envelopes contained poison. Some intended
recipients contacted by authorities knew who she was, while others
had no recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to identify the recipients or the witness.
Ms. Schoonover denied to investigators that she had previously
mailed out any pamphlets and did not offer an explanation for
having envelopes with poison in them. Officials said anyone who had
received such a package should contact a postal inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators worked through the night into Monday reaching
people on the mailing list, many of whom are medical profession.
Bob Killeen, a sheriff's deputy, said detectives were trying to
determine whether those professionals, including physicians and
people who draw blood, had treated Ms. Schoonover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the common thread yet is,'' Killeen said.
``It may be some place where she was treated, we don't know. Our
investigators are working like mad to try and get in contact with
people. It's really quite chaotic. It's a very difficult case.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers from West Covina, an eastern suburb of Los
Angeles, were on the list.

 &HT;    Over-the-counter drug causes quite a stir in sports circles
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, Mark McGwire took a rest. The same could not be said
of the controversy rippling throughout the sports world regarding
his use of an over-the-counter drug.
</P>
<P>
   The substance is Androstenedione, a container of which was
spotted in the St. Louis slugger's locker last week by a reporter.
His story touched off a firestorm over McGwire's consumption of the
drug, which is banned by many major sports organizations because a
segment of the medical community considers it about as close as you
can get on the hormone chain to illegal anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire sat in the dugout during the Cardinals' rainout in
Pittsburgh:
</P>
<P>
   _ Baseball commissioner Bud Selig spent the day soliciting
opinions from medical experts on the drug.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many American athletes involved in Olympic sports phoned the
U.S. Olympic Committee's drug hotline to ask why they cannot ingest
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ An NCAA official expressed concern that its use is growing on
the college level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health and nutrition retail stores reported inquiries from
curious customers about its availability.
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire closes in on one of sports' most revered records _
the single-season home run mark of 61 _ the little pills he
swallows to raise testosterone levels in his body and thus increase
strength has drawn attention to the inconsistent approach toward
drugs among athletics organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Most Olympic sport federations test for numerous drugs not only
at major events but also in spot out-of-competition situations. The
NCAA tests athletes out of season and at post-season events. The
NFL tests for steroids at the start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, like the NBA, forbids only some illegal
``street'' drugs. In both cases, drug policies are determined in
conjunction with the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any change will have to be approved by the union,'' Selig
said. ``This is a collective bargaining matter.''
</P>
<P>
   A league spokesman said Selig received varied opinions on the
potential risks of Androstenedione and hopes to bring his findings
soon to the players union.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic world's position is clear. Billie Marseilles-Berge,
a USOC pharmacist, said Androstenedione has been on the
International Olympic Committee's banned list ``forever,'' but not
until last year did athletes begin asking about the status of its
various brand-name supplements. Swimmers from the former East
Germany previously had been known to rely on the drug to improve
performance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marseilles-Berge said research generally supports claims that
the drug raises levels of testosterone, the body's primary
muscle-building hormone. As a result, it is forbidden under IOC
drug guidelines, even if it enables the body to create more of a
natural substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bake a cake and you add one cake mix, it'll make you a
regular size cake,'' she said. ``If you go out and take five cake
mixes, you're going to have a really big cake. Well, the analogy
here is they're adding in more cake mixes.''
</P>
<P>
   The substance is under scrutiny from the Food and Drug
Administration because it is advertised to double or triple the
production of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are curious,'' Marseilles-Berge said. ``The
big question is, why are they allowing it in baseball. Most of my
guys know you can't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL prohibited the substance in December 1996. Dr. John
Lombardo, the league's adviser on steroids, cited the anabolic
steroid qualities of the drug and the fact that no studies have
been conducted on side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The recent suspensions of Georgia Tech tight ends Chris Myers
and Mike Lillie after positive tests for the drug illustrated its
presence on the college level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's catching on because it's accessible,'' said Cindy Thomas,
the NCAA's assistant director of sports science. ``Athletes find
it's there and they can get their hands on it. It does increase
performance, increases strength and size ... and that catches on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not expensive, either. One form of the drug costs $50-$60
for 120 pills, about a 30-day supply for the recommended dosage of
four to six pills a day. Another form costs $20-$40 for 80
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   GNC stores, a national chain, does not stock Androstenedione
because, as local franchise owner Mark Leavitt said Monday, ``it's
too much related to steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   But other stores with the drug on their shelves indicated the
publicity has triggered calls. Greg Hynson, owner of Super
Nutrition in Marietta, Ga., said he bemoans the negative hoopla
over the product, and indicated he believes it's a safe and
effective supplement. Hynson says taking a capsule prior to working
out temporarily raises one's testosterone level by ''about 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You basically get a small spike for a duration of three or
four hours,'' Hynson said. ''When testosterone levels are raised,
you're going to have greater nitrogen retention. And with higher
nitrogen levels, you can recover faster from any workout.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does make you stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are hesitant about recommending hormone supplements
in amounts above what the body would naturally produce. Dr. William
Regelson, author of ``The Super Hormone Promise: Nature's Answer to
Aging'' and an oncologist at Medical College of Virginia in
Richmond, advocates using supplements only at replacement levels as
the hormones begin to decline around age 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes are using these supplements beyond what is needed to
prevent decline,'' he said. ``There should be a word of caution in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also claim Androstenedione can aide sexual
performance.

</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS will telecast tonight's game, Fox Sports South will
telecast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Today, RHP Kevin Millwood (14-7,
4.35; first appearance vs. Astros) vs. LHP Mike Hampton (9-6, 3.87;
2-6, 3.66 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday, RHP John Smoltz (12-2,
3.44; 13-12, 3.12 lifetime vs. Astros) vs. RHP Sean Bergman (11-6,

</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 277-275 but
is 7-8 at the Astrodome dating back to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves split a four-game series in Houston
May 15-18. A two-homer performance by Eddie Perez decided the first
game, before Astros starters Shane Reynolds and Sean Bergman
limited Atlanta to three earned run over the next two games. Tom
Glavine salvaged the split with seven innings of shutout work in a
4-0 win in the fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Astros leaders: Ave.: Craig Biggio (.327); HR Moises Alou
(38); RBI Alou (115); SB Craig Biggio (41). W Shane Reynolds (16);

<P>
   _ Quickly: The Astros are coming off a 6-2 road trip that just
concluded with a three-game sweep in Chicago. Houston's NL Central
lead over the Cubs, which was 3-1/2 games when the month began, is
up to a season-high 10-1/2. After going 53-34 (.609) before the
All-Star break, Houston is 29-16 (.644) since. . . . The current
82-50 record is the best 132-game record in Houston history. With
two more victories, the team can match t season win total. .

surpassing the 138-mark over the weekend, the old mark set in 1993.
The Astros have hit 13 homers in their last six games alone. . . .
Houston is leading the league in runs (738), RBI (680), stolen
bases (132) and on-base percentage (.357). They trail only Colorado
in hits, average and doubles. . . . The team ERA (3.64) is third
lowest in the league. Only the Braves have walked fewer batters. .
. . Hampton, tonight's starter, has just one victory in his last 11
starts. Seven of those games have been no-decisions. He is 1-3
since coming off the DL July 3 (strained groin). While his ERA has
remained respectable, Hampton has been hit consistently during this
span, having given up 76 hits in his last 60 innings. The Braves
beat him 4-0 May 18, when the bottom of the Atlanta order was
6-for-13 and drove in three runs. . . . On the DL: RHP Chris Holt
(shoulder surgery), RHP Ramon Garcia (right elbow ligament strain),
RHP Jose Cabrera (sore right shoulder), INF Jack Howell (broken

at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: OF Derek Bell went 6-for-31 (.194) on the road trip.
INF Tim Bogar is hitless in 15 at-bats, during which time his wife
gave birth to their second child. 1B Jeff Bagwell has one hit in

 &HT;    Mathias walks tall, makes big noise in NFL
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Amidst the glittering array of major college stars
stands the NFL's version of the underdog ``Rudy'' _ 5-foot-10,
180-pound Ric Mathias from NCAA Division III University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidated? Not at all. Eager to show he belongs in the NFL?
Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   All the undrafted rookie cornerback did in the Bengals' 33-19
victory over Detroit was commit two crimes _ one that aided the
enemy and another that sealed the win.
</P>
<P>
   Flagged for fair-catch interference when he bumped Detroit's
Terry Fair while trying to down a punt inside Detroit's 5-yard
line, Mathias made up for it by intercepting a Chris Dittoe pass
and racing 67 yards for a touchdown with 34 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias' last-minute heroics may not be enough to make the team.
That's why he's sweating out today's seven cuts as NFL rosters get
reduced to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking every play like it's my last play,'' Mathias said.
``I'm enjoying the people I'm around. I'm very, very grateful to be
in this situation and I just don't want to take anything for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   What isn't subject to debate is his intensity, desire and
lightning quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his guts, determination, quickness, speed and
toughness,'' said Jim Lippincott, the Bengals director of
pro/college personnel. ``The kid has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams are always hunting talent. So when the Bengals got a
call from UW-La Crosse coach Roger Harring regarding Mathias, they
figured: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't expecting very much,'' Lippincott said. ``What we
got was something pretty commendable. Ric plays the game the way
it's meant to be played _ 100 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathias knows he fighting tremendous odds with his size and
inexperience. But when skeptics say, ``You can't,'' he says, ``I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a small school, you're not expected to make it to
this level,'' he said. ``You see these guys on TV and you just
dream of playing with them someday. Now all of a sudden it's come
true. You have to understand you're here and you can't get caught
up in all the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not intimidated by these guys as far as their speed and
strength. It's just a matter of getting to know who I've got to
respect and how many steps I've got to give certain receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathias admits the complexity of the Bengals 3-4 defense with
all the checks, formations and responsibilities is ``a lot more
mentally taxing'' than college. But he's adjusting well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pulling for me to see if I can hang on,'' he said.
``I just want to make the most of my opportunity.''

CLINTON TO NAME COUNCIL TO OVERSEE FOOD SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will appoint a high-level council
to oversee food safety in the United States, an activity now
performed separately by a dozen agencies, a senior White House
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Clinton would sign an executive order on
Tuesday establishing the council, which would have the
responsibility of coordinating enforcement, research and
educational activities but would not have the authority to do any
of those things on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is generally regarded as having one
of the safest food supplies in the world, there are frequent
outbreaks of illnesses, many of them fatal, caused by harmful
substances in food. In recent years a strain of bacteria known as
E. coli 0157:H7 has caused many illnesses and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The government until recently has shown little leadership in
dealing with illnesses caused by unwholesome food. There is a
patchwork of weak state agencies as well as a federal bureaucracy
that focused more on reacting to outbreaks than on preventing them.
The new executive order places emphasis on prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last week by the Institute of Research and
the National Research Council, two groups that advise the
government on science, the number of deaths caused by food-borne
organisms was estimated at 9,000 a year, a figure that uted
by the food industry as too high.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the panel that produced the report, Dr. John
Bailar III of the University of Chicago, said, ``The United States
has some of the attributes of an effective food safety system, but
it lacks a central authority and is hampered by old laws that don't
allow flexible responses to today's threats.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizations, arms of the National Academy of Science,
called in its report for the appointment of one individual to
oversee food safety, a ``czar'' in current government argot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the president will name a troika to lead the new
council, which is not expected to require any new federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will appoint three co-chairmen of what will be called
the President's Council on Food Safety. They will be the secretary
of Agriculture, the secretary of Health and Human Services and the
assistant to the president for science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as members of the council will be the secretary of
Commerce, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the assistant
to the president for domestic policy and the director of the
National Partnership for Reinventing Government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of consumer and industry organizations, who had not
yet seen the final order, praised its overall thrust, but with some
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group, lamented the
choice of a three-headed council over a strong individual as
recommended in the scientists' report.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``We think that this is acceptable as a temporary
measure, a first step. The report clearly found weaknesses in how
we currently inspect food. This is modestly better.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Willard, the spokesman of the National Food Processors
Association, said the appointment of the council ``seems to be
moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The industry official was pleased that the program would not be
led by a single person. ``When you have a czar, that would probably
create a new bureaucracy,'' he said. ``It is important to keep
politics out of food safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House official said Congress would not be asked to
provide additional federal money to run the council.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why the president was creating the council by
executive order instead of asking Congress to institute it with
legislation, she answered: ``When the law allows us to put in place
a mechanism with an executive order, we are going to act to achieve
our objectives. Current law does allow us to put it in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was the likelihood that the Republican-controlled
Congress would have refused to pass legislation creating the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to President Clinton, said Monday
that the creation of the council was an important part in Clinton's
efforts to make food safety a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the system has been unchanged since Teddy Roosevelt
put it in place,'' Emanuel said. ``It's another chapter in the
president's efforts to modernize the nation's food safety system.''

 &HT;    Bonnie flirting, keeps coast guessing
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt and Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ With Hurricane Bonnie at least a day
away, surfers Monday rode the churning, dangerously powerful waves
next to a pier badly damaged two years ago by Hurricanes Bertha and
Fran.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark Johnnie Mercer's Fishing Pier and other businesses
along this narrow beach town have recovered from Bertha and Fran,
but residents have not forgotten the wreckage caused by the
back-to-back hurricanes _ North Carolina's most costly natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will leave if Bonnie is headed this way,'' said Eric
Knowles, 27, manager of Johnnie Mercer's pier, which lost 320 of
its 740 feet when Bertha barrelled up the Cape Fear River on July
12, 1996, and Fran followed on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Thick pilings that supported the end of the pier snapped off in
the storms. As reminders of the hurricanes' fury, the ragged
timbers still stick out of the blueish green water.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the North Carolina coast would take its third direct hit
in two years remained frustratingly uncertain Monday night, as
Bonnie, with sustained winds of 115 mph, moved erratically in the
Atlantic some 600 miles off the Florida coast, menacing the whole
Southern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch Monday for
an area stretching from Savannah to the North Carolina/Virginia
border. Forecasters said Bonnie could make landfall Wednesday
morning _ or not at all, possibly turning north and skirting the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Bonnie's erratic movement, no areas had been
evacuated Monday, and vacationers continued to frolic along the
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   At Wrightsville Beach, officials said Monday that a possible
evacuation was at leay away, but many property owners picked
up decals that would allow them to return to the island in the
event it is closed to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   On the Georgia coast, emergency officials and residents were on
hold as Bonnie stalled and wobbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the coastal counties are just sitting around waiting for
her to make up her mind,'' said Becky Tindall, assistant to Glynn
County Emergency Management Director Ed Abel.
</P>
<P>
   Abel said the Wal-Mart in Brunswick was stripped of D-cell
batteries over the weekend as residents laid in extra flashlight
batteries, bottled water, nonperishible foods and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just hurry up and wait,'' he said. ``It's too
early to evacuate. But as close as this storm is, if it picks up
speed and comes toward us, we'll all be moving and moving
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   On St. Simons Island, residents and vacationers enjoyed a
windless, sunshiny day, despite the fact that high surf advisories
covered the length of the Georgia coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean looked just like it always does when I rode past the
pier,'' said Gordon Strother, co-owner of J.C. Strother &AMP; Co., the
island's oldest hardware store near the beach. ``I'm looking out
the window at the oak trees right now and you can barely see the
leaves moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Palmer, a plywood salesman from Savannah, said plywood
sales were brisk Monday. In South Carolina, where the memories of
Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph winds remain vivid after nine years, Gov.
David Beasley ordered 1,300 National Guardsmen to coastal armories
in case they are needed to direct evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, many coastal communities still show evidence
of the long recovery from the 1996 hurricanes. At the northern end
of Wrightsville Beach, an inlet washes against sandbags protecting
Shell Island Resort, a high-rise that closed for nine months of
repairs after Hurricane Fran.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $2 million, a beach renourishment project pumped
900,000 cubic yards of sand onto the beach. But a dearth of dunes
leaves some waterfront homes vulnerable to high water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as ready as we can be ready,'' said Wrightsville Beach
Mayor Avery Roberts, 72, at the town hall on Sea Water Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing near Shell Island Resort, Daniel Goff, 20, said he had
stocked up on water, canned tuna and beer and had stored his
20-foot boat.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a violent wave broke his surfboard in half Monday,
Goff said, ``I am going to stay. I'm just waiting to pick up a new
surfboard.''

 &HT;    Emotions tense as hearing on schools, taxes opens
 &HT;    By Tim Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LEXINGTON, Ohio _ The state of Ohio and a coalition of local
school districts squared off in a southeastern Ohio courtroom
Monday during a sometimes tense hearing that saw the state
solicitor quote Communist Karl Marx to support property taxes for
schools and the schools' attorney deride the General Assembly's
funding fix.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom drama was a new starting point for a 7-year-old
legal case in which a coalition of Ohio school districts has been
trying to force the state to adopt a new funding mechanism that
provides every student with a ``thorough and efficient'' education
as required by the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Coalition for Equity &AMP; Adequacy of School Funding won
its case on March 24, 1997 when the Ohio Supreme Court ordered a
new funding formula. In the following 17 months, the General
Assembly has taken numerous steps it says solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The new trial before Judge Linton D. Lewis Jr. of the Perry
County Common Pleas Court is to determine the validity of that
claim. Lewis issued the original ruling in 1994, finding the system
unconstitutional because its relies too heavily on local property
taxes and thus property-poor districts cannot adequately fund their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The first day featured opening arguments followed by nearly five
hours of testimony and cross-examination of House Speaker Jo Ann
Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Both she and State Solicitor Jeffrey Sutton said the Legislature
has pumped millionsof additional dollars into primary and
secondary education, has developed a new funding subsidy of $4,063
per pupil, and is providing additional millions for school
renovation and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said the changes reduce the reliance on property taxes
and redistribute tax dollars across the state. He said the high
court did not demand that property taxes be scrapped and that it
would not be feasible to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl Marx could not have identified a fairer way of
distributing wealth,' Sutton said. ``I can't believe the voters
want us to get rid of that linchpin of our system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas Pittner, coalition attorney, said legislative
leaders have ``fallen woefully short'' of a systemic overhaul of
the funding formula. ``What was then is now. We haven't fixed it.
It is a house of cards that will collapse under close scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson appeared testy at times under cross-examination from
coalition attorney Quintin Lindsmith, who suggested that the
Legislature made the situation worse by enacting new mandates on
schools only to see voters defeat a state sales tax hike that many
believed was to be ufund the new formula.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson denied that the tax hike was directly linked to the
school reforms and said money from other revenue sources will be
available to pay for the changes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Monday, coalition leaders put their price tag
on the cost of an adequate education.
</P>
<P>
   If the case as expected goes back to the Supreme Court, Pittner
said the schools would ask for an order forcing the state to
gu $5,051 per student. Assuming a 50-50 split between with
local school districts, the new figure would add more than $1
billion to the $5.2 billion the state now spends annually on public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition also wants the state to pay the entire cost of
transportation and special education. And ultimately if the schools
have their way, a court-appointed overseer would determine the cost
of an adequate education and a way to pay for it, Pittner said.

FLIGHT 103 FAMILIES DISTRESSED BY TRIAL PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten years after terrorists killed her husband and
269 others in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Eleanor Bright
winced at a compromise the United States and Britain announced
Monday in an attempt to bring the suspects to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, addressing Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy's
request that two Libyans charged in the bombing be tried in a
neutral country, became public just days after the United States
unleashed its military might in retaliation for recent terrorist
bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the US-British proposal, the suspects would be tried by a
Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands. The Libyan foreign
minister told the United Nations in January that his government
would accept Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many relatives of the Pan Am 103 bombing victims want the
suspects tried in the United States or Scotland, where the bombing
occurred. And several wondered aloud Monday how the United States
could appear to compromise with alleged terrorists in Libya less
than a week after US raids on suspected terrorist sites effectively
declared war on terrorism around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very distressing,'' Bright said Monday of the US
attacks last week in Sudan and Afghanistan. ``It made all of us
feel as if our loved ones' lives weren't important enough,'' she
said by telephone from Little Cranberry Island off Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bright's husband, Nicholas, a manager for Boston-based Bain &AMP;
Co., was among 189 Americans who died in the explosion over
Lockerbie, Scotland, four days before Christmas in 1988. Seventy
other people on board were killed, as were 11 in Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest chapter of the Pan Am 103 explosion _ the most
deadly terrorist attack ever on American civilians _ Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright outlined the compromise plan in a
conference call Monday with Bright and 22 other relatives of the
bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, which drew mixed reactions among the
families, United Nations sanctions against Libya will be lifted if
Khadafy accepts the offer from the United States and Britain to
allow the suspects to be tried in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Khadafy has refused since the suspects were indicted in 1991 to
deliver them to the United States or Scotland, insisting they would
not receive a fair trial in either place.
</P>
<P>
   With few other diplomatic alternatives, the Clinton
administration decided ``to call the Libyan government's bluff,''
Albright told reporters after speaking to the family
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has urged tougher sanctions on
Libya to try to force Khadafy to turn over the suspects, reserved
judgment on the change in strategy. ``This is a new proposal, which
is in its early stages, and I want to study it carefully,'' he
said. ``If it is truly air-tight and will at long last bring to
justice those responsible for this heinous act, then it should move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives of the bombing victims also reserved judgment.
``It's clear to me that if Libya has not cooperated by now, they
never will,'' said Lestra Carpe Benello, of Hanover, N.H., a
retired physician whose 24-year-old son, Julian, died in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Benello, a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale
University, was working toward a doctoral degree at Cambridge
University when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cognizant of why it would be best to have the trial here
or in Scotland,'' his mother said. ``But what we need is a trial,
and I believe nothing further will happen as things stand now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright, whose son, Nick, was a year old when the bomb exploded,
said she worries about the United States stepping onto a ``slippery
slope'' by appearing to bargain with Khadafy. And she urged the
United States to push for an oil embargo against Libya if he
rejects this offer. The administration said Monday it would seek to
tighten UN sanctions and add unilateral measures if there is a
rejection.

TABLOID HERALD FIELDS REDESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some Boston Herald readers blinked when they saw it,
confusing the newly colorized tabloid with USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Others never saw the paper at all, or at least not until well
after the morning commute, because of a production foul-up that
delayed delivery for hours in some cases and nearly melted down the
newspaper's central switchboard with readers' calls.
</P>
<P>
   When the ink had dried on Monday's much-heralded, $10 million
Herald redesign, though, most agreed that the effort was both
splashy and historic. Splashy in the sense that the paper's snazzy
new packaging was a certified eye-grabber, and historic in the
sense that, for better or for worse, an era in local newspapering
was officially McPapered over and done with.
</P>
<P>
   Or, HUB TABLOID BIDS FANS ADIEU.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is the Herald's doing what all local TV stations and
newsmagazines are doing, and that's giving readers what the focus
groups say they want,'' said Northeastern journalism professor
Charles Fountain. ``Whether this means USA Today without the
national weather map or USA Today with an attitude remains to be
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Business Journal editor Jay Fitzgerald pronounced the
redesign ``very, very good _ as close as you can get to a home run
with a redesign, and I've redesigned a few papers myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Chicago, where the tabloid Sun Times underwent a
similar redesign in the '90s, Fitzgerald said he recognizes the
gamble being undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always that fear of alienating old-time loyal readers,
and I can see some saying, `Oh, the Herald is going too upscale,'''
Fitzgerald said. ``But the paper clearly needs more suburban
readers. And frankly I'm mostly hearing positive things so far.''
</P>
<P>
   New England Adweek editor Judy Warner noted a richer mix of
national advertisers in Monday's Herald, a hopeful sign for the
market's No. 2 newspaper, but not necessarily a guarantee of future
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the crisis of confidence in journalism today, including
local journalism, the redesign could not have come at a better time
for the Herald,'' said Warner. ``But something may still be lost
here. Will the Herald take itself too seriously? That remains to be
seen. If they wind up losing readers, they'll probably tweak the
new design and go back to their old tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's tricks had some readers out trying to track down a copy
of the paper before lunch hour. Malfunctioning presses and problems
with the equipment that folds the paper led to an embarrassingly
late roll-out that prompted hundreds of complaints from impatient
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was horrible, especially considering the time and
effort spent on promotion,'' acknowledged Gwen Gage, Herald vice
president for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gage, the Herald printed 375,000 copies of Monday's
paper, 50,000 more than the usual press run. While some areas west
and north of the city were unaffected by the production delays, the
downtown area _ the heart of the paper's readership _ was hardest
hit. Many newsstand customers simply assumed the paper had sold
out, unaware that it had yet to arrive.

WHILE CRONY CAPITALISTS THRIVE, MANY RUSSIANS FACE BLEAK FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A middle-aged woman wipes away a tear as she emerges
from the MOST Bank a block from Red Square. She just learned that
Russia's currency crisis had prevented her from withdrawing
savings.
</P>
<P>
   At a subway entrance, an old woman leans heavily against the
railing, burdened by two bags stuffed with bootleg beer that she
would sell for a few rubles' profit _ survival money for someone
whose pension works out to about $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   These are scenes from the ``new'' Russia. With the ruble
devalued, prices will go up once more, further lowering a standard
of living that has plummeted through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven years after the Soviet Union's fall, many Russians
feel powerless. They are embittered at their president and deeply
cynical about a government in which corrupt Communist bosses have
been replaced by crony capitalists _ sometimes the very same
people.
</P>
<P>
   They see poverty of pensioners intensify while the new rich
consume conspicuously. Last week, after the ruble was allowed to
free-fall, customers found themselves unable to withdraw savings
from MOST, one of the city's major commercial banks. Its major
owner, Vladimir Gusinsky, was vacationing at his home in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, there is no change. Any real change must still come
in the future,'' said Irina Gorvich, an elderly architect who
helped restore the Great Palace in Pavlovsk near St. Petersburg
after it was looted and burned by German occupiers in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The crony capitalism of today ``is not much different from the
old Communist Party,'' added Alexey Naimoosheen, 23, a medical
student from Ufa in the Ural Mountains, who was visiting his sister
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Naimoosheen sees President Boris Yeltsin as nothing more than
the party boss he was for most of his adult life. ``He is
Communist, he was Communist. We need somebody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll found that only 4 percent of Russians would back a
Yeltsin re-election bid in 2000. It's not hard to see why. Russia's
``misery index'' figures shoot off the chart.
</P>
<P>
   The male life expectancy in Russia has declined since 1987 from
65 to 57 years. An estimated 75 percent of the population lives at
or below the subsistence level. The once-buoyant stock market has
dropped more than 75 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures do not even factor in the way average Russians get
beaten down by the system, or fleeced in various scams. One
incident recently took place in St. Petersburg, a city that lost an
estimated 1.1 million people as German troops tried to starve it
into submission during a 900-day World War II siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bank that opened a fund for veterans, promising
tremendous profits. In a year or so, the bank collapsed,'' said
Father Alexander Tkachenko, a Russian Orthodox priest who works at
St. Nicholas's Cathedral in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian court system refused to order owners of the defunct
bank to pay back any of the investors' money. The veterans appealed
to the St. Petersburg city government. The mayor promised to redeem
their investment out of public funds. Instead of taxes going for
good roads and medical care _ two critical needs of the city _ ``we
end up helping banks solve their problems,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the Soviet era came the term ``blat,'' which roughly
translates as influence or clout. While Communism has been
consigned to the dust bin of history, ``blat'' still rules Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of oligarchs was allowed to buy state assets
cheaply. The result has been creation of economic empires like
Gazprom, which controls one-third of the world's natural gas
reserves and accounts for about 5 percent of Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is Russia's largest taxpayer, but Gazprom ``does not pay
nearly the taxes that it should,'' author David Remnick noted in
his book ``Resurrection: The Struggle for a new Russia.'' Recently,
government tax authorities put a lien on Gazprom assets until a
deal for higher taxes was worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The last oil and gas minister of the Soviet Union, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, became head of Gazprom when it was privatized. The
job reportedly made him one of Russia's richest men.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was named in 1993 as Russia's prime minister, and
served five years. On Sunday, four months after firing him, Yeltsin
reinstated the industrialist-technocrat as head of government.
Gazprom stock rose 24 percent on news of Chernomyrdin's
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government cannot pay salaries to the millions of
people who still work for it.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Kisselev, an obstetrician-gynecologist in St. Petersburg,
has not been paid in two months. She does receive income from
private patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blat'' operates in ways large and small. The omni-present
security force at the Intourist Hotel in downtown Moscow is known
to harass ordinary Russians when they enter. Last week, however,
prostitutes brazenly plied their trade in the hotel's bars, casino
and elevator landing. A man appearing to be a pimp sat in the lobby
bar, frequently rising to huddle with security men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nouveau Russians!'' snapped an engineer in Pavlovsk as he
passed a mammoth new house near his city's famous 19th century
palace.
</P>
<P>
   The country's new rich do not hesitate to show off their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prominent businessmen and pop-stars, famous politicians and
diplomats are frequent guests of our Club. Join us and feel
yourself part of St. Petersburg's high life!'' says a brochure for
the posh Taleon Club, located in a restored mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Once though a metal detector, guests partake of caviar and

   Nearby, in the Alexander Nevsky Montastery by the gates of a

<P>
   ``I am an Orthodox refuge from Azerbaijan,'' Viktor said,
referring to a Muslim former Soviet republic by the Caspian Sea.

first worshiped more than 60 years ago. It was long used as a
repair facility for Red Army tanks. While Ivanovich can again hear
the word of God, he knows that many fellow veterans are not getting
enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if life is better in the new Russia, Ivanovich stroked his
chin and replied: ``It is a very difficult question. Some people
think in Soviet times, it was better than now.''

   The new Russia has genuine adherents, mainly among young people
who sense opportunities in capitalism and have the skills to be
part of a global marketplace.

problem,'' said Nina Novikova, 23, a recent university graduate who
is going to work in Moscow before pursuing post-graduate studies.

<P>
   There is an array of once-scarce products, and a climate of free
cultural expression in which one can find a Kurt Cobain calendar
for sale at the new World War II memorial on a hill above Moscow.

   ``They are silly,'' said Lena, an 18-year-old university
student, when asked about people who believe life was better under

Moscow and St. Petersburg, if you have a job and can live there.
You can have a real life in other countries. But for many people,

U.S. SAYS IRAQ AIDED PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: ATTACK-SUDAN, ATTACK-PAKISTAN) 
 This article was reported by WILLIAM J. BROAD, BARBARA CROSSETTE,
JUDITH MILLER and STEVEN LEE MYERS and written by MYERS  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States believed that senior Iraqi
scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX
at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed
last week, administration and intelligence officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence the administration has cited as justification for
the attack consisted of a soil sample secretly obtained months ago
outside the pharmaceutical factory, the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries, the officials said. Officially the administration has
refused to describe its evidence in any detail, or to say how it
was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The sample contained a rare chemical that would require two more
complex steps to be turned into VX, one of the deadliest nerve
agents in existence, and the chemical, whose acronym is EMPTA, has
no industrial uses. The United Nations and the United States have
long agreed that Iraq is extremely skilled at many kinds of VX
production, having worked for years to perfect the best process.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
there was evidence that senior Iraqi scientists had aided the
efforts to make VX at that factory, and at another plant a couple
of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The connection with Iraq emerged as a key part of the
administration's argument for why it was justified in launching
cruise missiles at a plant in another country without any warning.
</P>
<P>
   The officials disclosed the information, four days after the
American strike, to try to counter claims by the Sudanese
government that the factory, located in an industrial area of
Khartoum, was purely a benign commercial venture that produced half
of the Sudan's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, rebuffed calls from the Sudan and
other countries to turn over its evidence. At the United Nations,
the Security Council on Monday put off a request by Arab nations _
submitted by one of the United States' closest Arab allies, Kuwait
_ to send inspectors to search the rubble in Khartoum for signs of
chemicals related to VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what the purpose of a fact-finding study would
be,'' Peter Burleigh, the deputy American representative to the
United Nations, said after the meeting. ``We have credible
information that fully justifies the strike we made on that one
facility in Khartoum.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Khartoum, the Sudanese president, Omar
Hassan el-Bashir, kept up his sharp attacks on the United States
and President Clinton, saying Clinton ordered the attack to cover
up the furor over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his senior aides have described the evidence linking
the factory to the production of VX as compelling and even
irrefutable, though until Monday the administration refused to
discuss the evidence in any but the most general way.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the soil
sample, collected outside the factory, contained traces of a
``precursor chemical`` called ethyl methylphosphonothionate, or
EMPTA. There would be no viable explanation for the presence of
that chemical, they said, other than the production of VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't obtain this chemical because you're making ball
point pens or whatever,'' an administration official said. ``If
you're making this, you're making VX.''
</P>
<P>
   VX is an odorless, colorless liquid that can kill with
remarkable speed. A mere drop on the skin or inhaled in the lungs
is enough to kill an adult within minutes. There are a number of
ways to make the agent, but the officials in Washington and other
American and foreign officials said the technique using EMPTA is
one Iraq used to develop its own VX stockpiles in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and at the United Nations said there
were a number of other factors linking Iraq to the pharmaceutical
plant, as well as a second facility.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, President Saddam Hussein's government asked
the committee that monitors U.N. sanctions to allow it to buy
medicines from the factory under the ``oil for food'' program that
allows humanitarian supplies into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative to the United
Nations who is this month's president of the sanctions committee,
confirmed the request, but the officials said it was not clear what
medicines were ordered or whether any were ever delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations closely monitors goods purchased
under the ``oil for food'' program, the officials said the contract
could have provided a pretext for extensive visits by Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
   A senior intelligence official said that one of the leaders of
Iraq's chemical weapons program, Emad al-Ani, had close ties with
senior Sudanese officials at the factory. The official said a
number of Iraqi scientists working for Emad al-Ani had attended the
grand opening of the factory two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant, officials
in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected
of making chemical weapons. That site, according to diplomats in
New York and the Sudan, has been frequently visited by Iraqi
technicians and was more heavily guarded than Shifa Pharmaceutical.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also in a residential neighborhood, and officials
familiar with planning for the American cruise missile strikes said
the fear of collateral damage was a factor in choosing a target. A
strike at a plant that made VX itself, not merely a precursor to
it, would pose significant risks of scattering a deadly nerve agent
during an attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M. _ In what would be the largest purchase of
private land by the U.S. Forest Service in at least a quarter
century, Congress and the Clinton administration are forging a
consensus to buy the Baca Ranch, a 95,000-acre expanse of alpine
meadows and fir-covered mountains so emblematic of the West that it
has served as backdrop for Stetson hat advertisements and Marlboro
man billboards.
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood directors, Madison Avenue advertisers or the rare
invited guest, the appeal of the isolated greensward, cupped in the
walls of an ancient volcano, is often the same. The Baca ranch
imparts a rare sense of discovery. Driving on Route 4 over a dark
and winding mountain pass, the visitor suddenly emerges into a
``Lost Horizon'' world of hot springs, trout streams, and meadows
of wildflowers where cattle and the state's largest elk herd graze
side by side.
</P>
<P>
   But the same sense of wide-open Western independence evoked by
the vistas has prevented the sale of the land for years. And the
deal to buy the ranch, which has been owned by one family for
almost 40 years, is as much about attitudes toward public land as
it is about money.
</P>
<P>
   Tton administration has long supported buying the ranch,
which has been called ``the hole in the donut,'' because it is a
privately owned island surrounded on all sides by the Santa Fe
National Forest. Last February on a visit to New Mexico, President
Clinton even had Air Force One make a detour to fly over the ranch
for a better view of its dominant feature _ a 15-mile-wide crater
of the dormant volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, noting that almost one third of New Mexico is
already owned by the federal government, have long opposed further
purchases. But in August, Republican sentiment began shifting
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation drafted by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the
Baca would be a separate unit of the National Forest system, owned
by the U.S. Forest Service, but managed by a trust, comprised of
members appointed by the president. This board would be charged
with responding to local wishes and making the park economically
self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Domenici's bill would tie an agreement to purchase
the Baca to legislation intended to speed sales of land owned by
the Bureau of Land Management that the agency has decided it does
not need.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, particularly those in Western states, are eager to
free up more federal land for private development.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said that the sale of the such land could increase
support among Western senators for his legislation, to be
introduced early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could get set aside this fall $20 to $40 million,''
Domenici said, ``money that says to the owners we are going to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the owners, the Dunigans, an oil family from
Abilene, Texas, expressed interest in selling the ranch in 1980,
the price was $55 million. Competition for the land between the
National Park Service and the National Forest Service, as well as
the death of the family patriarch, James Patrick Dunigan, squelched
that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although new appraisals have not been completed, the 1998 price
could easily be twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the price, and public interest, is tremendous population
growth in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, the state's two largest cities,
which are about 90 minutes by car from the Baca Ranch. In 1915,
when Woodrow Wilson first considered buying the Baca, recreational
tourism was an embryonic activity. Now, more than 3 million people
visit the Santa Fe National Forest every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baca could be the Rocky Mountain National Park for the new
Santa Fe-Albuquerque megapolis,'' said Roger Kennedy, a former
National Park Service director who lives in Santa Fe, referring to
the Colorado park that draws visitors from Denver and Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who ran the National Park Service until 1996, said
acquisition of the Baca was similar to the purchase of land for
national parks at the start of the cent   ``It's the largest piece of unviolate land anywhere near a major
city,'' he said. ``Everything else that size is either very remote
or very ugly. This is beautiful and close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baca began to approach its present form about one million
years ago, when two massive explosions blew the top off a volcano
here, sending 100 cubic miles of ash and lava into the air, some of
it reaching what is now Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, Indians from the Santa Clara and Jemez pueblos
hunted the area in the summer. In 1860, Congress settled a land
dispute by giving the area to heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca, a
Mexican sheep rancher. From 1926 to 1962, the ranch was owned by
the Bond family, who first grazed sheep, then cattle on the land.
Separately, a timber company heavily logged about half of the
forest area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smaller kind of Yellowstone, with a number of hot spots
in the streams,'' Frank Bond, a Santa Fe lawyer, said, recalling
childhood summers spent on the remote ranch. ``Because it has a
much more temperate climate that the rest of the Rockies, it has a
greater number of bird species.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, red-tailed hawks could be seen circling
over meadows, looking for prairie dogs that popped in and out of
their holes. Grouse, mourning doves, flickers and bluebirds abound
in this private reserve, which ranges from grasslands and aspens in
the valleys to spruce and fir at high elevations, up to 11,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, James Patrick Dunigan bought the ranch for $2.5 million
and instituted a gentler management hand. Through expensive court
battles, he ended the timber lease and stopped most of the logging.
Dunigan died in 1980, in the midst of negotiations to sell the
ranch to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   His heirs have maintained his management pattern, avoiding
overgrazing and logging largely for the health of the forest.
Giving priority to the elk, which were reintroduced after World War
II, the ranch now maintains about two elk for every cow - about
7,000 elk and 3,000 cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally have always thought we have been here as
caretakers,'' Anne Dunigan Wilson, Dunigan's widow, said on a
recent visit to a fieldstone hunting lodge her husband had built
here.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Dunigan, one of her sons, said that the family has set a
December deadline for Congress to show serious intent to buy the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are offering the government and the American people the
first opportunity to buy the property,'' said Dunigan, a private
investor based in Dallas. ``This is clearly one of the most
desirable trophy ranches.''

 JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M.: trophy ranches.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local county zoning allows for houses to be built on lots here
as small as three quarters of an acre. With demand growing from New
Mexico's city dwellers for second homes in the mountains, the
threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile homes with skirts around them _ that's the specter
now,'' said Dave Simon, regional director of the National Parks and
Conservation Association, a Washington-based parks support group.
As he bounced in a van along a ranch road, he added: ``There is
constant pressures on ranchers up here to develop. The best places
up here would be cherrypicked for development.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of development has caused many conservationists to
rally behind the new bipartisan efforts to preserve the area.
However, environmentalists and the Clinton administration insist
that any management board be charged with placing conservation
values over economic values in running the ranch as a park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resource values of this property must come first,'' Katie
McGinty, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality, wrote after visiting here in July. ``The trustees may not
sacrifice those values in an effort to make the property
financially self sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   While staffers for Republican and Democratic congressmen work to
hammer out mutually acceptable legislative language by Labor Day,
negotiations are spurred by the thought of the Baca being sold to
real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to see it divided up and sold off,'' said Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and a longtime advocate of public ownership
of the Baca. ``I think prospects are good that we can go ahead when
Congress reconvenes in September.''

&HT;        MARTHA'S VINEYARD LEADERS: PRESIDENT CLINTON CAN YOU HELP US
WITH ...
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 -- If Martha's Vineyard lawmakers could meet
with President Clinton, they would tell him they need Washington's
help with a number of issues ranging from an inadequate
transportation system to overly stringent fishing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole menu of ideas and items that we could use on
Martha's Vineyard,'' said U.S. Rep. William Delahunt, D-Quincy, who
represents the island.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said he wants people to know Martha's Vineyard is more
than a ``wealthy playground for the rich and famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I represent are the hard-working people trying to
eke out a living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems Martha's Vineyard faces is that the
federal government allocates its money without factoring into the
equation the island's part-time residents for such things as
highway construction, said Charles Clifford, executive director of
the Martha's Vineyard Commission, the island's regional planning
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes County, which encompasses Martha's Vineyard, has only
about 14,000 permanent residents. But with the likes of Clinton,
Hollywood stars and sun-starved tourists, the summer population
balloons to about 102,000, a spokesman for the Martha's Vineyard
Chamber of Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, Dukes County received $53.7 million from
the federal government, the lion's share coming in the form of
Social Security and other pension benefits paid to residents. By
contrast, Franklin County in western Massachusetts, with a
population of 71,000, took in $272.7 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's affection for the island -- this is the fourth
summer holiday he has vacationed with his family on Martha's
Vineyard -- Clifford said the president has ``done nothing to
understand its needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably count on one hand and have four fingers
left over how much in federal dollars we have received since
(Clinton) has been coming here,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman said President Clinton, too, shares
their concerns about these and other issues that are affecting
communities across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal dollars that Martha's Vineyard, as well as other
communities across the country, seek are overseen more by Congress
than the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is expected to hobnob with Hollywood celebrities
and the nation's elite over the next two weeks, local leaders said
they have no plans to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   But if local lawmakers did meet with Clinton, most said they
would ask for his assistance in obtaining fedney to improve
the island's transportation system. State Rep. Steve Turkington,
D-Falmouth, describes Martha's Vineyard's roads during the summer
months as ``parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many other places that have worse traffic in the
summer,'' Turkington said. ``Just try driving into Edgartown,
Vineyard Haven or Oak Bluffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rappaport, a local attorney and chairman of the Woods Hole,
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority -- which
oversees the operation of the ferries between the islands and the
mainland -- said the traffic congestion on Martha's Vineyard has
gotten increasingly worse over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a major expansion of the public transit system,''
Rappaport said, adding that the current public and private bus
systems are not meeting the demands of visiting tourists during the
summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport said he would like to see the federal government fund
a program that would allow Martha's Vineyard to use a fleet of
buses during the peak summer months. During the winter months,
those same buses could be used by a ski resort community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many island leaders are also concerned that future budget cuts
could close the Menemsha Coast Guard Station, although Delahunt
said there are no plans to shut it down this year. But he warned
that a shrinking Coast Guard budget puts the station at risk in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Goff, chairman of the Chilmark Board of Selectmen, said
the federal government needs to change how it regulates the
commercial fishing industry because current policies are hurting
local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reform and make better the fishing regulations,''
she said. ``I think the fishermen are looking for a little more
understanding so they can make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Morgan, a 74-year-old semi-retired Menemsha fisherman,
said the federal government needs to relax its catch quotas this
year on summer flounder and striped bass. Morgan also said that if
the U.S. is going to allow Canadian-caught swordfish to be sold on
Cape Cod, then our northern neighbors ``should allow us to fish in
the eastern part of the Georgia Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martha's Vineyard copes with the increasing growth boom that
is eating up its remaining landscape, island leaders are attempting
to preserve as much open space for future generations. In fact,
Rappaport said that 2 percent of every real estate transaction is
set aside in a land bank.
</P>
<P>
   A land bank is a designated fund designed for the sole purpose
of helping communities purchase land for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Turkington said he would like to see the federal government
``step up'' with some money and help the state and local
governments pay for preserving the island's open space.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Martha's Vineyard residents are looking for federal
money allocations earmarked specifically for the island. Chris
Burns, a well-known media consultant and former Washington Post
executive, said the best thing Clinton can do to help the island is
to make the federal government more responsive and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should walk on the beach, take a deep breath and figure
out how to give us a better federal government,'' Burns said would
be his advice to the president. ``A government that is more
reasonable, more civilized and more focused on what the country
needs.''

RONGEN BOOTED, ZENGA NAMED REVOLUTION COACH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last year, Walter Zenga rescued the Revolution with
spectacular performances in goal as they qualified for the MLS
playoffs. Now, the Revolution are counting on Zenga to lead them
again, this time as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was named interim coach of the Revolution Monday,
replacing Thomas Rongen, who had come under criticism after a 5-1
loss to Los Angeles Saturday solidified the team's position in last
place. Zenga, 38, was honored at halftime of the match, and offered
the position afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened very quickly, it was not in the works before
Saturday's game,'' general manager Brian O'Donovan said. ``We have
always said that the only reason we would make a change is if there
was an alternative that justified making such a change. There
weren't really a lot of good alternatives that would give us what
we hoped to achieve. But Walter was here, and at dinner before the
game he expressed interest in coming back to the Revolution,
whether as a player or in management.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that in mind, after the game Saturday I told him there
was an opportunity to come here as interim coach, if he was
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, 38, is a legendary figure in Europe, where he performed
for 20 years, making his name with Internazionale Milano and the
Italian national team. He has been exploring new opportunities, and
seemed to genuinely enjoy his experience with the Revolution last
year. But he underwent knee surgery during the season and announced
his retirement in December, then returned to Milan to work in
management with Inter and in the media, along with fiancee Hoara
Borselli, an aspiring actress.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to the US, Zenga had hoped to have one last chance
with a big-time club. He contacted former national team teammate
GianLuca Vialli, who was playing in England. But former Chelsea
coach Ruud Gullit, later to be replaced as player-coach by Vialli,
rejected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every move we make at this stage is a bold move,'' O'Donovan
said. ``It's true he hasn't coached a team, but neither had Vialli
or Gullit. In that sense, Larry Bird hadn't been a coach. There are
a lot of coaches with track records who have gone by the wayside.
Experience isn't always the most important of criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's taking a chance. Everything we do, every player
we take, is a chance, a judgment call. But we have every confidence
it will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, who likely becomes the most famous coach in the history
of Boston-area sports, is expected to return Thursday to prepare
the team for Sunday's visit to Miami. The Revolution, with 20
points in 26 matches, trail the Fusion by 6 points with six matches
remaining for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's expected of him is to bring stability to the team, and
to hopefully make a run at the playoffs,'' O'Donovan said. ``We
still have a lot of hopes for making the playoffs but there are
also longer-term issues we've got to consider for the Revolution.
Walter will not be judged solely on making the playoffs. He has to
decide if he likes coaching, if he is suited to coaching. This
gives him a chance to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesidio (Sid) Mazzola, formerly owner and coach of the Boston
Bolts in the American Professional Soccer League, and goalkeeper
coach Pete Simonini will be Zenga's assistants. Assistants Renato
Capobianco and Rich Williams also resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Rongen, MLS coach of the year in 1996 in Tampa, rebuilt the
Revolution after taking over from Frank Stapleton. The Revolution
earned 29 points in their first 19 games under Rongen, but began
floundering when Zenga departed for knee surgery. They have earned
just 29 points in the last 39 games, and dissension has become
apparent recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas is a great coach and I virtually guarantee he will be
coaching in the MLS and have success in the MLS,'' O'Donovan said.
``The only reality here is that the job was not getting done. We
will have many postmortems to see what contributed to us not doing
well.''

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The sputtering remains of Tropical Storm
Charley had pushed 200 miles up the Rio Grande Valley from the Gulf
of Mexico before stalling early Monday and dumping more than a foot
of rain on South Texas and northern Mexico, turning drought-baked
arroyos into gushing drain spouts and leaving at least 16 people
dead and more than 60 missing.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest loss of life and the fiercest flooding came about
145 miles west of San Antonio, in the remote desert town of Del Rio
and just acroborder in Acuna, Mexico. The rains had begun
early Sunday, and the flooding started shortly after midnight,
residents said, at one point sending a 5-foot wave down the San
Felipe Creek that washed away some 50 homes. Smaller creeks and
arroyos on the north side of town also flooded. By 4 a.m.,
two-thirds of Del Rio was under water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flood just came,'' said Eddie Eskew, 72, the senior pastor
at Grace Community Church in Del Rio's San Felipe section.
``There's this whole section here with mobile homes. It came right
through there and washed them all out. Three people were killed,
two I knew. There were four people in one mobile home. Two of them
swam away, and two stayed behind and they died. The water took that
mobile home off its foundation and across Amistad Boulevard and
slammed it through a brick wall and into a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officers, national guardsmen, local constables,
paramedics, firefighters, almost everyone in a uniform, worked
throughout the day Monday, rescuing people from roofs, treetops and
water-logged hillocks. The water had scattered cars, masonry,
asphalt and all manner of debris around the scrubby, cactus-filled
flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush sent 150 guardsmen, 28 trucks and nine
helicopters into the area following pleas from local officials, and
the dull thud of helicopter blades could be heard all afternoon as
the search continued for those still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Del Rio said Monday night that they had six
confirmed deaths, including a Border Patrol trainee who had gone to
search for relatives, but they cautioned that at least 50 people
were still missing and that the death toll was likely to rise.
About 17.5 inches of rain fell on Del Rio between 8 a.m. Sunday and
8 a.m. Monday. The previous record had been 8.8 inches of rain,
which fell on Del Rio on June 13, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highway 90 East had 5 feet of water ovand-new bridge we
just built,'' Askew said. ``Highway 90 West had 2 feet of water
crossing it out by the Wal-Mart, about a mile and a half from
downtown. It's unreal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the border, at least five teen-agers were
killed while trying to cross the swollen Rio Vacas using a length
of rope as a guide. The youths had worked as grocery baggers at a
local supermarket. Two others were still missing, as was an entire
family from a nearby neighborhood, Mexican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mena, a spokesman for the Coahuila provincial government
said that 20 homes had been destroyed in Acuna and dozens more made
uninhabitable by the rising waters, leaving some 2,700 people
homeless. All but 200 of them were living in makeshift shelters in
Acuna, Mena said, while the rest had fled south or moved in with
friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, the flood had left 6 feet of water on downtown
Acuna, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those flooded out of their homes in Del Rio, more than 500
people by late Monday afternoon, were scattered among four
shelters. Red Cross and Salvation Army officials were staffing the
shelters and passing out bottled water to the hundreds of
households left without drinkable water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the floods had damaged the city's water
system, allowing sewage to seep into it and making most tap water
unfit to drink.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, four Mexican immigrants, including a 2-year-old and a
4-year-old, were drowned when their pickup truck, carrying 18
people, tried to make its way across a swollen stream in Real
County, northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill
Country. The fast moving waters swept the truck away, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   And a 65-year-old man had a heart attack and died Monday while
being evacuated in Uvalde, Texas, where the Frio River had
overflowed its banks.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, virtually every major river had spilled its
banks at least some, including the Llano, the Frio, the Sabinal and
the Nueces. In the hardest hit areas, almost every creekbed, every
depression, every low-lying crossroads was under water on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Weather officials had expected Charley, which hit the Texas
coast on Friday and Saturday and was downgraded from a tropical
storm to a tropical depression, to continue to diminish as it moved
inland and into western Mexico on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remnants of the system moved into the Del Rio area and
basically became nearly stationery, and it produced the very heavy
rainfall in parts of southern Texas in the past 25 hours,'' said
David Imy, a meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center in
Norman, Okla. ``The problem when you have a system such as this is
that it picked up moisture over the gulf. These systems will
produce heavy rain wherever they go, but the problem here is that
it sat over basically the same area for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm stalled over Uvalde, Kinney and Val Verde counties. At
its height, it dumped 4 inches of water per our on parts of the
region, before moving slowly back to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing kind of hit us by surprise,'' said Ben Patterson, a
spokesman for the Texas Division of Emergency Management. ``The
first call we had was around 12:45 this morning, basically asking
us if we knew about the flood. We didn't, so we opened up the
operations center.''
</P>
<P>
   The water was making its way back to the gulf of Mexico Monday,
a great swell almost a mile in width moving slowly down the Rio
Grande, cresting in Eagle Pass Sunday night and expected to hit
Laredo sometime on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Eagle Pass said they were expecting the water
overnight to move into the downtown area, and hundreds of residents
were evacuated. In Piedras Negras, Mexico, across the Rio Grande,
300 residents were evacuated, and the water was just beginning to
seep into city streets at 7 p.m., Mena said.
</P>
<P>
   While emergency officials in Eagle Pass struggled to evacuate
and hold back the surge, officials in Laredo were meeting into the
evening to assess the threat of the danger approaching them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were concerned not only about those still missing but
about panicked residents who may try to escape. An automobile can
be swept away by less than 2-feet of moving water, Patterson said,
and many of the low-crossings in rural areas around Del Rio and
Eagle Pass were flooded out.
</P>
<P>
   Further scattered showers and thunderstorms were predicted for
South Texas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Oklahoma had been in the grips of the worst drought
the region had seen since the early 1950s, and the rains brought to
the region by Chad been expected to ease some of the
drought's effects. It did, officials said, but at a heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 2.8 inches of rain in Del Rio in the first seven months
of the year,'' Askew said. ``We've been praying for rain, but we
didn't pray for this.''

SUNBEAM OUTLINES NEW PLAN TO SAVE ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Fla.)  (jw) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunbeam Corp., the troubled appliance maker, Monday outlined a
strategy for fixing itself, scrapping the plan begun by its former
chairman and chief executive, Albert Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would decentralize its operations, keep open
some plants scheduled for closing and retain some businesses it had
planned to sell. The company also put in place a new management
team.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions come two months after Jerry Levin, a turnaround
specialist, was brought in to replace Dunlap. The plan calls for
the maker of Oster and Sunbeam blenders, irons and electric
blankets to be organized into a corporate group and three operating
groups: outdoor leisure products, household products and
international. Those units will be run out of 17 regional
headquarters and have separate management teams and research and
development divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast to the prior management's approach, we are
decentralizing operations while maintaining central support,''
Levin told analysts in a conference call. Dunlap closed regional
offices when he arrived at Sunbeam in July 1996 in favor of running
the business from a central location to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam, based in Delray Beach, Fla., also scaled back a plan
that Dunlap announced in May calling for reducing the company's
work force by 40 percent _ or about 6,400 workers. The company said
three plants scheduled to be closed would be shut, but four others
would remain open. It will also retain two businesses that Dunlap
had put on the block: the Eastpak backpack division and the
Powermate compressor business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we still have much to do in the short term to
stabilize Sunbeam's business,'' Levin said, ``our strategic focus
is on growth.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sunbeam's poor performance lately has caused frustrated
investors to send its stock tumbling from its high of $52, the
initial reaction to Monday's announcements, which came after the
market closed, was favorable. Shares of Sunbeam rose as high as $10
in after-hours trading, up from the close of $8.8125 in the regular
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a first step,'' said William Steele, an
analyst who follows the company for Buckingham Research. ``It
establishes where they stand and what they are going to be working
on.'' He said the company still had strong brands, good
distribution and now a capable and focused leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But until management releases more specifics about Sunbeam's
financial position, ``it is very hard to value the company, which I
think is ultimately what we are trying to do here,'' Steele added.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam said it would no longer pay its quarterly dividend of
one cent a share and it put in place a management team that is
heavy on executives who worked with Levin at Coleman Products.
</P>
<P>
   When Dunlap was let go by a board that said it had lost faith in
his leadership, Levin was handpicked to run Sunbeam by Ronald
Perelman, who sold Coleman to Sunbeam in March, making him one of
Sunbeam's largest shareholders. Levin had run Coleman, the camping
products company, and also had led Revlon Inc., which Perelman's
holding company controls.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over, Levin promised that he would quickly work to
stop Sunbeam's hemorrhaging and would put in place the people to
return it to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 30 executive changes he announced Monday was
the naming of Paul Shapiro, a former vice president and general
counsel at Coleman, to be executive vice president and chief
administrative officer, stepping into a post Dunlap had been
looking to fill. Also, Bobby Jenkins became executive vice
president and chief financial officer, replacing Russell Kersh, who
was Dunlap's most trusted lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management group has extensive experience in
consumer-focused businesses, which will be central to Sunbeam's
strategy, particularly as it increases its emphasis on brand
building and marketing,'' Levin said. But the new team and game
plan come as Sunbeam has been losing money, its inventory is
extremely bloated and the validity of its recent financial results
are in question.
</P>
<P>
   The company has turned in a disappointing performance all year,
including posting a $44.6 million loss in the first quarter. It is
also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
for possible accounting irregularities and says it will have to
restate its financial results for last year and possibly 1996 and
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders have filed lawsuits against the company and
Dunlap, saying they were misled about Sunbeam's financial health,
accusations the company and Dunlap deny.

&HT;        MARTHA'S VINEYARD LEADERS: PRESIDENT CLINTON CAN YOU HELP US
WITH ...
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 -- If Martha's Vineyard lawmakers could meet
with President Clinton, they would tell him they need Washington's
help with a number of issues ranging from an inadequate
transportation system to overly stringent fishing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole menu of ideas and items that we could use on
Martha's Vineyard,'' said U.S. Rep. William Delahunt, D-Quincy, who
represents the island.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said he wants people to know Martha's Vineyard is more
than a ``wealthy playground for the rich and famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I represent are the hard-working people trying to
eke out a living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems Martha's Vineyard faces is that the
federal government allocates its money without factoring into the
equation the island's part-time residents for such things as
highway construction, said Charles Clifford, executive director of
the Martha's Vineyard Commission, the island's regional planning
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes County, which encompasses Martha's Vineyard, has only
about 14,000 permanent residents. But with the likes of Clinton,
Hollywood stars and sun-starved tourists, the summer population
balloons to about 102,000, a spokesman for the Martha's Vineyard
Chamber of Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, Dukes County received $53.7 million from
the federal government, the lion's share coming in the form of
Social Security and other pension benefits paid to residents. By
contrast, Franklin County in western Massachusetts, with a
population of 71,000, took in $272.7 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's affection for the island -- this is the fourth
summer holiday he has vacationed with his family on Martha's
Vineyard -- Clifford said the president has ``done nothing to
understand its needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably count on one hand and have four fingers
left over how much in federal dollars we have received since
(Clinton) has been coming here,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman said President Clinton, too, shares
their concerns about these and other issues that are affecting
communities across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal dollars that Martha's Vineyard, as well as other
communities across the country, seek are overseen more by Congress
than the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is expected to hobnob with Hollywood celebrities
and the nation's elite over the next two weeks, local leaders said
they have no plans to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   But if local lawmakers did meet with Clinton, most said they
would ask for his assistance in obtaining federal money to improve
the island's transportation system. State Rep. Steve Turkington,
D-Falmouth, describes Martha's Vineyard's roads during the summer
months as ``parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many other places that have worse traffic in the
summer,'' Turkington said. ``Just try driving into Edgartown,
Vineyard Haven or Oak Bluffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rappaport, a local attorney and chairman of the Woods Hole,
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority -- which
oversees the operation of the ferries between the islands and the
mainland -- said the traffic congestion on Martha's Vineyard has
gotten increasingly worse over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a major expansion of the public transit system,''
Rappaport said, adding that the current public and private bus
systems are not meeting the demands of visiting tourists during the
summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport said he would like to see the federal government fund
a program that would allow Martha's Vineyard to use a fleet of
buses during the peak summer months. During the winter months,
those same buses could be used by a ski resort community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many island leaders are also concerned that future budget cuts
could close the Menemsha Coast Guard Station, although Delahunt
said there are no plans to shut it down this year. But he warned
that a shrinking Coast Guard budget puts the station at risk in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Goff, chairman of the Chilmark Board of Selectmen, said
the federal government needs to change how it regulates the
commercial fishing industry because current policies are hurting
local fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reform and make better the fishing regulations,''
she said. ``I think the fishermen are looking for a little more
understanding so they can make a living.''mmy Morgan, a 74-year-old semi-retired Menemsha fisherman,
said the federal government needs to relax its catch quotas this
year on summer flounder and striped bass. Morgan also said that if
the U.S. is going to allow Canadian-caught swordfish to be sold on
Cape Cod, then our northern neighbors ``should allow us to fish in
the eastern part of the Georgia Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martha's Vineyard copes with the increasing growth boom that
is eating up its remaining landscape, island leaders are attempting
to preserve as much open space for future generations. In fact,
Rappaport said that 2 percent of every real estate transaction is
set aside in a land bank.
</P>
<P>
   A land bank is a designated fund designed for the sole purpose
of helping communities purchase land for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Turkington said he would like to see the federal government
``step up'' with some money and help the state and local
governments pay for preserving the island's open space.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Martha's Vineyard residents are looking for federal
money allocations earmarked specifically for the island. Chris
Burns, a well-known media consultant and former Washington Post
executive, said the best thing Clinton can do to help the island is
to make the federal government more responsive and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should walk on the beach, take a deep breath and figure
out how to give us a better federal government,'' Burns said would
be hie to the president. ``A government that is more
reasonable, more civilized and more focused on what the country
needs.''

 WASHINGTON: an attack. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the administration offered details about its evidence,
there were still unanswered questions. The soil sample, which
presumably measured either a spill or airborne particulars, did not
prove that the attacked factory was the pharmaceutical plant that
produced the precursor chemical, EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable they were only storing EMPTA there, or it was
just passing through there,'' the senior intelligence official
said. ``You could spin several scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   While the administration maintains the evidence of VX production
is clear, the links between the factory and Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi exile whose network of terrorists was the target of last
week's strike, is circuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden controls a sprawling web of companies underwritten by
a fortune said to exceed $200 million, including vetures in the
Sudan, where he made a home after his expulsion from Saudi Arabia
in 1994 until he was forced to leave in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said bin Laden has no direct investment in the
pharmaceutical plant, but has financial ties to Sudan's state-run
military industrial complex. They said that fact and bin Laden's
suspected interest in obtaining chemical weapons was enough to
warrant destroying the factory, along with a paramilitary training
camp in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put all that together,'' the senior intelligence
official said of the factory, ``it all adds up to a source of real
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   As administration officials laid out their case, new details
emerged of the strike itself. A senior Pentagon official said on
Monday that the cruise missiles that landed in Afghanistan heavily
damaged or destroyed virtually every ``soft'' target at the
sprawling mountain training camp, including barracks,
communications equipment and arms stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States did not bother striking fortified
bunkers in the area, since Tomahawk cruise missiles, despite a
1,000-pound payload and remarkable accuracy, would not have
destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon also confirmed on Monday that the vice
chairman of he Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston,
traveled to Pakistan before the strikes so he could be with
Pakistani military leaders at the time of the attack. The reason
for the visit, which was first reported on Monday in The Wall
Street Journal, was to reassure Pakistan that the barrage of
incoming missiles was not an attack by its archenemy, India.

   PESHAWAR, Pakistan _ With Osama bin Laden having apparently
survived the barrage of missiles rained down on his stronghold
across the border in Afghanistan, the United States still has the
problem of how to get its hands on the man it considers the No. 1
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility that has been floated is for the United States
to negotiate with the Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls
most of Afghanistan, to surrender bin Laden _ perhaps in exchange
for several million dollars in aid or even diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats who have dealt with the Taliban doubt that
anything could come of such negotiations, particularly with the
Taliban's anger over Thursday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Taliban have repeatedly failed to keep promises
to U. N. agencies and Western governments _ promises to stop the
opium trade, to form a broad-based government and to ease its
restrictions on women.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and experts say the Taliban will not relinquish bin
Laden largely because of his relationship to Mohammad Omar, the
``supreme'' leader of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Omar, 39, is rarely heard from or seen in public, keeping
company mostly with a small group of Taliban subordinates. Bin
Laden is one of the few individuals outside this group whom Omar
has permitted to become close to him.
</P>
<P>
   Economically destitute and considered a renegade movement by
much of the world, the Taliban have few sources of income besides
bin Laden. Chief among them has been opium. Western diplomats said
this week that the opium production in areas it controls was
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Omar has demonstrated his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never hand Osama over to anyone,'' Omar said last
week. ``We will protect him with our blood at all cost.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both men were part of the mujahedeen movement, which wa
against the Soviet Union during its military intervention in
Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. But they did not meet then.
</P>
<P>
   Omar is said to have fought with a moderate faction and emerged
from the war a virtual unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who inherited a fortune that his father earned
building roads in Saudi Arabia, commanded a unit of volunteers
under the nom de guerre Abu Abdullah, and he earned a reputation
for being courageous and charismatic. His unit captured the
southeastern Afghan city of Khost. He lost the toes on his left
foot in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the 1989 Soviet withdrawal, bin Laden, who was
not welcome in his native Saudi Arabia because of his support for
militants, moved to Sudan and lived in a spacious, well-guarded
home on a dusty road in the capital, Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Sudan that bin Laden, along with building roads,
reportedly began to finance militant Islamic movements and assaults
against governments he opposed. In 1993, he reportedly sent his
operatives into Somalia to attack the U.S.-led peacekeeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the United States and Saudi Arabia, Sudan
deported him, along with other alleged terrorists, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan, which was racked by civil
war. The mujahedeen leaders ensconced in Kabul, the capital, were
fighting among themselves. And a new group had emerged _ the
Taliban, whose core fighters came out of Saudi-financed religious
schools in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the Taliban had risen to capture the entire south
and most of the west of Afghanistan. But the Taliban's military
drive stalled when its financial resources had all but dried up,
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani intelligence officers, who were backinaliban,
introduced the Taliban leaders to a new, wealthy friend _ bin
Laden. He gave $3 million to the movement, said Afghans and
diplomats familiar with the transaction, a sum that could go a long
way in the poor nation.
</P>
<P>
   With the money in hand, the Taliban and their Pakistani allies
began a round of visits to important militia commanders in eastern
Afghanistan. These local leaders were plied with cash, and many
agreed to ally themselves with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   In a sweep in September 1996, the Taliban rushed north with
little resistance, capturing Jalalabad. Ten days later, Kabul fell.
</P>
<P>
   Omar's gratitude to bin Laden was quickly apparent. Bin Laden,
his three wives and a 160-member coterie shifted south to Kandahar.
The two men were often seen together, and an enormous house was
built for bin Laden.

SOME COMPANIES ASK US TO BACK OFF IN TRUST SUIT

<P>
   Many technology firms support the federal government's antitrust
campaign against software giant &UR;  &LR;  Microsoft Corp. and processor
titan Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust efforts have brought dissension within the
computer industry, and led to the creation of new industry groups
that are urging the government to back off.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in Washington, a new organization called Technology
Access Action Coalition, is joining the fray on the side of Intel
and Microsoft. It plans a press conference to announce its
position. TAAC includes executives from computer retailer CompUSA
Inc. and system integrator Corporate Software &AMP; Technology Inc. of
Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over 200 software and hardware firms have joined the
Association for Competitive Technology, a group formed last year to
oppose consumer advocate Ralph Nader's call for antitrust action
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ACT cofounder Ted Johnson is chief technology officer of Visio
Corp., a Seattle firm that makes technical drawing software.
Johnson is in a delicate position. He's also on the board of the
Software Publishers Association, a major group that has condemned
Microsoft's business practices and supports a federal antitrust
suit against the company. But Johnson vehemently opposes the suit.
``I don't know why we've decided to punish success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most ACT members are small firms, but the roster includes
Symantec Corp., a leading maker of anti-virus software, as well as
Emerson Electric Co., a manufacturer of electrical components.
Microsoft, a long-time member of SPA, has also joined ACT as well.
</P>
<P>
   SPA president Ken Wasch admitted that disputes over Microsoft
have had a divisive effect inside his organization. ``In any
important public policy issue, you don't have unanimity of
opinion,'' said Wasch. ``Microsoft is SPA's largest member ... We
agree with Microsoft on so many issues. The antitrust case is not
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ACT's executive director Jonathan Zuck denied that Microsoft
is pulling the strings at his organization. He said that the
software titan joined two months after the group was founded, and
does not have a seat on the ACT board. Zuck also said that he
didn't know how much of the organization's financing comes from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ACT and TAAC were created in response to aggressive efforts at
the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to apply
antitrust law to the computer industry. Next month, the Justice
Department and Microsoft will square off in court in a major
antitrust case. The government alleges, among other things, that
Microsoft bundles new features like Internet browsing into its
Windows operating system in order to crush smaller competitors,
such as browser-maker Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission, meanwhile, is going after Intel &UR;  &LR; for
refusing to share technical specifications of its Pentium
microprocessors with certain companies. The commission argues that
Intel is using its dominance in the microchip industry to freeze
out possible rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC case against Intel starts to raise serious issues
about intellectual property rights,'' said ATC's Zuck, who believes
that Intel has a right to deny its product information to whomever
it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of ACT and TAAC reflects a controversy inside the
computer industry over the value of government intervention.
Computer companies have generally adopted a laissez-faire approach,
urging that government regulation of their activities be kept to a
minimum. But the growing market power of Microsoft and Intel have
led many companies to do an about-face and urge stronger
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, firms like Visio &UR;  &LR; have done well by riding on
Microsoft's coattails, designing their products to work well with
Microsoft operating systems. Such firms are content to co-exist
with their giant neighbor and don't want the government to rock the
boat.

BRITISH AIRWAYS TO ANNOUNCE BIG AIRBUS PURCHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is seen in Europe as a history-making deal that will be
trumpeted at a news conference Tuesday by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, British Airways has decided to buy 59 narrow-body
planes from Boeing rival Airbus Industrie, with options for as many
as 129 more planes.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe's largest airline also will buy 16 of Boeing's 777
widebody jets, with options for 16 more. And British Airways is
expected to say it remains committed to buying Boeing's widebody
jets for its longhaul fleet for at least the next decade, people
familiar with Tuesday's announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   With options, the Boeing order is potentially worth more than $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought hard for this deal,'' said a Boeing source close to
the talks with British Airways. ``It's disappointing to lose, but
we are happy with the widebody order.''
</P>
<P>
   And some analysts are saying Boeing's loss could actually signal
a positive change for the profit-starved Seattle aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of value, the firm orders won by Airbus for its 59
smaller jets is worth about $2.7 billion at list prices, or about
the same as the 16 firm orders for the more expensive 777.
</P>
<P>
   The list price of the 777 ranges from about $130 to $170
million, depending on the model and configuration.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Europe, the Boeing order will be overshadowed by the
Airbus victory because this is the first time British Airways as
ever opted to buy commercial jets from a manufacturer other than
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Boeing would have liked to have won both orders
(for the widebody and narrow-body planes), but given a choice, I'm
sure Boeing would rather have the 777 orders,'' said aerospace
analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing is getting a nice consolation prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet and several other industry analysts said, however, that
losing the order to Airbus for smaller planes could actually
benefit Boeing in the long run as it works through its current
production difficulties and returns to profitability. (Boeing
posted an operating loss last year for the first time in a half
century.)
</P>
<P>
   That's because Airbus and Boeing have been engaged in a price
war that continues to hurt Boeing's bottom line. The steep
double-digit discounts that Boeing has offered many customers have
all but eliminated the profit margins it once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing lost the order to British Airways because it was
being less aggressive in its pricing, so be it. It's a good move,''
said Peter Jacobs of Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find some comfort from the fact Boeing did lose,'' he added.
``The priority for Boeing must be to make money off the planes it
sells, regardless of market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aboulafia, director of aviation consulting with the Teal
Group in Arlington, Va., echoed that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing is finally starting to get smart,'' he said. ``They
have been selling their next generation 737 below the price it
takes to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing would not comment on the expected 777 order from British
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let our customers announce orders first,'' said Boeing
spokesman Scott Battishill.
</P>
<P>
   Neither British Airways nor Airbus would publicly comment on
their deal to be announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials said Prime Minister Blair will speak at a joint
news conference with Airbus President Noel Forgeard Tuesday
afternoon at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said British Airways will order a mix of Airbus
planes, including the A319, A320 and A321 models.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-seat A320 has a list price of $45 million to $48
million. The shorter A319 sells for about $5 million less. The
A321, a stretch version of the A320, has a list price between $55
million and $58 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those single-aisle Airbus planes compete with Boeing's next
generation 737, which the company had been trying to sell to
British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already has backorders for more than 1,000 of its next
generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no lack of demand for the next generation 737,'' said
Jacobs. ``Even though losing the British Airways order to Airbus
may be disappointing for Boeing, it by no means should be seen as a
negative for the 737. It's just amazing how well that airplane is
selling.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by British Airways to finally break away from
buying its jets only from Boeing is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   There has been industry speculation since early summer that
Airbus would win orders from the carrier for its smaller planes.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace Chief Executive Bob Ayling had publicly
challenged Boeing and Airbus back in June to come up with
``innovative'' financing arrangements to lessen his airline's risk.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the financial package offered by Boeing on its
next generation 737, politics also likely played a role in helping
Airbus land its first ever order from British Airways, analysts
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is a partnership that includes British Aerospace,
France's Aerospatiale, German's Daimler Benz and Spain's
Construcciones Aeronauticas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement comes at a time when British Airways is
reported to be rearranging its fleet to go with the slightly
smaller 777 rather than Boeing's 747 on some of its long-haul
routes.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways now flies to dozens of cities all over the world
using Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal Europe reported in Monday's editions
that British Airways will shift its long-haul strategy away from
the big jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   That change in strategy will be reflected in Tuesday's
announcement. Sources said five of the 777 firm orders to be
announced by British Airways will be substitutions for 747s now on
order.

CLINTONS ENJOY SEPARATE LUNCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton and his wife, cloistered in
their borrowed compound for much of their vacation, ventured out to
separate lunches Monday _ each of them visiting with a group of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   That simple social decision set off yet another raft of
speculation, as reporters and observers immediately pointed at
their separate engagements as a signal of the seriousness of their
latest marital rift. The White House, oddly, did little to defuse
such speculation.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said last week that the
couple was spending time alone as part of a healing process in the
wake of Clinton's admission that he carried on an extramarital
affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former intern fresh out of college
at the time of their relationship. Monday, McCurry added, to
laughter in the makeshift briefing room, ``I stand by my prior
assessment. With each day, we are getting more more confident in
that insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had lunch Monday with his longtime confidant Vernon
Jordan, dining at Jordan's Chilmark house on a menu that featured
Icelandic salmon, asparagus, potatoes and pie. Hillary Rodham
Clinton boarded a boat in Edgartown Harbor with friend Kelly Day
and a collection of female companions, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained silent to reporters coming and going from
lunch. Afterward, he stopped at Alley's General Store in West
Tisbury _ a favorite shopping haunt _ on his way home. He sipped a
cup of coffee and told the establishment's general manager, Jack
MacKay, ``I really like your store.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers described Clinton as looking ``forlorn,'' ``worn,''
and subdued. He talked with an 11-year-old boy in one of the store
aisles, and the boy's mother, Meghan Staffell, was overheard
saying, ``That was a really good speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later by a reporter which speech she was referring to,
Staffell said, ``The second one,'' meaning his Oval Office address
explaining the missile launch against terrorists in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clintons dedicated themselves to their personal lives,
White House national security officials are becoming increasingly
confident that last Thursday's strike on a suspected Afghanistan
terrorist camp was successful. Clinton received a telephone
briefing on the damage Monday morning from his ranking security
aide, Samuel (Sandy) Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each passing day we are growing more confident in the
preliminary assessment that we gave as to the damage assessment,''
said McCurry. Last week, Berger said the damage inflicted by US
Tomahawk missiles was ``moderate to heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Clinton still planned to visit Russia next week,
even in light of Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismanting his
government over the weekend. Clinton and Yeltsin will likely talk
about the Russian economy and the future of nuclear weapons
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reminder of the volatility that exists in Russian
domestic politics,'' said McCurry. ``We've known for a long time
that President Yeltsin faces a very complicated internal dynamic.
He deals with that. That's really between him and the Russian
people. But the work we do has to be cognizant of the fact that it
is a complicated environment in which President Yeltsin pursues
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But policy aside, all eyes are on Clinton for a hint of mood and
progress in his personal life. On vacation, the president has yet
to pick up a golf club. In year's past, he has golfed more rather
than less with Jordan, who is now a central grand jury  in
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, with the Clintons again hunkered down in
their house, the White House announced that they would not be
venturing forth again for the day or night.
</P>
<P>
   Some White House officials continue to search for a venue for
Clinton to appear at a political event off the island and raise his
public profile. Some aides have been bantering about the
possibility of venturing a rally in Boston on Thursday, but no
plans have been set. A few strategists believe it is crucial for
Clinton to make an appearance after what was widely believed to be
a failed speech last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was discussing the possibility of a Boston trip
as early as Tuesday, but the day passed without any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to intrude on their privacy, but they are
spending time together, doing all the things that I've been telling
you about,'' said McCurry. ``They've been talking, they've been
relaxing, they've been reading, they've been walking, and they've
been dealing with what is a personal private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   At Alley's, Clinton seemed buoyed after he shook hands with
about 40 people in a rope line. He seemed especially happy after
MacKay gave him a canvas bag filled with gifts, including an
oversized dog biscuit. Clinton pulled the treat from the bag and
said, ``You're going to make me a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Most aides said Clinton would not give another address on his
affair, but would look for another appropriate opportunity to
address it and possibly offer an explicit apology. One idea: a
question at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles
told aides to quit griping about the president's political
fortunes. ``Enough whining. Get back to work,'' he was quoted as
saying in a senior staff meeting.

 &HT;    For now, Florida seems safe as Bonnie begins to move
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Bonnie, running in place since
Saturday like a jogger at a red light, began plodding forward again
Monday, passing by Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast with
barely a ripple of surf.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-mile-wide storm was headed northwest but forecasters
were uncertain whether it would threaten South Carolina, North
Carolina and Virginia with its 115-mph winds or turn northeast and
churn out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Monday, officials issued a hurricane watch from
Savannah, Ga. through the North Carolina-Virginia border, meaning
hurricane conditions are possible by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a range of forecast tracks. The larger models
are forecasting a turn to the east but the others are pointing to
South and North Carolina,'' said forecaster Andrew Shashy of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual. We frequently have this problem,'' he said.
How quickly Bonnie turns depends on the strength of a mid-level low
pressure trough over the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Monday, Bonnie was located near latitude 26.3 north,
longitude 72.9 west, about 450 miles due east of Palm Beach. It was
moving northwest at 6 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane center still estimated a 2 percent chance the
storm could U-turn and strike Palm Beach County by midday Thursday,
a 3 percent chance for the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the mid-Atlantic Ocean, another storm rapidly
intensified from a depression to Tropical Storm Danielle. At 5 p.m.
Monday, the storm, with 40 mph winds, was located near latitude
14.4 north, longitude 38.8 west, about 1,400 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles. It was moving west-northwest at 21 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty impressive on the satellite imagery,'' Shashy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie was expected to remain a Category 3 hurricane through
today, capable of causing severe coastal flooding and serious
damage to homes and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds extended 85 miles from the center and
tropical storm winds reached 230 miles out, mainly to the northeast
and northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A heavydvisory was in effect from the Jupiter Inlet north
to Cape Hatteras, N.C., but Bonnie disappointed any surfers hoping
for a day of big waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surf is 1 to 2 feet, like (Sunday). It's real quiet. No
riptides,'' said Nate Nevid, a beach patrol lieutenant for Palm
Beach County beaches from Singer Island to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Reports were similar from Boca Raton to Fort Pierce. ``With the
storm south of us, the swells run up against the Bahama bank and
are broken up,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist Robert
Molleda.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie moves north, ``swells should start working their way
down the coast. It should start sometime (Tuesday), Wednesday for
sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, 7-foot swells were reported off Cape Canaveral
and surfers were delighted with 6-foot waves in Virginia Beach,
Va., where the East Coast Surfing Championship is scheduled this
weekend. ``Surfers always wish for a hurricane. We love 'em,''
championship director Paul West said.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Virginia and some coastal communities elsewhere
banned swimming because of rip tides, strong currents near the
beaches that were blamed for two drownings over the weekend in
South Carolina and Delaware. Hundreds of bathers had to be rescued
at New Jersey beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were getting sucked out left and right,'' said Margate
Beach, N.J., lifeguard Mike Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Gov. David Beasley told 1,000 National Guardsmen
to get ready in case the storm takes aim at that state's coast.
Officials estimated there were 125,000 tourists in the state's
beach towns. Almost a decade ago, South Carolina was battered by
Hurricane Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County emergency management officials and American
Red Cross volunteers were prepared to head north to help out in
storm-threatened areas, said Manny Papandreas, the county's
emergency operations coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   With the threat of Bonnie past, South Florida water managers
began filling up coastal canals Monday that had been lowered late
last week.

GORDON SET TO BREAK REARDON'S SAVE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (fixing headline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tom Gordon needs five saves to break Jeff Reardon's
club record for saves in a season set by the bearded one in 1991,
when he saved 40 games, and the record could fall on the nine-game
Red Sox homestand that opens Tuesday night in Fenway Park against
the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has eight saves in nine chances against the A's and the
two teams that follow Oakland into Fenway Park, the Anaheim Angels
and Seattle Mariners. His only blown save this season came against
the A's on April 14, but he eventually won that game and has saved
33 straight since then, the longest current streak in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon leads the American League in saves with 36, five behind
the major-league leader, the Padres' Trevor Hoffman, younger
brother of former Sox shortstop Glenn Hoffman, who now manages the
Dodgers. He also has a 6-3 record and 2.81 ERA, but take away the
21 games (15 runs in 23 1/3 innings) in which he pitched that were
nonsave situations, and Gordon's ERA becomes a microscopic 1.09.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a September collapse, Gordon is on track to have the
greatest season by a Red Sox reliever since 1964, when the man out
of the bullpen didn't point at the heavens in thanksgiving, as
Gordon does after every save, but thrust two giantverhead in
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Radatz did that for the first time the day he struck out
Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Elston Howard of the Yankees on 10
pitches with the bases loaded and nobody out in the ninth inning.
That became the calling card of ``The Monster,'' as the 6-foot-6,
240-pound Radatz would become known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed with Gordon, he's been very good,''
Radatz said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at relief pitchers, I do compare guys to those
back in my day--Stu Miller, Hoyt (Wilhelm), Johnny Wyatt, a couple
of other guys. The table is set a lot differently today for
relievers; it's easier to get a save.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from the beginning of the season, to me Tom Gordon has
been successful for one reason more than any other: He wanted the
job. It wasn't like he was going to try it. You either want it or
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he got a little tired of the mediocrity he had had as a
starter. He knew he wasn't going to be the No. 1 starter. Maybe he
had the feeling he could be the No. 1 man in the bullpen, the
savior. It was something he really wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gordon, Radatz, a college star at Michigan State, was a
starter, until Johnny Pesky made him reliever in 1961, the year
before he broke into the majors. Radatz had his doubts about the
switch, but as a rookie in 1962, he was American League relief
pitcher of the year, with a 9-6 record and 24 saves. A year later,
he was an All-Star and in 1964, he had the season of his career:
16-9 record, 29 saves, a 2.29 ERA and 181 strikeouts in 157
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Kansas City, Royals closer Jeff Montgomery, who
broke into the big leagues with Gordon, said that he learned a
valuable lesson from former Royals closer Dan Quisenberry. ``Quiz
told me the best thing a closer can have is a very short memory,''
Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz laughed in agreement. ``I don't know if my line was
original or not,'' he said, ``but what I always said was, `What are
they going to do if I give up a home run, take me to jail?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem was that there were so many doubleheaders.
If you screwed up in the first game, you still came out for the
second game, when what I wanted to do was go for a cold one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has pitched as many as three innings just once this
season, more than one inning on just 14 occasions. Radatz, of
course, pitched in the era before the micromanaging of bullpens,
and the age of specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on call from the seventh inning on,'' Radatz said. ``I
had a setup man, though they weren't called that back then, and
that was Jack Lamabe. Jack had nine wins that year ('64). He'd come
into the game in the fifth or sixth, and if he was pitching well,
they would leave him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz recalled blowing a save against the Yankees in the
seventh inning of one game in Yankee Stadium. ``Marshall Bridges
and I were out there until the 17th inning,'' Radatz said. ``We won
it in the 17th when Bob Tillman tripled, and that was the only park
he could have tripled in, and Billy Gardner, who was hitting for
me, squeezed him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to blow saves. I'd go up to a starter and say, `I'm
sorry.' But Bill Monboquette pulled me aside and said, `Listen,
you're going to save a lot of wins for me that I wouldn't have
gotten, so don't worry about it. Nobody else in here is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been used on back-to-back dates 13 times this season,
including the Aug. 18 split doubleheader against the Rangers in
which he saved both the matinee and evening affairs. He has pitched
three days in a row just once this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pesky, who managed the Red Sox in 1964, wasn't as shy about
using Radatz day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story sounds almost fictitious,'' Radatz said, ``but
after Johnny pitched me six or seven days in a row, he told me not
to come to the ballpark. `If you do,' he said, `I might be tempted
to use you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the first three innings at home on TV in Milton, and
then I told my wife, `I can't watch this, I'm going to the
ballpark.' I got there in the sixth, and Johnny used me in the
13th, and we won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be the only guy in baseball history to win a game
after watching the first three innings at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz recalled pitching 6 2/3 innings on a Sunday against
Baltimore, then going to Detroit the next day for a makeup game.
``Johnny looked at me and said, `Can you give me an inning?' I went
into the game in the seventh, and I pitched until the 16th. Fifteen
and two-thirds innings in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz, who does sports radio and TV, has not spoken with Gordon
this season. He's only been to the ballpark a handful of times,
preferring to watch most games on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it looks like he's tightened up his curveball a lot, to
the point where it works almost like a slider,'' Radatz said. ``In
the past, when he'd get beat, 80 percent of the time it was on a
hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has a lot better fastball than I think he thought he
had. And he throws it for strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz never had another season like '64. The following season,
1965, he was 9-11 with 22 saves, and in 1966, he was traded to the
Cleveland Indians for Don McMahon and Lee Stange, two pitchers who
played vital roles in the Impossible Dream season of '67. Stange
won eight games for the Sox en route to a pennant, while McMahon
was traded to the White Sox for Jerry Adair, the Mike Benjamin of
his day.
</P>
<P>
   By 1969, Radatz was out of baseball, his career ending at the
age of 32 with the original Montreal Expos expansion team.
Interestingly, despite a workload that would be considered criminal
by today's standards, Radatz's career wasn't curtailed by arm
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had arm problems,'' he said. ``I had control trouble.
I went to spring training with the Cubs in 1968, and I walked six
guys on 24 straight pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of wildness is reminiscent of the struggles Braves
closer Mark Wohlers is now enduring. But Radatz, on the
recommendation of catcher Randy Hundley, who once had trouble
throwing the ball back to the pitcher, overcame his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a psychiatrist who hypnotized me,'' Radatz said,
``and doggone if it didn't work.''

FLIGHT 103 FAMILIES DISTRESSED BY TRIAL PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a, i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten years after terrorists killed her husband and
269 others in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Eleanor Bright
winced at a compromise the United States and Britain announced
Monday in an attempt to bring the suspects to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, addressing Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy's
request that two Libyans charged in the bombing be tried in a
neutral country, became public just days after the United States
unleashed its military might in retaliation for recent terrorist
bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the US-British proposal, the suspects would be tried by a
Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands. The Libyan foreign
minister told the United Nations in January that his government
would accept Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many relatives of the Pan Am 103 bombing victims want the
suspects tried in the United States or Scotland, where the bombing
occurred. And several wondered aloud Monday how the United States
could appear to compromise with alleged terrorists in Libya less
than a week after US raids on suspected terrorist sites effectively
declared war on terrorism around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very distressing,'' Bright said Monday of the US
attacks last week in Sudan and Afghanistan. ``It made all of us
feel as if our loved ones' lives weren't important enough,'' she
said by telephone from Little Cranberry Island off Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bright's husband, Nicholas, a manager for Boston-based Bain &AMP;
Co., was among 189 Americans who died in the explosion over
Lockerbie, Scotland, four days before Christmas in 1988. Seventy
other people on board were killed, as were 11 in Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest chapter of the Pan Am 103 explosion _ the most
deadly terrorist attack ever on American civilians _ Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright outlined the compromise plan in a
conference call Monday with Bright and 22 other relatives of the
bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, which drew mixed reactions among the
families, United Nations sanctions against Libya will be lifted if
Khadafy accepts the offer from the United States and Britain to
allow the suspects to be tried in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Khadafy has refused since the suspects were indicted in 1991 to
deliver them to the United States or Scotland, insisting they would
not receive a fair trial in either place.
</P>
<P>
   With few other diplomatic alternatives, the Clinton
administration decided ``to call the Libyan government's bluff,''
Albright told reporters after speaking to the family
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has urged tougher sanctions on
Libya to try to force Khadafy to turn over the suspects, reserved
judgment on the change in strategy. ``This is a new proposal, which
is in its early stages, and I want to study it carefully,'' he
said. ``If it is truly air-tight and will at long last bring to
justice those responsible for this heinous act, then it should move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives of the bombing victims also reserved judgment.
``It's clear to me that if Libya has not cooperated by now, they
never will,'' said Lestra Carpe Benello, of Hanover, N.H., a
retired physician whose 24-year-old son, Julian, died in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Benello, a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale
University, was working toward a doctoral degree at Cambridge
University when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cognizant of why it would be best to have the trial here
or in Scotland,'' his mother said. ``But what we need is a trial,
and I believe nothing further will happen as things stand now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright, whose son, Nick, was a year old when the bomb exploded,
said she worries about the United States stepping onto a ``slippery
slope'' by appearing to bargain with Khadafy. And she urged the
United States to push for an oil embargo against Libya if he
rejects this offer. The administration said Monday it would seek to
tighten UN sanctions and add unilateral measures if there is a
rejection.

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The sputtering remains of Tropical Storm
Charley had pushed 200 miles up the Rio Grande Valley from the Gulf
of Mexico before stalling early Monday and dumping more than a foot
of rain on South Texas and northern Mexico, turning drought-baked
arroyos into gushing drain spouts and leaving at least 16 people
dead and more than 60 missing.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest loss of life and the fiercest flooding came about
145 miles west of San Antonio, in the remote desert town of Del Rio
and just across the border in Acuna, Mexico. The rains began early
Sunday, and the flooding started shortly after midnight, residents
said, at one point sending a 5-foot wave down the San Felipe Creek
that washed away some 50 homes. Smaller creeks and arroyos on the
north side of town also flooded. By 4 a.m., two-thirds of Del Rio
was under water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flood just came,'' said Eddie Eskew, 72, the senior pastor
at Grace Community Church in Del Rio's San Felipe section.
``There's this whole section here with mobile homes. It came right
through there and washed them all out. Three people were killed,
two I knew. There were four people in one mobile home. Two of them
swam away, and two stayed behind and they died. The water took that
mobile home off its foundation and across Amistad Boulevard and
slammed it through a brick wall and into a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush sent 150 guardsmen, 28 trucks and nine
helicopters into the area following pleas from local officials, and
the dull thud of helicopter blades could be heard all afternoon as
the search continued for those still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Del Rio said Monday night that they had six
confirmed deaths, including a Border Patrol trainee who had gone to
search for relatives, but they cautioned that at least 50 people
were still missing and that the death toll was likely to rise.
About 17.5 inches of rain fell on Del Rio between 8 a.m. Sunday and
8 a.m. Monday. The previous record had been 8.8 inches of rain,
which fell on Del Rio on June 13, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highway 90 East had 5 feet of water over a brand-new bridge we
just built,'' Eskew said. ``Highway 90 West had 2 feet of water
crossing it out by the Wal-Mart, about a mile and a half from
downtown. It's unreal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States believed that senior Iraqi
scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX
at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed
last week, administration and intelligence officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence the administration has cited as justification for
the attack consisted of a soil sample secretly obtained months ago
outside the pharmaceutical factory, the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries, the officials said. Officially the administration has
refused to describe its evidence in any detail, or to say how it
was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The sample contained a rare chemical that would require two more
complex steps to be turned into VX, one of the deadliest nerve
agents in existence, and the chemical, whose acronym is EMPTA, has
no industrial uses. The United Nations and the United States have
long agreed that Iraq is extremely skilled at many kinds of VX
production, having worked for years to perfect the best process.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
there was evidence that senior Iraqi scientists had aided the
efforts to make VX at that factory, and at another plant a couple
of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The connection with Iraq emerged as a key part of the
administration's argument for why it was justified in launching
cruise missiles at a plant in another country without any warning.
</P>
<P>
   The officials disclosed the information, four days after the
American strike, to try to counter claims by the Sudanese
government that the factory, located in an industrial area of
Khartoum, was purely a benign commercial venture that produced half
of the Sudan's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, rebuffed calls from the Sudan and
other countries to turn over its evidence. At the United Nations,
the Security Council on Monday put off a request by Arab nations _
submitted by one of the United States' closest Arab allies, Kuwait
_ to send inspectors to search the rubble in Khartoum for signs of
chemicals related to VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what the purpose of a fact-finding study would
be,'' Peter Burleigh, the deputy American representative to the
United Nations, said after the meeting. ``We have credible
information that fully justifies the strike we made on that one
facility in Khartoum.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Khartoum, the Sudanese president, Omar
Hassan el-Bashir, kept up his sharp attacks on the United States
and President Clinton, saying Clinton ordered the attack to cover
up the furor over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his senior aides have described the evidence linking
the factory to the production of VX as compelling and even
irrefutable, though until Monday the administration refused to
discuss the evidence in any but the most general way.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the soil
sample, collected outside the factory, contained traces of a
``precursor chemical`` called ethyl methylphosphonothionate, or
EMPTA. There would be no viable explanation for the presence of
that chemical, they said, other than the production of VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't obtain this chemical because you're making ball
point pens or whatever,'' an administration official said. ``If
you're making this, you're making VX.''
</P>
<P>
   VX is an odorless, colorless liquid that can kill with
remarkable speed. A mere drop on the skin or inhaled in the lungs
is enough to kill an adult within minutes. There are a number of
ways to make the agent, but the officials in Washington and other
American and foreign officials said the technique using EMPTA is
one Iraq used to develop its own VX stockpiles in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and at the United Nations said there
were a number of other factors linking Iraq to the pharmaceutical
plant, as well as a second facility.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, President Saddam Hussein's government asked
the committee that monitors U.N. sanctions to allow it to buy
medicines from the factory under the ``oil for food'' program that
allows humanitarian supplies into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative to the United
Nations who is this month's president of the sanctions committee,
confirmed the request, but the officials said it was not clear what
medicines were ordered or whether any were ever delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations closely monitors goods purchased
under the ``oil for food'' program, the officials said the contract
could have provided a pretext for extensive visits by Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
   A senior intelligence official said that one of the leaders of
Iraq's chemical weapons program, Emad al-Ani, had close ties with
senior Sudanese officials at the factory. The official said a
number of Iraqi scientists working for Emad al-Ani had attended the
grand opening of the factory two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant, officials
in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected
of making chemical weapons. That site, according to diplomats in
New York and the Sudan, has been frequently visited by Iraqi
technicians and was more heavily guarded than Shifa Pharmaceutical.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also in a residential neighborhood, and officials
familiar with planning for the American cruise missile strikes said
the fear of collateral damage was a factor in choosing a target.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration offered details about its evidence,
there were still unanswered questions. The soil sample, which
presumably measured either a spill or airborne particulars, did not
prove that the attacked factory was the pharmaceutical plant that
produced the precursor chemical, EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable they were only storing EMPTA there, or it was
just passing through there,'' the senior intelligence official
said. ``You could spin several scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   While the administration maintains the evidence of VX production
is clear, the links between the factory and Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi exile whose network of terrorists was the target of last
week's strike, is circuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden controls a sprawling web of companies underwritten by
a fortune said to exceed $200 million, including ventures in the
Sudan, where he made a home after his expulsion from Saudi Arabia
in 1994 until he was forced to leave in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said bin Laden has no direct investment in the
pharmaceutical plant, but has financial ties to Sudan's state-run
military industrial complex. They said that fact and bin Laden's
suspected interest in obtaining chemical weapons was enough to
warrant destroying the factory, along with a paramilitary training
camp in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put all that together,'' the senior intelligence
official said of the factory, ``it all adds up to a source of real
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   As administration officials laid out their case, new details
emerged of the strike itself. A senior Pentagon official said on
Monday that the cruise missiles that landed in Afghanistan heavily
damaged or destroyed virtually every ``soft'' target at the
sprawling mountain training camp, including barracks,
communications equipment and arms stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States did not bother striking fortified
bunkers in the area, since Tomahawk cruise missiles, despite a
1,000-pound payload and remarkable accuracy, would not have
destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon also confirmed on Monday that the vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston,
traveled to Pakistan before the strikes so he could be with
Pakistani military leaders at the time of the attack. The reason
for the visit, which was first reported on Monday in The Wall
Street Journal, was to reassure Pakistan that the barrage of
incoming missiles was not an attack by its archenemy, India.

CHINESE BOOK ON POLITICAL REFORM STIRS HOPES FOR MORE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The publication this month of a path-breaking book on
political reform is stirring excitement among liberal intellectuals
here, who hope that it will encourage more open debate about the
rule of law, freedom of information and the role of the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Political China: Facing the Era of Choosing a New
Structure'' (China Today Publishing House), brings together 39
recently published essays by 32 scholars, journalists, former
government officials who were dismissed for their democratic
sympathies, and even an adviser to President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most comprehensive book devoted to political
reform to be published in China since 1989,'' said one of the
authors, Li Shuguang, a law professor at the University of
Political Science and Law in Beijing. While there was a brief
flowering of debate on political change in the late 1980s, it was
abruptly halted when troops smashed the Tiananmen Square
demonstrations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   All the book's essays have appeared previously in journals and
newspapers. Scholars say they have felt a bit more free recently to
discuss the political system so long as they do not challenge the
Communist Party's primacy.
</P>
<P>
   The essays represent a range of views on how deeply the system
must change. But together, they capture the discussions among more
liberal thinkers who have begun to voice sharp questions about a
system that even party leaders concede is riddled with corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book also reveals just how narrow the boundaries of
permissible discourse here remain. Not a single author dares to
bring up multiparty politics, or to call for the direct public
election of national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's preface, Jiang Ping, who was forced from the
presidency of the University of Political Science and Law in 1989
because he failed to toe the party line about the crushed student
movement, writes: ``Discussing political structural reform is not
just an armchair strategy, but will build up psychological
anticipation for the reform in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the book was edited by two men with high-level
jobs in major official newspapers: Dong Yuyu, a senior editor of
Guangming Daily, and Shi Binghai, a senior editor with China
Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Junning, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences who wrote four of the essays, said in an interview
that he hoped that the book would ``create a general atmosphere in
which people may widely discuss political reform and possible
democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of provoking government censors, the publisher and editors
have avoided active promotion. But the first printing of 30,000 was
unusually large for highbrow books here, and the volume is selling
throughout the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One essay is by Wang Huning, an adviser to the president, and
calls for greater separation of government and industry and
measures to build the rule of law _ all under the Communist Party's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The more searching essays explore the implications of limiting
the reach of the party, creating a stronger legislature, the
benefits of a free press and protection of civil rights. But any
suggestions for changing the basic system must be read between the
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Liu calls for a constitutional guarantee of private property
rights, part of a broader effort to restrict the role of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Xie Qingkui, a political scientist at Beijing University, asks
why the country's much-vaunted village elections should not be
tried at the township and county levels.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of ``Political China,'' in a postscript to their
book, said: ``We hope the book will create ample room for
discussions on reform. If the consequence runs counter to our
expectation, it will not just be the misfortune of the editors.''

 California Bans New Taxes On Net Business   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
California yesterday banned new state and local taxes on Internet
access and purchases for three years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's only fitting that the state that showed America how to
surf _ and surf the Internet _ should also lead the policy debate
about how to keep the Internet a vibrant avenue for growth and
opportunity,'' Governor Pete Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson signed the California Internet Tax Freedom Act into law
at a ceremony in San Jose a Systems, a leading networking
company that does a lot of business online.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado passed legislation similar to California's in May. Two
other states, New York and New Jersey, limit taxes on Internet
services and transactions. In those states, the limits came about
through executive orders by state tax officials.
</P>
<P>
   The state law mirrors a federal proposal backed by President
Clinton. Passed by the House of Representatives, it is expected to
go before the Senate in September.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters consider such laws essential to maintaining the
growth of the Internet, which is still a relatively young business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The California Internet Tax Freedom Act, introduced by
Assemblyman Ted Lempert, D-Palo Alto, bars special taxes on
Internet commerce, treating it the same as mail-order or catalog
sales. Californians pay state sales tax on products bought over the
Internet only if the seller has a store, factory or other
``physical presence'' in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crucial legislation for California because this is home
to the Internet industry, and it's been so important to our
economic growth,'' Lempert said. ``Having a lot of folks trying to
tax the Internet could impede its growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which takes effect January 1, prohibits new taxes on
Internet access and on the telephone lines used to hook up to the
Internet. The bill does not affect any existing tax. Local
governments would still be able to collect utility user taxes on
basic cable television, telephone and cellular phone service, even
if the lines are used for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The League of California Cities, city governments and other
opponents had argued against an earlier version of the law that
would have curbed local taxes on cable TV companies and utility
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been another step in our dwindling revenue
base,'' said Dwight Stenbakken, legislative director of the League
of California Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments to the bill that won over the League protected local
governments' &UR;  &LR; existing taxing authority and ensured the tax
moratorium would be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the bill had strong support in Silicon Valley
and throughout the high-technology industry. Netscape, Apple
Computer, Microsoft and Netcom were among a group that lobbied for
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Th{Qyidea is to have jobs grow in California rather than
burden the industry with regulation and taxes and have them grow
some other place,'' said Teresa Casazza, executive director for
state public policy for the American Electronics Association in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and Net commerce is an emerging business that has
resulted in new technology and economic opportunities in every
state,'' said John Hough, a spokesman for Egghead.com in Portland,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the United States) have the chance to be the global leader
in Internet commerce,'' he said. ``It would be best if government
at all levels gives it a chance to develop before imposing
regulations and taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Egghead closed its remaining 80 retail stores in February to
move its business operations to the Web.

 Intel's New Pentium Chip to Send PC Prices Lower   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Intel's new top-of-the-line chip, the 450 MHz Pentium II, made its
debut this weekend, and at least one retailer, CompUSA, is selling
a system with the new chip for under $2,000. To anyone who has
followed the PC industry, that's nothing short of remarkable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago, after all, that you had to pay over
$3,000 to get a system with a brand new high-end Intel chip. And
$2,000 barely got you last year's chip.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind my nostalgia. The bottom line here is that if
you're in the market for a new PC, put on your shopping shoes,
because prices are about to take a nose-dive across the board.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the introduction of the new Pentium II will force
prices lower for other desktop PCs using Intel chips, as well as
for systems that sport competitive chips from AMD and Cyrix.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, PCs with 266 MHz chips _ now considered the low
end _ could soon be available for less than $750 from some dealers.
And 300 MHz systems, which now sell for as little as $1,000, should
move down below $900. By year's end, the 300 MHz will be the entry
level.
</P>
<P>
   The picture isn't so rosy for`}ntel. The big Santa Clara
company is selling the new Pentium II 450 to computer-makers for
$669 (when bought in volume). That's a good deal less than the $824
it got for the Pentium II 400 when it appeared in April _ and far
below the nearly $1,000 it commanded for the first Pentiums five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take an economist to conclude that when you shave
that much off the price, your profit margins go down. Intel will be
able to cushion the blow, because it continues to reap tremendous
profits from its notebook chips and chips used in corporate
workstations. But it's gotta hurt nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's overall gross margins this year should be around 52
percent. That's still high, but it's less than in years past, when
it topped 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A more imminent threat may face AMD, which has carved out a nice
business for itself selling chips for low-end systems. That
company's profit margins already are thinner than model Kate Moss,
but they're about to get thinner, and that could dampen AMD's hopes
of returning to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   AMD also faces renewed competition from the latest version of
Intel's Celeron _ Intel's entry in the sub-$1,000 market _ which
was introduced along with the Pentium II 450 over the weekend.

 Printers On the Way For the iMac   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Q:  I've been thinking about getting an Apple iMac. The only 
 thing that concerns me is whether I'll be able to get a printer 
 that will work with it, since it only has a USB port. Is   anybody
planning to come out with a USB printer soon? And what   about
other peripherals such as mice and Zip drives? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  All major printer-makers will have USB models within the
next few months that will work with any computer that has a USB
port. Also, companies are starting to sell cables that convert a
standard parallel port printer to USB. In fact, Hewlett-Packard
already has announced USB cables for its DeskJet 670C and 690C
printers, and Epson has announced one for its Stylus 600.
</P>
<P>
   USB-compatible mice are already available from market leaders
Microsoft and Logitech. And Iomega is planning to introduce a USB
version of its popular Zip drive soon.

 &LR; to use a laptop to keep track of my contacts. I will be booting &LR; 
 &LR; up anywhere from three to 10 times a day after sales calls. &LR; 
 &LR; Because I won't be near an electrical outlet, I'm afraid I'll &LR; 
 &LR; run down the battery in the computer. Is there a way to &LR;   &LR; recharge
using the battery in the truck? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  As Curley would say, ``Soitenly.'' All the big
computer-makers sell special cables that let you plug your
lapt &QR; ePfw41~to the cigarette lighter in the car or truck or boat or
whatever. You can treat this connection just like a regular plug in
your house. That is, you can run the computer off it, or use it to
recharge, or both. Expect to pay about $90.
</P>
<P>
   You also can find cables that convert your regular laptop power
cord into a mobile charger. That's a good option if you can't find
a car cable for your specific model laptop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I've got a Packard Bell with a 75 MHz Pentium and 16 &LR; 
 &LR; megabytes of memory. I'm thinking of getting Windows 98, and &LR;   &LR; I'd
like to know: A) Will I need more memory? and B) If so, how &LR;   &LR; can I
find out what kind I need? Also, is it hard to upgrade, &LR;   &LR; or should
I let a store do it for me? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  You don't need any more memory to run Windows 98 than you
need for Windows 95. But doubling your memory to 32 megs would
speed up your system appreciably. So it's definitely worth the
upgrade, especially because the kind of memory your computer uses
has become pretty cheap. You should be able to get 16 megs for
under $30.
</P>
<P>
   I believe your Packard Bell uses standard 72-pin SIMM chips. But
just to be sure, check the manual or call the company. That way
you'll know exactly what kind and how many chips to buy. As for
upgrading, it's a simple procedure, but if you feel queasy about
opening up the PC, let the store do it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I recently removed several programs I was no longer using &LR; 
 &LR; by deleting their folders in Windows Explorer. Then I noticed &LR; 
 &LR; that when I go to Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel, the &LR; 
 &LR; programs are still listed. When I try to remove them, I get a &LR; 
 &LR; message saying ``Cannot locate install.log.'' How do I get rid &LR; 
 &LR; of the programs and make sure they're truly gone? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Don't worry, they're gone. But since you didn't use
Add/Remove Programs to delete them, Windows thinks they're still
there. It's possible to remove the names, but it's complicated and
involves going into the Windows Registry. You don't want to do
that. Trust me. Just live with it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Netscape Update &LR;  _ Last week, I noted that Netscape
Communicator doesn't let you view a list of e-mail messages and a
directory of e-mail folders in the same window. But Netscape has
corrected that oversight with version 4.5 of Communicator, which is
now in beta testing and can be downloaded for free at
 &LR; www.netscape.com &LR; . This new version can display the directory of

 Catholic Values Claimed by Both Sides in Hospitals' Battle
With  Union  By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Catholic Healthcare West, the second-largest hospital network in
California, is facing a union drive by nursing aides, housekeepers
and other &UR;  &LR; service workers who claim that CHW is violating its own
religious principles by opposing their efforts to organize.
<P>
   The Service Employees International Union has spent the past
year trying to organize about 10,000 workers at 10 CHW hospitals in
Los Angeles and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions already represent about one-quarter of CHW's 32,000
employees, including service workers and nurses at St. Mary's
Medical Center and St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco,
and at Seton Medical Center in Daly City.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with CHW _ whose headquarters are in San Francisco _
say they are in full compliance with labor laws and with their
faith's teachings about the right of workers to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   They say they strongly oppose the union drive but have not tried
to unfairly pressure workers to reject a union. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly trying to get our message out, but we have
made it clear that intimidation and interrogation are
inappropriate,'' said Cindy Holst, CHW spokeswoman for the
Sacramento region.
</P>
<P>
   However, labor organizers say that the Catholic hospital network
is mounting an anti-union campaign as harsh and intimidating as
anything they've seen in the for-profit health care world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (managers) have &UR;  &LR; taken almost everyone in my department
into their offices on a one-to-one basis and told them lies like
they could lose their benefits or their jobs if they join the
union,'' said Luis Vallejo, a dietary worker at the Robert F.
Kennedy Medical Center in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by the atmosphere of terror, and I don't use
that phrase lightly,'' said Sal Roselli, president of SEIU Local
250. ``Managers are identifying union leaders and warning other
workers not to communicate with them. ... The hypocrisy (between
Catholic teachings and CHW practices) is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   With 37 hospitals and about 8,000 acute-care beds, California
Healthcare West is the second largest hospital chain in the state
after for-profit Tenet Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   CHW was formed in 1986 when local Catholic hospitals began
joining forces to remain competitive in the new era of cost-cutting
and managed care.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit organization with 1997 revenues of $3.2 billion, CHW
is governed by a board that includes representatives of nine
religious orders such as the Sisters of Mercy and Daughters of
Charity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CHW's Sacramento and Los Angeles employees say they decided to
seek union representation primarily because of cost-cutting
measures that have made it hard for them to do their jobs _ a
complaint common to all kinds of health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staffing is down consistently across the board, which means
everything is done as quickly as possible,'' said Jill Dibert, a
licensed vocational nurse who has worked at Mercy General Hospital
in Sacramento for 13 years. ``We no longer have time to attend to
patients' psychological or spiritual needs. One great thing about
Mercy is that it always had people like chaplains around. But now
we no longer have time to assess whether patients need help like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   CHW workers like Dibert hope a union will give them more of a
voice in setting hospital policies.
</P>
<P>
   They also want better pay and benefits. For instance, union
organizers say that CHW is one of the few Northern California
hospital chains that doesn't pay for health coverage for its
employees' dependents.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHW states in all its literature that its No. 1 priority is
making sure that children are insured _ yet in Sacramento, none of
their employees' kids are covered unless they can pay 100 percent
of the cost,'' Roselli said.
</P>
<P>
   CHW officials respond that they have recently raised pay levels
to a par with other hospitals. They say they've tried to lower
health insurance costs for their workers, but just can't afford to
pay for dependent care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the economic capacity at this time to pay 100
percent of (employees' families') health care,'' said Holst.
</P>
<P>
   CHW officials say they fear that a union would be a disruptive
``third party'' that would make it harder for employees and
managers to work together. And they said that, while unions may
have been necessary in other times and places, they are not
necessary at CHW.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, unions attempted to better substandard wages and
benefits, or improve areas where employees worked in deplorable
conditions,'' three Daughters of Charity wrote in an April 17
letter to employees at the Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center. ``We
know that none of those negative circumstances exist at Robert F.
Kennedy. ... It is not necessary to purchase the services of a
third party, the union, to address your concerns to
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute at CHW over cost-cutting and compensation is
strikingly similar to arguments going on elsewhere in the health
care industry.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the CHW union drive unusual is the religious nature
of the organization _ and both sides' efforts to invoke Catholic
values in making their case.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 19 letter about the union drive to employees at St.
Francis Medical Center in Southern California, Brother Richard
Hirbe said the hospital's mission was life and ``building up the
Kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``No union can make claim to building God's Kingdom as
its Mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SEIU organizers are drawing upon statements by Pope
John Paul II and other Catholic leaders that support the right of
workers to choose whether or not to join unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Church fully supports the rights of workers to form unions
or other associations to secure their rights to fair wages and
working conditions,'' the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
said in a 1986 statement. ``Therefore, we firmly oppose organized
efforts ... to break existing unions or prevent workers from
organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Union activists hope to convince Catholic leaders in Sacramento
and Southern California to intercede on their behalf, even though
bishops have no direct authority over the women's religious orders
that run CHW.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, a spokesman for the bishop said he would oppose
any instances of ``manipulation or deception or black propaganda''
by a Catholic institution.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The diocese would be concerned if an association within the
church were engaging in what is commonly termed `union-busting'
activities,'' said the Rev. Charles McDermott, vicar episcopal for
theological and canonical affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, McDermott added, he hadn't seen any evidence of that
at CHW.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be astonished if the Sisters of Mercy countenanced
intimidation,'' McDermott said.

 Cisco Using TV Ads to Outdo Lucent in Battle of Network Stars   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Are you ready?
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's what Cisco Systems asks in a new television ad campaign
that debuted last night on local news shows.
</P>
<P>
   The ads put a human face on a company that's a hit on Wall
Street but not exactly a household word. The network equipment
vendor is the latest high-tech firm to use television ads to build
a brand name with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Goldberg Moser O'Neill of San Francisco, the ads are
designed to let consumers know that Cisco hardware provides the
plumbing for much of the fast-growing Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesperson Doug Wills said Cisco will buy ad time on talk
shows and prime-time television. On the surface, the campaign is
designed to help Cisco launch a new family of consumer products _
high-speed modems and other geek gear _ that it will build and
co-market with manufacturers like Sony and Matsushita.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco has ambitions that transcend the network niche. A
second, if unspoken, purpose of the campaign is to help Cisco play
catchup in a battle for name recognition with one of its newer
rivals, Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which includes the former Bell Labs, is a top maker of
the hardware used to route telephone traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the phone network and the Internet were separate, but new
technology makes it possible and desirable to route phone and data
traffic over the same equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That means Cisco, the data-networking giant, and Lucent, the
Godzilla of voice, are increasingly bumping heads.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent began its own television-branding campaign last year
after it was spun off from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lucent's $26 billion in annual revenues dwarfs Cisco's
$9 billion take, Cisco chief executive John Chambers wasn't
overawed by the size of his rival when he briefed reporters in May
about the consumer ad campaign and other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Lucent an ``old economy'' company, Chambers said: ``It
will be interesting to see which cultures win, the old economy or
the new economy cultures'' like Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Size and number of people are not necessarily
strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the TV ad wars, dollars do seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's just a coincidence that Lucent spent $26 million
on its TV image ads, while Cisco is saying privately that's it's
willing to drop up to $30 million for prime-time exposure in North
America alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Web-apalooza: &LR;  There's been a whole lot of socializing in the
Web community of late.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday evening, for instance, the inaugural meeting of
San Francisco Women on the Web  &LR; (www.sfwow.org) &LR;  drew a crowd of
several dozen to the Macromedia Building in San Francisco.
Organizers Valerie Hoecke, of the San Francisco Web design firm
Fire Engine Red, and Cyd Harrell, of Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., said
some 300 women have already joined SFWow's mailing list, which
targets women whose jobs revolve around the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And both (or should we say all genders) are invited to the
Transmission Theatre in San Francisco tomorrow night for the
Geekapalooza, a party put on by the Bay Area chapters &UR;  &LR; of the
Association of Internet Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   You still may be able to get $7 advance tickets (check
 &LR; www.geekapalooza.com) &LR; , but if you're too late, what the heck: Dye
your hple and spend $10 to get a ticket at the door.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Palooza will air an eight-minute trailer of ``GirlGeeks?,''
a documentary-in-the-making that its producers _ne Hanna and
Peter Crosby of Sausalito _ hope to get on the air next April in
conjunction with ``Take our Daughters to Work Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, ``GirlGeeks?'' has focused on better-known women like
industry analyst Esther Dyson, Marimba chief executive Kim Polese,
network industry executive Judy Estrin (now of Cisco) and Katrina
(tres decolletage) Garnett of CrossWorlds.
</P>
<P>
   But the producers plan to set up a camera at the 'Palooza to ask
women in the tech field their feelings about working in a
male-dominated arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of the documentary is to find out how women
view this (geek) label,'' Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women already filmed, the attitudes range from
Polese's pride in wearing the label, to Estrin's comment that after
being named ``geek of the week'' in a Silicon Valley publication,
her mother sent her a dictionary entry that identified a geek as
``a carnival performer who rips the heads off chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. officially registered to end its
129-year-old partnership Monday and confirmed two things Wall
Street has long surmised: It is obsessively secretive and
phenomenally profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which formally decided to go public earlier this
month, will issue shares in November. But it leaders have been
traditionally loath to release operating details, and so far they
are clinging to the last strands of exemption from public scrutiny
that partnership status affords.
</P>
<P>
   Its 100-page filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
included few insights into ownership stakes and compensation. It
said little about how the firm's expected net worth of $28 billion
will be divided. Hundreds of spaces in the offering prospectus were
left blank. They will be filled in only at the last legal moment,
probably early October, people at the firm say.
</P>
<P>
   It is also vague about what Goldman plans to do with the capital
it raises from its initial public offering. If it raises in the
range of $3 billion as planned, the offering would be one of the
largest in history. The prospectus says that the proceeds will be
used for ``general corporate purposes.'' It says Goldman sees the
offering as a chance to stabilize its capital base and perhaps to
make acquisitions, but leaves the disclosure at that.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulatory filing does open a window on Goldman's
profit-making machinery, disclosing some previously undisclosed
details about its earnings and how they are made. The prospectus
stresses that Goldman has taken a clear leadership position in the
two areas that generate the high fees for investment banks,
underwriting initial public offerings and advising companies on
mergers and acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   For the five-year period beginning in 1993, the prospectus says,
Goldman ranked No. 1 worldwide in both categories. It does less
well against its rivals in debt markets than equity markets,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, few firms can match its growth. Fifteen years ago the
company earned $364 million before taxes, compared with $3 billion
in 1997, the filing says. That is a 15 percent compounded annual
growth rate for the period, an extraordinary pace of expansion
given that Goldman made no major acquisitions of other companies
during that time.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of gauging profitability for a private partnership,
return on partners' capital, shows both the enormous earning
potential and the roller-coaster-like dips that Goldman's 189
general partners oversee.
</P>
<P>
   In its best years, including this year's first half, Goldman has
generated a pretax return on capital that exceeds 60 percent. In a
down year like 1994, however, return on capital fell to 10 percent,
the filing says.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the offering, Goldman has already divided its
revenue into three categories, making it comparable to its
investment banking peers for the first time. In recent years, the
firm has derived roughly equal revenues from each of its three main
areas of business: investment banking, trading and principle
investments, and asset management and securities services.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with its leading rivals, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Goldman depends more heavily on its
storied trading operation. That makes its earnings potentially more
volatile than those of its rivals. For example, the firm suffered
big trading losses in 1994, leading to overall poor results that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia crisis and instability in developing countries may have
leveled another blow at Goldman last year, although surging results
from the United States easily covered any losses, the filing
suggests. During the second half of last year, when the Asian
crisis began spreading quickly, Goldman's earnings from stock
trading plunged 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's greater willingness to take risk on its own
account has also led to outsized gains in good years. So far this
year, for example, trading and principal investing accounted for
just shy of half of all revenue, powering the firm to record
first-half pretax profits of $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldman has never been shy about taking risk,'' said Art
Soter, a financial industry expert at Morgan Stanley. ``But that
does not mean they are unduly risky. They are good at seizing
opportunities and that can produce some spectacular results.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since the 1994 crisis, Goldman's tolerance for risk
has shrunk. The firm has greatly reduced the amount of money it
stands to lose from trading operations in any given day, the
offering says, even as its capital base has expanded. That means
the chances of trading losses threatening Goldman's financial
wherewithal are smaller than was once the case.

   WASHINGTON _ If Libya refuses an offer to try two Libyan
suspects in The Hague, Netherlands, for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
flight 103, the United States will press the United Nations to
extend sanctions on Libya to include an oil embargo, a senior U.S.
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook of Britain confirmed in simultaneous announcements
Monday that they were willing for the Libyans to be tried in a
third country, but by Scottish judges under Scottish law. They had
previously insisted that the trial take place in the United Kingdom
or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials called the offer, which is close to a proposal
made by Libya, ``nonnegotiable'' and said Libya must respond
quickly by handing over the suspects. Otherwise, they said, the
offer will be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Libyan leader, Moammar
Gadhafi, but the Arab League, seeming to speak for Libya, welcomed
the proposal cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, Egypt, the league secretary general, Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, said Monday: ``Libya and the Arab League are in
agreement in principle, but we need to know the details, in
particular whether there are any conditions. If this proposal
conforms with the Arab and Libyan offer for a Scottish panel of
judges to try them at The Hague in accordance with Scottish law,
this would be the beginning of the solution to the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who was asked by the United
States and Britain to notify Libya of the details of the proposal
and to handle the extradition of the suspects, endorsed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The plane blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988,
killing 259 people on the aircraft _ including 189 Americans _ and
11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We note that Libya has repeatedly stated its readiness to
deliver the suspects for trial by a Scottish court sitting in a
third country,'' Ms. Albright said. ``We now challenge Libya to
turn promises into deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright said the plan ``is not subject to negotiation or
change, nor should it be subject to additional foot dragging or
delay.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Libya fails to hand over the suspects, who have been named as
Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, Washington will
seek an expansion of U.N. sanctions to include sales of Libyan oil,
a State Department official added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said they considered an international oil
embargo unlikely. They said, though, that a Libyan refusal would at
least make it difficult for the United Nations to ease the
sanctions it imposed in 1992 on Libya for refusing to hand over the
suspects, who are believed to be Libyan intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspects are handed over, both the United States and
Britain will support action in the Security Council to suspend the
international sanctions against Libya, which include a ban on
flights to and from the country. But U.S. unilateral sanctions
against Libya for being what it considers a ``state sponsor of
terrorism'' will continue, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Libya has repeatedly broken the ban on flights, sending token
flights to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the annual Muslim pilgrimage.
Foreign dignitaries, including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
last month and President Idriss Deby of Chad Monday, have started
flying to and from Tripoli, the Libyan capital, instead of
traveling by road.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has not made any recent announcements on the proposal for
a trial in a third country, but the lawyer for the suspects,
Ibrahim Legwell, said last month they would accept a trial in The
Hague ``if the conditions for a fair trial are provided.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Legwell's conditions included an international
panel of judges, which the United States and Britain have rejected.
But the Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Muntasser, said
explicitly in a letter to the United Nations in January that the
judges could be Scottish.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the suspects could have to serve up to 30 years in
a Scottish prison, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger told the
families of those who died in the Pan Am bombing about the decision
in a conference call Monday morning. ``These families don't all
agree on the proper strategy for achieving accountability in this
case,'' Albright said. ``But they all agree that the delays in
bringing the suspects to trial have gone on for far too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose daughter,
Theodora, died in the explosion and crash, said she was very upset
about the outcome. ``Today has been a day which has been, in a
sense, a victory for Gadhafi and the terrorists,'' Mrs. Cohen said
in a telephone interview. ``This sets a bad precedent. If
terrorists out-wait us, do they now have a right to decide where to
be tried? I don't think the administration has really thought
through the long-term implications of this.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in contact with all the families said a majority
of them favored the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Johnson of Greensburg, Pa., said in an interview Monday
that he, his wife, Carole, and the board members of the group,
Survivors of Pan Am 103, supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this might allow us to get justice and get
off-center,'' he said. ``This still meets with what we can live
with. With everything that's happened, we need to take the
initiative, and this will force Gadhafi to make a decision.''

 &HT;    Sunbeam redesigns comeback
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Sunbeam Corp.'s latest turnaround strategy
calls for abandoning cost-cutting plans former Chairman Al Dunlap
put in place before he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Jerry Levin said Monday he will keep
open four of the eight plants Dunlap sought to close, delay the
closing of one and retain two businesses that were slated to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plants are being kept open,'' Levin said, ``to ensure a
high level of quality and customer service, as well as a
consistency of supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who spoke to Wall Street analysts after the market
claid discussion of Sunbeam's financial performance would
have to wait until the company restates its results by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled appliance maker, whose accounting practices are
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, has
said it will issue new numbers for 1997, the first quarter of 1998
and possibly all of 1996 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam also faces the difficult task of selling off bloated
inventories. Levin said he expects it will take 18 months to clear
warehouses of excess grills through outlet sales and special
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges we face in the near term are significant,''
Levin said. ``But they are more than offset by the upside of our
businesses _ the consumer is still buying our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been waiting to hear from Levin since he took the
helm at Sunbeam in June, several days after the board fired Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-July Levin had assembled a new management team made up
primarily of executives who worked for him at Coleman Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly much more optimistic now, given the management
team in place, than I have been in the last 12 months,'' said
William Steele, an analyst with New York-based Buckingham Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Steele has no plans to change his neutral outlook
on the stock, which he has rated a ``market performer.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who ran Coleman until Sunbeam bought the camping products
maker in March, was brought in by financier Ronald Perelman, who
became Sunbeam's second largest stockholder when he sold the
company his Coleman shares.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time Palm Beach resident will become the appliance
maker's largest investor if he exercises warrants he received this
month to buy 23 million additional shares at $7 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam issued the warrants as part of a settlement to avoid a
lawsuit from Perelman, who has seen the value Sunbeam
investment plummet.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire investor got a 14 percent stake in Sunbeam in
March, when the stock (NYSE: SOC) was trading above $40 a share. It
closed Monday at $8.81, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   To keep employees happy, Levin said the company will allow them
to trade in stock options set at exercise prices higher than $10
share for fewer options at Perelman's price of $7 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said his options are set at exercise prices of $7, $10.50
and $14 a share. In addition, he said Sunbeam will no longer pay
shareholders a quarterly dividend of a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Levin attributed much of Sunbeam's problems to poor customer
service and a lack of communication between Sunbeam's sales and
manufacturing divisions, both of which reported directly to Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``As things would change with customers, the word literally
never made it to the manufacturing floor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Levin plans to pull back from the centralization
Dunlap had planned and give each of the company's three business
units _ outdoor leisure, household products and international _
more control and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the company will keep open plants in Maize, Kan.;
Pocola, Okla.; Aurora, Ill.; and Acuna, Mexico. The closing of a
plant in Mexico City will be delayed three months, until December.
Sunbeam also will retain Coleman's Eastpak outdoor products
division and its Powermate compressor business, which were to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Levin eased analysts' concerns about the company's liquidity,
saying Sunbeam has $300 million available in cash and credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of going bankrupt,'' Levin said. ``It's
in nobody's interest.''

 &HT;    Banks facing difficult times
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After three years of record profits, Texas banks
may be headed for some turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were still good for the state's 855 banks in the first
quarter 1998, according to the latest figures from Austin-based
bank research company Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But banks' net interest margins _ the difference between what
banks charge for loans and what they pay for deposits _ took a
nosedive during the quarter, according to Sheshunoff.
</P>
<P>
   Banks typically derive most of their profits from two sources,
fee income and interest income. The declining interest income could
be a harbinger for lower profits, said Bob Colvin, Sheshunoff's
managing director of community banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indication of weakness may point to more difficult times
ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The net interest margin at Texas banks dropped 40 basis points,
from 4.43 percent to 4.03 percent, in the first quarter from the
fourth quarter 1997, according to Sheshunoff.
</P>
<P>
   The margin is the lowest in the last five years, Colvin said. It
continues a steady quarterly decline since the second quarter of
1997, when Texas banks reported their third straight record
earnings at $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net interest margin has declined since,'' Colvin said.
``While it was steady most of last year in the 4.40 percent to 4.50
percent range, it looks as if we have moved to another range.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 basis point decline was even greater than the decline of
33 basis points for all banks in the nation in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in interest spreads is indicative of banks'
increasing reliance on fees for everything from checking accounts
to use of tellers.
</P>
<P>
   But with more competition, some doubt whether banks can continue
to raise fees to offset the declines in interest income.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more competition, and shrinking margins, can these fees
continue to rise at a pace to offset any future declines in the net
interest margin?'' Colvin asked. ``Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Banking Commissioner Catherine Ghiglieri agreed that banks
are ``under a lot of pressure to reduce fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers also have a ``sense of urgency trying to book loans and
they are squeezing their margins down to almost nothing,''
Ghiglieri said. ``They are not leaving any room for any costs they
may incur in the future in terms of collection or any kind of cost
of care. So it is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As mergers and acquisitions give larger banks in Texas a larger
share of the market, pricing policies will have a depressing effect
on the rest of on the rest of the banking industry, said Steve
Scurlock, senior vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing from our community banks that some of the
larger banks are doing some fairly aggressive pricing on some
lending,'' Scurlock said. ``I guess they feel like they can make up
for a loss in spread, or net interest margin, by volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Rates on loans and long term investments rates have inched
downward as deposit rates stayed steady, said Hartland Bank
Chairman David Hartman, partly the result of heightened competition
between banks. ``It's basically the state of the monetary market
and increased competition,'' said Hartman. ``Banking is always most
profitable when there is a steep yield curve, and short term rates
are low and long term rates are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into the exact opposite situation right now.''

 &HT;    UT Law School's challenge: an open door to power
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For a fifth of its 115-year history, the
University of Texas School of Law has been able to call a former
student by the title governor.
</P>
<P>
   The school could have claimed a sixth Texas governor, but it
rejected George W. Bush about 30 years ago because it contended his
grades from Yale weren't good enough. Today, Bush works with 16 UT
law graduates in the Legislature. Another five sit in Congress.
Eighty-three call courts to order. And plenty of others practice at
prominent firms.
</P>
<P>
   UT ranks 10th nationally in producing managing partners, or
heads, of major law firms. It's in the top 20 schools turning out
graduates hired by the nation's 100 largest firms. Two recent
graduates clerk for U.S. Supreme Court justices, a career door
opener like no other.
</P>
<P>
   While the legal profession is often a gateway to power in
society, a pedigree from a premier law school such as UT helps turn
the key.
</P>
<P>
   But black and Hispanic access to the Law School _ along with its
innate connection to power _ is eroding at a time when the Hispanic
population is swelling and the Anglo population is expected to fall
below 50 percent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite monumental recruiting efforts, some Texas law school
deans are bracing for a second fall of enrolling fewer blacks and
Hispanics than their schools had in 1996 because of a federal court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   UT opens Wednesday for a second year of grappling with the
Hopwood ruling, which stopped Texas colleges from considering race
when selecting students, awarding scholarships and providing other
services. The ruling has been hailed by some as a victory over
reverse discrimination and decried by others as a tragic return to
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Hopwood has cast a lingering spotlight on the UT Law School, not
only because the lawsuit originated there, but because of the
school's standing in Texas. No other state law school has as many
graduates in the courts, Congress or state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   But only in the past 30 years have the gates to the state's
biggest and highest-ranked law school truly opened to blacks and
Hispanics. It took a court order in 1950 for the UT Law School to
admit its first black. Several decades later, it became known for
graduating more blacks and Hispanics combined than any law school
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of the 16 UT law graduates in the Legislature are
black or Hispanic. Many other minority graduates are judges,
community leaders, mayors and council members.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pen(tilde)a, a UT law graduate and president of the
State Bar of Texas, says that because the face of Texas is
changing, the Law School should reflect that diver
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``you're going to have a situation where over 50
percent of the population in Texas is minority and 10 percent of
the attorney population is minority,'' he said. ``You're talking
about a societal problem everyone has an interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   UT Law School Dean Mike Sharlot said people lose faith in public
institutions when they don't see people like themselves in power.
The justice system is especially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other country in the world that has turned a
greater variety of disputes over to the justice system to
resolve,'' Sharlot said. ``Our justice system depends ultimately on
most people in society accepting its decisions as legitimate.'' The
UT Law School has played a key role in shaping the Texas justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 until 1988, all seven chief state justices were UT
graduates, according to Michael Widener, the school's archivist and
rare books librarian.
</P>
<P>
   On the Law School's 100th anniversary in 1983, the
American-Statesman reported that nearly half of the state's sitting
appellate judges were UT law graduates. Alumni that year also
included the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, four
associate justices, a third of the state's senators, the attorney
general and the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   When Hopwood was argued in federal district court in Austin, UT
law graduates were intimately involved, from the presiding judge,
Sam Sparks, to lawyers on both sides. They included Vinson &AMP;
Elkins' managing partner Harry Reasoner, who defended UT, and
Steven Smith, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of four white
applicants who claimed reverse discrimination when denied admission
to UT in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The four applicants won, and Hopwood is being appealed for a
second time to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans, where seven of the 21 judges are UT law graduates.
</P>
<P>
   UT, like flagship law schools in some other states, has a
national reputation for grooming leaders, said Jim Vaseleck,
associate counsel to the Law School Admission Council, which
administers the Law School Admission Test and provides other
services. ``I've heard the road to the Statehouse goes right
through the UT Law School,'' Vaseleck said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Canales has worn a path between the Statehouse and UT
since 1992, first at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and then as a
law student. He started as a volunteer for state Rep. Irma Rangel,
D-Kingsville, chairwoman of the House Higher Education Committee,
in 1989. By 1995, he was her paid chief of staff. He left that fall
to enroll in law school and graduated last May.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to get in was fierce, Canales said, not just
because of the school's prestige but because of its low tuition.
</P>
<P>
   With 475 students entering last fall and about the same this
fall, more than six applicants are turned away for every one who
wins a place.
</P>
<P>
   While Canales, 29, awaits his bar exam results, he is monitoring
hearings at the Capitol, educating himself on an array of issues.
His goal is to be elected to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Canales, a former migrant farm worker who headed the
Chicano/Hispanic Law Students Association at UT, is considering
lobbying or consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this legislative bug in me I can't get rid of,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat and an African
American, also went to the LBJ School and then to the UT Law
School. Harvard had been his top choice, but he thought his law
exam score wasn't high enough, so he didn't apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back on it, I am much better off having gone to
the University of Texas rather than Harvard,'' Ellis, 44, said.
``I've lived my life in Texas, and the contacts I made . . . have
been invaluable.'' He mentioned Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk and several
other high-powered lawyers as examples from his 1979 graduating
class. As an investment banker, Ellis sometimes finds himself
working on deals with fellow alumni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at the premier law school in the state opened doors for
me in ways I never could have predicted,'' he said. ``It was like
being part of a fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Henry Cuellar of Laredo, also a UT law graduate,
wants to see the Law School return to the days of high minority
enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature is going to encourage the UT Law School and
the other professional schools to do as much as they can to
diversify,'' he said. ``If they don't move fast enhere will
be moves by the Legislature to take appropriate actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Texas Tech Law Dean W. Frank Newton is helping Rangel
craft proposals for lawmakers to consider when they convene in
January. One is designed to stem what Newton called a ``brain
drain'' of talent to other states. It would create a scholarship
fund so that Texas can counter offers from out-of-state law
schools.
</P>
<P>
   There are no data on how many students leave Texas for law
school elsewhere and what happens to them, but the vast majority of
lawyers educated in Texas stay. Last year, 87 percent were working
in the state, the highest percentage in the nation, according to
the National Association for Law Placement.
</P>
<P>
   Another legislative proposal, Newton said, would give law school
applicants with subpar LSAT scores a chance to enroll if they
perform well during a summer program.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Sibley, a leading Republican from Waco who has
sponsored legislation to end racial considerations in education,
government contracting and employment,says that while he supports
diversity he does not want the courts to overturn Hopwood. ``I just
don't believe in curing racial discrimination with racial
discrimination,'' said Sibley, who has a Baylor law degree.
</P>
<P>
   UT law professor Lino Graglia, who triggered a furor last year
when he made remarks about the cultures and academic performance of
blacks and Hispanics, agrees. ``Knowing everyone got in the same
way is better than having 40 that might not have gotten in like
everybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities with lower scores and grades are better off going to
less competitive schools where they can succeed, Graglia said. He
acknowledged that most beneficiaries of affirmative action at UT
graduated and eventually passed the bar. But using race casts
suspicions on all minorities, and that is devastating to race
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said it will be far more devastating if Texas fails to
significantly boost minority access to the legal pon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a creeping crisis, and creeping crises are hard to get
people's attention,'' he said. ``But the longer you let it go, the
harder it is to fix.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Offering a sobering portrait of an aging metropolis,
a new study by the city comptroller has found that New York would
have to spend more than $90 billion over the next decade to make
the necessary repairs to put the city's subways, water mains,
schools and bridges in safe working order.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is vastly higher than the $52 billion that government
agencies now plan to spend on repairs. But Comptroller Alan Hevesi
said that if City Hall, the Board of Education and the Transit
Authority did not spend more money now on repairs and maintenance,
conditions would further deteriorate, meaning costs would be much
higher in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ultimate goal is to have an adequate physical plant
where every facility functions well and safely, this is what is
required,'' Hevesi said in an interview. ``It is not a wish list.
This is not the optimal. This is by our definition a state of good
repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi and his report dealt only with the city's fundamental
infrastructure; they did not address recent problems _ falling
bricks, crashing scaffolding _ that have plagued construction sites
and privately owned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that parts of the city's infrastructure are
deteriorating is certainly not new. But the report _ based on the
work of auditors, investigators and engineers _ is the first in 20
years to describe the scope of the problem and to estimate the
money needed to make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and the city transit system account for more than half
of the projected cost in the report. Providing more space for
growing enrollment and repairing many of the city's 1,028 aging
school buildings would cost $28 billion. Fixing the city transit
system, including rebuilding and repairing subway stations and
improving track and signaliems, would take an additional $21
billion, the report maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on a series of assumptions _ ranging from
the influence of the weather on water pipes to how many people will
be riding subways or attending schools _ that may or may not prove
accurate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   David Neustadt, a spokesman for the comptroller, said teams of
engineers made sample visits to more than 200 sites and then used
what they learned to make projections about the likely condition of
similar sites. The investigators also reviewed records from 18
agencies, and used the agencies' own condition reports to make
their evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Colleen Roche,
declined to comment on the report Monday. ``We have not been given
the same courtesy of being given a copy of the report,'' she said.
``I am not able to comment on what appears to be government by
press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Neustadt said that the comptroller's conclusions were discussed
with each agency before the report was written and that there were
no major objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this,'' Hevesi added, ``is offered with hostile intent
or to be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its large price tag for repairs, Hevesi's report has
some good news. It found that since the city's fiscal crisis of the
1970s, the city has made great strides in improving the condition
of many parts of its infrastructure, including the subways, jails
and many sanitation stations. Overall, the comptroller said, New
York is ``a very well-managed city.'' But the sheer size of the
city's physical assets, combined with the cost of maintaining them
and their age makes it difficult to find a single solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title of the study is `Dilemma in the Millennium,'''
Hevesi sAnd it is a dilemma, it really is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 900-page report, in the works for 18 months, reflects the
varied needs and the ways in which small items can quickly add up:
</P>
<P>
   _ The city has 223 firehouses, many of which were built decades
ago and not designed to handle modern, 12,000-pound fire engines.
As a result, floors in 125 firehouses are in danger of buckling, or
have already begun to give way. Although the Fire Department has
shored up the floors, it only has had the money to fix 46 floors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The city's East River bridges _ the Brooklyn, Manhattan,
Williamsburg and Queensboro _ are undergoing a $3.2 billion
rehabilitation. Of the city's 838 other bridges, more than 70
percent are in poor or fair condition. The report says 148 bridges
are expected to deteriorate from good condition to fair condition
in the next 10 years if maintenance is not increased.
</P>
<P>
   _ The report projects a shortage of beds in homeless shelters in
two years. By 2007, a shortage of 1,556 to 4,800 beds is predicted.
There are no plans to build more shelters.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 2007, 1,060 miles of water mains _ about one-sixth of the
system _ will be more than 100 years old, which is their predicted
life span. The city only has money to replace 204 miles.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 340 of the city's 468 subway stations need major
renovations, at an estimated cost of $5.96 billion. The Transit
Authority expects to spend about $1.82 billion on the repairs in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The city does not have the money to fix everything. And, the
comptroller said that even if the money was available, it would be
impossible to do so much construction at the same time. The very
effort of digging up pipes, tearing up highways and closing off
buildings for repair could bring chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Schwartz, director of Cooper Union's infrastructure
institute, said that the city's spending on infrastructure began to
drop after World War II and that the decline accelerated after the
1970s fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the century, there were 200 workers cleaning
the Brooklyn Bridge,'' said Schwartz, a former chief engineer for
the Transportation Department. ``By the mid-1980s, there were
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the city faced a longstanding problem since
deferring maintenance would create greater spending needs in the
future. He said the city should consider setting aside money,
perhaps from its surplus, for annual maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to go in cycles,'' said Douglas Criscitello, director
of the city's Independent Budget Office. ``The city backed away
from some of its capital needs after the 70s fiscal crisis and
recommitted in the 1980s. It dipped in the early 90s and has gone
back up since then. It tracks the economy.''

COURT BARS `SAMPLING' METHOD IN NEXT CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for major rewriting and restructuring, with emphasis on
clarifying the meaning of the decision; 200 words longer than
original)  (Eds: See also CENSUS-SAMPLING) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal court ruled unanimously Monday that the
Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to supplement the
2000 census violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau had hoped to use sampling to avoid a
repetition of the 1990 census, which missed 8.4 million people and
counted 4.4 million either twice or in the wrong place while
relying exclusively on traditional head-counting.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stood to gain by sampling included minority groups,
whose members have been disproportionately undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has achieved a heightened importance because census
data are used to apportion House seats and draw boundaries for
congressional districts. With House Republicans holding a
razor-thin majority, both parties are acutely conscious of any
question that might give one side an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the partisan wrangling, the issue is of grave concern to
cities because some federal money is allocated on the basis of
population.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was welcomed by congressional Republicans, who
contended that sampling would lead to new errors and be subject to
political manipulation. But it dismayed Democrats, who thought the
system would count minority voters missed under recent censuses and
that counting them would produce new congressional and legislative
districts likely to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling said the method violated the Constitution,
which declared that the federal government was required to conduct
an ``actual enumeration'' every 10 years. But the special
three-judge panel, specifically charged by Congress with hearing
census issues, sidestepped the constitutional issue and ruled that
the scheme was not permitted under the 1957 and 1976 laws that
govern the census. The unanimous decision stressed that the court
found no need to decide whether sampling was constitutional because
the ordinary federal law already barred it.
</P>
<P>
   The decision can be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court,
and the Clinton administration is expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges deciding the issue Monday were Douglas
Ginsburg, an appellate court judge, Royce Lamberth, a district
court judge, both appointed by President Reagan, and Ricardo
Urbina, a district court udge named by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The panel issued an injunction Monday prohibiting the Census
Bureau from using any form of statistical sampling in the next
census. In the meantime, the ruling is expected to provide
ammunition to Republicans who have been waging a protracted
political and legislative battle against sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this gets the administration's attention,'' said Rep.
Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee on the
census. ``This is a unanimous decision _ one judge appointed by
President Clinton. The wise thing to do is put all their resources
into a full enumeration.''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of sampling said Monday they still hoped for a
favorable decision from the Supreme Court. ``Ultimately, it will be
before the Supreme Court,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
``Nothing has really changed. The nation needs an accurate count
that includes everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's planned sampling methodology was loosely
similar to that of public opinion polls in that it would
extrapolate information about the population from partial data.
</P>
<P>
   But the bureau's plans are more sophisticated than polls. They
involve using traditional methods to count everyone in 90 percent
of the households in a census tract _ a neighborhood of about 1,700
dwellings. Data from the 90 percent would be used to determine the
number and characteristics of the remaining 10 percent, and a
further adjustment of the population would be made on the basis of
a survey of 750,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision was particularly galling to representatives of
undercounted minority groups. ``It's inexplicable,'' said Eric
Rodriguez, senior policy analyst with the National Council of La
Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization. ``I don't understand it. We
had an undercount of 5 percent of the Latino population in 1990. If
this ruling is upheld we have no reason to expect anything but a 5
percent undercount this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of large concentrations of blacks in inner cities and
increased numbers of immigrants, mainly in the Southwest _ two
groups that have notoriously low response rates to mailed census
questionnaires _ the 1990 census was the first in modern history to
miss more people than the census that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling turned on an interpretation of two seemingly
contradictory provisions in the Census Acts of 1957 and 1976. The
1957 act said that ``except for the determination of population for
apportionment purposes,'' the secretary of Commerce ``may, where he
deems it appropriate, authorize the use of the statistical method
known as sampling.'' The wording codified the practice of sending
the census long form _ the questionnaire that asks how many
bathrooms there are in the home, for example _ to one in every six
households.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Congress changed the language of the law, saying that
except for purposes of reapportionment, the Commerce secretary
``shall'' authorize the use of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had argued that by changing the
wording to make sampling mandatory rather than optional, Congress
had effectively removed the prohibition against it for
reapportionment purposes. Further they argued that in 1976 Congress
added amendments _ Section 141 _ to the act that directed the
Commerce secretary to conduct a census every 10 years ``in such
form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling
procedures and special surveys.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, written by Lamberth, the panel disagreed
with the Justice Department's line of reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though defendants' interpretation of the except/shall sentence
structure is proper in some instances, the court finds it to be
strained and incorrect when applied to the amended section 195,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth stressed the importance of the census to the balance of
power in Congress between parties and between states, and said it
was hard to imagine that Congress would change the rules without
explicitly saying so. He quoted from Justice William Rehnquist in a
1980 decision:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case where the construction of legislative language such
as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as
that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into
consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit that produced Monday's ruling was brought by Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who in bargaining over the spending bill that
covered the Census Bureau last November won administration
agreement to allow general tax revenues to pay for the litigation,
a deal that enraged many House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought him the gun and said, `Shoot me,''' said a
Democratic staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, ``and
the court did.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time the White House was confident that the court would
rule that Gingrich lacked standing to bring the lawsuit since he
could not show how the Census Bureau's plans would cause a specific
injury to the House. White House lawyers were also confident that
the court would decide that because the administration and the
House Republicans were still haggling over the issue the case was
not yet ``ripe'' for a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling went against the administration on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has explicitly directed that in certain limited
situations, cases like those involving the Voting Rights Act or
challenges to the Census are to be considered by panels composed of
a mix of district and appellate court judges. Any appeals from
those panels go directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the
federal appeals courts. In the 1997 appropriations act that covered
the census, Congress ordered that this extraordinary procedure be
used in determining the legality or constitutionality of the
administration's plans for the 2000 census.

 &HT;    Texas techies outnumber oilers
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's official: nerds and geeks outnumber
wildcatters and roughnecks in the Lone Star state.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the presence of two of the world's biggest personal
computer makers _ Compaq in Houston and Dell in Round Rock _
oil-and-gas still packs a bigger economic punch than high-tech. In
a study released Monday, the state Comptrollers office said the
number of high-tech jobs in Texas surpassed those in the
oil-and-gas industry for the first time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is sure to continue, said Comptroller John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``High technology has emerged as one of the main engines of
economic growth in the state,'' said Comptroller John Sharp.
``There are strong signals that our high-tech industry will become
even more dominant in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, oil-and-gas accounted for 11 percent of the state's
economic output, while high-tech accounted for 8 percent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of jobs, however, high tech will continue to grow
beyond oil-and-gas. The report says jobs in the five core high-tech
businesses will pass 500,000 this year year, compared to 453,599 in
oil-and-gas.
</P>
<P>
   The core businesses are: semiconductors and computers;
communications, biotechnology, defense and electrical and
electronics equipment. Sharp released the study at a press
conference at the University of Texas at Dallas. The data also are
published in the comptroller's latest Fiscal Notes newsletter. It
is available online at
http://www.window.texas.gov/comptrol/fnotes/fnhome.html.
</P>
<P>
   When two related employment areas _ technical services and
``technology-intensive manufacturing'' _ are added, then Texas
high-tech employment swells to 781,000, or about 10 percent of the
state's work force.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech workers are far better paid than the typical Texas
worker, with an average annual salary of $48,000 compared with
$28,000 for all workers, but the benefits of the high-tech
explosion in the state are, for the most part, limited to the
state's largest metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of them are in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston,
while another 16 percent are in Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Triangle of Dallas-Forth Worth, Houston, Austin and
San Antonio are the primary beneficiaries'' of high-tech growth,
said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic
Development at the University of North Texas. ``It's not getting
spread out to the hinterlands of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein noted that three areas tied to petroleum and
petrochemicals, Beaumont, Odessa-Midland and Galveston-Texas City,
have high jobless rates of 7.7, 5.8 and 7.1 percent respectively.
By comparison, two high-tech centers, Dallas and Austin, have
jobless rates of 3.5 and 2.9 percent. High-tech has been gaining on
the oil-and-gas industry in Texas for some time. But the
comptroller's study said that the high-tech core industries gained
more than 51,000 jobs between 1994 and 1996 to top the 454,000 jobs
statewide and surpassed Texas' oil-and-gas employment for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas can keep training workers, high-tech jobs should keep
growing in the state, Sharp said. His office projects Texas will
add 51,000 high-tech industrial jobs in the next four years. Sharp
warned that the state must continue to train more workers for
high-technology jobs or risk having its job growth slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the computer power in Texas cannot match the brain power
of our young people,'' Sharp said. ``We have to do all we can to
create a technically skilled workforce to meet industry's demand.''

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M. _ In what would be the largest purchase of
private land by the U.S. Forest Service in at least a quarter
century, Congress and the Clinton administration are forging a
consensus to buy the Baca Ranch, a 95,000-acre expanse of alpine
meadows and fir-covered mountains so emblematic of the West that it
has served as backdrop for Stetson hat advertisements and Marlboro
Man billboards.
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood directors, Madison Avenue advertisers or the rare
invited guest, the appeal of the isolated greensward, cupped in the
walls of an ancient volcano, is often the same. The Baca ranch
imparts a rare sense of discovery. Driving on Route 4 over a dark
and winding mountain pass, the visitor suddenly emerges into a
``Lost Horizon'' world of hot springs, trout streams, and meadows
of wildflowers where cattle and the state's largest elk herd graze
side by side.
</P>
<P>
   But the same sense of wide-open Western independence evoked by
the vistas has prevented the sale of the land for years. And the
deal to buy the ranch, which has been owned by one family for
almost 40 years, is as much about attitudes toward public land as
it is about money.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has long supported buying the ranch,
which has been called ``the hole in the donut,'' because it is a
privately owned island surrounded on all sides by the Santa Fe
National Forest. Last February on a visit to New Mexico, President
Clinton even had Air Force One make a detour to fly over the ranch
for a better view of its dominant feature _ a 15-mile-wide crater
of the dormant volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, noting that almost one third of New Mexico is
already owned by the federal government, have long opposed further
purchases. But in August, Republican sentiment began shifting
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation drafted by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the
Baca would be a separate unit of the National Forest system, owned
by the U.S. Forest Service, but managed by a trust, comprised of
members appointed by the president. This board would be charged
with responding to local wishes and making the park economically
self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Domenici's bill would tie an agreement to purchase
the Baca to legislation intended to speed sales of land owned by
the Bureau of Land Management that the agency has decided it does
not need.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, particularly those in Western states, are eager to
free up more federal land for private development.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Monday that the sale of the such land could
increase support among Western senators for his legislation, to be
introduced early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could get set aside this fall $20 to $40 million,''
Domenici said, ``money that says to the owners we are going to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the owners, the Dunigans, an oil family from
Abilene, Texas, expressed interest in selling the ranch in 1980,
the price was $55 million. Competition for the land between the
National Park Service and the National Forest Service, as well as
the death of the family patriarch, James Patrick Dunigan, squelched
that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although new appraisals have not been completed, the 1998 price
could easily be twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the price, and public interest, is tremendous population
growth in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, the state's two largest cities,
which are about 90 minutes by car from the Baca Ranch. In 1915,
when Woodrow Wilson first considered buying the Baca, recreational
tourism was an embryonic activity. Now, more than 3 million people
visit the Santa Fe National Forest every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baca could be the Rocky Mountain National Park for the new
Santa Fe-Albuquerque megapolis,'' said Roger Kennedy, a former
National Park Service director who lives in Santa Fe, referring to
the Colorado park that draws many of its visitors from Denver and
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who ran the National Park Service until 1996, said
acquisition of the Baca was similar to the purchase of land for
national parks at the start of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest piece of inviolate land anywhere near a major
city,'' he said. ``Everything else that size is either very remote
or very ugly. This is beautiful and close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baca began to approach its present form about one million
years ago, when two massive explosions blew the top off a volcano
here, sending 100 cubic miles of ash and lava into the air, some of
it reaching what is now Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, Indians from the Jemez and Santa Clara pueblos
hunted the area in the summer. In 1860, Congress settled a land
dispute among ranchers by giving the area to heirs of Luis Maria
Cabeza de Vaca, a Mexican sheep rancher. From 1926 to 1962, the
ranch was owned by the Bond family, who first grazed sheep, then
cattle on the land. Separately, a timber company heavily logged
about half of the forest area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smaller kind of Yellowstone, with a number of hot spots
in the streams,'' Frank Bond, a Santa Fe lawyer, said, recalling
childhood summers spent on the remote ranch. ``Because it has a
much more temperate climate that the rest of the Rockies, it has a
greater number of bird species.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, red-tailed hawks could be seen circling
over meadows, looking for prairie dogs that popped in and out of
their holes. Grouse, mourning doves, flickers and bluebirds abound
in this private reserve, which ranges from grasslands and aspens in
the valleys to spruce and fir at high elevations, up to 11,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, James Patrick Dunigan bought the ranch for $2.5 million
and instituted a gentler management hand. Through expensive court
battles, he ended the timber lease and stopped most of the logging.
Dunigan died in 1980, in the midst of negotiations to sell the
ranch to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   His heirs have maintained his management pattern, avoiding
overgrazing and logging largely for the health of the forest.
Giving priority to the elk, which were reintroduced after World War
II, the ranch now maintains about two elk for every cow - about
7,000 elk and 3,000 cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally have always thought we have been here as
caretakers,'' Anne Dunigan Wilson, Dunigan's widow, said on a
recent visit to a fieldstone hunting lodge her husband had built
here.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Dunigan, one of her sons, said that the family has set a
December deadline for Congress to show serious intent to buy the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are offering the government and the American people the
first opportunity to buy the property,'' said Dunigan, a private
investor based in Dallas. ``This is clearly one of the most
desirable trophy ranches.''

 JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M.: trophy ranches.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local county zoning allows for houses to be built on lots here
as small as three quarters of an acre. With demand growing from New
Mexico's city dwellers for second homes in the mountains, the
threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile homes with skirts around them _ that's the specter
now,'' said Dave Simon, regional director of the National Parks and
Conservation Association, a Washington-based group. As he bounced
in a van along a ranch road, he added: ``There is constant
pressures on ranchers up here to develop. The best places up here
would be cherrypicked for development.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of development has caused many conservationists to
rally behind the new bipartisan efforts to preserve the area.
However, environmentalists and the Clinton administration insist
that any board be charged with placing conservation values over
economic values in running the ranch as a park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resource values of this property must come first,'' Katie
McGinty, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality, said in a statement after visiting the ranch in July.
``The trustees may not sacrifice those values in an effort to make
the property financially self sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   While staffers for Republican and Democratic congressmen work to
hammer out mutually acceptable legislative language by Labor Day,
negotiations are spurred by the thought of the Baca being sold to
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to see it divided up and sold off,'' said Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and a longtime advocate of public ownership
of the Baca. ``I think prospects are good that we can go ahead when
Congress reconvenes.''

<P>
   COSTA MESA, Calif. _ Basically, the deal to bring Australia's
Quiksilver professional surfer board shorts to the United States
and to start a U.S. company was sealed in 1976 when a champion
surfer exhibited his passion for them at a dinner with their
inventor by grabbing a doily and eating it. And another surfer,
today a key executive in Quiksilver, now the biggest surf-wear
company in the country, got his first job there after he exhibited
his passion for the board shorts by breaking into a warehouse and
stealing a stack of them.
</P>
<P>
   So if it's 10 a.m. on the coast, and the waves are perfect and
there are babes at the beach and the breeze is like a bath, it
would be hard to take Quiksilver seriously if its surfer-executives
were at their desks. Even if it is a nearly $250 million public
company, opening its first New York store the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the waves are good because the guys are all gone,''
sighed Amy Patrick, who handles press relations for Quiksilver,
when there are company types around for the press to have relations
with. ``The girls finally had to learn how to surf.''
</P>
<P>
   Surfing is the company's business, so there's nothing really to
apologize for. Which is why Danny Kwock, the executive vice
president in charge of Quiksilver's new lines, didn't, after
ignoring his office pager all morning last Tuesday while he was in
the water. ``If I do that, and some CEO of the board is scolding
me, we're in trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quiksilver opened its New York store last Wednesday in the midst
of one of the waves of mass popularity surfing seems to have every
decade or so, this time swelling among the fashionable. It isn't
just that the company's board shorts _ which are designed to fit,
stay on and be comfortable during grueling surfing events _ haveed designers like Anna Sui. James Danzinger recently
exhibited Don James' classic surfing photographs; Bruce Weber
bought some. Professional surfers are regularly showing up in
fashion shoots. The former Beach Boy Brian Wilson is releasing a
new album, and VH1 is broadcasting documentaries about the Beach
Boys, and about Jan and Dean. NBC is producing a new surfing
television show.
</P>
<P>
   And quietly learning to surf is the new chic activity for
trendsetters like Dewey Nicks, the fashion photographer, and Tom
Sachs, the cool conceptual artist. All of which means absolutely
nothing to teen-age girls who have made Quiksilver's Roxy one of
the most successful teen clothing lines on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important piece of Quiksilver's business from a
growth standpoint is they seem to have cornered the women's surf
market,'' said James Palczynski, a vice president of research who
specializes in the youth market at Ladenburg Thalmann, a New York
investment bank. ``Roxy is really on fire right now. They were the
first to market a women's surf line, and women's surf could be as
large a category as young men's.''
</P>
<P>
   With 11 stores now in the United States, 17 in Mexico and 27 in
Europe, Quiksilver could be positioned as a sort of blond Benetton
with a tan and a better body. But while most big-name designers and
mass-market stores have invented lifestyle myths with slick
marketing, there is a real lifestyle beneath the Quiksilver logo:
the surfer life. The company has walked the line between being a
company with gear for Kelly Slater, the five-time surfing world
champion and Pamela Anderson's current boyfriend, and being a
company with gear for guys who will only get as close to Pamela
Anderson as the poster in their gym locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not only the brand, but a history in involvement in
the sport which gives it real legitimacy,'' Palczynski said. ``And
what we know about teen-agers is they're interested in legitimacy.
They're very media savvy.'' And Quiksilver has been savvy at using
that media. So much so that it's difficult to tell which came
first, the women's surf movement or Roxy. Certainly whatever
fledgling feminist surf scene was growing was aided by the images
Roxy has used for seven years to promote its women's clothes: tan,
confident, leggy surfer girls like the Beach Boys might have sung
about.

</P>
<P>
   The real lives of surf team members sponsored by Quiksilver and
Roxy are so cool that they might have been invented by MTV, a hip
real world instead of a faked real world. During high surf-contest
season, Roxy's surfers share a house in Newport Beach, Calif., that
Quiksilver pays for, with as many of the nearly 100 male surfers as
the house can accommodate. That is, when the surfers aren't
competing in Australia, Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil,
Peru, Uruguay, Tahiti, Portugal, Spain or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Lissa Zwahlen, who designs the Roxy collection, has only to go
to the warehouse attached to the company offices, where there is a
half-pipe for skating, Ping-Pong tables, and a putting green, to
get a look at the surfer team kids, who treat the place as their
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of former surfers on staff. Eric Diamond,
who designs the company's high-tech board shorts, was sponsored by
Quiksilver when he was 13. He was raised on the Hawaiian island of
Maui by surfer parents, and had a cameo as a toddler in the Jimi
Hendrix movie ``Rainbow Bridge.'' All of which has helped keep him
close to the pro surfers. ``It's like designing a racing car and
drivers are telling you how it's running,'' he said. ``Like they'll
say some fabric gave them a rash.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kwock was the best surfer in the neighborhood when he stole
those Quiksilver board shorts in 1976, at 15. ``We were poor kids
from the 'hood, and couldn't afford them,'' he said. ``It was
status.'' Instead of punishing him, Jeff Hakman, the surfer so
passionate about getting the rights to sell Quiksilvers in America
that he ate a doily, and Robert McKnight, who is now the chairman
of the company, hired him as their first team rider. ``They were
stoked,'' Kwock said. ``They needed a surfer to sponsor. I thought
I was going to jail, but they put me to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakman had borrowed his first pair of Quiksilvers from a fellow
surfer in 1975 and never gave them back. His doily-eating dinner
with the board shorts' Australian inventor, Alan Green, ended with
him getting the rights to license the name and product in America.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting surfers (like the four-time women's world champion
Lisa Anderson, who gets a six-figure salary), sponsoring contests
and dressing up-and-coming athletes, Quiksilver is gambling that
its core constituency won't mind so much when a guy with a beer gut
who lives 500 miles from the nearest whitecap brands himself a
Quiksilver man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a diminished credibility factor in every stage of the
way,'' Kwock said. ``From the moment you start to print 10 pairs of
shorts you lose cool people. It's part of the game you play. The
ultra-creative people who discover people, that's their job. They
discover. The very coolest ones, at the very bottom, are gone
already.'' It's a balance as tricky as, well, surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Quiksilver, we were paranoid from day one that we never
lose our roots,'' said Randy Hild, the head of the Roxy division,
who was there on Tuesday morning, but planning to surf at lunch.
``The day we have a surf shop drop our line because we've sold out
is the day we've lost our soul. Not that we spend frivolously, but
we don't hesitate with promotion ideas from surf shops. Then we're
quietly building the other world.'' The other world, of course, is
their shops and department stores.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Kwock said, is for Quiksilver to do for surfing what
Ralph Lauren did for polo. ``He took polo as a vehicle and turned
it into an East Coast lifestyle,'' he added. ``Our quest is whether
surfing can be that West Coast lifestyle.''

   SAN ANTONIO _ The sputtering remains of Tropical Storm Charley
pushed 200 miles up the Rio Grande Valley from the Gulf of Mexico
before stalling early Monday and dumping more than a foot of rain
on South Texas and northern Mexico, turning drought-baked arroyos
into gushing drain spouts and leaving at least 16 people dead and
more than 60 missing.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest loss of life and the fiercest flooding came about
145 miles west of San Antonio, in the remote desert town of Del Rio
and just across the border in Acuna, Mexico. The rains began early
Sunday, and the flooding started shortly after midnight, at one
point sending a 5-foot wave down the San Felipe Creek that washed
away some 50 homes, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller creeks and arroyos on the north side of town also
flooded. By 4 a.m., two-thirds of Del Rio was under water.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garcia, a spokesman for the Del Rio police department,
said the wall of water that rushed down the normally docile creek
was caused by a buildup of branches and debris further upstream
that created a dam that finally burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flood just came,'' said the Rev. Eddie Eskew, 72, the
senior pastor at Grace Community Church in Del Rio's San Felipe
neighborhood. ``There's this whole section here with mobile homes.
It came right through there and washed them all out. Three people
were killed, two I knew. There were four people in one mobile home.
Two of them swam away, and two stayed behind and they died. The
water took that mobile home off its foundation and across Amistad
Boulevard and slammed it through a brick wall and into a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officers, national guardsmen, local constables,
paramedics, firefighters and almost everyone in a uniform, worked
throughout the day rescuing people from roofs, treetops and
water-logged hillocks. The water scattered cars, masonry, asphalt
and other debris around the scrubby, cactus-filled flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush sent 150 guardsmen, 28 trucks and nine
helicopters into the area following pleas from local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Del Rio said Monday night that they had six
confirmed deaths, including a Border Patrol trainee who had gone to
search for relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The dead officer, David Pyatte, had been with the Border Patrol
for less than a year, said Patty Mancha, a spokeswoman for the
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cautioned that in addition to the dead, at least 50
people were missing and that the death toll was likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   About 17.5 inches of rain fell on Del Rio between 8 a.m. Sunday
and 8 a.m. Monday. The previous record had been 8.8 inches of rain,
which fell on Del Rio on June 13, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highway 90 East had 5 feet of water over a brand-new bridge we
just built,'' Eskew said. ``Highway 90 West had 2 feet of water
crossing it out by the Wal-Mart, about a mile and a half from
downtown. It's unreal.''

 SAN ANTONIO: It's unreal.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the border, at least five teen-agers were
killed while trying to cross the swollen Rio Vacas using a length
of rope as a guide. The youths had worked as grocery baggers at a
local supermarket. Two others were still missing, as was an entire
family from a nearby neighborhood, Mexican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mena, a spokesman for the Coahuila provincial government,
said that 20 homes had been destroyed in Acuna and that dozens more
made uninhabitable by the rising waters, leaving some 2,700 people
homeless. All but 200 of them were living in makeshift shelters in
Acuna, Mena said, while the rest had fled south or moved in with
friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the flood, downtown Ciudad Acuna was under 6
feet of water, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 500 people flooded out of their homes in Del Rio
were scattered among four shelters. Red Cross and Salvation Army
officials were staffing the shelters and passing out bottled water
to the hundreds of households left without drinkable water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the floods had damaged the city's water
system, allowing sewage to seep into it and making most tap water
unfit to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The water level of the nearby Amistad Reservoir, which had
fallen 15 feet in recent years, surged 35 feet in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The storm knocked out power to about 5,000 of Del Rio's 34,000
residents. Almost all of the southern half of the city had received
some flooding, and there were pockets of flooding in the northern
half of town, as well.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby Laughlin Air Force Base, two of the three runways were
under water, and the third was being reserved for emergency
flights.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, four Mexican immigrants, including a 2-year-old and a
4-year-old, were drowned when their pickup truck, carrying 18
people, tried to make its way across a swollen stream in Real
County, northwest of San Antonio in the heart of the Texas Hill
Country. The fast-moving waters just swept the truck away,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And a 65-year-old man had a heart attack and died Monday while
being evacuated in Uvalde County, where the Frio River had
overflowed its banks.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, virtually every major river spilled over its
banks Monday, including the Llano, the Frio, the Sabinal and the
Nueces. In the hardest-hit areas, almost every depression and
low-lying crossroads was under water.
</P>
<P>
   Weather officials had expected Charley, which hit the Texas
coast on Friday and Saturday and was downgraded from a tropical
storm to a tropical depression, to continue to diminish as it moved
inland and into western Mexico on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remnants of the system moved into the Del Rio area and
basically became nearly stationery and it produced the very heavy
rainfall in parts of southern Texas in the past 25 hours,'' said
David Imy, a meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center in
Norman, Okla. ``The problem when you have a system such as this is
that it picked up moisture over the Gulf. These systems will
produce heavy rain wherever they go, but the problem here is that
it sat over basically the same area for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm stalled over Uvalde, Kinney and Val Verde counties and
at its height dumped four inches of water per hour on parts of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing kind of hit us by surprise,'' said Ben Patterson, a
spokesman for the Texas Division of Emergency Management. ``The
first call we had was around 12:45 this morning, basically asking
us if we knew about the flood. We didn't, so we opened up the
operations center.''
</P>
<P>
   The water was making its way back to the Gulf of Mexico Monday,
a great swell almost a mile in width that was moving slowly down
the Rio Grande, cresting in Eagle Pass Monday night and heading for
Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Eagle Pass, expecting the water to move into the
downtown area overnight, evacuated hundreds of residents. In
Piedras Negras, the Mexican city across the Rio Grande, 300
residents were evacuated and the water was just beginning to seep
into city streets at 7 p.m., Mena said.
</P>
<P>
   While emergency officials in Eagle Pass struggled to evacuate,
officials in Laredo were meeting into the evening to assess the
threat approaching them.
</P>
<P>
   Further scattered showers and thunderstorms were predicted for
South Texas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Oklahoma had been in the grips of the worst drought
the region had seen since at least the early 1950s, and the rains
brought by Charley had been expected to ease some of the drought's
effects. It did, officials said, but at a heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 2.8 inches of rain in Del Rio in the first seven months
of the year,'' Eskew said. ``We've been praying for rain, but we
didn't pray for this.''

 &HT;    Bush trip stirs speculation on his candidacy
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As he campaigns for re-election, Gov. George W.
Bush has steered wide of overtly presidential states like Iowa and
New Hampshire. But when he visits South Carolina today , Bush will
invite a new wave of speculation about his political aspirations in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will not ask anyone to vote for him at stops in Columbia
and Greer. Events in both cities are fund-raisers for his buddy
David Beasley, a Republican seeking re-election as governor of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina GOP Chairman Henry says South Carolina is the
perfect place for Bush to kick off a presidential campaign.
McMaster argues that the state has provided key wins for other
Republicans in recent years. Most recently, Bob Dole grabbed the
lead and kept it by winning the state's primary in early March
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the other George Bush, the governor's father,
also collected key wins in South Carolina, a state the GOP claims
stages ``the decisive must-win presidential primary.''
</P>
<P>
   McMaster said Governor Bush could take a big step toward the
2000 nomination by skipping Iowa, New Hampshire and other
lesser-known early battlegrounds and heading straight to South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is superlative in every category,'' McMaster said
in going as far as he could without violating his chairmanly role
of neutrality. ``I think he would make an excellent president.
There are many people here in South Carolina that are hoping he
will run. I certainly do hope he will run.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, said McMaster, would be a great place to start
that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I would do. Iowa and New Hampshire do not
represent the conservative thought as clearly and consistently as
South Carolina does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush placed second in a straw poll in May at South Carolina's
GOP state convention.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McMaster said the straw poll, won by Missouri Sen.
John Ashcroft, was far from indicative of how South Carolina
Republicans feel about the emerging presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's backers worked hard to make a strong, early showing
for their man. Bush was absent, physically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to vote today, Governor Bush would either win or .
. . be at the top somewhere,'' McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's campaign stops _ though not for himself _ will further
cement Bush as a favorite in South Carolina, McMaster added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will engender a lot of good will,'' he said. ``And unlike
some of the other potential candidates for president, Governor Bush
is already well-known here. This will make him better known.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of preseason presidential talk that Bush has come
to hate. And, this past weekend, the Bush-as-presidential-candidate
image took another high-profile step when he showed up in the comic
strip ``Doonesbury.''
</P>
<P>
   At stop after stop on his re-election campaign, the governor
reiterates that his only immediate goal is becoming the first-ever
Texas governor elected to consecutive four-year terms. He will not,
however, promise to become the first Texas governor to serve
consecutive four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush fielded a question about his presidential
ambitions from 10-year-old Holly Buck in Houston, where the
governor was touting a program to help at-risk youngsters make
responsible choices about drugs, sex and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I may. I may not. I'm a little worried what it
means to my daughters. They kind of like their privacy. I haven't
decided yet,'' said Bush, who has twin teen-age daughters.
</P>
<P>
   So, while most polls indicate he is the front-runner for the
2000 presidential nomination, Bush lists himself as an undecided.
</P>
<P>
   It's a crack in the door that Democratic challenger Garry Mauro
uses to try to persuade voters that Bush has his eyes on the White
House, and does his current job accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's South Carolina visit gives Mauro campaign officials a
chance to freshen up their he-wants-his-dad's-old-job line of
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the process, what he is doing is taking Texas for
granted,'' said Mauro campaign manager Billy Rogers. ``Instead of
going to South Carolina, the governor ought to be trying to figure
out a way to end the teacher shortage crisis in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign insists today's events are routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Beasley is a friend of Governor Bush and, as he has said
before, Governor Bush is committed to helping his Republican
colleagues get elected to governorships,'' said Mindy Tucker,
Bush's campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Bush curried favor with the friends of his friends,
including well-connected Republicans who are trolling for a
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say at this point he is probably on top right now,''
said Jim Butts, a county GOP chairman in the northwestern part of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, like Bush, is a favorite for re-election in November.
Also like Bush, Beasley is touting a record of tax cuts, welfare
reform, crime fighting and a strong state economy. Beasley also has
mounted a high-profile campaign to ban video poker machines that
have brought gambling to restaurants, truck stops and other
locations in his state. Similarly, Bush has led a battle against
devices like slot machines that have cropped up around Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, Beasley is backed enthusiastically by his state's
social and religious conservatives. Bush's backing from groups like
the Texas Christian Coalition has been tepid at times.

EXCERPTS FROM RULING ON STATISTICAL SAMPLING IN 2000 CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the decision by a
three-judge federal panel in a lawsuit filed by the House of
Representatives against the Commerce Department over the proposed
use of statistical sampling in the 2000 Census. The decision was
obtained from the federal District Court's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff, the United States House of Representatives, seeks
summary judgment against the Department of Commerce and the Bureau
of the Census (``defendants'') in this action challenging
defendants' plan for the 2000 Census. Plaintiff claims that using
statistical sampling to supplement the headcount enumeration used
to apportion representatives among the states violates the Census
Act, 13 U.S.C., and Article I, section 2, clause 3 of the
Constitution. The House seeks a declaration that statistical
sampling is unlawful and/or unconstitutional and an injunction
preventing defendants from using statistical sampling in the 2000
Census. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires Congress to conduct an ``actual
Enumeration'' of the population every 10 years ``in such Manner as
they shall by Law direct.'' Congress has delegated broad authority
over the conduct of the census to the Secretary of Commerce through
the Census Act. The Census Act governs the Census Bureau's (the
``Bureau'') gathering of economic, social and demographic data
about the United States, including the decennial apportionment
census mandated by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constitutional mandate to obtain an ``actual
enumeration'' of the population, ``no census is recognized as
having been wholly successful in achieving that goal.'' The 1990
Census was no exception. According to the Bureau, ``[t)hough better
designed and executed than any previous census, the census in 1990
took a step backward on the fundamental issue of accuracy. For the
first time since the Census Bureau began conducting post-census
evaluations in 1940, the decennial census was less accurate than
its predecessor. ... the undercount rate of 1.8 percent in 1990 was
50 percent greater than the rate had been in 1980.'' United States
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Report to the
Congress _ The Plan for Census 2000, (revised August 1997).
Specifically, the bureau reports that children, renters
(particularly in rural areas), and racial and ethnic minorities
were significantly undercounted. Among those the 1990 census missed
were 4.4 percent of African-Americans, 5.0 percent of Hispanics,
and 12.2 percent of American Indians living on reservations, but
only 0.7 percent of non-Hispanic whites. This undercounting of
certain groups relative to others, known as the ``differential
undercount,'' raises the possibility of Congressional
malapportionment, as jurisdictions with large numbers of
undercounted persons may have a greater share of the total
population than the census figures suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about problems with the 1990 Census, Congress passed
the Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1991, which directed the
National Academy of Sciences to study ``the means by which the
Government could achieve the most accurate population count
possible,'' including consideration of ``the appropriateness of
using sampling methods in combination with basic data-collection
techniques.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Statistical sampling is best understood as using information
derived from a portion of a population to infer information on the
population as a whole. The Bureau intends to use sampling in three
different phases of the 2000 Census. ...
</P>
<P>
   Motion for Summary Judgment
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interpretation of two provisions of the Census Act, sections
141(a) and 195, is ultimately determinative as to whether
statistical adjustment to the initial headcount is permissible or
proscribed. These provisions were last amended in 1976, and the
resolution of this dispute depends upon the substantive effect of
the amendments. Plaintiff contends that while the 1976 amendments
encourage, if not require, the extensive use of sampling to collect
the myriad of general demographic information that the Bureau is
obliged to compile under the Census Act _ from occupational to
educational to income _ they do not permit the use of statistical
sampling to determine population for purposes of apportionment.
Defendants allege that Congress's grant of authority to use
sampling techniques extends to the apportionment enumeration. Other
courts that have addressed these two sections and the effect of the
1976 amendments have rejected the view that the Census Act
prohibits statistical sampling. For the following reasons, the
court must disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Section 195 of the Census Act
</P>
<P>
   Amended section 195 provides: Except for the determination of
population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in
Congress among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he
considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method
known as ``sampling'' in carrying out the provisions of this title.
...
</P>
<P>
   Defendants note that the 1976 amendments to section 195 altered
the call for non-apportionment use of statistical sampling methods
from ``may,'' which is an authorization, to ``shall,'' which is a
mandate. Defendants argue that an exception from a mandate is not a
prohibition in the area covered by the exception; instead,ea
covered by the exception is discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate defendants' interpretation of how this sentence
structure operates, consider the directive, ``Except for Mary, all
children at the party shall be served cake.'' That all children
other than Mary must be served cake is beyond dispute. However,
that mandate does not affirmatively prohibit the host from serving
cake to Mary. The decision as to whether to serve cake to Mary is,
by defendants' understanding of the instruction, a matter left to
the host's discretion. Applthe instant case, defendants
claim that with respect to apportionment, current section 195
commits the decision to use sampling to the discretion of the
Secretary. ...
</P>
<P>
   Though defendants' interpretation of the except/shall sentence
structure is proper in some instances, the court finds it to be
strained and incorrect when applied to amended section 195. ... In
the party hypothetical, one would expect that the person who issued
the directive ``except for Mary, all children at the party shall be
served cake'' would be quite surprised to learn that Mary had been
served cake. ...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider the directive ``except for my grandmother's wedding
dress, you shall take the contents of my closet to the cleaners.''
It is far more likely that the granddaughter would be upset if the
recipient of her directive were to take the wedding dress to the
cleaners and subsequently argue that she had left this decision to
his discretion. The reason for this result, as contrasted with the
cake example, is because of our background knowledge concerning
wedding dresses: We know that they are extraordinarily fragile and
of deep sentimental value to family members. We therefore would not
expect that the decision to take a dress to the cleaners would be
purely discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   The apportionment of Congressional representatives among the
states is the wedding dress in the closet. ... The apportionment
function is, after all, the ``sole constitutional purpose of the
decennial enumeration.'' The manner in which it is conducted may
impact not only the distribution of representatives among the
states, but also the balance of political power within the House.
And, the apportionment has a direct effect upon the Presidency as
well, as the number of electors in the electoral college is ``equal
to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the
State may be entitled in the Congress.'' That the Congressional
apportionment function merits particularized treatment is best
demonstrated by the fact that when Congress first authorized the
use of sampling in 1957, that function was expressly excepted.
Having been completely explicit then, it is hard to believe that
Congress decided to rely upon subtle shifts in language to direct
the opposite in 1976. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the court agrees with plaintiff's assertion that
``[d)efendants' argument that Congress eliminated a 200-year-old
prohibition against the use of statistical estimation techniques in
the constitutional census by way of a permissive negative inference
from an exception to a statutory mandate is wholly implausible.''
...
</P>
<P>
   It is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that
dramatic departures from past practices should not be read into
statutes without a definitive signal from Congress. ... Perhaps the
most eloquent statement of this concept comes from then-Justice
Rehnquist, writing in dissent in Harrison v. PPG Industries, ``In a
case where the construction of legislative language such as this
makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that
made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into
consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night.''
(quoted in Chisom) Despite defendants' characterization of the
force of the legislative history, and the characterization of at
least one reviewing court, the court finds no indication that the
watchdog barked in the night. ...
</P>
<P>
   Congress was issuing a much stronger directive to the Department
of Commerce to employ sampling methodologies in most aspects of its
Title 13 data gathering responsibilities. However, Congress's
explicit directive again includes that ubiquitous qualifier _
``except in the apportionment of the U.S. House of
Representatives.'' The inclusion of this ``except'' language must
be read to mean that one area was affirmatively carved out from the
general desire to augment the use of sampling _ the area of the
Congressional apportionment enumeration. The second sentence of the
excerpted language is even more damaging to defendants' argument,
as it states that the only difference between the old and the new
section 195 is a reduction in the Secretary's discretion to use
sampling, not a categorical creation of discretion in an area in
which he previously had none.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the legislature's bark is all the more compelling
when one considers what the watchdog is guarding. ... The House of
Representatives' apparent lack of interest in a statutory
modification that goes to the fundamental matter of its composition
cannot be ignored by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this court agrees with plaintiff's contention that
``[i)t borders on the absurd that Congress would enact such a
momentous change in such an oblique fashion.'' Had Congress wished
to authorize sampling techniques employed in the apportionment
enumeration, it could have done so quite simply by either: a)
deleting the ``except'' clause in its entirety; or, b) modifying
the clause so as to affirmatively declare what defendants claim to
be true by implication; that the Secretary may, in the exercise of
his discretion, use sampling techniques to supplement the inital
headcount enumeration to determine population for apportionment.
Because of the straightforward means available to Congress to
accomplish its purported goal, this court declines to ascribe to
Congress the ``surprisingly indirect route'' that defendants
advance. Section 141(a) of the Census Act
</P>
<P>
   Whatever strength there is to the claim that using statistical
sampling in the apportionment enumeration does not violate the
Census Act comes from the fact that section 195 must be read
together with the other provision addressing sampling
methodologies: section 141(a). Prior to 1976, section 141(a) did
not address sampling procedures. The post-1976 version states, in
relevant part: The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10
years thereafter, take a decennial census of population ... in such
form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling
procedures and special surveys (emphasis added).
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that section 141(a), which standing alone appears
to permit statistical sampling in Congressional apportionment, and
section 195, which indisputably proscribes the same, conflict, the
rules of statutory construction dictate the resolution. The more
specific provision controls the general. ...
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, while 141 permits sampling techniques and surveys
in the conduct of the decennial census, that general grant is
subject to the more specific ``Use of Sampling'' directive in 195,
which, as explained above, explicitly proscribes the use of
sampling for apportioning representatives among the states. ...
</P>
<P>
   Reading section 141(a) and section 195 together, and considering
the plain text, legislative history and other tools of statutory
construction, this court finds that the use of statistical sampling
to determine the population for purposes of the apportionment of
representatives in Congress among the states violates the Census
Act. ...
</P>
<P>
   Because this court finds that the Census Act prohibits the use
of statistical sampling to determine the population for the purpose
of apportionment of representatives among the states, there is no
need to reach the constitutional questions presented. &QL;

DEATH-DEALNG STORMS AWESOME IN DESTRUCTIVENESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Core rains.'' It's a meteorological term worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
   When things go wrong weatherwise, as they did this weekend at
Del Rio on the Rio Grande, they can become death-dealing storm
systems awesome in their destructiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the daytime they may cover an area of 15 counties,''
explained Larry Eblen a meteorologist at the National Weather
Service's San Antonio-area office. At night, as temperatures drop,
``They collapse and intensify _ maybe they cover three or four
counties. They collapse just like a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a storm, the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley, which
smashed into the Texas Coast at Aransas Pass last week, dropped a
year's worth of rainfall _ about 18 inches _ near Del Rio between
Saturday night and Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The result was catastrophic. At 4:10 a.m. Monday, when the flood
gauge washed away, the Rio Grande was at 15.5 feet. Normally dry
creeks like the Devil's and Dry Devil's became raging torrents. The
flood claimed at least 17 lives in Del Rio, Ciudad Acuna across the
Mexican border and nearby Real and Uvalde counties. At least 20
other people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's forecast: a 70 percent chance of more rain.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Uvalde County, midway between San Antonio and Del Rio,
received about 7 inches of rain Saturday evening. A week earlier,
the area had received about 12 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturated?'' Eblen said. ``Extremely so.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 flood warnings have been issued since Saturday
evening for parts of Southwest Texas, Eblen said.
</P>
<P>
   Val Verde County, of which Del Rio is the county seat, is not
particularly prone to flooding, Eblen noted, as the area rarely
gets enough rain to flood. San Felipe Creek, which provides the
city's water, is one of the few area waterways running year-round.
Val Verde normally gets about 1 1/2 inches of rain in August.
</P>
<P>
   But, Eblen said, when the area does flood, the result can be
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creeks that basically had no water flood rapidly,'' the
meteorologist said. ``They're very flashy. They come out of the
banks. Our main concern is the low-water crossings, trying to keep
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   While rainfall continued Monday, its intensity was diminishing.
Nonetheless, authorities were concerned about flooding on the Rio
Grande downstream in Eagle Pass. The river was expected to reach 38
feet, 22 feet above flood stage Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our second concern is that the system is beginning to move
back to the east,'' Eblen said. ``That means the Uvalde County area
is about to experience its third major rain event.''

YELTSIN GOVERNMENT PROMISES TO SHARE POWER WITH COMMUNISTS IN
PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 1st and 2nd grafs for recasting) (See also: RUSSIA-VOICES, RUSSIA-POWER, RUSSIA-U.S.,

(sw) 
 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One day after he dismissed his prime minister,
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia signaled a new approach to
governing on Monday by giving a greater voice to the Communist-led
forces in Parliament that have sought to frustrate economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The new power-sharing arrangement is intended to build support
for Yeltsin's new choice for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   But the move raised fresh questions about whether the Kremlin is
retreating from the urgent economic reforms demanded by
Chernomyrdin's predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, who was ousted over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia in the grips of an economic crisis and the nation
still reeling from yet another government shakeup, Yeltsin's new
strategy for extricating the nation from its economic crisis
remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   There were no details about new economic policies. Chernomyrdin
said he would not even announce his new cabinet until his
appointment was approved by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of the Kremlin's message seemed clear. Under
Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister who enjoys good political
relations across the political spectrum, the Russian government
would be more receptive to appeals by the Communist opposition and
more solicitous of the demands of Russia's powerful bankers and
financiers.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 year-old Kiriyenko used to sermonize about the need for
Russians to tighten their belts. Had he continued in office,
Kiriyenko planned to press this week for the Parliament's approval
of an unpopular package of measures to reduce the looming budget
deficit and bring order to the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, however, is not talking about ramming a demanding
reform program through a recalcitrant Parliament. Instead, the
Kremlin's emphasis Monday was on giving the Parliament and other
influential groups more of a voice over the Kremlin's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Aleksandr Shokhin, a key Chernomyrdin aide, put it on
Monday, the aim is to form a new government, ``backed by the
majority of political forces in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said that
Chernomyrdin would support the general effort to develop Russia's
version of capitalism. added pointedly that under
Chernomyrdin ``we should expect serious changes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no way Chernomyrdin can wish away Russia's
mountain of troubles. Russia's banks remain on the brink of
insolvency. Moscow has yet to announce a plan to restructure its
short-term debt. Its currency may continue to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also major constraints on Chernomyrdin's freedom of
maneuver because there is simply not enough money to go around.
Russia needs to slash spending to shrink the federal budget
deficit. And Chernomyrdin conceded on Monday that the government
did not have enough funds to bail out all of its troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
   But some free-market proponents expressed concern that
Chernomyrdin would still yield too easily to the tycoons, such as
Boris Berezovsky, who helped engineer his return to power.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, the senior Kremlin aide and former governor of
Nizhny Novgorod, said on Monday that he would not serve in a
Chernomyrdin government because he had concluded the Chernomyrdin
lacked the will to challenge powerful financiers and monopolists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are not likely to be solved in the Chernmyrdin
government,'' Nemtsov said. ``And since this is the situation there
is no point for me to work in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some investors seem to have concluded as much. Shares
in Gazprom, Russie natural gas monopoly, rose almost 20
percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Yeltsin government six years ago,
Chernomyrdin served as the head of the gas giant. And many
investors believe the oil and gas companies will now be treated
more leniently. In contrast, Kiriyenko had sought to squeeze the
energy sector for back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin aggressively courted the Parliament before his
recent return to power and continued to do so on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage Parliamentary approval of Chernomyrdin's
appointment as prime minister, the Kremlin announced on Monday that
a new commission would be consist of Yeltsin government aides and
members of the upper and lower houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the panel would be ``to develop an anti-crisis
program'' and perhaps discuss appointments to the new government,
Yastrzhembsky said. Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin had discussed
the arrangement on Monday with Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist
speaker of the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commission ``will become a very important
institution in our political and social life. It will scrutinize
the main content of our anti-crisis program. Different views will
clash at its meetings, different versions of this anti-crisis
program will be proposed. These battles will produce the contours
of the future anti-crisis program.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision led the Communists to boast they had won a seat at
the table in a new ``coalition government.'' It is too soon to tell
if the weakened Kremlin will actually cede substantial power to the
Communists and other opposition groups. The newspaper Izvestia,
however, speculated on Monday night that the Communists would gain
some key posts and that the government would back away from some
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can expect that some of the urgently needed anti-crisis
measures will not be enacted,'' Izevestia said.

SWEEPSTAKES IN AGREEMENT TO REIMBURSE NEW YORKERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Conn., N.Y., W.Va., Ind.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mailing sent out by American Family Publishers
early this year for a multimillion-dollar sweepstakes carried an
eye-catching inducement. ``It's down to a two-person race for
$11,000,000,'' the promotion said. ``You and one other person in
New York were issued the winning number ... whoever returns it
first wins it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the advertisement violated New York state's consumer
protection laws, Attorney General Dennis Vacco announced Monday
that he had reached a settlement of more than $800,000 with
American Family Publishers, based in Tampa, Fla. The settlement
includes a $60 rebate for 12,000 consumers who bought seven or more
magazine subscriptions from American Family.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that they received more than 300 complaints
regarding the company, which features the television personalities
Ed McMahon and Dick Clark in its advertising. ``In the future they
will stop telling consumers that they have won a prize,'' Vacco
said at a news conference in Manhattan, referring to American
Family. ``Or that they are part of a select group with a better
chance of winning unless that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said an independent accounting firm using
records from American Family Publishing will identify who is
eligible for the $60 refund, to be mailed at the end of September,
and New Yorkers do not need to apply for it. They said a New York
resident must have bought six or more magazine subscriptions from
American Family Publishing between November 1996 and November 1997.
They must also have purchased at least one new subscription in
December 1997 or January 1998, whenthe ``two-person race'' mailing
went out.
</P>
<P>
   The New York settlement is the latest in a series of legal
battles entangling the company and the first to include a rebate.
In March, 32 states and the District of Columbia reached a joint
settlement with American Family Publishers, which is owned jointly
by a unit of Time Inc. and an investment group associated with the
Pritzker family of Chicago. To settle that case, the company paid
$50,000 to each state and agreed to stop telling people they were
winners unless they had actually won. It also agreed to state in
the mailings that it was not necessary to buy subscriptions to win
the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said American Family had admitted no wrongdoing in
reaching the settlement with New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Andrus, a spokesman for American Family Publishing, said
the company sends out more than 200 million pieces of mail each
year. He said that the mailings do not mislead people into thinking
that they have won the sweepstakes, or into thinking that buying
subscriptions will increase their chances of winning. ``We do try
to have people understand exactly what our promotions entail,'' he
said. ``We make it very clear that a person is not required to buy
subscriptions to enter our sweepstakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four states, West Virginia, Connecticut, Indiana and Florida,
are pressing suits against American Family Publishers. Clark and
McMahon are also being sued by these states, and the company also
faces at least 26 class-action civil suits and 11 lawsuits brought
by people seeking millions in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Until March, New York was one of the nearly three dozen states
negotiating a group settlement with the company. But Vacco said
that when he saw the final terms of the agreement, he felt a better
settlement was possible and withdrew.

 JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M.: trophy ranches.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local county zoning allows for houses to be built on lots here
as small as three quarters of an acre. With demand growing from New
Mexico's city dwellers for second homes in the mountains, the
threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile homes with skirts around them _ that's the specter
now,'' said Dave Simon, regional director of the National Parks and
Conservation Association, a Washington-based group. As he bounced
in a van along a ranch road, he added: ``There is constant
pressures on ranchers up here to develop. The best places up here
would be cherrypicked for development.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of development has caused many conservationists to
rally behind the new bipartisan efforts to preserve the area.
However, environmentalists and the Clinton administration insist
that any board be charged with placing conservation values over
economic values in running the ranch as a park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resource values of this property must come first,'' Katie
McGinty, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality, said in a statement after visiting the ranch in July.
``The trustees may not sacrifice those values in an effort to make
the property financially self sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   While staffers for Republican and Democratic congressmen work to
hammer out mutually acceptable legislative language by Labor Day,
negotiations are spurred by the thought of the Baca being sold to
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to see it divided up and sold off,'' said Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and a longtime advocate of public ownership
of the Baca. ``I think prospects are good that we can go ahead when
Congress reconvenes.''

   ATLANTA _ Surfers rejoiced Monday while anxious coastal
residents from Florida to Virginia kept a wary eye on Hurricane
Bonnie, a sluggish but powerful Atlantic storm that is confounding
forecasters with a wobbling track toward the southeastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., the National Weather Service declared a hurricane
watch from Savannah, Ga., to the border between North Carolina and
Virginia, meaning that hurricane conditions were possible anywhere
along that 450-mile stretch within the next 36 hours. But because
the hurricane was moving so slowly _ about 6 miles per hour in a
generally northwestern direction _ hurricane trackers had great
difficulty predicting where, when, or even if the storm would come
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel terrible because we know we've got all these people
hanging on and we're not being able to be very definitive for
them,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. ``And there's no quick end in sight. It may be
Wednesday before we get a landfall, or even later if it doesn't
start moving a little faster.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening, the hurricane was sliding past the
northeastern side of the Bahamas. The center of the 400-mile-wide
storm was about 615 miles southeast of Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum winds reached 115 miles per hour, placing the storm
within Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. By
comparison, Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in
1992, carried winds of 145 miles per hour, while Hurricane Hugo,
which struck Charleston, S.C., in 1989, had sustained winds of 135
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said that Hurricane Bonnie's size and strength ``makes
this hurricane a potential disaster sitting out there waiting to
fall on somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Eastern Seaboard, emergency management teams began to
dust off plans for evacuating barrier islands and for housing
people with nowhere to go. In South Carolina, which harbors painful
memories of Hugo, Gov. David Beasley placed 1,000 members of the
National Guard on alert and asked them to move to their armories.
</P>
<P>
   But in most places, sunny skies and light winds provided at
least a temporary sense of reassurance, if not complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers enjoyed a day blessed with 6-foot waves, with some
skipping their first day of school and braving swells well after
nightfall. On Hilton Head Island, S.C., Nanci Polk-Weckhorst, the
owner of Nan-Seas Custom Canvas and Surf Shop, found herself torn
between the heightened demand for surfboards and her own desire to
ride the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is we all want to be out surfing so the shop's
been closed a lot of the time,'' Ms. Polk-Weckhorst said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Buxton, N.C., on Hatteras Island, John R. Hooper, the owner
of the Lighthouse View Motel, said that surfers ``are having a
blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Powerful riptides, possibly generated by the hurricane's
offshore winds, were blamed for the drowning deaths on Sunday of a
24-year-old man in Delaware and a 25-year-old man in South
Carolina. Some 100 people were rescued from the dangerous surf in
Atlantic City on Sunday, and 30 were saved in Carolina Beach, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlantic City Monday, as elsewhere along the coast,
lifeguards restricted bathers to waist-deep water and few swimmers
found themselves in trouble, said Robert Levy, that city's beach
patrol director.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hurricane's path was so uncertain, relatively few
coastal property owners were taking protective measures like
boarding and taping windows. Nancy Y. Peacock, a closet designer in
Neptune Beach, Fla., near Jacksonville, spent $300 on 20 sheets of
plywood, but left them piled in her driveway for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``t usually have hurricanes in Jacksonville,'' Ms.
Peacock said. ``But I thought, as an added good luck charm, if we
buy all this stuff it will certainly not hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said his current forecast called for the hurricane to
land on the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Wednesday or Thursday.
But he said he had ``low confidence'' in that prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is the hurricane's lethargic pace makes it
susceptible to relatively minor atmospheric forces. ``If you think
about a ball that's moving very fast, it's harder to change its
direction or to stop it,'' he said. ``But if it's moving very
slowly, it's fairly easy to change its direction or stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it moves sharp, closer to west, then it goes into north
Florida,'' Jarrell said. ``If it moves almost straight north, it
goes into the Outer Banks. That's a horribly wide zone to be
talking about, but unfortunately that's sort of where we are at the
moment.''

LBO FIRM BETS ON OIL INDUSTRY COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Okla., Texas)  (js) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, venturing onto a field
already littered with investor casualties, announced a $250 million
bet Monday that the oil business is ready for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse, a leveraged buyout firm based here, agreed to pay
$6 a share, in cash, for 62 percent of Coho Energy, an oil
exploration and production company with properties mostly in
Mississippi and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal itself is modest, Hicks, Muse says it plans to
use Coho and its managers as a platform to buy other companies that
find, produce, process and transport oil. Hicks, Muse is also
looking over oilfield services companies and properties that
companies want to unload.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse, which usually borrows more than it invests,
signaled its seriousness by making its Coho purchase entirely from
its own funds. For Coho, the deal amounts to a private offering of
additional shares, to Hicks, Muse, that will give it the
wherewithal for a shopping spree in an uncrowded market.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hicks, Hicks, Muse chairman, said his firm planned to
continue buying in the next six to 18 months, then realize the
gains over five or seven years as oil prices return from the
current $13-a-barrel range to the $18 he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the most attractive time we've seen to invest in oil
and gas in the last 10 or 15 years,'' Hicks said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   As oil prices have collapsed, so have shares of Coho and most
others in the industry. Coho, having traded as high as $13 last
fall, closed at $4.6875 on Friday. After news of the Hicks, Muse
investment, they rebounded to $5.4375 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the 28 percent premium over Friday's closing
price that Hicks, Muse is paying a sensible long-term proposition.
Coho will have the money to become a consolidator among
medium-sized oil companies that might be pressed to raise cash by
selling some or all of their holdings, said C. Van Levy, an analyst
at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``Provided these quality properties hit the
market, I think it's a good move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the investors who had already jumped in before the shares
hit bottom are the Hicks, Muse partners themselves. In May, they
personally bought 2.2 million Coho shares at nearly $7 a share.
Jack Furst, one of those partners, said that Monday's investment
might also be early, but that the firm needed to establish a
foundation for further acquisitions now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Hicks, Coho represents a cautious return to a sector he last
invested in about two decades ago, only to face the 1980s oil price
crash. He learned that oil is too risky for companies to bear heavy
debt.
</P>
<P>
   One of the energy industry's best-known outside investors this
time around has been Richard Rainwater of Fort Worth. Though not
familiar with the Coho particulars, Rainwater praised the Hicks,
Muse strategy. He, too, is hunting for oil-industry acquisitions,
having already bought some shares and some oil futures. In a
television interview a year ago, he said that he would relish the
prospect of $12 to $13 energy prices if it created opportunities.
``Now what's happened is people like Hicks, Muse who are pretty
smart investors are taking advantage of it,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rainwater's energy companies have fallen in recent
months, he still has substantial long-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainwater case for higher oil prices is based on growing
global demand _ which has been slowed by Asia's economic turmoil _
and limited resources. In the Hicks, Muse outlook, low prices will
force oil production cutbacks, especially in the United States,
with rising demand then likewise leading to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Coho Energy, named after the salmon to reflect its Canadian
roots, operates primarily in Oklahoma, where it spent $250 million
for Amoco's properties last year, and in Mississippi. The declining
value of other holdings has forced it to take large write-offs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Coho itself has grown through acquisitions, then proving that
the acquired properties had far more oil than the sellers thought.
Jeffrey Clarke, the company's chief executive, applauded Hicks,
Muse's timing. ``Most people get into this industry at the top,''
he said. ``These guys have gotten in at the bottom, or as close to
the bottom as you're ever going to see.'' &QL;

MCGWIRE'S QUEST PUT ON HOLD FOR A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL MODOONO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Mark McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris'
single-season home run record went on vacation Monday, as McGwire
was rested by Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. But, as luck would
have it, the game between St. Louis and Pittsburgh was rained out
with the score tied at 5-5 in the bottom of the seventh. Since the
Pirates and the Cardinals will meet again in St. Louis for three
games beginning Sept. 14, the game will be replayed in its entirety
as part of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, McGwire did not lose any ground in his quest to get
to 62. Instead, he got to sit in the dugout and rest and listen to
the chorus of boos that serenaded John Mabry, his backup at first,
each time Mabry went to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame the fans,'' Mabry said of the 28,435 who showed
up on a rainy afternoon at Three Rivers Stadium. ``They wanted to
see Mark hit. It's like paying to see Elvis and getting a garage
band instead.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McGwire, who has 53 home runs, did not seem
thrilled by the prospect of an extra game, even if it may give him
one extra shot at catching Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the ridiculous rules of Major League Baseball,''
he said minutes after the game ended. ``Why do the stats count and
they still play it over? Why does it have to begin again in the
first inning?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in New York, McGwire sat out one game during
back-to-back doubleheaders against the Mets. La Russa said Monday
that he would ``play it by ear'' on whether McGwire would sit out
any more games the rest of the way, including either game of the
newly scheduled doubleheader. One factor La Russa will weigh is
that the Cardinals already have three off days scheduled in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how his body feels, and what type of game he'd
be playing,'' said La Russa, who has rested McGwire five games this
season and seen the slugger sit out three other games with minor
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while you have to give him a chance to catch his
breath,'' La Russa added. ``But if you take care of a player for
the first four and a half months of a season, he should have enough
gas in the tank for September.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, La Russa said that if he did rest McGwire again,
he would not subject Mabry to another round of catcalls. Mabry has
been booed in Milwaukee, New York and Pittsburgh while performing
in his understudy role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee you I'll play Willie McGee at first,'' La Russa
said. ``And if you boo him, you get ejected from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh fans had no chance to see any of McGwire's show
Monday. An early morning rain canceled batting practice (McGwire
was expected to participate), and the seventh-inning downpour kept
La Russa from using him as a pinch-hitter. McGwire's only on-field
appearance was to pose for a picture with the former Pirate stars
Dave Parker and Willie Stargell.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that McGwire was the sole attraction. The
Pirates' public relations director, Jim Tridinich, even fielded
some hostile phone calls from fans who had bought tickets in
advance only to learn Sunday that McGwire would not play. La Russa
and McGwire had planned the day off weeks earlier, but only made
their decision public on Sunday. Tridinich was chastised by one
irate caller who said he ``didn't do his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paying $50 to see Kevin Polcovich,'' Tridinich said
the fan told him, referring to the Pirates' reserve shortstop who
is hitting .189.
</P>
<P>
   On his day off, McGwire spent much of his time before the game
talking on his cell phone. He did agree to a request to sign a
baseball from a young fan who had caught one of his weekend homers.
McGwire refuses to sign the actual home run balls, but he did give
the youngster his signature on another ball.

CONFUSING DAY FOR METS RESULTS IN DISAPPOINTING CALLS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most crucial sequence of Monday's game between
the New York Mets and the Arizona Diamondbacks was also the most
confusing sequence, leading Manager Bobby Valentine to complain to
the umpires and get ejected and leaving the Mets looking dazed.
Then the listless game turned brutally disappointing for the Mets
because Mel Rojas made an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were sleepwalking to their second straight loss to an
expansion team, which was depressing enough for them. But the
events that unfolded in the eighth and ninth innings of their 9-5
defeat at Shea Stadium stood out as prominently as Mark McGwire
bashing baseballs during batting practice. On a high school field.
</P>
<P>
   The dreary loss left Valentine offering a critique of the
umpires as he quoted from the rule book on his desk, Rojas cursing
himself for giving up five runs for the second time in four days
and the weary Mets clinging to a one-game lead over the Chicago
Cubs in the National League wild-card race as they flew to the West
Coast for nine games in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about it because it's nobody's fault but my
own,'' Rojas said. ``It's frustrating. We scored five runs and we
could have won. What can I say about what I did? It's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the way to perform in a wild-card skirmish,
especially against an Arizona team that could win its next 30 games
and still be two games under .500. Even Valentine, who preaches
optimism with every sentence, called the day ``pretty
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, it will be forgotten,'' Valentine said. ``Today,
it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets' starter Masato Yoshii (5-7) yielded four runs in six
innings, with Jay Bell doing the most damage. Bell hit a two-run
homer, a run-scoring triple and a double off Yoshii; he failed to
complete the cycle with a single as he struck out in the seventh
and walked in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had a 4-1 lead in the bottom of the eighth when the Mets
put runners on first and second. But they saw the threat vanish
when Brian McRae was called out on a controversial 3-2 pitch and
John Olerud was thrown out trying to steal second. The plate
umpire, Greg Bonin, initially ruled that McRae had checked his
swing on Willie Banks' curveball for ball four, which would have
loaded the bases and made catcher Kelly Stinnett's throw to second
meaningless. But the third-base umpire, Bill Hohn, stepped forward
and signaled strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine argued that Bonin, who had held up four fingers for a
walk, had to ask for help from another umpire to change his call
and that hld not be volunteered, as it was in this case. In
fact, Rule 9.02 (c) of the Major League Baseball rule book states
that ``no umpire shall criticize, seek to reverse or interfere with
another umpire's decision unless asked to do so by the umpire
making it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, with the runners going, Stinnett threw first and
then appealed to Hohn at third. And at that point, Hohn made his
call, without waiting for Bonin. Replays indicated that McRae did
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was ejected the moment he left the dugout because,
Bonin told him, he could not argue balls and strikes. Again,
Valentine claimed the umpires were wrong, saying that he is
supposed to receive a warning. A person working in the umpire's
room after the game said none were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was an overzealous decision on his part,'' said
Valentine. ``Whether it was right or wrong on the swing, it wasn't
the proper call.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Valentine did not have to witness what happened next.
He watched on television as Rojas started the ninth and was whacked
for five runs on a wild pitch, Matt Williams' massive three-run
homer and Stinnett's bases-empty shot. Suddenly the score was 9-1.
The fans buried Rojas in boos.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally awakened in the ninth and clipped Banks for
four runs to slice the deficit to 9-5 and make the afternoon
interesting. It made it frustrating, too.
