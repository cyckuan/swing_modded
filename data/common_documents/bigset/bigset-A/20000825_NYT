MEXICO COURT MAKES HISTORY BY SIDING WITH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS reason for dismissing justices in 7th graf)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a ruling that justices described as a judicial
watershed, the Mexican Supreme Court ordered President Ernesto
Zedillo Thursday to turn over to Congress secret banking data
relating to questionable financing of Zedillo's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the first in modern history in which the court,
the weak sister in Mexico's system of government, has ruled in a
constitutional dispute between two competing federal powers. The
court's decision to uphold a congressional challenge to
presidential powers marked a clear declaration of independence by
the court from the all-powerful executive branch, which has
dominated the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a suit filed by opposition lawmakers last year, the
court found that Congress had every right to demand full disclosure
by Zedillo's government about the dealings of Banco Union, a bank
that oversaw millions of dollars in donations to the president's
1994 campaign even as it was sliding into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Zedillo later intervened in Banco Union's case, turning
its liabilities into public debt and arguing that bank secrecy laws
barred any public accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, the court gave Zedillo 30 days to turn
over to Congress a series of files from Banco Union. The court's 11
justices endorsed the order unanimously. In a statement hours
later, Zedillo's office pledged to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a profoundly historic decision,'' Olga
Sanchez Cordero, the justice who presided over the previous
deliberations in the constitutional challenge, said at a news
conference. She said it marked the first time the high court had
refereed a dispute between two branches of the federal government,
and also because it limited bank secrecy laws here by stipulating
that they may not be used to shield potentially illegal
transactions in which taxpayers must pay for the reckless
management of private assets.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, its judicial
system has been hobbled by frequent presidential interference, and
three presidents in this century have simply dismissed the entire
high court. One was Zedillo himself, who in his first month in
office dismissed all 26 justices, installing the new 11-member
court as part of a judicial reform that he says has strengthened
the court's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the justices elected a new chief justice, Genaro
Gongora Pimentel, who has championed initiatives aimed at
increasing the judiciary's power and independence. Under his
influence, the court's powers to broker constitutional challenges
have been growing.
</P>
<P>
   It has ruled in constitutional disputes between two cities,
between cities and states, between states and the federal congress.
But it had never ruled in a dispute pitting the congress against
the presidency, Sanchez said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes eight weeks after Zedillo's governing party
suffered its first defeat in seven decades of presidential voting,
and some analysts suggested that the July 2 election of an
opposition candidate, Vicente Fox, had strengthened the court's
willingness to rule against Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Zedillo said he had already ordered the
treasury secretary and the president of the National Banking
Commission to turn over the Banco Union files requested by
Congress.

DEMOCRAT TO VOTE TO OVERRIDE VETO OF MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY AND STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. Dennis Moore, a Kansas Democrat, said
Thursday he would vote to override President Clinton's veto of a
bill to reduce higher taxes people often pay when they get married.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, in a tough re-election fight, has been an outspoken
supporter of the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act, which Congress
passed in July and Clinton vetoed on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminating the marriage penalty not only provides much-needed
tax relief, but it also makes the tax system more fair,'' Moore
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is running against Republican Phill Kline to hold his seat
in the House in a district that had elected Republicans for 40
years until Moore won in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kline said Thursday that he also would vote to override the
president's veto. In addition, he said Moore on three other
occasions voted against ending the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis continues to dance the Potomac two-step in an effort to
deceive the voters of Kansas,'' Kline said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore shot back that he voted three times to eliminate the
tax. Two of his dissenting votes, an aide said, were because the
tax cut was part of a $792 billion package that Moore disliked
because it would have eaten up too much of the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I voted for marriage penalty tax
elimination three times, and I guess I'm having trouble
understanding why Phill Kline is complaining about that,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the average annual tax savings under the bill would be
$500 per couple and that it would affect 42 million Americans and
nearly 67,000 people from his 3rd Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the bill ``poorly targeted, costly and
regressive'' and one that could cost more than $280 billion over 10
years. He said it would undermine efforts to revamp Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats such as Moore and Reps. Pat Danner and Ike
Skelton of Missouri voted for it. Spokesmen for Danner and Skelton
said Thursday they were uncertain if the lawmakers would vote to
override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Karen McCarthy, a Democrat from Missouri, voted against the
bill. She was unavailable for comment on how she would vote on the
override.

SUGAR'S ON TOP OF L.A.'S BOXING CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shane Mosley, Fernando Vargas and Oscar De La Hoya
_ with unusual God-given ability, fighting spirit, charisma and
success _ have made Los Angeles the first city of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the three rank among the 10 greatest fighters in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   However, who's the best of the bunch, the Ace Angeleno, the King
of Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News asked three well-known and respected trainers _
Teddy Atlas, Joe Goossen and Emanuel Steward _ to answer that
question and provide their reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict? Mosley is the man, although it was no knockout
punch. He received two votes (Atlas and Goossen), Vargas one
(Steward) and De La Hoya none.
</P>
<P>
   This is the consensus:
</P>
<P>
   Mosley (35-0, with 32 knockouts) was a very successful
lightweight champion and moved up to welterweight to take De La
Hoya's title. He's proven himself over an eight-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas (19-0, 17 KOs) _ who defends his IBF junior middleweight
title against Ross Thompson on Saturday in Las Vegas _ also is
unbeaten but at 22 doesn't have the track record.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (32-2, 26 KOs) has the most impressive list of
victories and is the best marketed of the three but has lost his
last two big fights, to Felix Trinidad and Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the thoughts of the trainers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ATLAS
</P>
<P>
   To Atlas, it comes down to this: Mosley, of Pomona, held the
lightweight title for two years _ a solid eight defenses _ and then
jumped over junior welterweight to welterweight and beat one of the
top fighters in the world, De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   He's as complete as any fighter in the world and he has proved
it in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He defended the lightweight title well,'' said Atlas, who also
is a television analyst on ESPN2. ``There was nobody great (in the
division) but he beat everybody. He showed he had the ability to be
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, to move up to another weight class and maintain those
skills and win another title against a fighter like De La Hoya says
a lot. He's ahead of Fernando in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlas was the most critical of Vargas of the three trainers.
</P>
<P>
   He likes what he sees so far _ a well-schooled, tough fighter
with unusual maturity in the ring and a victory over super-tough
Ike Quartey in April _ but he believes Vargas is still evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a victory over Trinidad (whom Vargas is tentatively
scheduled to fight Dec. 2) would speed up the evolution process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vargas has shown some versatility,'' Atlas said. ``He's
strong, he can box, he has good hand speed. And technically he's
improving. He used to be a guy who stood straight up, he caught
solid shots. He seems to be more aware of that now. I think he's
finding himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``... He hasn't accomplished that much yet. He'll have his
opportunities, though. A mega-fight against Trinidad would be very
big. I think it's a fight he can win. If he does, I think he's
right with Shane.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a year ago, De La Hoya was considered by many to
be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's difficult for Atlas and the other trainers to look
past the two defeats even though neither was one-sided. Most
observers believe De La Hoya beat Trinidad in September and he was
in the Mosley fight until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I'm not putting him second (ahead of Vargas)
are the two losses,'' Atlas said. ``You have to respect Vargas'
undefeated record, especially since he fought a substantial guy in
Quartey. He's a fighter on the upswing. De La Hoya is not a fighter
on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   ``... With all (De La Hoya) has (read: money, fame) it might be
tough for him at this point to change a few things he might have to
change unless it's a personal priority of his, unless he wants to
prove something to himself.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOOSSEN
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's victory over De La Hoya, combined with Vargas' youth,
made Goossen's decision easy.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, who runs a gym in Van Nuys, echoed the common
assessment of Mosley: ``He's got it all. He's great defensively,
great offensively. He'll outbang you, he'll outbox you. He was
outstanding at 135 pounds (lightweight), he still has power at 147
pounds (welterweight).''
</P>
<P>
   And he's a big fan of Vargas, who he believes might be the
``toughest'' fighter in the world and one of the most gifted in
terms of boxing skills. He's Goossen's kind of fighter: fearless.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's the prototypical fighter. I'd like to cut along
the dotted line and get about 10 of those guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he pointed out that De La Hoya is only a handful of
punches away from the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can chalk up his losses to a few minor adjustments he
didn't make,'' Goossen said. ``What separated him from victory
against Trinidad? A few dozen punches (late in the fight). Against
Mosley, he was fairly effective but didn't change his style when
the momentum shifted toward Mosley. He should've gone back to what
got him there, he should've boxed him (instead of stalking Mosley,
as he did throughout the fight).
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does these things, he's 2-0 instead of 0-2 and
everything is different. Is he an underachiever? I wouldn't say
that. I (ital)would(endital) say more could've been squeezed out of
him, enough to win those two fights.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
STEWARD
</P>
<P>
   Steward, who has trained De La Hoya among many world champions,
didn't hesitate when he was asked to name the top L.A. fighter:
Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that Vargas has a relative lack of experience
but gushed over the Oxnard fighter as if we were witnessing the
rise of one of the greatest fighters (ital)ever(endital).
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Vargas when his head is right,'' said Steward,
referring to the fighter's out-of-the-ring legal problems. ``I just
think he's a very balanced fighter and he's very, very patient for
such a young fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always in position to execute, to take advantage of his
opponent's mistakes. That's also very unusual for a young fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he loooooooves to fight. If he can control his outside
activities, if he doesn't self-destruct, I feel he's on his way to
becoming a great fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Where can Vargas improve?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't, really _ except in experience,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Steward likes Mosley. He likes his speed and his
skills but emphasized a less-tangible reason for his success: His
love of boxing. Mosley will beat you up and smile while he does it.
</P>
<P>
   However, Steward did find what some might say is a relative
flaw: Mosley's relative lack of punching power at 147 pounds, at
which he's fought only three times. He landed several extremely
hard punches to the jaw of De La Hoya but was unable to put him
down.
</P>
<P>
   That could change with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a big puncher yet,'' Steward said, ``but he has
enough qualities to make up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, I don't like what I've seen,'' Steward said. ``... He
was such a beautiful fighter. He could punch on his toes, had
upper-body movement. He was like a perfect machine. Now, he's more
flat-footed, one dimensional. Maybe these losses will stimulate him
again, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at his best, though, I'd have trouble rating him higher
than Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a debate that could rage on for years. &QL;

KANSAS TO PROMOTE STATE TOURISM THROUGH SPONSORED ATHLETIC EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Kansas Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer
participates in the coin toss for the Kansas State-Iowa football
game Saturday, it won't be just because he's rooting for the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   It's because Kansas state government sponsored the game, part of
a $100,000 project _ paid for with public funds _ to market Kansas
as a good place to visit and do business.
</P>
<P>
   Ads promoting Kansas tourism will appear on the telecast of the
game, at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City and in the game program
for the Eddie Robinson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kansas plans to bring in out-of-state consultants who help
companies choose new locations for plants and offices, show them
what the state can offer and then take them to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The state will pick up the travel and expense tab for the
consultants, who often take a central role in helping companies
decide where to move.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrer, the economic development czar for Kansas, said state
government hasn't undertaken this kind of venture before.
</P>
<P>
   But the state competes with 49 other states and needs to
aggressively tell its story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we're going to promote Kansas if we don't
invest some money.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sherrer said he can understand why some might
question the use of public funds for a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Such spending, however, isn't unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Eddie Robinson Classic was played in Indiana. The
Indiana Commerce Department sponsored the game, a way of touting
Indiana as a desirable spot for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the start of a larger marketing campaign,'' said Kevin
Waltman, department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   State officials consider the money well-spent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't receive much criticism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, money for the project won't come from tax revenue,
like income tax or sales tax funds. It will come from the proceeds
of the Kansas Lottery, which are used for many economic development
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsoring the game cost $84,000, state officials said. Expenses
for the consultants will run an estimated $20,000, they said.
Fifteen consultants are expected from out of state, along with
seven from the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants will tour the Sprint campus in Johnson County,
Kan., and the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know we can do big things in this state,''
Sherrer said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrer and the Commerce and Housing Department he runs have
faced questions in the Legislature about economic development.
Paying to sponsor the nationally televised football game on Fox
Sports Net may prompt more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff is beyond me,'' said State Sen. Ed Pugh, a
Republican from Wamego. ``I don't understand it. It doesn't make
sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said state law should be changed so proceeds from the
lottery would be channeled directly to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   According to calculations from the Commerce and Housing
Department, the state will receive considerable value for its
$84,000 game sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has been mentioned in 1,569 pregame radio and television
ads, exposure that would have cost $300,000 if the state paid for
each spot, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effect of increased visits to the state could be
millions of dollars, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   As the main sponsor of the game, Kansas paid the most of any
sponsor, said David Gardiner, senior vice president and general
manager of Dorna Sports Promotions, which is staging the contest.
The other sponsors, he said, range from a grocery store chain to a
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the sponsorships, along with other revenue from the
game, will go to the two participating schools to cover game
expenses, and to charitable causes at the Eddie Robinson
Foundation, named after the legendary college football coach.
</P>
<P>
   With Kansas State growing into a college football power,
sponsoring one of their games is smart, said State Rep. David
Adkins, a Leawood Republican who is the outgoing chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense has been, when it comes to marketing the state,
Kansas has been far behind our neighboring states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the state hasn't done nearly as much tourist
advertising as Missouri. Kansas spends about $900,000 a year, while
Missouri spends about $2 million on television advertising alone.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Driskill, director of the Missouri Economic Development
Department, said his state buys television ads in several states to
entice tourists, and periodically meets and entertains consultants
dealing in corporation relocations.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot recall his agency ever sponsoring a football game.
Until this week, he wasn't aware of the Kansas project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact,'' said Driskill, ``that they're coming to
Missouri to advertise Kansas.''

  THE POLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   A BOOST FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   New polls show Vice President Al Gore has enjoyed a significant
post-convention boost in four crucial big states, overtaking Gov.
George W. Bush in Minnesota and perhaps in Michigan and increasing
his lead in New Jersey and California. Ralph Nader, the Green Party
nominee, slipped in all four states.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, an EPIC-MRA poll showed Gore ahead of Bush by two
points. That lead was within the poll's margin of sampling error of
plus or minus four percentage points. In a pre-convention poll, he
trailed Bush by eight points.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, a Mason-Dixon poll gave Gore an eight-point lead
over Bush. A July Mason-Dixon Poll had Bush ahead of Gore by three
points.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, gave
Gore a 12-point lead. A New Jersey poll taken just before the
Republican convention had Gore ahead by only four points.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a Field Poll had Gore leading Bush by 13 points.
The previous Field Poll, in June, had him ahead by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   A BIG FUND-RAISING NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore pulled in more than $1.25 million
Wednesday night in a pair of fund-raising dinners in Washington for
the Democratic National Committee. The first dinner drew 30 people,
most of them Indian-Americans, who paid $5,000 each. With other
contributions, the dinner yielded $250,000. The host of the dinner
was Ramesh Kapur, owner of a medical technology firm in Winchester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The second dinner drew about 60 people, most of them friends of
Gore's running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, who also attended. They
each paid or raised varying amounts, with a maximum of $50,000, for
a total of $1 million. Both dinners were served at the Mayflower
Hotel, but the second was a Glatt Kosher meal, the pure form of
Kosher food, blessed by a rabbi and provided by a restaurant, Dahan
of Washington. Its host was Marvin Lender, who once ran his family
business, Lender's Bagels, and is now an executive with M&AMP;M
Industries, based in Woodbridge, Conn.

   On Dec. 9, 1995, Robbins entered a 2-year-old son of Cee's Tizzy
and Cee's Song in a $32,000 claiming race for maidens, and watched
the horse run a close second in an encouraging debut. Then Robbins
watched with surprise as the horse was led away to someone else's
barn, having been claimed by Dan Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   The horse was Budroyale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know how he got claimed,'' Robbins said this
week. ``That was Cee's Tizzy's first crop (of offspring), so it was
hard to judge how good a sire he was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Robbins' surprise when Budroyale went on to earn more
than $2 million in four-plus years of so-called overachievement
that included second-place finishes in the Breeders' Cup Classic,
Hollywood Gold Cup and Santa Anita Handicap for the father-and-son
training team of Ted and Ted H. West.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale's rags-to-riches story has been told so many times,
it's understandable if Robbins doesn't care to hear any more about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, someone
loses (a good) one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Robbins, though, the story may yet have a happy ending.
Saturday at Del Mar, the 54-year-old trainer will saddle 3-year-old
Tiznow, the 5-1 fourth choice on the morning line for the $1
million Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow is Budroyale's full brother _ a son of Cee's Tizzy and
Cee's Song, bred and co-owned by Cecilia Straub-Rubens, same as his
elder kin.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow is no Budroyale clone. Though both are listed as bay,
Robbins said, ``He's a different (darker) color, and he's much
bigger than Budroyale.''
</P>
<P>
   A full sister, 2-year-old Tizsweet, resides in the next stall in
Robbins' Del Mar barn. Tizsweet is gray.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow, to be ridden for the first time Saturday by Chris
McCarron, could turn out to be a racing rarity, a full sibling who
lives up to the family expectations.
</P>
<P>
   As the lone 3-year-old and least accomplished of the seven
horses entered in the 10th Pacific Classic, Tiznow might be
overlooked by handicappers focusing on 9-5 favorite General
Challenge (the defending champion), 5-2 second choice Skimming
(eight-length winner of the recent San Diego Handicap), and 7-2
third choice Ecton Park (the 1999 Louisiana Super Derby winner
shipping in from Saratoga).
</P>
<P>
   But hidden in Tiznow's record (5 starts, 2 wins, 2 seconds,
earnings of $225,550, all against horses of his age) is the
potential for an upset.
</P>
<P>
   First, consider that as a rule of thumb, 3-year-old
thoroughbreds are still maturing physically and mentally, so what
you see in the Daily Racing Form is not necessarily what you get.
</P>
<P>
   Next, remember the success of 3-year-olds in the Pacific
Classic. Four have run in the race, which is for 3-year-olds and
up. Two have won it _ Best Pal in 1991 and General Challenge in
1999 _ and another, Dramatic Gold, finished third in 1994. None of
them were favored.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, look at how Tiznow has improved since finishing sixth
in his debut in a Santa Anita sprint _ not a claiming race, as if
you had to ask _ in April. After breaking his maiden by 8{ lengths
at Hollywood Park in May, he edged Dixie Union to win the Affirmed
Handicap at 10-1 in July.
</P>
<P>
   Later in July, he ran second to Captain Steve in the Swaps
Stakes. He and jockey Victor Espinoza got boxed in on the turn for
home, trouble that might have cost Tiznow the 2{-length margin of
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Tiznow's trouble on Swaps day was self-inflicted. The
nervous colt sweated away precious energy in the saddling paddock.
But Robbins blames that on the fact he was training his horses at
Santa Anita and vanning them to Hollywood Park for their races.
Tiznow didn't have a chance to get familiar with the Hollywood Park
paddock.
</P>
<P>
   Because Robbins is training his horses at Del Mar this summer,
he has been able to school Tiznow in the paddock here. Robbins
doesn't expect another display of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow will carry 117 pounds, seven less than the older horses,
according to the Pacific Classic's weight-for-age format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going a mile and a quarter, I think seven pounds is pretty
meaningful,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that isn't why he entered Tiznow in Del Mar's
biggest race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought he's training really well down here,'' Robbins
said. ``It remains to be seen whether he can run with these older
horses. I think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then Tiznow can achieve something Saturday that Budroyale
never did. For all his success and popularity, and for all the
aggravation he caused his original trainer, Budroyale never won a
Grade I race or a million-dollar race.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCENE: Ecton Park arrived at Del Mar on Thursday and had
a two-mile gallop to get used to the track. All of the Pacific
Classic horses are now on the grounds. In post-position order, they
are: River Keen (Espinoza riding), General Challenge (Corey
Nakatani), Euchre (David Flores), Tiznow, Skimming (Garrett Gomez),
Ecton Park (Kent Desormeaux) and Forty One Carats (Eddie
Delahoussaye).
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic will be run as the eighth race at about 4:15
p.m. PDT on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12:30 p.m. PDT first post is 90 minutes earlier than usual.
Gates open at 9 a.m. PDT.
</P>
<P>
   Race coverage will start at 3:30 p.m. PDT on Fox Sports Net. &QL;

L.A. SCHOOLS BOSS LISTS SEVEN IMPROVEMENT AREAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kicking off the first year of the newly
reorganized Los Angeles Unified School District, Superintendent Roy
Romer unveiled a seven-point plan to improve schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a back-to-school pep rally, Romer spoke on Thursday to 1,800
principals, assistant principals and administrators at a hotel in
downtown Los Angeles. It was his first public address to district
staff since assuming office July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Romer's management plan calls for standards-based guidelines, an
assessment of those standards, more classroom materials, better
quality teaching, parental involvement, and more space and time for
teachers to help students learn.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor of Colorado laced his talk with folksy
analogies, declaring that teachers can improve their skills by
learning the lesson of corn farmers who help each other grow the
best corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became governor of Colorado, it was as sick
economically as it could get,'' he said. ``We turned that place
around. We had a state, at the end of 12 years, that was about the
top of the heap. It wasn't just the governor who did it. It was a
team of very talented people who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said teachers and principals need to work together to
improve education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all rowing oars on the boat,'' he said. ``And let me
tell you, LAUSD has a lot of people who want to torpedo the boat.
So everybody in the teaching corps and in the management corps
ought to proceed to say we've got to improve our performance or
we're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   To help accommodate an expected surge of 80,000 students by
2006, the district plans to break ground on nine new schools during
the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space is crucial,'' said Romer, who this week helped break
ground on the San Fernando Valley's first new elementary school in
29 years. ``We're going to build 65,000 spaces in the next five or
six years, but we're going to have a growth of enrollment of 80,000
students.''
</P>
<P>
   He also encouraged principals to use their authority to make
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a moral responsibility, if nothing else, to say, I've
got to manage to get the maximum impact on those kids having an
opportunity to learn,'' he said. ``This institution is not here for
the benefit of us adults.''
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer period afterward, Fernangeles
Elementary School Assistant Principal Charles Addcox asked what
Romer thought about a shortage of computers for students still
receiving bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Valley principal said students in Intensive Academic
Support classes, which provide remedial education, are receiving
computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our same IAS classes that have (Prop. 227) waiver-learners do
not get those computers and software.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said he wasn't familiar with the issue but would
investigate.

L.A. RESIDENTS SOUND OFF ON `SURVIVOR' OUTCOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Survivor'' winner Richard Hatch may be a
low-down scheming ``snake,'' but much of the talk around town
Thursday focused on trucker Susan Hawk's tirade during the TV
series' cliffhanging climax.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was vile and horrific,'' comedian Robert Lee, 43, said
outside a Woodland Hills coffee shop. ``She should be a truck
driver so she can be confined in a small space with no one else
around.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the wildly popular ``Survivor'' show concluded, the
chatter at water coolers, coffee shops and just about everywhere
else was focused on the castaways.
</P>
<P>
   People were dissecting the strategy of million-dollar winner
Richard and the power plays and double-crosses of the other
contestants _ among them Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Between breathless recounts of the highlights, Lee, Pierce
College freshman Stacey Lopez and others agreed that the CBS hit
series struck a chord with Americans by reflecting some
contemporary moral attitudes, especially winning at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard made no pretensions about playing the game as ruthlessly
as possible, forming an alliance with other cast members to
eliminate rival contestants with precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character at this point doesn't matter in America _ it only
matters if you get the job done and Rich did,'' Lee said, as his
friend Todd Shaffer cringed.
</P>
<P>
   The naked ambition exhibited on the show left him embarrassed,
Shaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought out the worst in people,'' said the 38-year-old
sales representative from Torrance. ``It was like a bad accident.
You just keep driving and hope everyone is OK but rubberneck to see
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was a nail-biting thriller in which an estimated
51 million viewers saw Richard beat rival Kelly Wiglesworth by a
single tie-breaking vote in a ``tribal council'' of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the people who ignored the weekly series or watched
little or none of the final episode knew Richard had a bad
reputation that was expected to cost him the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won?!!'' said Chris Ramsey, 42, of Pasadena, who favored
retired Navy SEAL Rudy Boesch, many people's odds-on favorite to
win. ``Secretly I figured (Richard) would win just because the
world seems to be backwards these days. His values accurately
characterized our society _ ingenuousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludivine Poirier, a French native living in Woodland Hills,
could barely contain her contempt for Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was really happy this mean woman was out of the
picture _ we hated her,'' Poirier, 25, said outside the coffee shop
along Ventura Boulevard. ``When I came here it was the first thing
everyone wanted to know: Did you watch `Survivor' last night?''
</P>
<P>
   Poirier found Richard, a 39-year-old corporate trainer from
Rhode Island, to be funny, sweet and nice.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said she found inspiration in Susan's blistering attack on
Kelly, whom she called a two-faced rat who, if dying, would best be
left to the vultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire that she had the guts to tell Kelly off straight
out,'' Lopez said. ``Everyone knew Richard was evil.''
</P>
<P>
   David Arias, 21, an after-school worker from Canoga Park, rooted
for Rudy: ``I guess he was the least objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its popularity, the show had its share of detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapist Andrea Sussman of Sherman Oaks knocked reality
television as creatively void and a trivializing of real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's people out there who probably know who each of the
survivors are by name but it's scary they don't know who's running
for president or is in the Senate,'' said Sussman, 44, sipping an
iced coffee outside a neighborhood coffee shop.

   The movie's tag line gets the point across like a tackle
rumbling along with a recovered fumble: ``Pros on strike. Regular
guys get to play!'' After that, everybody might as well go home
because absolutely nothing happens that one hasn't seen before in a
sports movie.
</P>
<P>
   With his $5 million-a-year players walking the picket line, Ed
O'Neill ( Warden), the natty, boozy owner of the Washington
Sentinels, enlists Jimmy McGinty (Hackman), that great old coach
from the '80s, to put together a team of scabs to carry on the
season. McGinty rounds up a crowd of characters he has known (don't
we all): the mad-dog linebacker, the swift receiver who couldn't
catch a balloon, the inevitable convict on loan from prison, the
400-pound lineman down from 600 pounds. (He's a sumo wrestler.) ``I
love to see a fat guy score!'' McGinty exclaims. He's come to the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarterback he hires a sad sack named Shane Falco
(Reeves). While at Ohio State, Falco was so badly whipped by
Florida State (who wasn't?) that he has quit the sport in shame and
now scrapes barnacles off yacht bottoms. The point McGinty wants to
get across to him and all his misfits is that they aren't
necessarily losers. For this one moment they can be all they ever
dreamed of. So crank up those self-images, get out there and
persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty strikers turn over Falco's pick-up truck, but he drops his
wimp routine, swallows his self-loathing and starts to throw
touchdown passes. What's more, he's a selfless leader, which
impresses Annabelle (Langton), who heads a very hot crew of
cheerleaders recruited from a strip joint. But to reach the
playoffs, the fill-in Sentinels will have to defeat the genuine
Dallas team, the league champions, who have just crossed the picket
line. That's absurd, of course, but do you doubt that redemption is
at hand?
</P>

   ``You should be working,'' reads a message taped to the spot in
the ceiling where Sebastan Caine (Bacon) occasionally gazes when
he's at his computer. The hard-driving Caine heads one of the more
sensitive research projects around Washington. He and his team
inject animals with blue fluid and make them invisible. But they
can't make them visible again _ that is, until Caine cracks the
reversion problem and reconstitutes a gorilla named Isabel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's a sensitive. There's no stating how badly the
Pentagon wants this stuff. Without telling the military, Caine
decides to take the project to level three _ humans, specifically
himself. This alarms his assistants: Caine's ex-lover Linda (Shue),
Matt (Brolin) and Sarah (Dickens), the project veterinarian, who
already has a problem with Caine over his vivisectionist's attitude
toward the animals, visible and invisible, caged at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Caine injects himself and disappears. Unlike
Isabel, however, he can't be brought back. At first he is vastly
annoyed, but soon he begins to enjoy popping around the lab scaring
the daylights out of his team members, who can't detect him unless
they wear infrared glasses or he's in contact with liquid, which
outlines his form. Later there's nothing to do but escape from the
lab and have some fun on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this brings out darker elements in Caine, who
immediately rapes a neighbor he's previously only admired through
the venetian blinds. Then, while invisibly spying on Linda, he
discovers she is having an affair with Matt, which sends him back
to the lab for a gory run of terror. The glasses would help.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Graphic and extreme, with people skewered, ripped and
snapped. The same goes for animals (add munched).
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ Caine strips down completely (rear view) before his
injection, and there is partial nudity at other times.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ As pronounced as the violence.

   There she sits, all dewy and ripe and positively gurgling at the
notion of taking up with the nicely notorious millionaire
restaurateur 26 years her senior. This being fairly routine for the
graying, tousled 48-year-old Will (Gere), it is with a kind of
weary, amused resignation that he's drawn into an affair with
22-year-old Charlotte (Ryder). It's OK for now, he tells her, but
she should understand that they have no future.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he doesn't understand the ramifications of that
remark. Will is old enough for Charlotte's mother, and in fact he
was involved with her mother before her death. As for Charlotte,
she is ill with a tumor and a heart problem that has her collapsing
around town at dramatic moments. She hasn't long, he learns, a year
at most.
</P>
<P>
   Will being Will, he has a rooftop fling with an old girlfriend.
To him, that is as consequential as walking the dog, but it rankles
Charlotte. He encounters another attractive young woman
(Stringfield), only this time it's his daughter, whom he's never
met. Mulling that one over and deciding he can't do without
Charlotte, he begs her to let him love her.
</P>
<P>
   After reuniting very cute, she glows and acts adorably feisty

PARK DOES IT ALL IN DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park stood at home plate and watched. Just
like the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   To the Dodgers, no one is bigger right now than Park, whose
first major-league home run provided the confetti in Thursday
afternoon's 7-0 victory over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Park's pitching _ seven more scoreless innings to add
to a string that has reached 15 _ that gave the Dodgers their third
consecutive victory and a hope for a tailwind leading into their
upcoming road trip and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great for his home run, but it is the way he has taken
charge that could really mean a lot the rest of the way,'' pitching
coach Claude Osteen said. ``Our starters are coming together and
Chan Ho is a big part. You need that down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a doubleheader today against the struggling
Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, the Dodgers are facing a string of
mutts in these dog days of August. They are out to prove they are
not one of them, even if they still trail idle San Francisco by 7{
games with 36 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Including Montreal, which played the last three games of the
series without superstar Vladimir Guerrero (strained left
shoulder), the Dodgers face the Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers,
Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates during a 17-day
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday, those teams were a combined 71 games under
.500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big series for us to get going,'' said outfielder
Shawn Green, who homered and appears to be breaking out of a
two-month slump. ``Obviously, we're still a ways back, but we're
looking to give ourselves a chance, to get really hot and sneak in
there somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is playing more relaxed than we were a couple
of weeks ago. when we were only 2{ games back. But now we're just
going out there and playing and better things are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially to Park (13-8). After giving up a first-inning home
run to the Mets' Derek Bell last Sunday, he has allowed just nine
hits his last 15 innings. He has struck out 17 during that stretch
and issued just two walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am having fun,'' Park said. ``As long as I work hard, days
like this will come.''
</P>
<P>
   His victory came one day after Kevin Brown took a perfect game
into the seventh inning and defeated Montreal 4-1. Today's Game 1
starter Darren Dreifort has won six consecutive decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is finally the starting pitching that we have been
lacking,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``We need to build some
consistency and momentum. You do that with your starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is well aware his team fell apart the last time they won
three straight. It came earlier this month after the Dodgers drew
within 2{ games of the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Then they dropped the next three to Milwaukee and Chicago and
six of seven overall.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Brown hadn't won for almost a month. The fourth
and fifth starters are winless since June 6, when Eric Gagne beat
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had the pitching we're getting now,'' said Johnson,
who pulled Park on Thursday after seven innings and 109 pitches.
``Chan Ho was perfect today, ask any hitter. He was totally in
control. It was a big and outstanding day for him. He was so
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Dodgers put away Montreal with four runs in the
fourth. They strung together four consecutive hits, including
Green's 23rd homer. Third baseman Adrian Beltre had an RBI single,
one of his three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Even Park drove in his second run with a base hit to right.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his home run the inning before off Expos starter
Javier Vazquez (8-6) that brought to life the crowd that was much
smaller than the announced 28,896. Park crushed Vazquez's first
pitch 427 feet into the bleachers in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun, my first home run, Park said. ``I was feeling good
even before the game. I was focused from the start and just trusted
my grip. I just threw my curve and changeup the whole day. I didn't
think about it. I just threw with confidence.'' &QL;

FORD ATTACKS THE LAWYERS PURSUING SUITS OVER TIRES
</HEADLINE>
  By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Officials of the Ford Motor Co. lashed out
Thursday at plaintiffs' lawyers suing the automaker and
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., accusing them of endangering public
safety by calling for a broader recall of tires and of distributing
Ford documents out of context to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday afternoon at Ford's headquarters
here, executives again rejected lawyers' calls for a wider recall
of 15-inch Firestone tires and for a new recall of 16-inch
Firestone tires. Only the tires already recalled pose an unusual
risk of failure, said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for
North American light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said that dealerships were being mobbed by
customers insisting on replacements for tires not covered by the
recall, draining the supply of new tires and forcing people with
hazardous tires to continue driving on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A broader recall is wrong,'' said Helen Petrauskas, Ford's
vice president for safety and environmental engineering. ``It's
wrong because many good tires will be delivered and used to replace
good tires _ and people who have tires which should be replaced
will have to stand in line and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, a consultant for plaintiffs' lawyers who is
coordinating much of the litigation against Ford and Firestone,
said that the two companies should prove that the tires not
recalled are safe by releasing all of their raw data on the
production and failure rates of many sizes of tires. ``It's Ford's
and Firestone's responsibility to restore public faith in them and
in this process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators reiterated Thursday that they had made no
decision on whether the recall undertaken by Ford and Firestone was
broad enough and would continue to investigate many Firestone
tires. Congressional committees are also beginning to look into the
tire problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it would put extensive information on tire failures on
its Web site, www.ford.com, by Friday morning. The data, including
a series of charts, shows that the failure rates for the tires
being recalled, particularly tires made in Decatur, Ill., are up to
hundreds of times those for other Firestone tires. Last week, Ford
put the data on its media site, which is available only to
reporters with passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Hoar said that Ford should make its files available to the
public rather than calculating failure rates and other information
in ways that might serve the automaker's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, said that Ford and Firestone had
replaced 13.3 percent of the 6.5 million recalled tires in the last
two weeks. That is an unusually fast pace in an industry that
normally takes as long as two years for a recall and often only
persuades 50 percent to 60 percent of customers to bring in their
vehicles for work. But the pace of the recall has failed to satisfy
angry Explorer owners at Ford and Firestone dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Petrauskas also accused plaintiffs' lawyers of distributing
documents out of context to journalists with little familiarity
with the engineering process through which automobiles are
designed. The documents involve potential safety problems that Ford
engineers identified in designing the Explorer. Petrauskas said
that engineers at any automaker analyze vehicle designs for
possible safety problems and then fix them before putting vehicles
into production, and she said that Ford did this with the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really struck that somehow it's being held against us''
that Ford engineers tried to identify potential safety problems in
early prototypes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrauskas' comments were indicative of a common worry at Ford
that plaintiffs' lawyers will dribble out documents for months
whenever the recall fades from public attention. The lawyers ``have
a lot of documents,'' fretted a senior Ford executive in an
interview last weekend. Hoar said that Ford had been more selective
than plaintiffs' lawyers in releasing information by refusing to
make raw data available and by labeling some of its boxes of
filings with regulators as proprietary information that cannot be
included in the public docket.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It will take about a month for Verizon Communications to work
through roughly 50,000 delayed repairs and more than 200,000 orders
for new service as a result of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, customers in need of new telephone service have
few alternatives aside from acquiring a wireless phone. Even if
customers try to get local dial-tone service from one of Verizon's
competitors, like AT&AMP;T or MCI WorldCom, there could be delays
because these companies use parts of Verizon's network
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing people can do is be patient,'' said Eric Rabe,
a spokesman for Verizon, which was created by the merger of Bell
Atlantic and GTE. Verizon customers in the 12 Eastern states and
Washington, where the strike took place, can call customer service
numbers on their bills, on which the company has just begun to
substitute its new name. Or they can use Verizon's Web site,
www.verizon.com, to order new service or request repairs.

VATICAN ASSAILS NEW GUIDELINES ON HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethical debate over the research potential and human rights of
frozen embryos intensified Wednesday as the Vatican condemned new
U.S. guidelines on embryonic research, calling them ``gravely
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Rome only one day to respond to President Clinton's
prediction that new rules from the National Institutes of Health
will encourage medical breakthroughs with ``potentially staggering
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the uses and abuses of stem cells taken from human
embryos that were created in fertility clinics, but never implanted
in the womb of a mother or surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many thousands _ or millions _ of these tiny
embryos are sitting in suspended animation on laboratory shelves
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   New research may soon enable these ``pluripotent'' stem cells to
be used in the manufacture of muscle cells, skin cells and nerve
cells. These self-replicating cells could lead to breakthrough
treatments for a variety of deadly and debilitating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   What's lost in this high-tech harvest is the embryo itself,
which could have been used to produce another human life.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday, the Vatican's Pontifical
Academy for Life said the medical benefits do not warrant embryonic
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good end does not make good an action that in itself is
bad,'' the Vatican said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is expected to address the stem cell
controversy himself next week when he speaks at a scientific
conference in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the pope suffers from Parkinson's disease, one of
the degenerative, age-related ailments that stem cell therapies
could be used to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the opposition to this promising line of research comes
from religious leaders and politicians who oppose abortion because
of their belief that life begins at conception. The Catholic Church
opposes in- &LR; vitro fertilization, but says that embryos deserve
protection, in both the womb and the petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines announced Wednesday permit federally financed
researchers to work on stem cells extracted from surplus embryos at
private laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history, our federal government will
promote research in which developing human beings are destroyed,''
said Richard Doerflinger, Associate Director of the Pro-Life
Secretariat at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that these surplus embryos would have been destroyed
anyway, so why not use them for beneficial purposes. &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying we should take the organs from prisoners on
death row because they're going to die anyway,'' Doerflinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other ethicists disagree with the hard-line position of the
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Peters, a professor at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary
in Berkeley, warned against oversimplifying the ethical questions
around embryonic research, or viewing it through the ``pro-life''
and ``pro-choice'' arguments in the abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of this research outweighs the arguments against
it,'' said Peters, who has studied stem cell research for the
Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley. ``We'd be
sacrificing an enormous difference in human health to protect
fertilized ova that won't become babies anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters and Doerflinger also disagree as to whether researchers
could get similar results by using stem cells taken from adults,
rather than using embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said adult cells ``deteriorate rapidly and are too small
to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doerflinger cited a recent study showing that researchers
could ``produce a virtually limitless supply of new nerve cells for
transplants from patients' own bone marrow stem cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ethicists note that the enormous potential of stem cell
research opens a Pandora's Box of larger questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lurking behind the scenes is a not-so-subtle quest for
immortality,'' said C. Ben Mitchell, a bioethics consultant for the
Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cottage industry is developing to ward off not just
age-related diseases, but aging itself.''
</P>
<P>
   More liberal denominations with a pro-choice position on
abortion, such as the United Methodist Church, still have concerns
about embryonic research.
</P>
<P>
   That church has called for ``a ban on medical and research
procedures which intentionally generate `waste embryos' which will
knowingly be destroyed when the medical procedure or the research
is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other churches have embraced both genetic engineering and
in- &LR; vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Resolutions adopted by the United Church of Christ support ``the
rights of families to make decisions regarding their use of
reproductive technologies,'' and conclude that ``genetic
engineering opens new ways for people of compassion to help those
in need.''

LAPD ABUSED WHISTLE-BLOWERS, LAWSUIT CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks and top commanding
officers routinely punished lower-ranking officers who reported
wrongdoing by supervisors, according to a class-action lawsuit
filed in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 43 plaintiffs claim in the suit filed Thursday they blew the
whistle on captains suspected of stealing computers, of falsifying
overtime records in the Devonshire and West Valley divisions, and
of ordering crime-scene response times falsely enhanced, among
other infractions.
</P>
<P>
   For breaking that ``code of silence,'' the officers and civilian
workers said they were targeted by the department as troublemakers
and either disciplined unfairly or drummed out of the department
entirely. About one-third of the plaintiffs are Valley officers or
civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   The class, which has yet to be certified, is anticipated to grow
to up to 500 officers seeking as much as $100 million in a jury
trial, as well as an injunction to prevent retaliations against
whistle-blowers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers report misconduct and then they are retaliated
against for the pettiest things,'' attorney Bradley C. Gage said
during a press conference at his Woodland Hills office. ``It comes
from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish said the department doesn't
comment on pending litigation. But he defended the disciplinary
system and argued that morale has not suffered among officers who
support Parks' efforts to get rid of cops who engage in unethical
or illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discipline system of the LAPD is absolutely fair and
equitable for everyone involved,'' Kalish said. ``There is no doubt
the chief holds his employees accountable, but it's always done in
a fair and consistent manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gage said he did not have specific evidence or documents linking
Parks to the alleged retaliations, but that it was the chief's
disciplinary policies that contributed to the ``pattern and
practice'' of retributions contributing to a climate of fear and
silence in which scandals like Rampart flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police officers are more afraid of the administration
than they are of the bad guys out there, then they have to be
careful, they can't say anything,'' Gage said. ``It's this code of
silence that's created out of fear that can lead to corruption
within a department.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the captains and other high-ranking officers accused of
misconduct were named in the lawsuit, and it could not be
determined late Thursday whether those identified had been
investigated by the department.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation culminates several years of complaints by members
of the Los Angeles Police Department's rank and file and their
union that Parks has been an arbitrary and draconian disciplinarian
responsible for the department's troubles in recruiting and
retaining cops. Parks has made discipline central to his vision of
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is a more aggressive and direct thrust at Parks than
anything the Los Angeles Police Protective League, representing
officers, has ventured.
</P>
<P>
   League President Ted Hunt said nonetheless the LAPD's
disciplinary system widely is viewed as dysfunctional, with the
punishment viewed as often in excess of the infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not working; it's illogical and irrational,'' Hunt said,
adding that nearly every day, an officer contacts him out of
frustration with the department and its rules.
</P>
<P>
   West Valley Division Officer Johneen Jones is a case in point,
Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who appeared with about a half-dozen other plaintiffs at
the press briefing, had complained about a ``No Fat Cops'' poster
displayed in West Valley Division. Jones and several other
employees found the placard offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The poster, however, was deemed to have ``significant historical
value,'' and Capt. Lee Carter allowed it to remain. It was put up
again by Capt. Julie Nelson when she was transferred to another
station, according to the lawsuit. Carter and Nelson could not be
reached for comment late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is now before a disciplinary Board of Rights, where the
charge against her is refusing to obey a direct order given by a
detective, according to LAPD records. Gage said the charge of
insubordination is in connection with photographing the poster and
refusing to leave when ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous what happened to her,'' Gage said.
``She was the victim of a captain who overreacted, and of a chief
who is very punitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Devonshire and West Valley divisions, officers who
reported a captain's falsification of overtime all were forced out
of the department or are currently in disciplinary proceedings, the
lawsuit states. The captain has left the department, Gage said. It
could not be determined whether he had been disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Other officers objected when they were ordered to punch their
police-car computers prematurely so it would appear they were
arriving at crime scenes more quickly. The lawsuit said they, too,
were forced out of the department after bogus claims were filed
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish, the LAPD's spokesman, said the department's rationale
for terminating officers is always set forth in Board of Rights
transcripts, but that some retire or resign before their cases can
be heard. Several of the officers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit
fall into that category.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-count complaint includes allegations of discrimination,
harassment, retaliation for filing claims of discrimination and
conspiracy to retaliate against police officers for reporting
criminal and other serious misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The retaliations the plaintiffs claim occurred had the added
effect of so frightening other officers that they soon learned to
``keep their mouth shut,'' making them less likely to report
corruption, notably in the Rampart Division, where several officers
are suspected of framing and physically harming suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once police officers keep quiet, officers, supervisors and
managers are then able to engage in criminal conduct, harming all
citizens of the city of Los Angeles,'' the lawsuit claims.

GOOGLE SENSES THAT IT'S TIME TO GROW UP  &HT;     BY VERNE KOPYTOFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Google Inc.'s brief history, from its inception in 1998 by two
Stanford University students to becoming one of the Internet's
leading search engines, is posted on a wall at the firm's Mountain
View headquarters.
<P>
   The posting shows the company's popularity growth to nearly 40
million queries a day, in typical Google fashion: The history is
written in green, purple and red crayons, with exclamation points
punctuating the biggest successes.
</P>
<P>
   So goes business at Google, a company trying to emerge from
adolescence into maturity. It has quickly become a major force in
the Internet industry, underscored by its agreement in June to
provide its search engine to Yahoo Inc., the giant Santa Clara Web
portal.
</P>
<P>
   But like many Internet companies these days, Google is grappling
with very adult issues such as revenue and profit. Long reluctant
about commercialization, the company is just now focusing on some
business basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build the ultimate search engine,'' said Larry
Page, Google's chief executive and co-founder. ``We think that we
can make search engines better every month, and I don't see that
ending anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Google's popularity is based on providing particularly relevant
results to user queries. The company usually ranks near the top in
studies of search-engine quality.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Google's search engine relies on software that
retrieves Web pages based on word placement and headlines. But it
also includes a proprietary technology called Page-Rank that
retrieves Web pages based on the number and quality of other Web
pages that point to it.
</P>
<P>
   Another lure is Google's simplistic design that is unusual for
all the blank white space. The sparseness helps it download faster
than most search engines, so much so that the company gloats by
displaying for users the time it takes to respond to every query.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, it harks back to the original image of search
engines,'' said Wit Andrews, an Internet industry analyst with the
Gartner Group, a market research company in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Sullivan, founder of Search Engine Watch, an online
newsletter that follows the search engine industry, said many
people praise Google for its search performance. But he added that
other companies may provide better searches for certain queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because people are talking about Google doesn't mean that
the other search engines are bad,'' Sullivan said. ``Google may not
be good on a particular query. If you wanted to find multimedia or
audio-visual files, Google wouldn't be helpful at all.'' Google
faces strong competition from the likes of AltaVista Co., the Palo
Alto Web portal, and Inktomi Corp., the Foster City firm that
licenses search technology to Web sites such as Lycos and America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies dwarf Google in size and experience. But they
nevertheless feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   For example, AltaVista released a bare-bones search engine in
May called Raging Search, partly in reaction to Google. Troy Toman,
general manager of search at Inktomi, said that competition with
Google has pushed his company to be more aggressive but adds that
no firm ``is going to conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Google replaced Inktomi as Yahoo's search engine, one
of the top prizes in the search-engine industry. Phu Hoang, the
vice president who oversees search at Yahoo, said his firm switched
services because of Google's ability to deliver useful responses
and handle millions of queries a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Google has really built a name for themselves out in the
Internet community,'' he said. ``Our users have been asking us to
work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   How much of a financial success the Yahoo contract is for Google
is unclear, though. Google gave Yahoo an undisclosed number of
stock options as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Google, named after googol, the term for 1 followed by 100
zeros, was created by Page and Sergey Brin, now the company's
president, while they were doctoral students in computer science at
Stanford. They operated the Web site out of their dorm room for a
few months, quickly realizing that their idea had potential.
</P>
<P>
   Brin and Page, now both 27, tried to shop Google to the big
search engines of the day like Excite and Infoseek. But those firms
were preoccupied at the time with becoming Web portals by adding
message boards and news, prompting Google's founders to go it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Google's offices reflect its college dormitory origin with Lava
lamps, a disco ball, hockey sticks and a model roller coaster. But
on a recent afternoon, the headquarters was more like a library
with most of its 120 employees in their cubicles, staring at
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Google has expanded rapidly. The company
announced the biggest search index with 560 million Web pages, it
added 10 languages to its search engine for the international
market and signed several agreements with wireless firms.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of its maturing process, Google last week
launched its first concerted effort to solicit advertising. Prior
to the announcement, Google's strategy consisted mostly of letting
companies discover for themselves that they could advertise on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Brin, Google's co-founder, says the company is not
obsessed with maximizing profits. His strategy is to provide a
better search engine to lure loyal users and reap profits later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wanted to sell ad banners, we could call DoubleClick and
be profitable today,'' said Brin, referring to the dominant online
advertising placement company. ``But we can be more successful in
the long run if we grow our user base. I've been happy with our
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Google searches is increasing by an average of
nearly 20 percent a month, according to the company. Google is
particularly popular among computer-savvy males, though the company
says its demographics are slowly shifting to more mainstream users.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Google was ranked fifth among search engines and
navigation Web sites in terms of unique visitors, according to
Media Metrix, the online research firm. However, that ranking
represents only traffic at the Google.com Web site and not the
search services it provides to Yahoo, Netscape and other partners.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of Google's searches come via the companies that
license its technology. Google's own Web site handles 14 million
searches a day, while its partners account for another 26 million,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Because Google is private, it is immune from the criticism
leveled at other Internet firms these days about declining stock
prices. Brin said his company has no immediate plans to go public,
but doesn't rule it out for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, the Internet industry analyst, said it is unclear what
direction Google will travel in the coming years. While Google has
carved out a niche in providing searches, he said, that is a
relatively limited business.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does Google want to be when they grow up?'' Andrews
asked. ``I don't know the answer to that question. Maybe they'll
look like a competitor to a Yahoo. Maybe they'll do intranet and
local search capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Google's executives say they will not do is transform
their company into a Web portal. While the firm may add
capabilities such as online image and music searches, according to
its co-founders, it will stay away from calenders, news and chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search is a very core function,'' Brin said. ``It deserves 100
percent focus.''

   FTC SUES ADULT WEB SITES OVER BILLING
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general
have sued the owners and operators of a network of adult-oriented
Web sites, including www.playgirl.com and www.highsociety.com,
asserting they illegally billed thousands of people for services
that were advertised as free, and for charging many others who
never visited the Web sites at all. The suit, filed in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan, contends that Crescent Publishing
Group of New York, along with 64 affiliated corporations, routinely
charge people who provided credit card information ostensibly to
verify they were over 18 before they could view the adult sites.
Telephone calls to Crescent Publishing, and its owner, Bruce Chew,
and principal, David Bernstein, were not returned Thursday &QL;

   Hearings are set for Monday in the copyright infringement trial
of Seagram's Universal Music Group against MP3.com, following a
ruling on Wednesday by a federal judge that could limit the damages
owed by the Internet music start-up. U.S. District Judge Jed S.
Rakoff ruled that damages would be assessed for copyright
violations of each compact disc, not for every individual song that
was infringed by Mp3.com, as the recording industry had wanted.
Universal and four other major record labels sued MP3.com in
January, saying it had made illegal digital copies of songs
available on its site. In April, Rakoff ruled against MP3.com,
saying it had infringed record company copyrights. MP3.com has
settled with four of the record companies.

PrivateAccounts.com, a Minneapolis-based venture that planned to
connect individual investors with well-known money managers. ETrade
did not disclose what it was paying for PrivateAccounts.com, which
has not even opened for business. Later this year, ETrade plans to
start charging fees to customers with $100,000 or more that they
want managed for them, said Liat Rorer, an ETrade vice-president.
Rorer declined to say who the managers would be or what the cost
would be. ETrade also just bought the Electronic Investing Corp., a

   INTEL LOOKING INTO NEW AREA
</P>
<P>
   Intel is forming an industry working group to foster standards
and protocols for so-called peer-to-peer computing, particularly in
business environments. Popularized by music distribution services
like Napster and Gnutella, peer-to-peer computing is a set of
technologies that enable the direct exchange of services or data
between computers. ``Peer-to-peer computing could be as important
to the Internet's future as the Web browser was to its past,'' said
Patrick Gelsinger, vice president and chief technology officer of
the Intel Architecture Group. By using the collective processing
power of the thousands of PCs at Intel in a peer-to-peer network,
the company was able to mothball its mainframe computers, saving
$500 million, he said.

CABLETRON SPIN-OFFS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE NETWORKING'S `FAB FOUR' 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Are four money-losing companies worth more than one?
<P>
   In the case of Cabletron Systems Inc., Wall Street seems to
think so.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest multiple births since the Baby Bells,
Cabletron, an also-ran in the computer networking business, is
spinning off four divisions as separate companies.
</P>
<P>
   During the next year or so, it will sell 20 percent or less of
each unit in four initial public offerings and distribute the
remaining shares to Cabletron stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Four IPOs amount to a full-employment act for investment banks,
and their analysts have been churning out ``sum of the parts''
analyses that estimate the combined value of the four companies at
$45 to $60-plus per share. Cabletron currently trades at around
$36.
</P>
<P>
   The hype is getting noisier now that the sexiest quadruplet,
Santa Clara's Riverstone Networks, is closing in on an IPO.
Cabletron stock jumped about $10 this month as Riverstone
executives made a pre-quiet-period promotional push.
</P>
<P>
   Riverstone is expected to file an IPO prospectus in September
and start trading in October or November. Sources say Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter will manage the offering, with help from
Salomon Smith Barney, Lehman Bros. and Chase H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   Given that most of Wall Street is in on the deal, or vying for
one of the others, investors might want to take these
sum-of-the-parts valuations with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pyykkonen of CIBC World Markets, one of the few analysts
without a buy recommendation on Cabletron, says, ``These target
prices are not outlandish, but they presume some success in the
company's sales that's not necessarily there today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the valuations assume Cabletron's offspring will
grow faster in the future than they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   None is expected to grow faster than Riverstone, which sells
switches and routers to Internet service providers for metropolitan
area networks. Its routers let customers ``shape'' traffic, or
allocate more bandwidth to customers who are willing to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   Riverstone competes with hot ``Internet infrastructure''
companies such as Redback Networks, Foundry Networks and Extreme
Networks. Their stocks now sport sky-high valuations, and
Riverstone would like to cash in before investors go searching for
the next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley analyst Christopher Stix opines that Riverstone,
by itself, could be worth almost as much as all of Cabletron today.
</P>
<P>
   But Pyykkonen is skeptical. ``It all hinges on Riverstone's
sales execution,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Riverstone Chief Executive Officer Romulus Pereira admits that
in the past, sales and marketing was Cabletron's Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   The company always had good technology and a flamboyant former
CEO who drove around in a tank and once arm-wrestled comedian Joe
Piscopo at a trade show.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Cabletron of Rochester, N.H., was actually
bigger than Cisco Systems. But as information technology became a
commodity, San Jose's Cisco recognized the importance of building a
brand name, and Cabletron didn't, Pereira says.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Andrew, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, is even harsher on
the old Cabletron.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a `hype and disappoint' management team,'' he
says. ``They were slow to come to markets, slow to make
acquisitions, and had a `not invented here' mentality. They screwed
up everything possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron did one thing right, though. In 1998, it bought Yago
Systems of Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   Yago had a next-generation high-speed switch ``that essentially
saved the company and now accounts for 25 percent of total sales,''
Andrew says.
</P>
<P>
   Yago had something else Cabletron desperately needed _
management. Yago's co-founders _ Piyush Patel and Pereira _
eventually became Cabletron's chief executive and chief operating
officers, respectively. Although the new team began delivering
consistent results, Cabletron never was able to regain respect on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The company decided that if it split into four parts _ each with
a new name, new management, new stock options and a sharper focus _
it would increase shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street rewards pure plays,'' Pereira explains.
</P>
<P>
   After Cabletron announced the restructuring plan in early
February, its stock shot up from the high-20s to the high-30s.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, the company disclosed that Silver Lake
Partners _ a Silicon Valley investment firm with deep pockets and
fat Rolodexes _ was investing in the firm, and the stock shot up to
$52 by late March.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 29, when the company announced results for the
fiscal year ended in February, it became clear that losses from the
restructuring would be bigger and longer lasting than expected, and
the stock tumbled all the way back down to $18.64.
</P>
<P>
   After languishing in the 20s, it started moving up again when
Riverstone moved closer to an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Breakups like this have worked well for companies operating in
unrelated markets. But to the untrained eye, Cabletron's four units
don't seem all that disparate.
</P>
<P>
   Enterasys, the biggest but slowest-growing division, will sell
networking hardware _ routers and switches _ to enterprise
customers, which means big businesses, for their internal networks.
</P>
<P>
   Riverstone will sell switches and routers to ``service
providers,'' such as Internet service providers, application
service providers and Web-hosting companies, for regional networks.
</P>
<P>
   Aprisma will sell network-management software to enterprises and
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Global Network Technology Services will be a network-consulting
company, capitalizing on the hot outsourcing trend.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the divisions lost money in the latest quarter and
will continue to do so for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to run four different companies, you have to
have four different everything. In the short run, you're going to
have higher expenses,'' says Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, however, analysts say the companies will grow
faster because they can get capital by selling stock to the public,
instead of squabbling with one another for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riverstone can grow so much faster than the other ones _ 25 to
30 percent a year. That would suck up a lot of resources that
Enterasys thinks they ought to get,'' says Bert Hochfeld, an
analyst with Josephthal &AMP; Co. On its own, Riverstone can get the
same kind of capital its competitors are getting.
</P>
<P>
   He says some of the units will be able to snag new customers by
shaking off real or perceived conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'd ever be able to sell the Aprisma software
in high volume as long as it continues to be part of Cabletron,''
Hochfeld says. ``It was designed as a network management platform
for Cabletron. So long as it belongs to Cabletron, there will
always be the belief that it's optimized for Cabletron equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, GNTS will be able to expand its consulting clientele
when it's no longer seen as beholden to Cabletron.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's no proof that separating Cabletron's
hardware business by customer base will be a boon. Pyykkonen points
out that Cisco, Foundry and Extreme all sell equipment to
corporations and service providers _ and are doing just fine, thank
you.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Davidson of Silver Lake admits that ``synergies could be
lost, but there could also be tremendous opportunities. We're
making a bet that the total available market that can be served by
independent companies is bigger, and they'll be more successful
serving those markets as independent companies. Part of it is just
re-energizing the management team and employee base.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Lake has agreed to invest $90 million in the parent
company and $110 million or more in each of the four spin-offs. But
Davidson doesn't expect to get rich overnight. ``I'm long-term
greedy, not short-term greedy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its operating units, Cabletron has investments in 25
or 30 technology companies and plans to make more with its sizable
cash horde. When the breakup is complete, the parent company may
use these investments to form an incubator company similar to CMGI
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   So how much is this whole thing worth?
</P>
<P>
   Hochfeld until recently had a ``hold'' on the stock, but now
says it's worth ``north of $60.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hare, an analyst with Spin-Off Advisors, a hedge fund,
says the pieces add up to $55 per share. But after subtracting a 15
percent discount for ``execution risk,'' he comes up with a value
of $46 or $47.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew says Cabletron could hit $55 to $60 within 12 months.
But, he cautions, ``a lot could happen: The market could crash,
they could implode. This is a very difficult story to understand,
and they have to get over that hurdle.'' If things go wrong, he
says, the stock could sink back to the 20s.

INTEL MAKING PITCH FOR `PEER-TO-PEER' COMPUTING 
 &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN JOSE _ To the average corporate computing manager, the very
mention of the Napster file-sharing site conjures visions of
rampant copyright violation and networks brought to their knees.
<P>
   But Intel says that's only part of the story. Thursday, the
giant chipmaker set out to persuade the high-tech industry and its
business customers to see the positive potential of Napster-style
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is called ``peer-to-peer computing,'' which Intel
defines as technologies that enable the direct exchange of data or
services _ including processing power and storage capacity _
between computers over both local-area networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peer-to-peer computing could be as important to the Internet's
future as the Web browser was to its past,'' declared Pat
Gelsinger, vice president and chief technology officer of the Intel
Architecture Group _ the company's core division _ in a keynote
speech on the third day of the Intel Developer Forum in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to the legal controversy surrounding Napster, Intel
is ``neutral,'' Gelsinger said. ``We're creating the technological
framework. It will have good and bad uses, as all technologies
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The good side, he said, is the underlying notion that desktop
PCs as well as network servers can offer information and resources
to other users over far-flung networks. To promote that idea, and
to foster standards and protocols for it, Intel has formed an
industry working group (www.peer-to- &QL; 
peerwg.org).
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Hewlett-Packard have already joined, along with some 16
other companies, mostly little-known startups. Gelsinger also said
Intel's venture-capital fund would play an aggressive role in
promoting the new paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   Citing data from Intel's own experience, the Intel executive
said the peer-to-peer approach could save business customers
billions. Until a decade ago, he said, the Santa Clara company
``bought mainframes like candy,'' particularly to run simulations
of new chip designs.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990, it developed software called NetBatch, which scans
the company's 10,000 engineering workstations, then dispatches such
tasks to idle machines.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, he said, has been to raise utilization rates on
expensive workstations from 30 percent to 70 percent. As a result,
Intel hasn't had to buy a new mainframe since 1992, and across 10
years, it has saved an estimated $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another example involves software Intel is testing for
distributing computer-based training files to its employees.
Instead of each employee downloading the large, media-rich files
over expensive and often congested wide-area networks, only one
worker at each site has to; that worker's machine then serves up
the file to other users at the same site over the LAN, where
bandwidth is plentiful and inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, aren't convinced that peer-to-peer
computing will have wide appeal in the business world. ``It's no
accident that Napster is a consumer phenomenon,'' said Jeffrey
Tarter, editor and publisher of Softletter, a software-industry
newsletter in Watertown, Mass. ``The biggest impact of these
technologies is in the consumer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's problem, he said, is that ``processor speed no longer
matters for most tasks,'' but manipulating digital audio and
especially video still taxes the capabilities of today's PCs. By
facilitating distribution of such multimedia files, peer-to-peer
computing could help increase demand for expensive cutting-edge
chips on both end-user computers and network servers.

VATICAN ASSAILS NEW GUIDELINES ON HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE)  
 (Eds: Changes Time Element Throughout, From Wednesday To
Thursday)     &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethical debate over the research potential and human rights of
frozen embryos intensified Thursday as the Vatican condemned new
U.S. guidelines on embryonic research, calling them ``gravely
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Rome only one day to respond to President Clinton's
prediction that new rules from the National Institutes of Health
will encourage medical breakthroughs with ``potentially staggering
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the uses and abuses of stem cells taken from human
embryos that were created in fertility clinics, but never implanted
in the womb of a mother or surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many thousands _ or millions _ of these tiny
embryos are sitting in suspended animation on laboratory shelves
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   New research may soon enable these ``pluripotent'' stem cells to
be used in the manufacture of muscle cells, skin cells and nerve
cells. These self-replicating cells could lead to breakthrough
treatments for a variety of deadly and debilitating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   What's lost in this high-tech harvest is the embryo itself,
which could have been used to produce another human life.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday, the Vatican's Pontifical Academy
for Life said the medical benefits do not warrant embryonic
destruction.

   Pope John Paul II is expected to address the stem cell
controversy himself next week when he speaks at a scientific

   Most of the opposition to this promising line of research comes
from religious leaders and politicians who oppose abortion because

opposes in- &LR; vitro fertilization, but says that embryos deserve

<P>
   The new guidelines announced Thursday permit federally financed
researchers to work on stem cells extracted from surplus embryos at
private laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history, our federal government will
promote research in which developing human beings are destroyed,''
said Richard Doerflinger, Associate Director of the Pro-Life
Secretariat at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that these surplus embryos would have been destroyed
anyway, so why not use them for beneficial purposes. &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying we should take the organs from prisoners on
death row because they're going to die anyway,'' Doerflinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other ethicists disagree with the hard-line position of the
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Peters, a professor at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary
in Berkeley, warned against oversimplifying the ethical questions
around embryonic research, or viewing it through the ``pro-life''
and ``pro-choice'' arguments in the abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of this research outweighs the arguments against
it,'' said Peters, who has studied stem cell research for the
Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley. ``We'd be
sacrificing an enormous difference in human health to protect
fertilized ova that won't become babies anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters and Doerflinger also disagree as to whether researchers
could get similar results by using stem cells taken from adults,
rather than using embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said adult cells ``deteriorate rapidly and are too small
to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doerflinger cited a recent study showing that researchers
could ``produce a virtually limitless supply of new nerve cells for
transplants from patients' own bone marrow stem cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ethicists note that the enormous potential of stem cell
research opens a Pandora's Box of larger questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lurking behind the scenes is a not-so-subtle quest for
immortality,'' said C. Ben Mitchell, a bioethics consultant for the
Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cottage industry is developing to ward off not just
age-related diseases, but aging itself.''
</P>
<P>
   More liberal denominations with a pro-choice position on
abortion, such as the United Methodist Church, still have concerns
about embryonic research.
</P>
<P>
   That church has called for ``a ban on medical and research
procedures which intentionally generate `waste embryos' which will
knowingly be destroyed when the medical procedure or the research
is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other churches have embraced both genetic engineering and
in- &LR; vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Resolutions adopted by the United Church of Christ support ``the
rights of families to make decisions regarding their use of
reproductive technologies,'' and conclude that ``genetic
engineering opens new ways for people of compassion to help those
in need.''

<P>
   Ethical debate over the research potential and human rights of
frozen embryos intensified Thursday as the Vatican condemned new
U.S. guidelines on embryonic research, calling them ``gravely
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Rome only one day to respond to President Clinton's
prediction that new rules from the National Institutes of Health
will encourage medical breakthroughs with ``potentially staggering
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the uses and abuses of stem cells taken from human
embryos that were created in fertility clinics, but never implanted
in the womb of a mother or surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many thousands _ or millions _ of these tiny
embryos are sitting in suspended animation on laboratory shelves
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   New research may soon enable these ``pluripotent'' stem cells to
be used in the manufacture of muscle cells, skin cells and nerve
cells. These self-replicating cells could lead to breakthrough
treatments for a variety of deadly and debilitating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   What's lost in this high-tech harvest is the embryo itself,
which could have been used to produce another human life.

 LEGISLATURE CONFIRMS INSURANCE NOMINEE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Retired Justice Harry Low was confirmed as the
state's new Insurance Commissioner Thursday, receiving unanimous
approval from both houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Low replaces disgraced former commissioner Chuck Quackenbush,
who resigned under a cloud of suspicion and faced possible
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, he will restore public confidence in the
public's confidence in the Insurance Department,'' said Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Moving with rare speed, the Senate approved Low, a San Francisco
native, in a 34-to-0 vote that took less than 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. John R. Lewis of Orange called Low ``a
fair-minded official. Mr. Low is certainly well qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said Low is
exactly what the department needs to restore its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can once again be assured that the department will lawfully
and carefully carry out the laws that protect consumers under Harry
Low,'' Hertzberg said. The Assembly confirmed Low on a 71-to-0
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis appointed Low, 69, to replace Quackenbush at the
end of July. Low has said that he will assume the office in
mid-September. Law school professor Clark Kelso will continue to
run the department in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Low, a former state appeals court justice, will serve out the
remaining two years of Quackenbush's term. A Democrat, he has not
ruled out running for the office at that time.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, members of an Assembly committee questioned Low about
his ability to be not just an impartial judge, but an advocate for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that my role as insurance commissioner will be to
fairly and impartially administer the laws as the Legislature
enacted,`' replied Low, who will become the highest-ranking Asian
American in state government. ``However, the laws are also directed
toward the protection of consumers, and I intend to enforce the
laws. However, as commissioner you must be fair to everyone, and
that includes businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Shiela Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, said she was at
first worried that Low would be too neutral, and not enough of an
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've concluded that he will be just right,'' she said
Thursday.

JULIAN N. CARSEY, WHO CREATED 3 IDENTITIES, IS DEAD AT 65
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Fla., Texas)  By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Julian Nance Carsey, a Maryland college president who twice
vanished and created a new life for himself, died on Sunday at his
home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Carsey, known as Jay, had a liver ailment, said his companion,
Corinne Silverton.
</P>
<P>
   Carsey first disappeared in 1982, when he left his job, his wife
and his home in Maryland. After making a new life in El Paso and
remarrying, he disappeared from that life in 1992. He moved to
Jacksonville and took up another existence.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about his disappearance in 1982, Carsey said: ``It
wasn't that I was leaving something. I always felt I was going to
something, but I didn't know what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Coleman, the author of a book about Carsey, ``Exit the
Rainmaker'' (1989, InPrint.com), said what motivated Carsey ``was
just a hope that what he was going to would be better for him than
what he was leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A favorite expression of his,'' Coleman said, ``was that he
always loved `to seek and search.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carsey had been the president of Charles County Community
College in Maryland for 17 years when he disappeared from the
173-acre campus on a sunny morning in May 1982, only days before he
was scheduled to preside over a graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   His energetic fund raising had enabled the institution to expand
greatly from a program of evening courses offered at a local high
school. But federal education money was evaporating, and he foresaw
difficult times ahead for the college. His marriage had also come
to seem hollow to him.
</P>
<P>
   But in a parting note discovered by his wife, Nancy, he said:
``I am a physical and psychological disaster, I have no will to
improve and I don't want to drag you down with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He took refuge in El Paso, where he was not known, divorced
Nancy and married a second wife, Dawn, and taught subjects
including mathematics for some years at Air Force bases in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He taught and did administrative work at El Paso Community
College from 1988 until he disappeared again, just before Christmas
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman recalled that shortly before that disappearance he
received a letter from Carsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his own way he was trying to tell me that his life was
becoming too much for him again,'' Coleman said. ``So he took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Carsey's wife said at the time, `` `I'd better go to the airport
to see if the car's there,''' Coleman said, ``and it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Carsey went to Jacksonville, made it his home, and taught at
some colleges in Florida in the 1990s. He lived quietly, often
watching football games.

 `MINDSET' OF COLLEGE FRESHMEN RUSTY ON HISTORICAL DETAIL  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   History isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   For college freshmen descending on campuses across the nation
this month, the Kennedy tragedy is a plane crash, not an
assassination. The Osmonds are talk show hosts, not a
brother-sister singing and dancing duo. And Jane Fonda is just a
workout queen, not a Vietnam War icon.
</P>
<P>
   Beloit College in Wisconsin has just released its third annual
``Mindset of First-Year Students'' list to help professors
understand where their freshmen are coming from.
</P>
<P>
   The list of 50 items will get a laugh out of most anyone 30 or
older (Born in 1970? Yes, you are  &UR; old  &LR; to these kids of the '80s)
and provides a startling reminder of the gap between generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanoi Jane? What is that?'' asked UC Berkeley freshman Joe
Mellin, 28, reading that No. 45 on the list said freshmen of today
never thought of Jane Fonda as Hanoi Jane or connected her with any
revolution other than the ``Fitness Revolution'' videotape they may
have found in the attic. ``Isn't she the workout lady?'' Mellin
asked, clearly puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   The students in the class of 2004 were born mostly in 1982, the
year the Equal Rights Amendment was defeated, Phil Gramm became a
Republican and C-SPAN began 24-hour broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen of today feel a greater threat from sex and being
in school with armed classmates than from nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a thing of the past,'' said UC Berkeley freshman
Zaneta Wolanska, 18, of a potential nuclear war. ``We have never
really been close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A George Bush has been on every national ticket, except one,
since 18-year-olds were born. ``MASH'' and ``The Muppet Show'' have
always been in reruns. ``Coming out'' parties celebrate more than
debutantes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't everlasting pink meat in a can that springs to mind
when they hear the word Spam. For them it is junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   And a weekend without cash has never been an issue for this
group since ATM's have been around their entire lives.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a national holiday honoring Martin Luther
King Jr., television signals have always been available by direct
broadcast satellite. And their experience has led them to believe
that wars are events that begin and end quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the list is compiled in an unscientific way _ coming
from parent contributors and others around the Beloit campus, and
references culled from almanacs and editions of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But students themselves find the list fairly accurate, though
they do take umbrage at some of the items.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good portion of them are true, but there are a few that
underestimate our intelligence, like on Russia and communism,''
said UC Berkeley freshman Bryon Winget, 18, who is studying nuclear
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   According to Number 22 on the list, ``They have never referred
to Russia and China as `the Reds.''' They learned those terms in
school, students huffed.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly they knew Madonna sang ``Like a Virgin,'' not just
``American Pie,'' as the list claimed in number 43.
</P>
<P>
   And Winget was clearly offended by Number 47: ``They have never
used a bottle of ``White Out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written on my book covers with White Out,'' he corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the assertions came from the personal experiences of Ron
Nief, director of public affairs for Beloit College, and one of the
authors of the study _ with Humanities professor Tom McBride and
Richard Miller, director of Institutional Research.
</P>
<P>
   Number 7 _ A ``45'' is a gun, not a record with a large hole in
the center _ came from a chat Nief had with a group of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that I still have a closet full of 45s. I got shocked
looks. They said, `You have a closet full of guns?' I said, `No!
They are records!''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the list is whimsical, but that it has a serious
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really done to remind people that things change and
references change. You may have to explain things differently than
you have,'' Nief said.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl agreed that the
differences show up in the classroom. When he taught a course last
year on the history of the UC Berkeley campus, including
information on the loyalty oath, the free speech movement and the
anti-war protests, he found that students didn't always understand
the references.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their perceptions of the world are really quite different. Our
understanding has to be brought into alignment with their reality
every year,'' he said. ``It is a fascinating list of things that
demonstrates how young these freshmen really are in their
consciousness of the world and things we take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ...Like that shag carpeting disappeared long ago, never to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shag carpeting is coming back. I'd like to have it in my
place. It is so nice,'' Mellin said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's scary.

COWBOYS FINISH 0-5 IN PRESEASON AS OFFENSE STRUGGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It could be a result of the laser eye surgery he
had last year, but Troy Aikman saw the silver lining in a 24-17
exhibition loss to the St. Louis Rams on Thursday night at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that if we could get in and out of this game without
getting anybody hurt, it would end the preseason on a very positive
note,'' said Aikman, adding that the regular-season opener against
Philadelphia on Sept. 3 will mark the first time that new offensive
coordinator Jack Reilly will have a chance to map out a game plan
against an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to do that at full strength, personnel-wise,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and the Cowboys' first-team offense _ including Erik
Williams and David LaFleur, each in his first preseason game _
managed only three points in two series against the defending Super
Bowl champion Rams.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys finished with their second 0-5 preseason record
in three years, Aikman and the starters turned the ball over for
the first time in 15 preseason possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed double-digit passes of 14, 22 and 22 yards to
three receivers (LaFleur, Chris Warren and Rocket Ismail) on the
opening drive and moved the Cowboys into the red zone. But from the
Rams' 19, Aikman badly underthrew Joey Galloway at the goal line,
and safety Dexter McCleon turned and made the easy interception for
a touchback.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Aikman and the first-team offense got the ball,
they squandered excellent field position _ without making a first
down _ and had to settle for a 44-yard field goal by rookie Tim
Seder.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's seventh field goal of the preseason (in nine tries) gave
the Cowboys a shortlived 3-0 lead just 7 minutes, 6 seconds into
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This game produced two recurring themes: 1) The Cowboys lost for
the 14th time in 15 preseason games since 1998; and 2) auditions by
the Cowboys' young cornerbacks continued their downward trend.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kareem Larrimore, expected to be the Cowboys' starting
left cornerback when the regular season opens nine days from now at
Texas Stadium, was called for a pass-interference penalty that was
declined because the play went for 50 yards despite the infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore stood and argued the first-quarter call as Rams' Pro
Bowl receiver Isaac Bruce made the catch on his back and turned it
into a 25-yard gain. Then, as Bruce was being tackled by linebacker
Barron Wortham, he flipped the ball to Ricky Proehl, who ran
another 25 yards to the Dallas 15.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis settled for a 24-yard Jeff Wilkins field goal after
linebacker Joe Bowden stopped the Rams' Robert Holcombe on
third-and-two.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 3-3, the Cowboys used the next drive to see what rookie
running back Michael Wiley could do with the football _ five rushes
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio State fifth-rounder carried for 8, 7, 4 and 4 yards,
then fumbled when stripped by Rams safety Keith Lyle, who returned
it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Rams led 10-3 with 30 seconds left
in the first quarter and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams took a 17-3 lead early in the second quarter when Trent
Green hit Az-Zahir Hakim on a 15-yard post for a touchdown. Cowboys
free-agent first-year cornerback Stephen Fisher was in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Cowboys second-year cornerback Duane Hawthorne was beaten
by Chris Thomas on a 48-yard touchdown pass from Green. The score
came with 3:19 left in the half, which proved to be a long one for
the Dallas defense.
</P>
<P>
   Between those two St. Louis touchdown drives, the Cowboys
finally put the ball in the end zone, led by Arkansas rookie Clint
Stoerner at quarterback. Wane McGarity, who led all Cowboys
receivers with 10 preseason catches a year ago, turned his fifth
reception of this preseason into an 8-yard touchdown with 7:21 left
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity later caught a 26-yard pass from Stoerner that set up a
7-yard touchdown run by Wiley with 12:13 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two turnovers hurt the Cowboys early. Too many penalties hurt
the Cowboys late. Free-agent quarterback Charlie Puleri tried to
give the handful of stragglers in the seats a comeback effort, but
a Dallas penalty wiped out that effort as well.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Cowboys were happy to say goodbye to
preseason.

 WHO WANTS TO MARRY THIS SURVIVOR?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Right now it's just a gleam in my matchmaking
eye.
</P>
<P>
   But I have connections, I really think I can make it happen:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Richard Hatch, I'd like you to meet Darva Conger.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most annoying nude couple since John and Yoko.
</P>
<P>
   Sure there would be complications, there always are, but love
will overcome. Richard is gay, I understand, but Darva doesn't
sleep with her husbands anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a ``Survivor'' expert because I watched 15 minutes of the
final show. I would have watched previous episodes, but I was deep
into Joyce's ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   I LIKE the new ``reality'' shows. ``Survivor,'' though, needed
one more touch. When it got down to the final two, they should have
packed up the cameras, and  &LR; cast and crew and sailed away, leaving
behind only naked guy and rat-chick, whatever her name was.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, one of them would have washed ashore at Malibu on
a raft made of woven rat bones, and that would have been great
reality TV.
</P>
<P>
   TV ruined TV's suspenseful ending. Peggy Rourke-Nichols was
watching QVC before ``Survivor,'' and they were selling
``Survivor'' T-shirts with a picture of all the contestants, each
face X'd out except Richard, who was circled. All the breaking
news, right there on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   And just before the show's climax (says reader Elein) there was
a station break, and a teaser for the nightly news, and the
anchorwoman told everyone to stay tuned for an interview with the
man who won a million dollars on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVING BITS of ``Survivor'':
</P>
<P>
   Cuffs Corbett has studied the motley crew for weeks and says,
``That's the reason I'd never go on a cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   And Old Homeboy brings home the local angle, that Mayor Willie
Brown has created San Francisco's very own island survivor: Wendy
Linka of Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``HELP WANTED: 34-year-old Mongolian divorcee, must be Lutheran
or atheist.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sign in the window of Top Dog on Durant in Berkeley,
noted by Tanya Schevitz. Must be a story behind this, right?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the owner has some issues regarding free speech and
PC-run-amok in employment laws. Thus the lampoonish sign. The owner
isn't actually hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago a woman walked up to the hot- &LR; dog stand and said
she was looking for a job, and that she is a 34-year-old Mongolian
divorcee.
</P>
<P>
   However, the woman admitted to the owner, she is neither
Lutheran nor atheist.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, lady, it's Berkeley. They can train you.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER SIGN of the times:
</P>
<P>
   Dave Toschi was driving through the Richmond on Sunday evening,
saw a young man standing on the traffic island holding a
hand-lettered sign: ``Russian River, need ride, prefer driver with
a BMW conv.''
</P>
<P>
   RALPH NADER, my hero, is sinking in the polls as the dread
specter of President Shrub scares Nader voters to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nader fans sadly realize they can't waste that symbolic
vote on Ralph. But it's going to be hard to give up the
holier-than-thou feeling of walking out of the voting booth having
voted for an honest dude.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Ralph won't be president, but how about creating for him
a new Cabinet post: Secretary of the Road, protecting American from
driving rip-offs?
</P>
<P>
   Like: Ford admits it fixed Explorer rollover tendencies by
underinflating the tires. ... Firestone assembly-line workers say
they were told to pop bubbles with an awl. ... Mitsubishi is busted
for a coverup of customer complaints. ... And Tiger Woods is caught
selling a Nike golf ball that only he has; it's not the same Nike
ball the public drives.
</P>
<P>
   The motto of Nader's new watchdog post: ``Liar, liar, car on
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   CELL STUFF: Down in Silicon Valley, Steve Beck has been
attending cell phone technology conferences, and reports:
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Intel Developers Forum, a slide appeared just before a
wireless panel session: `Please place your cell phones on silent or
stun.'
</P>
<P>
   ``During breaks in the conference sessions, folks used to gather
outside to chat. Now they are all calling someone somewhere on
their cell phones. One pierced and stabbed wirelesser got his cell
phone antenna caught in his earrings.''
</P>
<P>
   KNEE-JERK liberal Rev. Robert Cromey checks into California
Pacific Medical Center Friday for his second knee replacement, and
you have to wonder if all that knee-jerking is just too hard on the
joints. Repetitive stress and all that.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev is also a self-proclaimed bleeding-heart liberal, and
you know the surgeons must hate to work on a guy with jerky knees
and a bleeding heart.
</P>
<P>
   OH, SWEET mysteries of life: From the Grass Valley-Nevada City
Union's Police Blotter (thanks, C. Leach):
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman living on Wolf Hollow Road reported that upon
developing a roll of film, she discovered obscene pictures of
someone in her closet.''
</P>
<P>
   MAILBAG: ``Please give us some more of your keen observations
about interesting places and people. ... I do not enjoy your
`cutesy' columns because I don't think you are `cutesy.' You just
seem to miss.'' (J.M.H. Shane)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but with columnists like me around, the pinata of life
lasts a lot longer.

BIBBY DENIES ALLEGATION OF RECRUITING PAYMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC men's basketball coach Henry Bibby is denying
an allegation that one of his assistants offered money to a junior
college coach to help recruit one of his players.
</P>
<P>
   College of Southern Idaho coach Derek Zeck said Wednesday that
USC assistant David Miller made the offer at the Adidas Double Pump
camp July 28-30 at Cal State Northridge to help USC land forward
Jerry Dupree, a 6-foot-7 sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'll write you a check to donate to your booster
club to recruit and get Jerry,''' Zeck said. ``I said, `I don't do
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bibby issued a statement through the USC sports
information office disputing the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements made by Derek Zeck regarding our recruitment of
one of his former players, Jerry Dupree, at the College of Southern
Idaho are completely false. Neither I nor anyone on my staff
offered any money to Mr. Zeck while we were recruiting Mr. Dupree.
Mr. Zeck's allegations that we offered money for access to Mr.
Dupree are totally false.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked very hard as a staff to build the USC
basketball program into one of the most competitive in the Pac-10,
if not the nation, and we have done so by following the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Beck did not retract the claim but said he was
under instructions from his school president not to comment
further. Beck did say he would not pursue any action with the NCAA,
although that might not stop the NCAA from conducting an
investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree left Southern Idaho last week and is now enrolled at San
Bernardino Valley College. Dupree, who is from Pomona, plans to sit
out next season to preserve his three years of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the situation told the Daily News on Thursday
that Zeck is upset that USC coaches persuaded Dupree to leave
Southern Idaho. The source also said Beck had a falling out with
San Bernardino coach John Smith, an assistant under Beck last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't really get along,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree has not committed to USC. If he does, it will give the
Trojans another impact player to join Bishop Montgomery twins
Errick and Derrick Craven and 6-11 center Rory O'Neil from
Burroughs Ridgecrest, all of whom have committed to USC for 2001 to
give the Trojans one of the top early classes in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a big-time player,'' said David Pump of Double Pump
Inc., a scouting service.
</P>
<P>
   Pump, who conducted the camp at which the alleged incident took
place, said he was unaware of any money being offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Miller) said it, maybe he was just joking around.
Sometimes people say things just trying to be funny,'' Pump said.
``But I don't know any of the details to make any comment.'' &QL;

PLANE NEARLY LANDS ON CLOSED RUNWAY, BUT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
INTERCEDES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Continental Airlines plane nearly landed on a closed runway at
Newark Airport before dawn Thursday, but an air traffic controller
noticed the impending mistake and ordered the plane up before it
could land.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, on a red-eye flight from San Francisco, was cleared
to land on one of two parallel runways at 6:15 a.m., a slow time
for the normally busy airport, said James Peters, a spokesman for
the Federal Aviation Administration. But the pilot aligned the jet,
a Boeing 757, with the left-hand runway instead of the right-hand
one.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the plane reached the runway's threshold, the air
traffic controller handling the flight noticed, Peters said, and
ordered the pilot to ``go around.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot ``powered up, circled the field, came back and landed
on the first runway,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that such ``go-arounds'' or ``missed approaches'' _ when
a pilot cannot execute a planned landing _ happened several times a
day at busy airports like Newark. Sometimes they are requested by
pilots, other times by controllers, but they rarely occur because a
plane is heading for the wrong runway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the controller and the pilot followed go-around procedures
correctly, said Peters, adding that no one was hurt and that the
flight was not delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the flight standards district office at Teterboro
Airport would investigate the incident by obtaining tapes of
ground-to-air communications and radar data showing the flight's
path.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred as an airport duty manager, Dan Harvey,
was inspecting the runway, which had been closed for routine
electrical maintenance, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey was monitoring air traffic on his car radio and heard the
controller's instructions, then saw the plane emerge from the
morning fog, said Steve Coleman, an airport duty manager.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, the Federal Aviation spokesman, said it was too early to
speculate on what caused the mistake. An automated information
service for pilots was announcing that 22-Left was closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A union official defended the air traffic controller, a 13-year
veteran. Daniel D'Agostino, president of the Newark division of the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told The Associated
Press that tapes of air-to-ground communication showed that the
pilot had misunderstood the controller's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines, said
the company did not know what instructions the pilot had received
nor how quickly he had responded to the go-around order.

 ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS TIE UP TECH WORKER VISAS  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mix two of this year's most hotly contested
political blocs, stir rapidly right before an election, and you can
pretty much expect an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happened to one of Silicon Valley's most coveted
priorities _ a big increase in temporary visas for skilled workers
that was expected to breeze through Congress with huge bipartisan
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   But with Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush speaking
Spanish to Latino voters and Democratic nominee Al Gore speaking
geek at Silicon Valley fund-raisers, tech visas proved highly
combustible.
</P>
<P>
   With just four work weeks left before Congress adjourns, the
Clinton administration is refusing to accept a big increase in
so-called H-1B visas for the high-tech industry unless the increase
is tied to amnesty and green cards for up to 2 million Latino
immigrants who have been living illegally in the United States for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the
National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigrant lobby, ``is that the
Democrats will say to Latinos, `We're on your side and they're
not.' The Republicans will say to Silicon Valley, `We're on your
side and they're not.' And both high-tech and the Latino and
immigrant communities will go home empty-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty provisions, particularly for illegal immigrants, deeply
divide Republicans, and the last thing they want is a messy vote on
Latino immigration a month before an election when their candidate
is reaching out to Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Handing out more visas for skilled labor divides Democrats, but
they do not want to be fingered for killing a top Silicon Valley
priority when their candidate is campaigning on the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the chief House co-sponsors of the H-1B bill,
San Jose Democrat Zoe Lofgren and Covina Republican David Dreier,
have deteriorated into a public spitting contest since the
administration tied the two measures together in a letter to
Congress last May.
</P>
<P>
   Things are no better in the Senate, where Majority Leader Trent
Lott and Minority Leader Tom Daschle are hurling accusations at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech lobbyists are furious. ``If H-1B legislation
ultimately fails, then the people who have unnecessarily
complicated it will have to explain to the high-tech community why
they did that,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information
Technology Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Despite personal pleas by executives from Intel's Andy Grove to
Microsoft's Bill Gates, it now appears there will be no vote to
increase tech visas. The best that either side can hope for is a
last-minute, closed-door deal between GOP leaders and the White
House, although what that could be is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this has been stalemated for five months doesn't
lead you to believe that magically it's going to resolve itself,''
said a GOP aide. ``So basically, high-tech could be out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Things started out smoothly enough last spring, when Dreier and
Lofgren teamed up to raise the cap on H-1B visas to 200,000 from
the current 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   The visas allow college-educated foreigners to work in the
United States for up to six years. The industry ran out of this
year's allotment in March. Under current law, the cap will drop to
107,500 in the next fiscal year, starting in October, and to 65,000
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies say they have hundreds of thousands of jobs
going vacant and will have to move operations overseas if they
can't get more visas. Although next year's fresh allotment of
107,500 visas becomes available in October, tens of thousands of
applications already are backed up, potentially filling next year's
quota before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable that the program could cease to function in
January,'' said Tom Stohler, director of workforce policy for the
American Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   Latino and immigration advocates just as deeply want amnesty and
green cards for immigrants who are already in this country _ many
for 15 years or more. They say these immigrants were unfairly
denied residency during the broad 1986 amnesty or were unfairly
excluded from special green card provisions covering Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   But their measures never had the high profile _ or the votes _
of the tech visas until the White House decided to link the two.
</P>
<P>
   White House economic adviser Gene Sperling asserted at the time
that no bipartisan consensus on a tech visa bill existed _ despite
many indications that one did _ and that the administration was
trying to foster ``a good-faith, bipartisan negotiation that could
lead to a quick resolution of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The result proved quite the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they saw a political trap _ a big floor debate
on a controversial amnesty where Democrats would accuse them of
being anti-Latino _ and refused to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are terrified of bringing up the Latino immigration
measures, fearing the issue would cause an explosive split between
their pro- and anti-immigration factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late amnesty will blow up the Republican conference in the
House,'' said one lobbyist. ``It's one thing to support legal
immigration. It's a whole other to go on record in support of
giving amnesty to illegal immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Lofgren heaped fuel on the fire with a letter to
Dreier, signed by Palo Alto's Anna Eshoo, Visalia's Cal Dooley and
others. The letter said the Democrats would accept a stand-alone
H-1B bill _ in effect abandoning the Latino caucus _ but also
upbraided Dreier for not including ``important fairness issues''
for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view your decision,'' the members wrote, ``with great
disappointment, as it will mean thousands of honorable persons in
the United States living lives in limbo will continue in that mode
for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreier, whose Southern California district is heavily Latino,
was enraged. ``At the 11th hour they decided to come in with two
issues that I happen to support,'' Dreier said, calling the letter
``very, very harsh, saying I unilaterally was slapping those
Latinos in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren responded, ``He's ridiculous. It's just preposterous for
him to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to move it along, we said fine, move it along,''
Lofgren said. ``The truth is, the Republicans have stalled the
Latino fairness issues for almost two years. It's the No. 1 agenda
item for the Hispanic caucus and it is a huge issue all across the
country, and if they don't understand that, they really must be out
of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley accused Republicans of trying to blame New Democrats for
blocking a big high-tech bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how anyone can accuse Democrats of blocking
this,'' Dooley said. ``We're going to vote for H-1B legislation,
but we can't vote for it if the Republicans don't bring the bill to
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, spokeswoman for Republican House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, said the Latino provisions are ``a completely separate
issue'' from high-tech visas, and that the GOP has refrained from
adding any of their own controversial riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that we should take care of this H-1B thing on
its own, not have this poisonous debate about a completely
unrelated provision,'' Davis said. ``That's exactly what the
Democrats want to turn it into. They want to have a floor debate
that's all about illegal immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Lofgren showed ``zero interest'' in the Latino
immigration provisions when drafting her H-1B bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the administration suddenly wanted to attach this
unrelated illegal immigration provision, she completely changed her
position,'' Davis said. ``I don't think there could be any more
evidence of politics at work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren conceded that she pushed the Latino provisions onto the
H-1B bill after the Clinton administration suggested it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They proposed it, and we said we thought it was a good idea,''
Lofgren said. ``If the Republicans don't think it's a good idea, we
told them to go ahead, don't do it. They're in charge, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what they're doing,'' Lofgren said of the
Republicans, ``and my fear is they don't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreier insists he will ``continue to work in a bipartisan way''
to get the visa bill through.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech lobbyists are issuing warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a huge risk for the White House on H-1Bs, not
so much for Clinton but for Gore,'' said Sandy Boyd, chairwoman of
American Business for Legal Immigration. ``Tech is a constituency
that he very much wants to have.''

VARGAS, THOMPSON FIGHT BEFORE FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidently, Fernando Vargas and Ross Thompson are eager to fight
one another Saturday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the final news conference to promote the bout with
an exchange of punches that left Vargas and promoter Gary Shaw with
bloody mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson shouted at Vargas as he stepped up to the dais and
walked past the IBF junior middleweight champ from Oxnard. Vargas
stood up and Thompson landed a right that caused blood to trickle
from Vargas' mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas then knocked Thompson from the dais with a left hook.
Thompson jumped back onto the dais and threw a punch that hit Shaw
in the jaw as he was attempting to break up the fight before
security guards restored order.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was more confident than ever that his fighter, Vargas,
would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to worry about this guy. He can't even drop
(ital)me(endital),'' the 50-ish Shaw reportedly told Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a 30-1 underdog, will be disciplined, according to
Nevada officials.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE THAT: Oscar De La Hoya has said repeatedly that he won't
fight Vargas because he objects to some of Vargas' comments. Now
Vargas, gaining rapidly on his East L.A. rival in terms of
marketability, is saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to fight him,'' he said. ``For what? He has two
losses in a row. There's no incentive there for me. Mosley
definitely beat him. He doesn't do anything for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a fighter with a name. ... He's history to me.''

HEDGE FUND FOUNDER CHARGED WITH DEFRAUDING ITS INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria)  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael W. Berger, a hedge fund manager, was charged
Thursday with defrauding 300 people who invested about $575 million
in his fund.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was charged with securities fraud and fraud under the
Investment Advisers Act. He pleaded not guilty and was released on
bail of $75,000 cash and a $100,000 bond secured by his home in the
Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, an Austrian citizen, was also required to surrender his
passport. His attorney, Sara Mogulescu, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, 28, was the manager of the Manhattan Investment Fund
Ltd., which bet that Internet and high technology stocks would
decline at a time that they rose.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
said that Berger reported annual fund earnings as high as 27.4
percent in 1997, when his company lost about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charge that Berger hid the losses from investors and
from auditors by creating fake financial records and passing them
off as the fund's actual returns. When auditors from the accounting
firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche asked for additional records to confirm
Berger's reports for 1999, prosecutors said, Berger fired them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
Berger and his management company for overstating the fund's
holdings and using misleading account statements to raise more than
$350 million from investors since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC froze the assets of the fund and the court appointed a
receiver to review the figures. Peter H. Bresnan, the SEC's
assistant chief litigation counsel, said when the fund was frozen
about $35 million remained. Some investors had removed about $140
million, leaving overall losses of about $400 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bresnan said that for the most part the fund did not attract
small investors. ``These were institutions and high-net-worth
individuals predominantly from outside the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, investors had to contribute at least
$250,000 to participate in the fund.

 GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE RATTLES SILICON VALLEY  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
trained his sights on issues dear to the heart of Silicon Valley
Thursday, saying he would do away with all corporate-donated
computers in public schools and tax every stock transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging 90-minute interview with The Chronicle, Nader
also repeated his vow to replace Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan _ whom he called ``a convenient icon for Wall Street ...
who does very little for the economy'' _ with a central banker who
would aggressively represent the interests of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party candidate and consumer advocate made the
comments on his way to a campaign stop in Sacramento and was
especially critical of high tech equipment donated to schools.
</P>
<P>
   He described such gifts as the ``addictive commercial
exploitation'' of children in American schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has been met with enthusiastic, overflow crowds on his
California campaign swing this week _ 3,000 turned out for his
appearance in Santa Cruz on Wednesday _ even as a new California
Field Poll suggested his impact on the presidential race may be
waning.
</P>
<P>
   Nader discounted the poll _ which showed his support at just 4
percent, down by nearly half from June _ as ``totally inexplicable.
Unless there are some real angry Democrats who say, `Yeah, our
lives have been saved by safer cars and cleaner food and better
drinking water _ but we don't like him because he's upsetting our
little apple cart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said his campaign, which he expects will spend about $5
million, plans to air a series of radio spots as well as a
30-minute nationwide television message.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old author and lawyer vowed to continue to challenge
both Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush to address core
Green Party issues ranging from trade and the environment to a
living wage and child poverty. But he also appeared to acknowledge
the political reality of what even supporters describe as a
quixotic presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose in November, there's going to be a Green magnet,
or a Green hammer, in the form of a significant Green Party,'' he
said. ``And it will save the two major parties. (We're telling
them) you can have the magnet, and let us pull you into the realm
of decency and responsiveness to the needs of the American people _
or you can have the hammer, which means the Green Party will just
get more and more votes. ... That's going to happen. Regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that Californians, by a 2-to-1 ratio, want
both Nader and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan to be included
in upcoming presidential debates, Nader challenged Gore and Bush to
share the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, the cynical manipulators behind these two party
candidates,'' he said. ``They really think they can lie, cheat and
flummox the public and get away with it. Because they don't think
the press is going to hold them accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who has a loyal following among progressives in the Bay
Area, was particularly animated Thursday on a number of issues
affecting Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he ``absolutely'' supports the removal of all
corporate-sponsored aid to public schools _ including all donated
computers _ a policy that could profoundly affect thousands of
local schools that receive donations from area high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public schools are the public responsibility. You cannot
mix public functions with commercial functions. All these so-called
donations come with a price, a restraint,'' he said. That price, he
added, might range from an obligation directive &LR;   &LR; to show
commercial television to restraints on ``making corporations look
like the bad guys when you teach environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader called it a ``systemic default'' dating back to
Proposition 13 that so many schools rely on corporate donations.
But ``this is a rich state,'' he said, and ``you have to have a
fundamental reassessment of what kinds of resources are going to be
made available for public need.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said schools would benefit from his tax policies that
would shift burdens to polluters, ``addictive industries ... and
for the first time, the sacrosanct of all industries, the stock
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't even a tiny little transaction tax on trillions of
dollars of stock transactions every week,'' Nader said. ``In some
states, you buy food and you pay a sales tax ... but you don't pay
a sales tax when you buy 50,000 options or 200,000 shares,'' he
said. ``And that is a huge revenue source that would help pay for
universal health care and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader argued his policy would not severly impact the millions of
small traders who have entered the stock market in recent years via
online trading firms. ``It's a matter of pennies per share, a
fraction of 1 percent,'' he said, adding that ``the top 5 percent
of the richest people in this country own 77 percent or the
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a statement that will surely raise eyebrows among Silicon
Valley's fast-paced financial crowd, Nader confirmed he would fire
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman who has been credited with
policies that have helped sustain the nation's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan is the emissary from Wall Street. I mean, do
you want your central bank controlled by bankers? On that basis,
just have the banks develop their own policy,'' he said. ``Why
should there be a government agency?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, he said, is ``a convenient icon for Wall Street. He
does very little for the economy, but they have to have some
pretext to juggle the stock market on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who he would appoint in Greenspan's place, Nader
responded: ```A person who looks at the Federal Reserve as an
instrument to expand employment and living wages and consumer
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he would also challenge what he characterized as
unrelenting attacks by corporations and broadcasters on American
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are too precious of a resource to be turned over
to a bunch of violent, addictive, pornographically oriented
corporations whose CEOS get invited to diplomatic dinners at the
White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want children just to be onlookers, couch potatoes,
getting overweight, out of shape, watching programs that show
violence as a solution to life's problems, that pump them full of
junk food, sugar and fat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A President Nader, he said, would work to ensure that ``every
community would have a children's cultural center, funded by the
government, (which is) one less B-2 bomber or joint strike force.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader also promised to get tough on broadcasters and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country allows depraved programming to go unrebutted on
the same media. ... We have to have cable channels that are devoted
to serious subjects: not just entertainment, home shopping and
sports reruns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for conditioning licenses for television stations on
the assignments of other cable services. ``Labor would get a
channel. Citizen groups would get a channel. Teacher, education,
students would get a channel. Consumer issues would get a
channel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Our position) is, the commonwealth assets owned by the people
should be controlled by the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader was reminded that _ despite his hopes that Americans
will demand higher-quality TV content _ more than 50 million of
them watched the finale of ``Survivor'' this week, an avalanche
compared to the small numbers who tune in to nightly news or
political shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People live frantic, beleaguered, tired lives getting back and
forth from work, and they want a little comic relief,'' he said.
``There's sugar, and there's nutrition. And we're not getting
enough nutrition.''

9 L.A. SCHOOLS, SITES PROBED FOR TOXINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Jason Kandel contributed to this story) 
By DANA BARTHOLOMEW 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine San Fernando Valley schools and sites are
under investigation for possible toxic contamination, including a
future Van Nuys elementary school site laced with pesticides,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by its failure to find explosive methane under the
half-built Belmont Learning Center, the Los Angeles Unified School
District and state have reopened probes of three Valley schools
near landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations center on Arminta Street and Germain Street
elementaries and Francis Polytechnic High School, where landfills
could be leaching methane gas and other emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The schools remain in use during the investigation, and district
and state officials said parents should not be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be comforting to parents, we are actively searching
out these problems and investigating them,'' said Los Angeles
school board member Valerie Fields. ``I think it's a sign of the
times that we are being pro-active.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it was built, the district found the Valerio Primary
Center site was atop soil laden with pesticides, herbicides and
lead. The dirt was hauled away prior to construction last year.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Toxic Substances Control, as a result of
new state laws enacted after the Belmont scandal, also is
conducting preliminary assessments of four new Valley school sites
and has investigated a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday at the Van Nuys New Elementary School No. 1, a
shovelful of dirt ceremoniously dug by LAUSD officials to celebrate
their first new Valley elementary school in two decades could be
carted off as contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the school is built at Vanowen Street and Columbus
Avenue, about 75 cubic yards _ or three or four double dump trucks
of dirt _ must be removed because investigators found they contain
arsenic and chemicals associated with pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Julie Korenstein maintains that DTSC
oversight is working to clean up school sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're working very well together and it will
ultimately benefit the health and safety of children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency expects to complete reports on 41 LAUSD sites
by the end of next year. Such reports are required before up to 100
new schools are built in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district finally got the sense to say, `Damn it,
we're not doing something right: Let's bring in an outside agency
before schools are constructed,''' said Angelo Bellomo, district
interim director of the environmental health and safety division.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a school that opens that doesn't have
a full (environmental) review certification from the DTSC before
kids are moved onto the site _ there will be no Jeffersons.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental scandals, such as the one centered on Jefferson
Middle School in South Los Angeles and the Belmont Learning Center
downtown, have caused legislators to bring in state oversight of
new school construction.
</P>
<P>
   At Jefferson, the district had installed a system to clean
toxins from the soil that spewed potentially dangerous matter into
air conditioning vents and across outside lunch tables.
</P>
<P>
   At Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley, methane gas
from a nearby landfill filled buildings to explosive levels on more
than one occasion while a crucial monitoring system lay inoperable
for a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, Assemblywoman
Martha Eschutia, D-Los Angeles, and Scott Wildman, D-Glendale,
pushed bills forcing the DTSC to clear sites for new school 123
districts across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts teeth into environmental oversight of California
schools,'' Wildman said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wildman said he threatened to withhold $278 million in
school funding to goad district officials to allow the DTSC to
oversee inspection of contaminated schools such as Francis
Polytechnic, school officials maintain such cooperation was
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The DTSC currently is assessing methane emissions at Arminta
Elementary in North Hollywood and Germain Elementary in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   At Francis Poly, where the talk of the campus used to center on
the dangers of explosive methane gases, the agency will monitor
emissions for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime Poly coach quit because he wouldn't work his team
into the ground on the football field knowing that children could
develop cancer from dump emissions.
</P>
<P>
   But after LAUSD tests last year revealed that few people were
affected by the gases in a five-mile radius, school officials say
few mention methane anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a huge weight has been lifted off our back,'' said
Poly Assistant Principal Dan Schar. ``One of the results of the
tests was that the coach, who had been here a long time, came back
and asked to be considered for a position as a coach again.''
</P>
<P>
   Other LAUSD staffers remain hopeful. Dorothy Allison, the plant
manager at Germain Elementary, said LAUSD inspectors arrived at the
school early this summer to conduct environmental tests for methane
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their readings were zero,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The final report is not complete.
</P>
<P>
   But Maggie Randall, a YMCA community resource director who helps
conduct before- and after-school classes at Germain Elementary
School, was surprised to learn that her school has been testing for
methane.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times I smelled gas,'' she added. ``But I didn't
know what it was. The school should have informed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Hinojosa, a DTSC chief in charge of school
investigations, said there's no reason to be alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the department had found something of immediate risk, we
would have acted right away.''

COULD IT BE UNHAPPY VALLEY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The offensive line is in shambles, the once-vaunted defense is
rebuilt and the quarterback is facing criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it's business as usual for the Penn State
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations remain high in Happy Valley as the 22nd-ranked
Nittany Lions are again viewed as major players in the
ultra-competitive Big Ten Conference, as well as on the national
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that somehow, coach Joe Paterno will pull the
Nittany Lions through their various on- and off-field conflicts and
make them winners again. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not optimistic and I am not pessimistic,'' Paterno said.
``I am just trying to be a realist about it. We have a good, young
squad that is really going to have to stay lucky and healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, good fortune has eluded the Nittany Lions, who
open the season against USC on Sunday with nine new starters on
defense. Perhaps more important are the major issues on the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Penn State's success on offense is built around the
power-running game. The Nittany Lions have the running backs _ Eric
McCoo and Larry Johnson _ to build a successful rushing attack, but
the offensive line has crumbled significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Two starters, John Blick and Eric Cole, graduated from last
year's team. The Nittany Lions also lost two potential starters
this fall when guard Jordan Caruso suffered a fainting spell in
practice earlier this month and center Joe Iorio was diagnosed with
mononucleosis.
</P>
<P>
   All-America candidate Kareem McKenzie returns at strong-side
tackle, but otherwise, the Nittany Lions have some holes to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Frank Spano, who started six games last year before being
replaced by Iorio, will start at center. And junior Joe Hartings,
who missed all of last season with a back injury, will replace
Caruso at one guard position.
</P>
<P>
   At the other guard, junior Josh Mitchell will make his first
start on Sunday against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some people who, if they stay healthy and we keep an
offensive line together most of the season, will be pretty good,''
Paterno said. ``Whether we can be as good as some of the great
lines we have had through the years, when we have had high draft
picks from tackle to tackle, that would be debatable.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Penn State is that quarterback Rashard Casey
doesn't require much protection. Casey, one of the nation's most
mobile quarterbacks, has the ability to move the pocket and make
plays happen, even if the line suffers a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that Casey's ability to focus on football has
been compromised by his arrest in May on charges of assaulting an
off-duty police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has stood behind his quarterback and denied that the
charges have been a distraction, but questions of morality continue
to follow Paterno and his decision to keep Casey in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect me to do something just because something is
alleged,'' Paterno said. ``I don't think there is anything for me
to be perplexed about. If some people out there are perplexed, I am
probably perplexed about their perplexing.''
</P>
<P>
   Less perplexing is what the Nittany Lions will try to do on
offense. McCoo and Johnson make for a strong one-two rushing punch,
if the line holds up.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Drummond returns to lead an unheralded group of receivers
that also includes Sam Crenshaw, Bryant Johnson and Rod Perry, a
junior flanker who transferred from USC following the 1998 season
and ended up at Penn State after first transferring to Cal State
Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is much less settled, now that three stalwarts from
last year _ LaVar Arrington, Courtney Brown and Brandon Short _ are
in NFL training camps and defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky
retired after 34 years as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of rebuilding the defensive unit falls to Tom
Bradley, who spent the past 22 years working with the Nittany
Lions' secondary, linebackers and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   All-America candidate Justin Kurpeikis and senior Jimmy Kennedy
return to anchor the line, and Bob Jones shifts from tackle to end
to replace Brown, but there isn't much depth after that.
</P>
<P>
   That might not hurt Penn State against USC, which doesn't have a
particularly large or quick offensive line. But it could be
disastrous against Big Ten opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers and secondary are completely new, which makes
the Nittany Lions' defense a wild-card against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Even Paterno doesn't know how an almost-entirely new unit will
react in a high-profile, nationally televised game against a
higher-ranked opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has spent much of the preseason downplaying his team's
chances this year, and at one point said he regretted agreeing to
play USC, even though he later retracted the statement. Still,
Paterno acknowledges that a loss could be devastating to his young
and fragile team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a great experience for our young players,
win lose or draw,'' Paterno said. ``The disadvantages are that you
could take a good licking. We may get a good licking. I would hope
that regardless of that we are young enough that we would have some
resilience and learn from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known how good Southern Cal was going to be, I
probably would not play it. We are in it and are going to try to
make the best of it. We are going to try to make it a positive
experience, win or lose.'' &QL;

WIN OVER VIN: THAT'S THE TASK FACING SONICS BRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now that feelings are hurt all the way around, it's
time for apologies, served with milk and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Unsolicited advice for the Sonics: Make Vin Baker's milk no-fat
and his cookies sugar-free.
</P>
<P>
   Or if the reader prefers food similes from the breakfast table:
Get the omelet pan ready, because many eggs are dripping from a lot
of faces.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm done torturing the subject of the Vin Baker-for-Patrick
Ewing trade. It is a little foolish to torture something after it's
dead.
</P>
<P>
   But there is room for a little conversation about the Sonics'
future.
</P>
<P>
   As in: Now what?
</P>
<P>
   The buzz that was created about acquiring the gimp from Gotham
has not only vanished, there is now damage to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and about half the Sonics roster, and perhaps many of
their hipster bartenders in Belltown, were all set to be swapped
around the country in the largest, most surprising NBA development
since the peek into Marv Albert's lingerie drawer.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a leak in New York and cold feet in Detroit, no
trade was made, leaving the Sonics with a roster full of scowls.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a merry group in the first place, particularly when
they learned the TV remote-control throw was not an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is acute in the case of Baker, the only NBA player
known to mist up whenever he gets within 100 feet of a Hallmark
card shop.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker, who helped hatch what would have
been the biggest trade in league history, knows he has a $10
million player who needs his nose blown and his head patted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm not worried at all (about Baker),'' Walker
said Thursday, emerging from the bunker. ``At the same time, I'm
convinced things will work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Vin, the organization likes Vin. He'll feel rejected
for awhile, and then I think he'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, liking Baker has never been an issue. He's among the
nicest galoots in the NBA. Which is part of the problem. Most folks
around the Sonics would be thrilled if he said something like,
``Wait 'til I get my hands around Wally's scrawny neck. He'll wish
he had Ewing next to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not Baker. And in this case, he shouldn't be hacked
off, even though his agents claim Baker is upset.
</P>
<P>
   According to all credible parties, the Knicks called the Sonics
a couple of weeks ago, informing them they were one of eight teams
to whom Ewing would accept a trade (he has the lone no-trade clause
among NBA contracts). Walker insists he was not shopping Baker, and
no evidence has emerged suggesting otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Walker alerted Baker on Thursday, and gave permission, should he
assent, for the Knicks to meet with him to talk it over. He did,
and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The four-team, 13-player swap was all set Sunday, just after a
couple of New York papers first published word of the
Ewing-to-Seattle segment. But by Monday, the full story inevitably
leaked. The Pistons, already burned by the loss of Grant Hill in
free agency, belatedly realized they were getting a box of rocks
and called it off.
</P>
<P>
   After various defibrillators were applied unsuccessfully this
week, the patient died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the deal's birth nor death can be called a Sonics
screw-up.
</P>
<P>
   Baker wasn't betrayed or misled. The Sonics were open to a good
offer after Baker's two sub-par years and signing a big, long,
guaranteed contract, even though few teams had the salary
flexibility to deal with Seattle. When one came along, the Sonics
would have been foolish not to engage, particularly when it
included one of the game's pre-eminent big men and brought
salary-cap relief.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, the high-risk maneuver failed. The Sonics are
left with a disheartened Baker and several dismayed reserves, all
of whom have eyebrows in permanent arch whenever the coach or
president opens his mouth, if they weren't so disposed already.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the business of trades is a fundamental part of pro
sports. Sure, athletes are well compensated to accept the hassle.
And it's not as if the failed deal cost any one of them much more
than a few phone calls to an attorney to make sure no warrants were
outstanding in the potential new city.
</P>
<P>
   But in the battle with logic, emotion always wins. Half the
roster feels dumped. No one knows how that will manifest itself,
but for a team as tumultuous as the Sonics were last year, starting
the season irked puts them about two months ahead of their record
pace a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is still more than two months away, but given the
breadth and depth of the team crater, there's no time like the
present to start shoveling.
</P>
<P>
   Sending coach Paul Westphal to the Maui training camp of the
U.S. Olympic team, where Baker and Gary Payton are, ahem, working
out, might be a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it, but it's a possibility,'' Walker
said. ``Certainly, we believe in more communication than less.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Sonics will be relying on the principals to be
stoically professional.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a bigger shocker than the trade.

72-year-old Republican who has spent much of his public life
battling the Lummis and other tribes on everything from fishing
rights to the power of governing their own affairs. In all the

that reputation on Thursday when it reported earnings of $4 billion
in the first half of 2000. Most of Hutchison's profit, however,
came from a special one-time gain after the sale of its European
mobile phone operations. And the company's encore, an ambitious
plan to offer next-generation cellular services throughout Europe,
is in doubt. Last week, Hutchison unexpectedly gave up a coveted
license to offer advanced mobile services in Germany, saying it was
too costly. Thursday, even as Li and his lieutenants basked in the

   DECIMAL-NORRIS-COLUMN (New York) _ On Monday, the New York Stock

Sometime next year, all stocks will be traded that way. That
change, in itself, is unimportant. Whether a price is quoted as a
quarter or as 25 cents is irrelevant. What is important is that
arbitrary limits on price competition are vanishing. In 1997, the
smallest change in price on the Big Board was cut in half, to
one-sixteenth of a dollar, or 6.25 cents. Now it will go to a

marketing campaign to introduce a revamped old product. Unilever is
locked in a race with Procter &AMP; Gamble to reacquaint American
consumers with the laundry tablet, a product they have not seen

   HEALTH-BUYERS-CLUBS (Undated) _ After decades of ceding control
over their care to cost-conscious health plans, consumers appear
ready to reclaim at least some of the decision-making authority
that they had in the years before managed care. Now, a number of
new companies are setting up shop, often on the Internet, to offer
people with little or no health care discount medical services,
cheaper prescription drugs and reduced rates on everything from
dental care and chiropractics to eye care and acupuncture. The new
companies, many of which operate like buyers' clubs like Costco,
are intended to let consumers and their doctors decide which
medical services they need. By Milt Freudenheim. 1,800 words.

PLANE SPINS AROUND AFTER TOUCHDOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Continental Express turboprop landing at Newark International
Airport spun around several times on the runway when its brakes
locked shortly after touchdown Thursday night, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries to the 22 passengers and crew members on
the plane, a Brazilian Embraer 145 arriving from Savannah, Ga., as
flight 4282, said Jim Peters, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But four tires on the plane blew out from the stress, Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which landed at 9:47 p.m., came to a stop 4,000 feet
from where it touched down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The runway the plane landed on, 4R, was shut down for nearly two
hours, until 11:30 p.m., after the mishap, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the brake malfunction was not known.

USC ARRIVES FOR KICKOFF CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ USC arrived for the Kickoff Classic late
Thursday night full of confidence, something the oddsmakers seem to
be lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are 3{-point underdogs to Penn State despite being
ranked higher in both top-25 polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' USC linebacker Zeke Moreno said.
``I'm glad we're the underdogs. We have to go out and show what the
Pac-10 is capable of. It's just another obstacle we'll have to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for USC's underdog status could be that this is a
glorified home game for the Nittany Lions. While the Trojans spent
more than six hours flying Thursday, Penn State was not scheduled
to leave its campus until this afternoon, and then the Nittany
Lions intended to travel by bus.
</P>
<P>
   The difference illustrates a concern for USC coach Paul Hackett.
Just how many of the fans in attendance will be rooting for Penn
State?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a home game for them in terms of playing
in Giants Stadium,'' Hackett said, before adding, ``They sold
68,000 tickets to Penn State and 5,000 to us. So it will clearly be
a neutral site.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was joking, but that is about what the fan split was in
1996, when the teams also met in the Kickoff Classic. Penn State
won that game 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett claims he isn't too worried about the disparity in
attendance because of the configuration of Giants Stadium, where
fans are not nearly as close as they would be in Beaver Stadium,
site of Penn State home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not right on top of you, like in Happy Valley, so that
should help us out,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   KNIGHT NO-NO: According to sources, linebacker Darryl Knight was
kicked off the field by an assistant coach for not paying attention
during a walk-through practice at UC Irvine. Knight left the field
and has not returned. Hackett said he has left the door open in
case Knight changes his mind.
</P>
<P>
   NO LONGER THE WEAK LINK: Kori Dickerson will try to show Sunday
that strongside linebacker is no longer a source for consternation
for the defense. Last year, teams found ways to exploit the
position by throwing to the tailback or tight end, which is the
responsibility of the strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickerson, who switched from defensive end last spring, has
already made a difference, with an eye-catching interception in
practice and nice pass-coverage skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the thing that hurt last year,'' Dickerson said. ``I
want to prove I belong. I don't think it will be a big thing
playing in my first game. I'm actually real excited because I want
to see how I can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett labeled Dickerson one of the most improved players in
training camp, and Dickerson feels more comfortable at linebacker
than he did during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all the bugs out. Spring was a learning process, I was
learning the technique,'' Dickerson said. ``But since we got to
camp, playing with Zeke has helped. He sets the standard here, and
makes sure we know we're in the right position on the field and
doing the things we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   TOURIST TIME: USC will travel to Ellis Island and visit the
Statue of Liberty as part of its sightseeing activities. The
Trojans will practice at the New York Giants' indoor practice
``bubble'' today because Giants Stadium will host an exhibition
game between the Giants and the Baltimore Ravens tonight. &QL;

OFFENSIVE LINE IS GROWING UP, AND OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's offensive line is so much bigger and
stronger this season, you'd think they'd added a pound of muscle
for every sack they allowed last season.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they're not (ital)that!(endital) much bigger, but the
much-maligned offensive line has returned stronger, more
experienced and more together (physically and mentally) than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is good news for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing 35 sacks, the offensive line was a big
reason the Bruins rushed for only 1191 yards and 2.9 per carry _
their lowest totals since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have a lot of pride,'' said line coach Mark Weber.
``They know they didn't do as good a job last year as they needed
to. But they did what's been asked. They've worked hard and
committed themselves. As they get out and play, they'll have
success.''
</P>
<P>
   All five starters _ LT Bryce Bohlander, LG Oscar Cabrera, C Troy
Danoff, RG Brian Polak, RT Mike Saffer _ started last year, as did
backup guard Blake Worley.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably bigger are the three sophomores _ Bohlander, who
gained 18 pounds; Saffer, who added 21; and Worley, who is up 25.
The only one who has slimmed down is Polak, who at 318 is ``in the
best shape he's been in,'' according to Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Polak has been moved to guard, his natural position, which has
allowed the more-athletic Bohlander and Saffer to play the tackles,
where they'll see pass-rushing ends like Cal's Andre Carter and
Alabama's Kenny King.
</P>
<P>
   Danoff has recovered from offseason knee surgery and is playing
like a veteran in his second year as a starter. Cabrera, who
suffered a high ankle sprain on the first day of fall camp and was
expected to miss the first two games, returned to practice Thursday
and is slated to start against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Weber says this unit, which has only two seniors _ Cabrera and
Polak _ reminds him of the 1997 unit, another young group with two
senior guards, Chad Overhauser and Chad Sauter. And Weber isn't
afraid to let them know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hear the coaches talking about Jonathan Ogden, Kris
Farris, Chad Overhauser and Andy Meyers,'' Bohlander said. ``Coach
Weber will always joke, `Shawn Stuart wouldn't have missed that
block or Meyers wouldn't have done that.' We weren't complete as a
unit last year. That really motivates us to prepare for this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   DEPTH CHART: The Bruins released a depth chart Thursday, but the
only thing that would qualify as a surprise is that Ryan Nece, who
has been bothered by a sore left shoulder, and Marcus Reese are
listed as co-starters at weakside linebacker. The decision is based
on Nece missing practices and Reese's performance, coach Bob Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends Gabe Crecion, Bryan Fletcher and Mike Seidman are
listed as tri-starters.
</P>
<P>
   KOCHER DOUBTFUL: Defensive tackle Ken Kocher, who sprained his
ankle Tuesday, is listed as doubtful for Alabama. He was on
crutches Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   OPPONENT INJURIES: Alabama defensive end Kindal Moorhead, an
All-America candidate, suffered what appeared to be an Achilles'
tendon injury in a scrimmage Thursday and could miss next week's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' Alabama coach Mike DuBose told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Michigan quarterback Drew Henson underwent surgery
Thursday after fracturing his foot in practice and is expected to
miss 3 to 6 weeks, leaving his status for the UCLA game Sept. 16 in
doubt. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SOUNDING THE GONG IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA
</HEADLINE>
  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first premise of game-playing is that nobody rebels against
the game itself. That premise worked almost to a fault in
``Survivor,'' the desert-island game show _ let's discard forever
the phrase ``reality-based'' _ that ended Wednesday night. If
survival had really been at stake, the first thing the 16
contestants would have done last March, when the show was taped in
the South China Sea, was take hostage the CBS camera crew and the
host, Jeff Probst, and demand $16 million for their release. It
would have made better drama and edgier viewing, something like a
remake of ``Papillon'' by the producers of ``The Blair Witch
Project.''
</P>
<P>
   But everybody obeyed the rules. The contestants banged the gong
as they entered the tribal council area. They competed in inane
contests and childish rites. They kept their mouths shut, under the
threat of stiff penalties, when they were voted off the island.
Nobody groaned, except perhaps inwardly, when Jeff Probst said,
``You created a new civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he had a point. This indeed is how new civilizations are
created. Strangers bearing complicated contracts show up in places
they deem to be uninhabited and lay down the rules. Then they name
an SUV after the civilization they displaced. The supreme test in
the final episode of ``Survivor'' was whether Probst could say the
words ``Pontiac Aztek'' without breaking the mood.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood went unbroken, at least until the ``Survivor
Reunion,'' which immediately followed the final episode and whose
host was a particularly chirpy Bryant Gumbel, who looked as though
he had just been voted off the island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Created by footage that comes straight from the genre of nature
documentaries and awash in New Age sound emitted by some
New-Age-sound sausage machine, the mood of the final episode of
``Survivor'' was in fact unbreakable. Words that once had meaning
were simply eviscerated, words like ``tribe,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Television is truly the hyperbolic machine, the medium in which
``the ultimate human experiment,'' as ``Survivor'' was billed, was
really to see whether CBS could get 50 million Americans to watch a
show for which the network could charge a fortune for commercials.
The experiment was a success.
</P>
<P>
   There they were, though, the people we had tuned in to see,
their personae sharper than ever _ Rudy, looking more and more like
a disgruntled iguana; Kelly, almost indecipherably impassive at
times; Rich, coiled fetally on the final day; and Sue, who has
given truck drivers everywhere a bad name and whose motto was ``I
never regret what I say,'' when clearly she should have. At the
last it was Kelly and Rich, the one making a plea for personhood,
the other for gamesmanship. You all know who won.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of it is that we are stuck now in
``Survivor''-survivor hell. Commercials beckon the contestants. So
does Playboy. For a time the cameras will follow Rich and Sue and
Rudy and Kelly _ and Gervase and Jenna and Colleen, too _
everywhere they go. Having played by the rules for so long, the
contestants will find it hard to buck them now. And then the real
game of survivor will begin.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 25:
</P>
<P>
   After a summer of record delays and frayed nerves, the nation's
flying public is being told the situation is untenable and will be
fixed. It is a tale we have heard before, as recently as a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays are up 10 percent from last year. This week
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater called in the key players in
commercial aviation to talk about ways to improve what is
increasingly looking like a broken system.
</P>
<P>
   There are some heartening signs that airlines, their unions and
transportation regulators are genuinely ashamed of the endurance
test flying has become. Some airlines have agreed to fly some of
their short routes at lower altitudes to alleviate congestion in
the skies, and are cutting back on their schedules to enhance their
performance. In recent years, unrealistic peak-time scheduling by
airlines at major airports has contributed greatly to delays.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no quick fixes for a system strained to its limits
by the estimated 178 million passengers who will have boarded an
aircraft this summer in the United States. That figure is up 37
percent from 1990. Clearly, the longest economic expansion in U.S.
history is as responsible for the clogged skies as any other
culprit. And thanks to the revolution in information technology,
airlines have become increasingly sophisticated at auctioning off
seats to leisure travelers that would otherwise go empty. Planes
are thus more packed than ever, making travel all the less
enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Real, systemic relief to the nation's strained aviation grid is
still a few years away, in the form of added runways at the busiest
airports and a new satellite navigation system that will free
pilots from having to stay within set flight lanes in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has already become a more
savvy and efficient traffic cop, though one bedeviled all summer by
unusually bad weather. This June saw 19 ``severe weather'' days,
compared with 5 in 1999. That helped make it the worst flying month
ever, with more than 50,000 delayed flights, or 20.5 percent more
than a year earlier. Because of the hub-and-spoke architecture of
today's airline route systems, when things go badly in one part of
the nation's air grid, it tends to affect traffic elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines' labor travails this summer did not help matters
either. Pilots at United, the nation's largest airline, turned down
overtime and called in sick because of a continuing labor dispute,
forcing the airline to cancel as many as 600 flights over a recent
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Slater has set up a task force to look at ways to enhance the
notoriously sloppy quality of information shared by airlines,
regulators and consumers. This is no small matter, as anyone stuck
at an airport and deprived of meaningful information will agree.
Too often, passengers are treated like children incapable of
handling the truth, or airlines massage facts to shift blame for
delays. If nothing else, a passenger trapped in a hub-and-spoke
nightmare is entitled to accurate information.

NORTHRIDGE FULLBACK IS A FULL BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Usually no one is concerned about a football
player who weighs 270 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he's the fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge sophomore Crayton Milton played at 240
pounds last year and entered training camp at 260. Now he's 270.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I need to get (the weight) down,'' Milton said. ``Just
think if I'm around 240. I'd be 10 times better. When I came in, I
think (the coaches) may have been concerned. But when I got out
there, they saw I was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton, who's 6 feet, isn't preoccupied with losing weight.
While coaches would like to see him shed a few pounds, Milton feels
he's just as effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing at this weight,'' Milton said. ``I'm just as fast
or faster. I'm real confident in my abilities. I started nine games
last year and I did well in spring and `Hell Week'''.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coaches don't know who will start at tailback, but Milton
has the starting fullback position secured.
</P>
<P>
   Milton said he took both sessions of summer school and worked,
which is why he wasn't running as much as he said he should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in a little heavy and we're trying to get him to to
lose some weight,'' said Daniel Escalera, CSUN's running backs
coach. ``He probably could lose a little more. But when he goes to
block he's tough to deal with. He's a big guy. Even when he was
lighter he was pretty aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have several quality running backs who employ
different running styles. Milton is big and tough to bring down.
But he'll be used in more than just short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good pass catcher,'' Escalera said. ``You can put him
out on a pattern. He's not a guy you don't throw to because he
can't catch. He can do damage downfield. He's a component of our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURY REPORT: Quarterback Marcus Brady was held out of some
drills in Thursday morning's practice because of a twinge and
soreness in the biceps muscle of his right throwing arm, according
to CSUN coach Jeff Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these injuries are nothing more than us being
conservative,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Jason Stone's shoulder popped out and popped back
in on its own during Wednesday's scrimmage, so he was held out of
Thursday's practice. ... Running back Terrelus Wright was hit in
the thigh with a helmet Wednesday and sat out Thursday. He's
expected to return to practice today _ the last day of two-a-days.
... Johnny Acosta, Jason Nicastro and Aschon Madjid, who've all
been nursing minor injuries, started limited practicing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   HICKS STILL NOT PRACTICING: Running back Matt Hicks _ who
transferred from Air Force _ still hasn't been admitted to CSUN and
therefore can't practice. ... Tight end Cory DiSanti hasn't been
admitted to CSUN either. DiSanti _ a transfer from Mt. San Antonio
College _ is waiting for transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICING POOLSIDE: Kearin decided to cancel Thursday
afternoon's practice in favor of a team swim at the University
Student Union pool. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A SMART AFRICAN ITINERARY  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 25:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has devoted unusual energy to strengthening
ties between Africa and the United States. But some of Clinton's
past efforts have led him to embrace leaders who were neither
democrats nor statesmen. The journey he embarks on Friday is more
promising.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend he will be in Nigeria, visiting President Olusegun
Obasanjo, the elected leader of Africa's most populous democracy.
On Monday he travels to Arusha, Tanzania, to join Nelson Mandela,
the continent's elder statesman, who is working to end Burundi's
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 months since Obasanjo succeeded a corrupt and
repressive military dictatorship, he has eased senior officers from
power, curbed some corruption and preached tolerance among
quarreling ethnic and religious groups. Washington has showered him
with aid, including $10 million to reform the military and $50
million to train Nigerian troops for peacekeeping. But Nigeria's
passage toward democracy has been uneven. Obasanjo has worked
poorly with the legislature and has brutally crushed unrest in the
Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will use his time in Nigeria to encourage U.S.
investment, promote democratic reforms and support AIDS education.
His visit also coincides with the start of U.S. military training
of the Nigerian peacekeepers, who bear the main burden of
maintaining order in Sierra Leone. Nigerian peacekeepers were
previously known for violating civilians' rights. Obasanjo wants to
end such abuses and has sought U.S. help to teach the skills and
discipline needed for these missions. America's own reputation will
be on the line when graduates of the training program go on duty in
Sierra Leone. Washington must vigilantly monitor their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's stop in Tanzania is meant to support Mandela's efforts
to win a Burundi peace agreement. Like Rwanda, Burundi is divided
between a ruling Tutsi minority and a large and restive Hutu
majority. Negotiations aim at getting its political parties and
armed factions to agree on ethnic coexistence and power-sharing.
Clinton's brief Africa trip usefully demonstrates U.S. interest in
African democracy and peace.

EDITORIAL: SENSIBLE RULES FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration issued guidelines this week that
would at long last allow federal funding of research on stem cells
derived from human embryos. This avenue of inquiry offers the
potential for breathtaking medical breakthroughs. Even so, the
guidelines are sure to be challenged by pro-life members of
Congress who have vowed to block the needed funding.
</P>
<P>
   The research involves taking cells from a human embryo when it
is only a week old and still just a microscopic clump of cells. The
expectation is that scientists will learn to manipulate these
versatile cells to produce the specialized tissue needed to treat
such diseases as diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, spinal cord
injuries, burns, heart disease, cancer and other maladies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet progress has been stymied for years by congressional
opponents who consider the clumps of embryonic cells a form of life
that must be protected. Although stem cell research is allowed in
the private sector, Congress has banned federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines have been written with great care to answer
many of the criticisms. The stem cells will be taken from frozen
human embryos that would otherwise be discarded after treating
infertile couples. The cells will be obtained by private companies
rather than by the researchers who receive government funds, in an
effort to skirt congressional prohibitions on funding research in
which embryos are destroyed or discarded. And there will be
multiple scientific and ethical reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence has been emerging that in some circumstances adult stem
cells might be used to achieve the same medical benefits, thus
avoiding the need to use embryos. But no one yet knows which
approach will work best with which diseases. It makes sense to give
researchers the broadest possible arsenal to cope with some of the
most devastating human diseases. &QL;

<P>
   Nations, like individuals, can react in unpredictable ways when
they are convulsed with grief and anger.
</P>
<P>
   The 118 sailors who perished on the Kursk submarine will not be
the only Russian servicemen to forfeit their lives in ugly, violent
circumstances this year. Indeed, the toll in this incident is tiny
compared with the sickening casualties which Russian forces
continue to suffer, and inflict, in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the loss of the Kursk, and the bungling that followed, have
dented President Vladimir Putin's reputation for controlled
efficiency and may yet make Russians think again about the sort of
government they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the Kursk fiasco has had a bigger effect on
Russia's national psyche than any other recent news event is that
the navy, which gave out conflicting reports of the accident and
then fouled up the attempt to find survivors, had previously
enjoyed a higher reputation than other bits of the battered defense
establishment. Now Russia's admirals look tarnished too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the repercussions from the tragedy are growing for
Russia's civilian masters. After giving the impression that he had
a tightening grip on Russian affairs, Putin and his administration
seemed to be flailing about hopelessly.
</P>
<P>
   If the correct lessons are eventually learned, the submariners
will not have died for nothing. But the affair seems bound to
affect Russia's political atmosphere and its relations with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Kursk has already boosted Russia's opposition,
both in the political arena and in the media. Only a few weeks ago,
Putin was proceeding rapidly with a plan to transform Russia's
internal balance of power in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   As the new presidential team regrouped the country into seven
``super-regions'' with Kremlin loyalists in charge, they seemed
confident of solving the abiding problem of Russia's rulers: how to
assert federal control in a sprawling land where power
disintegrates unless actively husbanded.
</P>
<P>
   But their vision leaves precious little room for what America's
founders called ``checks and balances'' on executive power _ or for
a western-style separation of powers. For the most part, Russians
have seemed ready to go along with this, preferring almost any sort
of order to the chaos that went before. That may now change.
</P>
<P>
   The families in mourning in the Russian Arctic may not yet see
it, but there is a connection between their plight and the need for
some counterweight to central authority, including robust media, in
a country where absolute power has so often corrupted its holders
absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   If the rage of the garrison community in Murmansk has been
transmitted to the nation and the world, it is only because
Russia's journalists, under renewed pressure from the Kremlin in
recent months, are still able to denounce error and dishonesty in
high places.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents can happen anywhere, but more accountable governments
are more likely to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   In defense matters, the trade-off between secrecy and
accountability is never simple; western countries do not find it
easy either. But in a democratic society, the media develop a nose
for the difference between real and invented national-security
concerns. When security is being used to mask incompetence, a
whistle is blown.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the fate of the Kursk has already focused attention
on another attempted cover-up: the refusal by officialdom to
discuss honestly the ecological danger posed by at least 100
disused nuclear submarines whose reactors could poison the Arctic
with radioactive material unless they are stored more safely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to international criticism by tackling the
problem, officials have tried to press treason charges against
Alexander Nikitin, an ex-naval officer who denounced the ecological
threat to the region through a Norway-based pressure group,
Bellona.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a fitting memorial to the sailors lost on the Kursk
if the authorities heeded Nikitin instead of persecuting him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the loss of one of their most modern submarines, and
the public anger at their handling of the incident, should prompt
Russian policymakers to reexamine basic assumptions about defense
and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the Kursk affair should be a fresh look at
the cuts and reforms needed in Russia's oversized armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been holding the ring in a dispute between Russia's
ground troops and its strategic-rocket forces over which should be
sharply reduced; in reality, both need to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Because it continued to function, and could play cat-and-mouse
games with NATO, the submarine fleet had seemed comparatively
immune from the hard choices posed by shrinking budgets. Yet its
bungling and obfuscation over the Kursk affair suggests the navy,
too, must rethink priorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging to see how many Russians, and not only the
bereaved families of the Kursk crew, feel the government was too
slow to accept assistance offered by Britain and Norway. The
message to Russia's ruling class is that xenophobia as a political
tactic _ one much favored in recent years _ does not always pay.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with a long tradition of regarding all transactions
with foreigners as adversarial, ordinary Russians seem to have
recognized that these offers of help were made in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   On this, as on the need for greater openness and accountability
over the whole affair, Russia's government would be wise to listen
to its voters. &QL;

DON'T BLAME DEREGULATION FOR THIS SUMMER'S `BROWNOUTS'

Times Syndicate is for use by clients of The Economist.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   This has been a miserable summer in California. Thanks to a
surge in electricity consumption, Californians and other Americans
have endured several power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Since brownouts were rare in the past, some wonder if recent
steps to liberalize the power market are to blame. Politicians are
meddling, arbitrarily imposing rate freezes and price caps. This
week President Bill Clinton offered federal subsidies to poor
people and small firms hit by higher power prices in California.
</P>
<P>
   A growing chorus is arguing that electricity deregulation has
gone too far and too fast. The problem is just the opposite. The
real culprits behind this summer's power failures are the muddle
and hesitation surrounding the introduction of competition in much
of America.
</P>
<P>
   In places such as Britain, Scandinavia and Australia, which
began liberalizing long ago, the transition to competitive power
has been orderly and free of mishap; consumers there enjoy reliable
power, lower prices and better service.
</P>
<P>
   California's deregulation has failed to yield such gains largely
because it neglected a variety of market realities.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will invest in generation only if the rules of the
game are clear. In America, they seldom are. That is partly because
of the country's federal structure, which has left the states to
take the initiative in electricity deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   About half have opened up their markets, but each has its own
peculiarities. This patchwork, plus changing environmental
regulation, explains why so many utilities have avoided building
new plants for years.
</P>
<P>
   State governments should base reforms on clear and consistent
rules. The federal government also needs to bring order to
interstate power trading. Regulators must break the monopoly of the
aging and overloaded distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Merely generating more power at big central plants far from
markets means little unless it can reach consumers _ and
bottlenecks on the grid mean that not enough of it does. Expanding
distribution capacity is often impossible in crowded urban areas,
and elsewhere people dislike new power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic advances in technologies such as fuel cells and
microturbines, which generate power efficiently and cleanly on a
smaller scale, may make up the shortfall. But regulators still tend
to imagine that power will flow in one direction only: from big
plants to small consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the bottlenecks, they should follow the recent move by
New York state to facilitate access to the grid for small
micropower plants.
</P>
<P>
   The other area of reform is the hardest but also the most
crucial: the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, liberalization and competition will deliver
lower electricity prices for companies and households alike.
However, in many places, retail prices remain fixed by government
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for protecting domestic households from price
volatility until a genuinely competitive retail market emerges.
However, the zeal with which politicians have introduced arbitrary
price ``rollbacks'' suggests that they may turn any exception into
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a mistake, for unless consumers see fluctuations
in prices (especially at peak times), they have no incentive to
conserve power or shift their use off-peak.
</P>
<P>
   The right way forward is to allow retail prices to fluctuate
with market conditions. This will encourage consumers to use power
more judiciously and speed the arrival of such innovations as
fixed-price ``energy service'' contracts, which promise outcomes
such as certain levels of heating, rather than merely delivery of a
set amount of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Price transparency will also allow micropower plants to buy and
sell power on the grid as demand dictates, so improving the grid's
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   In fits and starts, America is heading toward the promise of
competitive energy markets. Consumers in Pennsylvania, for example,
now pay $3 billion a year less for their electricity than they did
before 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The populism and shortsightedness of its regulators and
politicians must not stop California from getting there too. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Politics is always an illogical business. But two of
the hardest things to explain in the current election are the
general ingratitude and indifference of the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the consensus that the country is on the right track,
very few people want to give much credit to the Clinton
administration (or at least its chosen heir, Al Gore). Similarly,
although the election is both close and important, with both the
White House and Congress up for grabs, the turnout will be
abysmally low.
</P>
<P>
   There are many answers to these riddles _ from the assumption
that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan matters more
than President Bill Clinton to the current addiction to
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing often lurks behind the indifference and
ingratitude: an obsession with local issues. For many Americans,
parking now matters more than prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   One good place to look at this is Chicago. Its most famous
mayor, Richard J. Daley, ruled the city through a ward system,
which not only allowed local aldermen to solve local problems but
also linked local politics to the national ticket (Daley famously
delivered Illinois to Jack Kennedy in 1960).
</P>
<P>
   One of Daley's sons is now mayor, the other the chairman of the
Gore campaign. But today the focus of the city's ward system seems
to be entirely local; there is no connection to any national
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, Lincoln Park, a prosperous area of the
city. To any visitor, including Bill Clinton (who dropped in
earlier this month), the signs of urban renaissance are pretty
clear. Crime and unemployment have plunged; property values have
shot in the opposite direction. The public schools are still dicey,
but most people think it is Mayor Daley's job to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear much about Washington in Lincoln Park politics.
What you do hear about is property taxes. The same skyrocketing
urban property values that have made many families rich on paper
have also pushed up taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax hikes after the recent three-yearly assessment by the
city were especially brutal. In Lake View, a neighborhood just
north of where Clinton visited, the median tax bill climbed 53
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are fears that the artists, small manufacturing
businesses and working-class residents that have always given
Lincoln Park a diverse, slightly Bohemian feel will be driven out.
</P>
<P>
   People also worry about the folks who are moving in. Wealthy new
neighbors do not just buy houses; because land is scarce, they
often buy houses, knock them down, and then build bigger houses
that tower over other structures on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, large national retailers are eager to go where the
money is. The list of chains looking for space around Lincoln Park
includes Home Depot, Costco and IKEA _ all names that remind local
residents of suburban shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's host, DePaul University, has been gobbling up
green space, adding 10 big buildings in Lincoln Park in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   One result: nobody has enough room to park.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's zoning laws, written in 1957, require that property
developers provide one parking space for each new unit of housing.
In reality, new families arrive with several cars, at least one of
which is likely to be a hulking sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents would like to see street parking limited to
permit holders; local businesses claim it would be their death
warrant. ``It's one of the most divisive issues I've ever
encountered, outside of dogs,'' says Judy Casey, president of the
Sheffield Neighborhood Association.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dogs. Chicago residents are now more likely to have a mutt
than they were a decade ago, pitting an estimated 750,000 dogs and
their owners against non-dog owners in the battle for open space.
(If your labrador frolics off the leash in a local park, prepare
yourself for a visit to the criminal court.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sheffield Neighborhood Association is wrestling with the
weighty policy issue of whether or not a local park should have a
drinking fountain exclusively for dogs, and if so, where it should
be located.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the frustrations have bubbled over. Community activists
in Lincoln Square, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood on Chicago's
northwest side, recently took to the streets to protest against the
opening of a third Starbucks coffee shop in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Starbucks comes in,'' explained one protester, ``there
goes the diversity. Property values go up, rents go up, taxes go
up. A Starbucks is the first sign that much worse things are going
to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these complaints are beginning to bubble up to the
national stage. At the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, Beverly O'Neill, the mayor of Long Beach, Calif., told her
peers that prosperity-related pressures are the number one problem
facing the country. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She had a sympathetic audience. In San Francisco, where
high-tech wealth has had an even more pronounced effect, the
entrepreneurs who were once the pride of the city now find
themselves referred to as ``e-holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty thousand San Franciscans signed a petition supporting a
November ballot initiative that would limit the growth of
technology companies in the city. A group calling itself the Yuppie
Eradication Project has been slashing the tires of sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Such local resentments can be found in suburbs, farms and cities
_ but they seem particularly ungrateful in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, American cities are far more pleasant places
to live than they were a decade ago. One Chicago neighborhood
leader recalls that 30 years ago his main challenges were cracking
down on slum landlords, massage parlors and street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, even mayors with forceful local records, such as
Rudy Giuliani in New York, have had trouble in reminding the locals
of those achievements (his latest crime: spraying for mosquitoes).
</P>
<P>
   And the gap between local and national politics seems far
greater: zoning and property taxes seem no more on the mind of
George W. Bush and Gore than missile defense is on the mind of
Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
   The ``friendship'' that people like the older Daley enjoyed with
voters, and the involvement Chicagoans once felt in national
debates, has ebbed away into a series of local squabbles over
things like utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given a new twist to an old saying. If you want a
friend in American politics, get a dog (and do please keep him on a
leash). &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ask any unmarried, overworked middle-class person
looking for love, and he or she will tell you it all seems
hopeless. Finding Mr. or Miss Right is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the median age of marriage for women in the United
States was 20, and it was not much more for men. Most well-educated
women met their husbands at university, where there was an ample
supply of suitable partners. Men could do the same, or find a wife
in the suburbs where they grew up, or marry a girl in the office.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage age has crept steadily upwards since then. The Ally
McBeal classes, in particular, are usually finished with university
and graduate school before they grow serious about finding a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   A rising divorce rate means that more older people are searching
for love for a second or a third time.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past quarter of a century there has been no reliable
institution where you can search for a prospective mate, says
Bernard Beck, a sociologist at Northwestern University at Evanston,
Ill. Places like singles bars or health clubs often leave much to
be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is always the workplace, where so many
Americans seem to be spending an increasing amount of their time.
But the lawyers are busy thwarting that possibility: insurers
against sexual-harassment litigation are starting to tell companies
that they ought to have ``no-dating'' policies.
</P>
<P>
   And even employees who regard such restrictions as Orwellian
tend to be hesitant about flirting in the office. Some
relationships are bound to fail, and the only thing worse than a
rotten colleague is a rotten colleague who is also an ex-lover.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a single person to do? The answer, it appears, is to
think like a company. You should ``outsource'' your social calendar
to one of an increasing array of sophisticated matchmaking services
that provide ``assisted dating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Just Lunch (IJL) is a firm that arranges ``pre-screened
lunch dates'' for busy professionals. IJL customers pay $1,000 a
year for a minimum of 12 dates. After each date, the customer
reports to the firm on the quality of the match. In theory, each
date should bring him or her closer to the desired perfect partner.
</P>
<P>
   The firm does its business the old-fashioned way, face to face.
But the Internet is almost certainly going to be a growing part of
the dating business.
</P>
<P>
   Match.com, for instance, claims 3 million members since it
began, and 38,000 new ones each week. It charges $40 a month to
match members with others whom the computer deems compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about numbers, and it's also about time,'' says Fran
Greene, Match.com's Director of Flirting and Dating. Indeed: your
correspondent received 95 matches as soon as he started his trial
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the process involves screening. Goodgenes.com is open
only to graduates of Ivy League universities and a handful of other
superior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   JDate.com caters to Jewish singles. Singleswithscruples.com is
``an Internet dating site for people who have morals and a sense of
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which guarantees anything. ``The probability of
deception is quite high,'' says Norval Glenn, a sociologist at the
University of Texas. (Your correspondent now wonders whether he
should have mentioned in his Match.com profile that he is married
with two children.)
</P>
<P>
   Many sites do not use real names until members have grown
comfortable with one another. The advice that one Internet dating
executive offers for the first face-to-face meeting sounds like a
Cold-War espionage manual: meet in public, drive yourself, let
someone know where you will be.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger problem is more banal. Since most matches
arranged in such a way are liable to fail, the Internet may
generally be introducing singles to even more people they don't
particularly like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to kiss a lot of frogs,'' concedes Laurie, a
37-year-old who works in Silicon Valley and joined Match.com after
learning that her roommate was secretly already a member. She was
further encouraged when her roommate married an online match.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of Laurie's matches was interested in Gregorian
chants. Another asked her to compare herself to a character on
``The Simpsons.'' And then there was the guy with the Budweiser
watch and gold nugget ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be such a time-saver in the long run,'' says Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   It is really more like shopping. You go out looking for one
thing, and come back with something else. But for single people
longing for a suitable partner, here at least is a different way of
finding one. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of attitudes
towards public education released this week found that a majority
of Americans feel it is important to put ``a qualified, competent
teacher in every classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association
(NEA), the main teachers' union, wasted no time in pointing out
that this will require raising teachers' salaries so that more
qualified candidates will enter the profession and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has won cheers from Democrats for suggesting a pay hike.
Would it really help? Work over the past five years by two
economists, Dale Ballou at the University of Massachusetts and
Michael Podgursky of the University of Missouri, suggests that the
quality of America's teachers has more to do with how they are paid
rather than how much.
</P>
<P>
   The pay of American public-school teachers is not based on any
measure of performance (the NEA opposes merit pay); instead, it is
determined by a rigid formula based on experience and years of
schooling, factors that Podgursky calls ``massively unimportant''
in deciding how well students do.
</P>
<P>
   The uniform pay scale invites what economists call adverse
selection. Since the most talented teachers are also likely to be
good at other professions, they have a strong incentive to leave
education for jobs in which pay is more closely linked to
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   For dullards, the incentives are just the opposite. The data are
striking: when test scores are used as a proxy for ability, the
brightest individuals shun the teaching profession at every
juncture. Clever students are the least likely to choose education
as a major at university.
</P>
<P>
   Among students who do major in education, those with higher test
scores are less likely to become teachers. And among individuals
who enter teaching, those with the highest test scores are the most
likely to leave the profession early.
</P>
<P>
   Ballou and Podgursky have studied the effects of a nationwide 20
percent real increase in teacher salaries during the 1980s. They
conclude that it had no appreciable effect on overall teacher
quality, in large part because schools do a poor job of recruiting
and selecting the best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even if higher salaries lure more qualified candidates
into the profession, the overall effect on quality may be offset by
mediocre teachers who choose to postpone retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ballou and Podgursky also take aim at teacher training. Every
state requires that teachers be licensed, a process that can
involve up to two years of education classes, even for those who
have a university degree or a graduate degree in the field they
would like to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein would have had to go back to the local community
college for 12 months of training in pedagogy and first aid before
he could teach high-school physics.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this system does little to lure in graduates of top
universities or professionals who would like to enter teaching at
mid-career.
</P>
<P>
   None of this proves that all training courses are useless _ or
that America's teachers are being paid enough. Many patently
deserve more money. Good ones would get it under any system with
merit pay. But the current system of training, licensing and pay
could not have been better designed to protect bad teachers from
competition. &QL;

<P>
   DETROIT _ Now that they were wired to the Internet, Carol and
Bill Tragar thought it would be easy to order their dream car.
After all, more than two-thirds of all American new-car buyers are
turning to the Web at some point in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For the Tragars, that meant surfing one of the many car sites
where consumers can ``spec out'' a vehicle equipped exactly the way
they want, then find a dealer near their home.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part. But they only had to visit one dealer to
discover the Internet's big lie. It may be easy to specify the car
you want. Getting the vehicle is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tragars were told they would have to wait up to three months
to have what they desired. So, like nearly 90 percent of American
buyers and 80 percent of Europeans, they settled for something
standard on the forecourt.
</P>
<P>
   Things are about to change, though, as car makers prepare to
launch a concept known as either Order-to-Delivery or
Build-to-Order (BTO).
</P>
<P>
   Harold Kutner, head of purchasing for General Motors, calls it
``the most dramatic change I've ever seen in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but all it means is that a motorist will be able to
order a car customized at the factory without having to grow old
waiting to have it delivered.
</P>
<P>
   BTO is based on a system pioneered by Dell Computer: go online
or call a freephone number, and your tailored product will be
assembled and shipped within days.
</P>
<P>
   A car is a far more complex product than a computer, but many
manufacturers believe they can cut the order-to-delivery time to
less than two weeks. The Internet will play a critical role in
making BTO work.
</P>
<P>
   In the system that GM is building, a customer picks his
preferred package and, within seconds, the transaction reaches a
central database that checks to make sure the order matches an
approved design. The car is then scheduled for assembly, based on
the earliest date that parts can be shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers have all sorts of reasons to be interested in BTO.
Giving a customer precisely what he wants is a sure way to
strengthen his loyalty. And studies show that buyers are likely to
load on more expensive options when they custom-order.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, says GM's Kutner, ``I'd consider myself a failure if
I don't take 50 percent out of (overall) inventory in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least $20 billion in parts on hand at any one time to
support assembly systems, the savings on carrying costs alone could
add up to several hundred million dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is also experimenting with a BTO system at its plant in
Ontario, Canada, which builds Camry Solara coupes and convertibles.
Ford, meanwhile, has launched a BTO program that allows buyers in
Canada's capital city of Ottawa to custom-order any of four models.
</P>
<P>
   But car firms are reluctant to make too many promises. Ford's
Brian Kelley expects that it will take a series of halfway measures
before BTO becomes the normal way of doing business in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The first step he dubs ``build-to-demand,'' where companies like
his try to guess ahead what buyers will request and build
``predictive'' models, so that dealers will have a more desirable
mix of cars on hand.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Cadillac division is trying that approach already. A
network of regional vehicle depots stock the most popular paint and
gadget configurations, allowing dealers to reduce their
inventories; customers can get all but the most unusual packages
within a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is effective, but it means that Cadillac must carry
the costly burden of stocking those depots _ so GM is trying to set
up an across-the-board BTO system in America by as early as 2003.
It even plans to place cameras along its assembly lines, so that
buyers will be able to watch their vehicles being built.
</P>
<P>
   Will the car makers match the nimbleness of the Dell system?
Probably not, but there are plenty of reasons why they need to try.
</P>
<P>
   And if they succeed, customers like the Tragars will at last be
able to get what they want _ without having to choose between
second-best and an interminable wait. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody loathes it, but everybody does it. A recent
poll showed that 40 percent of Americans, the world's most lavish
tippers, hate the practice.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so arbitrary, after all. Why does a barman get a tip,
but not a fast-food worker or a doctor who saves lives?
</P>
<P>
   In America alone, tipping is now a $16 billion-a-year industry _
all the more surprising since it is a behavioral oddity. Consumers
acting rationally ought not to pay more than they have to for a
given service.
</P>
<P>
   Tips, which are voluntary, above and beyond a service's
contracted cost, and delivered afterwards, should not exist. So why
do they?
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that tips both reward the efforts of
good service and reduce uncomfortable feelings of inequality. The
better the service, the bigger the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations no doubt explain the purported origin of
tipping _ in the 16th century, boxes in English taverns carried the
phrase ``To Insure Promptitude'' (later just ``TIP'').
</P>
<P>
   But according to new research from Cornell University, tipping
no longer serves any useful function. The paper analyzes data from
2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation between larger tips and better service was very
weak: only a tiny part of the variability in the size of the tip
had anything to do with the quality of service. Customers who rated
a meal as ``excellent'' still tipped anywhere between 8 percent and
37 percent of the meal price.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping is better explained by culture than by economics. In
America, the custom has become institutionalized: it is regarded as
part of the accepted cost of a service. In a New York restaurant,
failing to tip at least 15 percent could well mean abuse from the
waiter. Hairdressers can expect to get 15-20 percent, the man who
delivers your groceries $2.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, tipping is less common; in many restaurants,
discretionary tipping is being replaced by a standard service
charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on
at all.
</P>
<P>
   How to account for these national differences? Look no further
than psychology. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell paper's
co-author, countries in which people are more extrovert, sociable
or neurotic tend to tip more.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping relieves anxiety about being served by strangers. And,
says Lynn, ``in America, where people are outgoing and expressive,
tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think
less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.''
</P>
<P>
   Icelanders, by contrast, do not usually tip _ a measure of their
introversion and lack of neuroses, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While such explanations may be crude, the hard truth seems to be
that tipping does not work. It does not benefit the customer. Nor,
in the case of restaurants, does it actually incentivize the
waiter, or help the restaurant manager to monitor and assess his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The cry of stingy tippers that service people should ``just be
paid a decent wage'' may actually make economic sense. &QL;
</P>

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Though Internet firms have found many a strange
bedfellow, who would have guessed that a dalliance with
philanthropy would prove fertile?
</P>
<P>
   Any self-respecting charity sends newsletters and solicits
donations over the Web, yet it is a clever capitalist who can make
money out of online giving. Now a cottage industry offering
services to not-for-profit types is trying.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, GreaterGood.com, a two-year-old Seattle firm,
is the biggest of the bunch. It is essentially a matchmaker,
bringing together consumers, charities and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Web site and you find a series of shopping villages,
each run for the benefit of a particular cause _ UNICEF, say, or a
local school _ and with links to the Web sites of retailers such as
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   At these sites, a small box reminds you that a percentage of
money spent will be donated to charity; an equal portion goes to
GreaterGood.
</P>
<P>
   Although online retailers, who charge the same price to a
GreaterGood-referred customer as to a regular one, see their
margins shaved by paying a commission, they are eager to take part,
happy to encourage others to send them customers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amazon, the granddaddy of Web retailers, has been
running such a pay-the-referrer scheme for years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of GreaterGood's business comes from shoppers following a
link from their favorite charity's site, or reading about the
service in a newsletter. Still more customers are drawn in by stage
two of the marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   In February, GreaterGood bought The Hunger Site, a Web site that
shot to Internet stardom as soon as it launched. The gist is: look
at a few advertisements, help end hunger.
</P>
<P>
   When a user clicks on the site's ``donate free food'' button, he
is shown half a dozen ``banner ads,'' the colorful rectangles
festooned with slogans that have become ubiquitous _ and
increasingly ignored _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For reaching a prospective customer, each advertiser pays half a
cent (the equivalent of a quarter of a cup of food aid) to the
site, which passes it on to the U.N. World Food Program. Which is
good for everybody: users feel virtuous, advertisers entice
customers, and the hungry get food, lately about 1,000 tons a
month.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a win for GreaterGood, whose own message accompanies
each batch of ads, exhorting users to help even more by visiting
its site and shopping for hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   GreaterGood has a patent pending for its Hunger Site model, a
worrying development for genuine nonprofit sites, such as
ClearLandmines.com, which also use banner-ad profits to help good
causes.
</P>
<P>
   GreaterGood recently opened its newest variation on the theme,
TheRainForestSite.com, and has registered scores of other domain
names, including TheHelpingWomenSite.org.
</P>
<P>
   It may not like competitors, even nonprofit ones, muscling in on
its turf. Although GreaterGood is yet to break even, it is already
considering a stock market listing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ironically, the company is part of a breed much threatened
by the Internet: a bit of Web publishing and helpline-manning
aside, it is simply an intermediary, adding little value for its
cut of the action.
</P>
<P>
   That may be fine for now; with revenues still low, charities
seem happy to let it beaver away. But if commissions continue to
grow, charities may soon tire of losing half and try to do without
GreaterGood, dealing with retailers directly.
</P>
<P>
   As many a matchmaker has found, when a couple hits it off, they
end up more loyal to each other than to the soul, however helpful,
who introduced them. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Your product, despite loyal customers, is not
selling, and your protests against heavy taxes go ignored. Sales
are suffering. If only some of the tax burden could be shaken off.
What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Why, team up with your foreign partners to smuggle, of course.
And, according to the Canadian government, this is exactly what
several North American tobacco companies did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit currently winding its way through the courts in the
United States is a tale of conspiracy and intrigue as compelling as
any John Grisham novel.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's case rests on four facts, disputed by nobody, and a
crucial piece of conjecture. The facts are these. First, from 1981
until 1994, the Canadian government increased cigarette taxes, more
than doubling the retail price of a pack in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Canada's cigarette exports, largely to the United
States, boomed 36-fold at the same time. True, both the
Canadian-American free-trade agreement and later the North American
free-trade deal came into effect during this period; true again, no
two countries anywhere trade back and forth more than America and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Yet consider facts three and four. Neither Canadians nor
Americans, eager traders though they are in general, are
particularly keen about each other's tobacco blends; rare is the
year when Canadian exports capture more than 1 percent of the big
neighbor's market.
</P>
<P>
   And, lastly, cigarette exports fell back again after the
Canadian government drastically cut tobacco taxes in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden boom, then the sharp drop? Canada's lawyers
connect the dots to draw an interesting picture.
</P>
<P>
   As galloping taxes began to trample profits, cigarette
manufacturers in Canada started exporting to agent companies south
of the border. (Tobacco exports remained largely tax-exempt.)
</P>
<P>
   Although these companies were purportedly selling the cigarettes
in the United States or re-exporting them to third countries, they
were really _ runs the accusation _ handing them to smugglers, who
then carried them back across the 5,522 miles (8,893 km) of border
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, even tobacco firms did not deny that some sort of
smuggling was going on, though they denied responsibility for it.
Smuggling was rampant, lobbyists agreed, but the blame lay with
high taxes, not with the manufacturers, who were simply filling
orders.
</P>
<P>
   After protests from sellers in Quebec, irate over sales lost to
smugglers, Canada relented, slashing taxes dramatically. At this
point, opinions diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's lawyers argue that at least one American cigarette
company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, helped to smuggle
cigarettes made by its Canadian sister-company across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing is RJR the firm named in the case. The Canadian
wing, RJR-Macdonald, has been badly hit by two recent defeats in
court.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago a subsidiary based in the United States,
Northern Brands International, pleaded guilty to smuggling and was
fined $15 million. Then Leslie Thompson, a former senior manager at
RJR-Macdonald and NorthernBrands, was sent to prison for his part
in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes Canadian lawyers believe that they can trace the
smuggling across the border. They have yet to prove their point. A
lower-court judge in the United States said in June that his
country's courts could not enforce Canadian tax laws, and handed
Canada a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The case is now on appeal and the Canadians are optimistic.
Anti-smoking groups are happy, too, because the Canadian government
seems likely to raise taxes back to the 1994 level.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has had a horrible few months. First a
Miami jury awarded an amazing $145 billion in punitive damages to
sick Florida smokers. Then a report by the World Health
Organization, its great enemy, accused it of a ``systematic
effort'' to discredit the WHO, and of trying to get the WHO's
budget cut.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also faces smuggling-related lawsuits from the
European Union, Ecuador and, of all places, Colombia. If the appeal
in the Canadian case goes against it, share prices _ like those
cigarettes _ may head sharply southwards. &QL;

   PRAGUE _ In the brothels off Wenceslas Square, in central
Prague, sexual intercourse can be bought for $25 _ about half the
price charged at a German brothel. Step inside and upstairs, past
the strip joint and the peep show, and the cut-price approach
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Spent condoms fill plastic buckets in the corridor; stained
carpets line sweaty little rooms; young women guard the doorways,
wearing not so much bored as vacant expressions.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses of several hundred trafficked women _ strangled,
shot, or beaten to a pulp _ fetch up around Europe each year. Many
more bodies, Europol reckons, are never found.
</P>
<P>
   The organized gangs of traffickers who lure and smuggle young
women, mostly from Eastern and Central Europe, into prostitution
are ruthless. In January, a group of 22 women being led across a
mountain range into Greece via Bulgaria were abandoned by their
traffickers when a blizzard struck. Two women froze to death before
Greek border troops could reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative estimates put the number of women smuggled each
year into the European Union and the more prosperous Central
European countries at 300,000, though not all end up in the sex
trade. But the figure could well be double that.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 20,000 women in 600 or so brothels in the Czech
Republic alone, most of them foreigners smuggled into the country.
Ukraine's interior ministry reckons that many of the 400,000
Ukrainian women who have left the country since independence have
been drawn into the sex industry.
</P>
<P>
   While the illicit and violent nature of the trade makes accurate
monitoring impossible, a clear pattern seems to have emerged since
communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Simplistically, there is a two-step movement of women from east
to west. First, of Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans and Belarussians
into the trade in Central Europe; second, of these women and
Central Europeans to western cities.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Slav women have supplanted Filipinas and Thais as
the most common foreign offering in Europe's brothels.
</P>
<P>
   Some trafficked women do prosper in the sex business, which in
Europe is thought to be worth some $9 billion a year. They are the
ones who graduate to work for the lucrative escort agencies. But
many more, seduced by false promises of a better life, are
financially, physically and mentally scarred.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment follows a familiar pattern. A young woman, say from
provincial Ukraine, almost certainly under 23 and often far
younger, is approached by a trafficker. She is offered employment,
usually as a waitress or maid, in Central or Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Having agreed, her underground journey takes her to a squalid
way station. There, her passport and identity papers are stolen,
and she is sold, more or less as chattel, to brothel owners _ many
of them based in Germany, the chief destination for trafficked
women _ for a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If she resists, she is isolated, beaten, and often raped. Thus
broken, she begins her brothel career, held by means of physical
abuse and debt bondage in involuntary sexual servitude.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or so, the EU has been much exercised by the
trafficking of immigrants in general. But that of women is a
particularly tricky category.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the mainly Russian-speaking gangs who dominate
this business _ Albanian gangs concentrate on drugs _ are highly
organized. Often, the best that any police raid can hope for is to
disrupt, or divert, the flow of women.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is a powerful silence on the part of the
women themselves. ``Who is to say this Russian is a student and
this one is a prostitute?'' asks one Czech police chief. ``Unless
someone complains, we are powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   This also makes it difficult for human-rights groups to help.
``Their concern is survival, not feminism,'' says Iveta Bartumkova,
of La Strada, an organization which assists victims of trafficking
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Various ideas are circulating about how to combat this trade. In
the Czech Republic, where prostitution is already legal, a new law
is being drafted which is designed to crack down on ``unlicensed''
streetwalkers, while enforcing health and labor standards at
state-sanctioned brothels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot suppress,'' argues Radim Bures, of the country's
organized-crime unit, ``but we can regulate prostitution, just as
the Dutch and Austrians do, in order to minimize the negative
aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-trafficking groups think greater transparency might
empower the prostitutes, who often receive, at best, a meager share
of the cash paid by their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is also pushing EU members to bring in a
minimum common penalty for the crime of trafficking itself.
</P>
<P>
   A second approach is education. The International Organization
for Migration, a United Nations body, has underwritten several
graphic campaigns in Central and Eastern Europe to stress to young
girls the risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   The list of needs is long: safe houses for those fleeing pimps;
witness protection for those ready to speak out; medical and
psychiatric help. An accompanying effort to educate the men who pay
for sex, suggest campaigners, might help curb demand.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of moralizing, however, will have much effect unless a
broader problem feeding the supply of women is confronted: the
feminization of poverty in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of communism, women have experienced a
disproportionate share of economic hardship. Two-thirds of Russia's
unemployed, for example, are women.
</P>
<P>
   Women have increasingly become breadwinners for drunk or absent
husbands, even as they have been squeezed from the workplace thanks
to industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of opportunity compels East European women to take risks
their peers in Western Europe would never contemplate. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   TOKYO _ A stone's throw from The Economist office in the
Otemachi financial district of Tokyo lies Japan's most accursed
plot of land: a shrine erected to pacify the furious spirit of
Taira no Masakado, a vindictive Japanese warrior who lost a power
struggle against the emperor in the year 940 and had his head
lopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the ghost is supposed to have brought misfortune
upon an arrogant establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, after the Kanto earthquake killed 130,000 people, the
Ministry of Finance decided to halt work on new offices being built
on top of the shrine because 14 of its officials, including the
minister himself, had died during construction.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, plans to build a car parking lot over the
sacred tomb were hastily reconsidered after terrified city
officials, not to mention repeated accidents, made the sacrilegious
American occupying forces think twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, superstitious office workers in nearby banks and
trading firms avoid turning their desks and backs disrespectfully
to the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Masakado's ghost is not alone in Tokyo. The city has always had
its haunted places and wandering souls, and Tokyoites remain a
superstitious lot.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Edo era (1600-1868), telling ghost stories has
been a traditional way to while away the sweltering summer
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   August is the month of the Buddhist Obon festival when ancestors
from the netherworld make their annual visit to their former homes
to dance and celebrate, and families from Tokyo and other big
cities return to their ancestral homes to welcome back the spirits.
</P>
<P>
   As the living and dead make their travel plans, Japan's ghost
season gets truly under way. The kabuki theatres run their
traditional ghost plays. Programs about supernatural experiences
and photographic phantasms abound on television. Cinemas show
spine-chilling films announced on billboards dripping in
signwriter's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters organize gut-testing nighttime trips to cemeteries to
gauge one another's courage. And for the less brave, the Hato Bus
company arranges sightseeing tours to the sites of famous Japanese
hauntings.
</P>
<P>
   But ghost stories in Japan are more than mere summer
entertainment. The constantly evolving Japanese ghost story
reflects the changes in the country's social and cultural values.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded wraith appears in the 10th-century ``Tale of
Genji,'' but many of Japan's traditional ghost stories come from
the Bunka-Bunsei period in the early 19th century. This renaissance
in ghost stories occurred when the urban entertainment culture of
Edo (old Tokyo) reached its zenith of creative decadence.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Japan's folk art of the day _ including pulp fiction,
puppet theatre, storytelling, kabuki, scroll painting and woodblock
prints _ vengeful spirits were among the most popular motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and socialites played a party game called hyaku
monogatari where they told each other 100 ghost stories through a
summer night. One hundred candles were lit for the occasion, with
one blown out after each tale. After the 100th candle, the room was
plunged into darkness and something spooky was supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Such ghost-revellers would have expected to see a scowling,
long-haired woman in a white funeral gown and with no feet _ the
classic image of the wife who, betrayed and murdered by her
husband, returns from the dead to punish her tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, such as the eminent Yukio Hattori, have argued that
such apparitions reflected the low status of women in feudal Japan,
not to mention the belief that women were thought to be more
spiteful and attached to life than men.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries on, Japanese spooks have become more modernized
and westernized, just like Japanese society itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Second World War fuelled a whole corpus of supernatural
tales. People saw apparitions of dead soldiers and heard the
wailing voices of bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dreams,'' Akira Kurosawa has an eerie episode in which an
officer who survived the war is haunted by a platoon of his men who
died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   A different set of troubled souls haunt contemporary Japanese.
The most emblematic ghost of the 1990s _ popularized in the
``Ring'' series of books that sold more than 5 million copies _ is
a cursed videotape that kills viewers within a week. The only way
to avoid the curse is to copy the tape and force unsuspecting
friends to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Such supernatural terrorism, combining modern technology with
traditional ghost motifs, has become increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide, long associated with spiritual reincarnation in Japan,
has likewise become an increasing source of ghostly tales. With the
country's worst recession since the war driving bankruptcy,
violence and unemployment to record levels, more than 31,000 people
in Japan committed suicide last year _ a 30 percent increase over
two years before.
</P>
<P>
   The prominence of tales about bullied children and stressed-out
salarymen haunting their schools and offices after taking their own
lives adds a sad postscript to this tragic statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horror stories increasingly mirror contemporary ills,'' says
Hideki Sato, the editor of Kadokawa Horror Novels which published
the ``Ring'' series. Not satisfied with mere fringe manias, more
and more readers want the macabre of real life stirred into their
horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kadokawa's newest chillers, ``Aoi Honoo,'' is a
psychothriller about a juvenile murderer. After a spate of recent
murders by knife-and-bat-wielding teenagers, this comes as no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese media's fascination with the killings of the past
year does seem to have pushed many of the country's more
traditional ghosts into the shadows. Despite that, nostalgia for
the headless warrior or long-haired harridan has not vanished
completely.
</P>
<P>
   At times Japan's ghosts from the past strike back. The mighty
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan had its head office in Otemachi on
an urban site that overshadowed the Masakado shrine. Rumor has it
that the bank did not show decent respect to its spiritual
neighbor, and was too mean to pay for proper Shinto purification
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The LTCB failed in 1998 and soon passed into foreign hands _ in
Japanese banking, a fate worse than death. That surely cannot have
been mere coincidence. &QL;

   PRAGUE _ Highly organized, ruthless gangs of sex traffickers are
luring and smuggling young women, mostly from Eastern and Central
Europe, into prostitution throughout the continent. There are some

most of them foreigners smuggled into the country's thriving sex
industry. While the illicit and violent nature of the trade makes
accurate monitoring impossible, a clear pattern has emerged since

   TOKYO _ Japan's annual ghost season is underway. Ever since the
Edo era (1600-1868), telling ghost stories has been a traditional
way to while away the sweltering summer evenings. The kabuki
theatres run their traditional ghost plays. Programs about
supernatural experiences and photographic phantasms abound on
television. Youngsters organize gut-testing nocturnal trips to
cemeteries to gauge one another's courage. But ghost stories in
Japan are more than mere summer entertainment. The constantly
evolving Japanese ghost story reflects the changes in the country's
social and cultural values. &QL;

   The loss of 118 sailors on Russia's nuclear submarine, the Kursk
_ and the bungling that followed _ have dented President Vladimir
Putin's reputation for controlled efficiency and may yet make
Russians rethink the sort of government they deserve. After giving
the impression that he had a tightening grip on Russian affairs,
Putin and his administration seemed to be flailing about
hopelessly. &QL;

   This has been a miserable summer in California. Thanks to a
surge in electricity consumption, Californians and other Americans
have endured several power failures. A growing angry chorus is
arguing that electricity deregulation has gone too far and too
fast. The problem is just the opposite. The real culprits behind
this summer's power failures are the muddle and hesitation
surrounding the introduction of competition in much of America. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Politics is always an illogical business. But two of
the hardest things to explain in the current election are the
general ingratitude and indifference of the American public.
Despite the consensus that the country is on the right track, the
voter turnout in November is expected to be abysmally low. There
are many answers to these riddles, but one thing often lurks behind
the indifference and ingratitude: an obsession with local issues.
For many Americans, parking now matters more than prosperity. &QL;

a single person to do? The answer, it appears, is to think like a
company. You should ``outsource'' your social calendar to one of an
increasing array of sophisticated matchmaking services that provide
``assisted dating.'' ``It's Just Lunch'' is a firm that arranges
``pre-screened lunch dates'' for busy professionals.

   CHICAGO _ The annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of attitudes
towards public education released this week found that a majority
of Americans feel it is important to put ``a qualified, competent
teacher in every classroom.'' Bob Chase, president of the National
Education Association (NEA), the main teachers' union, wasted no
time in pointing out that this will require raising teachers'
salaries so that more qualified candidates will enter the
profession and stay there. Al Gore has won cheers from Democrats
for suggesting a pay hike for teachers. Would it really help? &QL;

what several North American tobacco companies did a decade ago. A

   PRAGUE _ Highly organized, ruthless gangs of sex traffickers are
luring and smuggling young women, mostly from Eastern and Central
Europe, into prostitution throughout the continent. There are some
20,000 women in 600 or so brothels in the Czech Republic alone,
most of them foreigners smuggled into the country's thriving sex
industry. While the illicit and violent nature of the trade makes
accurate monitoring impossible, a clear pattern has emerged since
the collapse of communism. Simplistically, there is a two-step
movement of women from east to west. First, of Russians,
Ukrainians, Moldovans and Belarussians into Central Europe; second,
of these women and Central Europeans into western cities. &QL;

 &HT;    IN `THE CREW,' WIZENED GUYS STEAL THE SHOW(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The guys in (beginitalic)The Crew (enditalic)still have it.
</P>
<P>
   They just can't remember where they put it.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the fun of this raucous comedy about four old
mobsters who move to Miami Beach and dream up one last caper to
save their retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   The film features a star-studded cast, including Richard
Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Jennifer Tilly. Unlike its
kissing cousin, (beginitalic)Space Cowboys(enditalic), about four
senior citizens who join NASA, (beginitalic)The Crew
(enditalic)offers crisp dialogue and a clever script that keeps the
story moving.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their star power, none of the actors walks through this
picture. They're all working so hard they achieve a chemistry that
makes you believe they've been friends for years.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss does a fabulous job narrating the story, and Reynolds
is wonderfully understated as the violent ``Bats,'' who loses his
job at Burger King in hilarious fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Hedaya turns in his finest performance to date as thick-headed
``Brick,'' whose job at a mortuary ultimately comes in handy. The
gang is rounded out by ``Mouth'' (Seymour Cassel), who talks only
at the most inopportune times.
</P>
<P>
   After a snappy opening that introduces us to the gang in their
youth, we fast-forward to the present, where they're living in a
retirement home being circled by yuppie vultures who crave their
ocean views.
</P>
<P>
   As the noose tightens, the boys dream up a plan: They spirit a
body from the mortuary and leave him in the lobby, making it look
like a gang hit. The plan backfires when it turns out that the
``victim'' was the father of a local drug dealer (Miguel Sandoval).
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval gives a great comedic performance as the overserious
dealer, Raul Ventana, who mistakenly thinks he's being victimized
by competing drug lords. Sandoval gets laughs just about every time
he's onscreen. Lainie Kazan does a nice turn as a woman who is
kidnapped by the boys, as does Tilly, playing a stripper without
the requisite heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Crew (enditalic)includes several sidesplitting
sequences that are as original as they are funny. At one point, the
gang employs a mouse to start a fire, with the camera following the
little guy through all the nooks and crannies. That scene had the
audience roaring throughout.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a really inventive sequence involving Ventana and
some unfortunate members of his gang, who are dangling upside down
by ropes. Somehow, Sandoval is able to keep a straight face, which
makes it even funnier.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this, there's also a sweet back story involving
Dreyfuss' character trying to locate his long-lost daughter, who
disappeared when he was serving a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   The plot line gives the story just enough weight to make it
touching.
</P>
<P>
   The only mystery here is why Touchstone chose to open one of the
year's funniest films in late August. No matter, though.
(beginitalic)The Crew (enditalic)should have legs well into the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the guys still have it.

<P>
   (beginitalic)Bring It On (enditalic)poses the musical question:
Who put the ``duh'' in dumb?
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we know.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you take two dozen cheerleading
routines and patch them together with rejected dialogue from
(beginitalic)Beverly Hills 90210(enditalic). You get
(beginitalic)Clueless(enditalic) without the charm or trace of a
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's not much room for story between cheerleading
tryouts, cheerleading practice, cheerleading contests and
cheerleading summits, which include winning lines such as, ``This
is not a democracy. It's a cheerocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie isn't even cute, mostly because of its parade of
unlikable characters: snippy, foul-mouthed rich girls who seem to
live in their cheerleading uniforms. They're so unpleasant, we
really don't care if they win the big competition.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is clearly aimed at teenage girls; the studio trucked
in a busload of them for the screening in Phoenix. If only they had
drowned out more of the inane dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the cheerleading theme may bring teens into the
theater, but they might as well watch the real thing on ESPN2.
Except for the predictably corny finale, the pep squad sequences
are pretty unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   This film is also filled with lewd references and sexual
innuendo that seem out of place in an otherwise lightweight story.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Bring It On (enditalic)stars Kirsten Dunst as
Torrance, captain of a champion cheerleading squad at a ritzy San
Diego high school. In a crisis of pom-pom proportions, Torrance has
to find a new routine for the nationals after learning her team's
material was stolen from an inner-city squad, the East Compton
Clovers.
</P>
<P>
   The film plays up the race angle, but the Clovers get the short
shrift as caricatures that walk on set, deliver put-downs and then
disappear. Even so, Gabrielle Union stands out as the Clovers'
strong-willed captain.
</P>
<P>
   As Torrance struggles to find a new routine, she meets some
characters lifted from other movies, including Cliff (Jesse
Bradford), a guitar-playing, retro outsider, and his sister, Missy
(Eliza Dushku), a sophisticated tough girl who rolls her eyes a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Torrance is also equipped with the standard-issue cheating
boyfriend, irritating little brother and nearly invisible but
well-meaning parents.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst gives a totally flat performance, almost as if she's
insulted to be making a cheerleading movie. She has none of the
sparkle that Alicia Silverstone brought to
(beginitalic)Clueless(enditalic). And this film could have used a
little sparkle. Or something.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a fairly well-done opening sequence, the funniest
scenes roll during the credits, when the actors and actresses
freelance to (beginitalic)Mickey,(enditalic) the Toni Basil tune
from the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   As they dance around, you can tell they're relieved that the
movie is over.

   Just like the audience.

   TIRES (Phoenix) - Laurie Arehart of Phoenix thought her recently
purchased Ford Explorer was exempt from the Firestone tire recall
because her Wilderness AT tires were made in Canada, not in the
suspect Decatur Ill. plant. But she took it to a Firestone dealer
anyway, three different times, just to make certain her tires we
OK. On Tuesday, with her 2-year-old daughter on board, the left
front Firestone tire stripped off its tread in the fast lane of
Squaw Peak parkway. She managed to steer to safety, but now she's
angry and afraid. And her truck sustained $2,600 worth of damage
from the heavy tread flying off. Firestone has limited its latest
tire recall to 6.5 million. Others think that many more tires
should be recalled. We talk to Clarence Ditlow, the head of the
Ralph Nader group The Center for Auto Safety, on why he and other
consumer advocates sued Firestone to have its national tire recall
expanded , stating that the tire company is playing Russian
roulette with the lives of its customers to save the expense of
replacing bad tires. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``A''
category.

   (Phoenix) - Laurie Arehart of Phoenix is afraid to drive her
newly purchased Ford Explorer after one of its Firestone tires
shredded its tread Tuesday on the Squaw Peak Parkway, damaging the
vehicle and nearly causing a crash with her 2-year-old daughter on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Arehart is also angry. This wasn't supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week earlier, she had been assured at a Firestone
dealership that her Wilderness tires were safe and not part of the
recent recall.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are the same model and size as some of the
6.5million tires recalled by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., her tires
were built in Canada, not at the Decatur, Ill., plant blamed for
producing defective 15-inch Wilderness tires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arehart pointed out, her tire underwent the same kind of
catastrophic failure. And the tire that failed on her SUV is the
same as those being used around the nation to replace the recalled
Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that people should know what happened to me
because these are the tires they're using as replacements,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Safety and consumer advocates are calling for an expansion of
the Firetone recall, citing crashes, injuries and deaths caused by
tread separations in ATX, ATX II and Wilderness tires not included
in the current recall.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone has recalled all P235/75R15 ATX and ATX II
tires, as well as Wilderness AT tires in the same size made in
Decatur. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is
investigating 62 deaths and more than 100 injuries that could be
linked to tread separation in those tires.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics say that the recall doesn't go far enough and
that the manufacturers are playing Russian roulette with the lives
of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole strategy of Ford and Firestone is to limit the
recall and do as much damage control as they can,'' said Clarence
Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C.,
which has filed suit to force the companies to broaden the recall.
``We seek an order that Ford and Firestone replace all the
Wilderness, ATX and ATX II tires regardless of plant and size.''
</P>
<P>
   The traffic safety agency said Thursday that it is investigating
the safety of Firestone tires beyond the 6.5million that have been
recalled, including all 47million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Safety agency Administrator Sue Bailey, who came on the job
Monday, would not discuss specifics of the investigation, but said,
``If we feel there is a defect affecting safety, we will issue a
recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress also is getting involved. House Commerce Committee
Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., said Thursday that he will send four
committee staffers to Dearborn, Mich., today to meet with Ford
Motor Co. officials and review company documents related to the
recall.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Senate Commerce Committee chairman,
has scheduled a Sept.6 hearing and plans to invite Ford and
Bridgestone/Firestone officials to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dasse, a Scottsdale attorney who specializes in tire
litigation cases, says he has several pending lawsuits against
Firestone involving non-Decatur 15-inch Wilderness tires and
16-inch versions of all three tire models. One of those cases is a
California death related to tread separation on a 16-inch tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of several others,'' he said. ``I have several
non-Decatur 15-inch tire cases, and I know of more.''
</P>
<P>
   Dasse notes that Ford found it necessary to recall all those
tires in recent years in four foreign markets - Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Malaysia and Thailand - for tread separation problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same 16-inch Wilderness tires that were recalled
in 1999 in the Middle East, of course, which is why I go
ballistic,'' Dasse said. ``Why would they recall them there and not
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Ditler, Dasse and others calling for an expanded recall say the
tire designs or materials are at fault, not the manufacturing
process. If the Decatur plant was making bad 15-inch Wilderness
tires, Dasse said, why aren't any of the nearly 50 other tire types
and sizes affected?
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone say their data prove they have zeroed in on
all the problem tires, citing figures that show non-Decatur and
16-inch Wilderness tires ``performing at world-class levels'' in
terms of reliablity.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ford held a press conference to counter demands for
expanding the recall, explaining the extensive and complex data
they used to figure out which tires were defective and where the
data came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data we have clearly show which Firestone tires are good
and which are not,'' said Helen Petrauskas, Ford vice president of
environmental and safety engineering. ``A broader recall is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrauskas said that Ford and Firestone would end up replacing
good tires with good tires and diverting replacements from those
who really need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of approach, which is not based on good information,
will cause more harm with no added benefit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ford says, it has replaced 861,874 tires, 13.3percent of
the number recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, called the expanded-recall
campaign ``disinformation'' from groups ``more interested in
lawsuits than solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   With today's tire improvements, tread separations are unusual,
Ford officials said, which is part of what red-flagged the recalled
ATX, ATX II and Wilderness tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people understand that tread separation is a
very, very rare event,'' Petrauskas said.
</P>
<P>
   But these arguments are small comfort to Arehart, who just wants
her truck fixed after her tread separation incident and replacement
tires put on so she can drive it again. She said she's gotten the
runaround from Firestone, possibly because her tires are not part
of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my Explorer, but it really scared me,'' the young
mother said. ``I have damage to my new vehicle, and all I can think
about is what would have happened if it had rolled over.''

KEEPING A SLOW PACE IN A FAST WORLD 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been zooming down the information highway so fast and for
so long we almost forgot there are people still poking along the
back roads, preferring the scenic route.
</P>
<P>
   They are so far offline they don't even have e-mail. They'd be
insulted to be called a user and they don't care about capturing
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   When they want to chat, they pick up the phone. To keep up with
what's happening they read (oh, bless them) the printed newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   They like referring to themselves as Luddites, in a self-mocking
and yet prideful way.
</P>
<P>
   Luddites are named for Ned Ludd, who in the early 18th century
worried that machinery was not a good thing for the working man and
inspired his British brothers, who named themselves after Ludd, to
go around breaking up manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Lee is a Luddite, although her resistance is merely
personal. Computers, she's long said, are fine for other people,
especially the high school students she teaches and her son, who is
an Internet Web page designer.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Lee still writes letters, for goodness sake, and when she
tells of shopping for the perfect creamy paper with hand-painted
edges and then finding stamps to match and maybe even buying
sealing wax, she sounds as dreamy as someone setting off to buy
their first Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk into a stationery store, I'm in a cloud,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   But now Flora Lee has tip-toed into the World Wide Web, not to
be snagged, merely to visit.
</P>
<P>
   She went over to the other side for several reasons. First of
all, as a teacher, she believes, ``My role is to present as many
choices and possibilities to students as I can.'' And for them, she
says the Internet is essential. ``If you're a young person and
you're not fluent in this language, it's a detriment.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the school put a computer in her room and she couldn't
ignore it. Also, as a former hipster, she felt some self-imposed
pressure to become more techno-savvy. For the first time in her
boomer life she felt ``on the disadvantaged side of the generation
gap.''
</P>
<P>
   So this summer, she reported almost in an embarrassed way, she
took a junior college course in basic computer use. She would have
preferred to use her time learning Italian, although she makes the
analogy between it and Net-speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the new language. If everyone suddenly started
speaking Italian and you wanted to know what they were talking
about, you'd need to learn Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   So she's learned a little and maybe enough for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   She appreciates the organizational style. Her teacher compared
the storage of information to 3-D file boxes ``and those Russian
dolls with the smaller dolls nesting inside the bigger ones.''
</P>
<P>
   And she marvels, she said, at the ``brilliant minds'' behind the
Internet's creation, although she says as a Luddite, ``I don't
really like machines. I believe that our chemical and mechanical
advances up to World War II were sufficient enough to run the
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last week she went without cable TV, but then decided she
wanted to watch Joe Lieberman up close.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a machine is not her style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dig in the earth,'' she says, although she might be won over
if they came up with a voice-activated PC, ``like a Dick
Tracy-style wristwatch.''
</P>
<P>
   I think many of us have our Luddite moments, or maybe just those
who get Dick Tracy references. I like to darkly joke that future
generations will be born with ergonomically correct bottoms, little
beady eyes, round shoulders and ambidextrous claws.
</P>
<P>
   I also love hearing that one of Flora Lee's former students
became a programmer, made a bunch of money, got bored, and is now
teaching kindergarten.
</P>

   ``The Internet has empowered people,'' said Robert N. Gordon,
the president of the Twenty-First Securities Corp., an investment
management firm in Manhattan that specializes in risk-reduction
strategies. ``Investors used to be hostage to their brokers; if
they wanted stock quotes, they had to call their brokers, and only
the brokers had access to research reports. The Internet has broken
down the information wall. Now investors can eliminate the
middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kochis, the president of Kochis Fitz, a San Francisco
money-management firm, called online investing ``fast, reliable and
convenient, a great thing.'' But referring to the popular image of
the get-rich-quick day trader, he warned that online investing
``can be abused by the user.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial professionals have long warned against trading
impulsively on supposedly hot tips, saying many people cannot
resist buying shares of what will surely be the next Microsoft the
minute they hear about it from the guy in the office down the hall.
And with Internet chat rooms creating even more hype, people with
poor impulse control can lose money even faster.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, first-class information is also available; it
can be used profitably whether one is trading online or through a
traditional broker, is an active investor or just rethinks
strategies at tax time. All the leading brokerage firms, both
full-service and discount, have secure, accessible Web sites, as do
service organizations such as Morningstar and Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey E. Curvey, the executive vice president of online
brokerage for Fidelity Personal Investments, compares this more
thoughtful approach to the Internet to patients' use of the Web to
research health problems before visiting a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors are also moving from research to trading. Assets
in online brokerage accounts grew 23.5 percent in the first quarter
of this year, to more than $1 trillion, US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
reported last month. And online trading volume rose 69 percent over
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kochis cautioned, ``stock picking is not for the casual,
lay investor,'' although a handful of his clients who have spent
substantial time and effort on research have been successful in
fairly aggressive online trading. Many more prefer to have the firm
manage their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Neither approach is right or wrong, Kochis added, but is a
matter of personality and individual choice. Some people are
entrepreneurial, while others like to delegate.
</P>
<P>
   With the information available on the Internet, people who feel
insecure about making investments can learn the basics of investing
and personal finance before they trade. Online trading is the easy
part _ with a few mouse clicks, you can buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it on your own time,'' Curvey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But prudent investors do not trade until they have researched a
security's fundamentals and considered how it fits into their
financial plan and their tolerance of risk. One approach is to put
the money you're investing into a money-market account. You can use
the resources on your brokerage firm's Web site to learn about the
market, then set up a dummy portfolio, research stocks or mutual
funds and simulate trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel comfortable, go ahead and make a transaction,''
Curvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers are smarter about their future than their
predecessors 20 years ago, having gained experience with their
401(k) plans. Many young people, too, have grown up using
computers, so online research and trading seems natural. The leap
to online trading is undoubtedly easier for self-directed customers
of a discount broker, such as Fidelity, than for those working with
traditional brokers. In return for the higher commissions, the
full-service firms offer clients guidance as well as execute
transactions, but even these brokers are pressured to offer online
trading and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, for example, offers a lot of information at
www.mlol.ml.com. There are financial calculators, asset allocation
models, courses on financial planning and understanding risk,
mutual fund and stock scanners and detailed reports from the firm's
analysts, as well as access to news and one's own account
performance.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to trading, Merrill Lynch clients can deal with a
financial consultant, as they have traditionally; choose a managed
account; trade online through Merrill Lynch Direct at $29.95 a
transaction; or use some of each by linking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Joel S. Isaacson, a certified public accountant and certified
financial planner who is the president of his own firm in
Manhattan, said that online trading could be ``good for
do-it-yourselfers, provided they do the research, buy good stuff
and hold it'' rather than trading in and out. Even so, he added,
``most people are better off using some advice or buying index
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   People who open an account where cheap trades are advertised may
lose more through poor executions than they gain on low
commissions, Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're just executing a trade, you can sometimes negotiate
low commissions with a full-service broker,'' he said, especially
when a block of stock is involved.
</P>
<P>
   For people who do want to invest online, the quality of
information on a broker's site can be more important than the
charge for each transaction. But it is good in any case to remember
that the Internet does not offer investors a superhighway around
the market's ups and downs. People who speed ahead may well crash.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: DANGER SIGNS FOR TRADERS
</P>
<P>
   Investing online does not condemn an investor to becoming a
crazed day trader any more than enjoying a glass of wine at dinner
leads inexorably to alcoholism. Still, for certain people, online
investing, like taking a drink, can lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a bad day at work or with your family, go to the
gym, not the computer,'' said Linda Barbanel, a Manhattan
psychotherapist and the author of ``Sex, Money &AMP; Power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who think that they have stumbled or have not been
appreciated in one area try to prove themselves in another, she
explained. In the last couple of years, that other area has often
been the stock market, where people take unwarranted risks in the
quest to make a killing and impress their spouse, boss or friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many alcoholics who give up alcohol take up other compulsions
_ shopping, spending and now online trading,'' Barbanel said.
``Gamblers and day traders tend to be compulsive. They can't tear
themselves away when trading, because when they are doing it, they
do not have to think about their frustration, anger and
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who follow prudent financial practices and research
their investments carefully, online trading can be remunerative,
Barbanel added, but compulsive traders often skip that part of the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think of it as a game, but it is a treacherous one,'' she
said, citing these warning signs:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you feel it is important to make trades every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you see online trading as a way to get rich quick, even
quitting a job to devote more time it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are borrowing money, running up credit-card debt or
taking a second mortgage on your house to trade, you are in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   People who do well at online trading tend to be entrepreneurial,
Barbanel said, adding: ``They want to be captain of their own ship.
They like to make their own decisions. They are risk-takers to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wish to be powerful, respected and in control,'' she
noted, even when it would be smarter to get help.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For a long time, the image of the typical Internet user was a
heterosexual white male younger than 40. Although this
characterization was mostly true, the Web is now becoming a
thriving marketplace for a wider range of people.
</P>
<P>
   As the economic and political influence of Asian-Americans,
Hispanics, African-Americans and gay men and lesbians increases, so
does their presence on the Web. Technology is also allowing
millions of people with disabilities to go online. Not
surprisingly, a growing number of sites are serving these
communities as they contour the Web to their own needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian-American community is wired, with a full 69 percent of
Asian-American households connected to the Internet. This is
reflected in the many sites aimed at this community, including
www.aonline.com, a site focusing on culture and lifestyle for
Asian-Americans, produced by A Magazine. Another site,
www.Click2Asia.com, links to shopping, business and travel in the
United States, Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For the Hispanic market, the site www.zonafinanciera.com
provides banking, insurance, auto and real estate services in
English, Spanish and Portuguese in 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Hispanics are looking for convenient ways to send money
home, secure a loan for a family member in Latin America or buy
stock or property there,'' said Greg Keough, a co-founder of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The site www.starmedia.com is a huge portal that includes
shopping in Spanish, travel services, news from the Americas,
classified advertising and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans are the fastest-growing group online. ``Blacks
are always on the tail end of technology, and we need to get on the
front end,'' said Harry Alford, the president and chief executive
of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. Its site,
www.nationalbcc.com, offers members discounts from major
corporations and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like www.blackplanet.com, will soon offer college
databases, financial tools and technology classes, said Omar Wasow,
the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   For people with disabilities, the Internet offers perhaps the
greatest promise. With www.wemedia.com, ``for the first time, a
homebound individual can visit the grocery store, stop at the bank
and pick up a new shirt,'' said Mikki Lam, a senior vice president
of WEmedia Inc. The site also offers health assistance and
information about finances, education and sports.
</P>
<P>
   For gay men and lesbians, two large portals, www.gay.com and
www.planetout.com, offer chat, personal ads, shopping, information
on living with HIV, investment tools, news and links to gay-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay commerce takes a different angle online,'' said Megan
Smith, Planetout's chief executive. ``We're a large community with
specific needs. It's a completely underserved market.''

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ While looking through my home
files for a friend's birth date, a yellowed newspaper clipping fell
on the floor. The headline said ``Insect juice kills pests.'' The
Knight News Service article reminded me of two things: One, my
filing system sucks stump water. Two, how excited I was when I
first read this article about 25 years ago. The words in the
article written by Rich Kent caused my heart to race and a light
bulb to go on over my head. ``I'm going to be rich and famous,'' I
remember thinking. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ BONNEVILLE DAM, Ore. _
After 10 days on the road with the North Fayetteville Moyes in
their new land yacht, we are appoaching Portland and Delta back to
Atlanta. I'm still waiting on Alex to cook his specialty lamb
chops, the main reason I agreed to this adventure in the first
place. Unless I dozed through the film and got my facts mixed up,
Bonneville is the first super-dam Franklin Roosevelt decided to
build when he moved into the White House. The Columbia River,
bigger than the Savannah, the Chattahoochee and the Altamaha rolled
into one, has been spinning Bonneville's turbines since the middle
1930s. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta

you that stay with you. That's the way it is with Heater and me.
All summer long, I pursued my prey. Heater is, of course, the
Dragons' mascot, that towering green dragon whose identity has been
more closely guarded than the last Survivor. (McCarty, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

   CAMP _ TUXEDO, N.C. _ It's 583 miles from our house in the

boyhood. (Deans, Cox News Service)

earthquake-prone area is more comfortable than being in a
hurricane-prone one because earthquakes don't visibly creep up on

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Spectrum governs the wireless world.
Come September, the feds plan to put up for bid some of the

estate is just what's needed to build out third-generation mobile
systems that enable cell phones to surf the Internet at high
speeds. But there's a hitch. In most large markets, these

 &HT;    Dragons don't like to undress
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As a reporter, it's the ones that get away that
haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   You don't gloat _ not for long, anyway _ over the big interviews
you bag. It's the ones that elude you that stay with you.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is with Heater and me.
</P>
<P>
   All summer long, I pursued my prey. Heater is, of course, the
Dragons' mascot, that towering green dragon whose identity has been
more closely guarded than the last Survivor.
</P>
<P>
   I even talked, briefly, with the Elusive One, the Greta Garbo of
the firebreathing set. The ``real'' Heater _ or the one who most
frequently dons the costume _ initially agreed to talk to me, so
long as I didn't reveal the mascot's true identity.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big concession, but one I'd be willing to make for
Dayton's newest superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Look around the stadium, and the eight-inch Heater stuffed
animals are as plentiful as popcorn. Retail manager Christie Wise
estimates that the Dragons Den gift shop has sold 1,750 of the
dolls. ``We're not able to keep it in stock,'' Wise said. ``Kids
love Heater.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't need to tell me. For my daughter, Heater is not only
the Dragons mascot; he is the Dragons, or at least the primary
reason to come out to the game. I can't tell you how many
accommodating pairs of knees I've sidled past after yet another
Heater sighting.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many times she wraps herself around Heater's
knees, human Velcro, the dragon never loses patience. ``When it
comes to Heater, you can't get too many hugs,'' Veronica explained,
after the sixth such outing at a recent game.
</P>
<P>
   All summer long, Dragon spokesman Brad Eaton and I played phone
tag. Somehow, the interview never got set up, but I was confident
it would happen before summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Eaton called with the bad news: There would be
no Heater interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even if I promised not to reveal his identity?'' I
pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   No dice. ``Everybody knows there is a real person inside the
costume,'' Eaton explained, ``but we want to hold on to that sense
of mystery. When Heater runs into that tunnel leading from the
dugout, nobody sees him but the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Heater has his own dressing room under the stands, right across
from the umps', and the mascot is under strict orders not to remove
the costume until safely in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have all too much reality in their lives. It's important
for them to have that bit of fantasy,'' director of entertainment
Todd Hollst noted. ``It's like Mickey Mouse. For the kids, it's not
a guy dressed in a Mickey Mouse costume, it's Mickey Mouse
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Heater's ``character'' has evolved as the season has worn on,
Hollst said, thanks to the improvisation of the person inside the
costume: ``Initially he was a Barney character who was big and
friendly and hugged babies. As the season went on, he became more
outgoing and developed a bit of an attitude, taking a dive on the
field, or snagging cotton candy from the vendors and giving it to
the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all very well and good, but I still want my exclusive. I
want ``interview with well-known local dragon'' on my resume. And I
have tough questions that need answering:
</P>
<P>
   How does it feel to walk around in the summer heat in a 40-pound
costume? To be the idol of thousands?
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever feel like telling all those kids to blow their noses
and go home?
</P>
<P>
   And can magic still be magic if you know its face and name?

 &HT;    Scheme to hit jackpot on insect repellent not quite foolproof
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ While looking through my home files for a friend's
birth date, a yellowed newspaper clipping fell on the floor. The
headline said ``Insect juice kills pests.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knight News Service article reminded me of two things:
</P>
<P>
   One, my filing system sucks stump water.
</P>
<P>
   Two, how excited I was when I first read this article about 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The words in the article written by Rich Kent caused my heart to
race and a light bulb to go on over my head. ``I'm going to be rich
and famous,'' I remember thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The article was datelined Palmetto, Fla. It began, ``Are your
plants bugged? Liquefy some of the creatures with a blender, spray
the stuff on your harried greenery and presto!''
</P>
<P>
   Kent learned about the miracle of blended bug juice from an
article in Organic Gardening and Framing Magazine. The magazine
article told about Mike Sipe, a 37-year-old fish farmer and
pesticide opponent, who came up with a cheap, environmentally
friendly way to combat unwanted insects.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine article asked for reader responses about Sipe's
non-polluting bug-juice method of controlling bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading the article,'' a Fort Scott, Kan., motel
operator wrote the magazine, ``I rounded up some of the beetles
(that infested his kitchen) and mashed them thoroughly with water.
I dabbed the bug juice on the walls and counter where the bugs were
worst.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING BUT DEAD BUGS
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours later I checked the counters and found
nothing but dead bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine included a number of other testimonials to the
effectiveness of Sipe's bug juice discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sipe said he got the idea from the work done by a former U.S.
Department of Agriculture entomologist who used a similar control
method that employed diseased insects.
</P>
<P>
   Sipe tried the method with healthy bugs. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   He figured insects carry pathogens that are released with the
bugs are crushed. Either that, or crushing the bugs releases
distress pheromones that drive off other insects. If not that,
crushing the bugs may release an odor that attracts natural
predators. He didn't know why, it just worked.
</P>
<P>
   About this time, Texas was being invaded by fire ants, a
particularly vicious foreign pest accidently imported into the
United States via a ship in the port of Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants, like killer bees, attack in swarms. They are small,
about the size of harmless sugar ants, but they ruin crops and kill
wildlife. On humans, fire ants deliver bites that develop into
pustules and often leave scars.
</P>
<P>
   No one had figured how to stop fire ants from taking over the
South. Like killer bees, they supposedly avoid cold climates.
</P>
<P>
   I now had the solution. I was going to puree fire ants into a
million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I put a shovel and a variety of containers in my Volkswagen bus
and headed east from my apartment in Austin until I hit the leading
edge of the fire ant invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to shovel fire ants into buckets, jars and a kitty litter
box was a lesson in humility.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants swarmed up the shovel handle and up my legs. I jumped,
swatted, slapped, ran back to the bus and tore off in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants now have taken over most of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants it can have my idea. Blend up a few pounds of
fire ants and see if their juice kills other fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, you could become a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Try it and let me know how it works. It should make another
column if nothing else.

 &HT;    Looks, not math, guide rocker design
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today we'll discuss rockers for a baby crib, which
aren't a big problem, and working with oak, which can be a very big
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Williams wrote to say that ``We have an antique baby crib
from which the rockers were removed before it came to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to build rockers for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your thoughts on the correct size and `rocking
capability' for these rockers?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams went on to provide the dimensions of the cradle and
speculate on federal rules governing crib rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Rockers on cribs, and rocking chairs for that matter, are really
a matter of aesthetics rather than any kind of mathmetical formula.
All you really need to worry about is keeping their curve shallow
enough to promote gentle rocking.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want an older child to start rocking the baby so
enthusiastically that the crib tips over. To that end, some makers
work flats, or even recurves, into the ends of rockers to prevent
tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, I recommend drawing the end profile of the crib to
scale on a piece of graph paper, and then using a compass to work
out a pleasing curve for the rockers. Generally speaking, don't run
them so long that they present a hazard to traffic in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   The curve can then be enlarged full-size onto wrapping paper or
something similar and used as a pattern for bandsawing the rockers,
or for making the molds if you intend to laminate them.
</P>
<P>
   And, incidentally, laws regulating things like baby crib rockers
_ if there even is such a law _ are confined to products you offer
for sale. As far as I know, our lawmakers have not gotten into the
business of regulating what we make for our own satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shillington in Snellville, Ga., asks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please advise (how in the world) one might drill holes and
pilot holes in 1-by-3 red oak for No. 10 wood screws. I am an
amateur woodworker at best, but am baffled as to what type of bit
to use to drill these holes. All I seem to be able to do is burn my
way through, using new bits and a 3/8-inch electric drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that, I have to start with a very small bit and then ream
out. I have about 60 holes to do for this project. The red oak was
probably a bad choice for an outside hanging planter of a unique
design that I saw and photographed on vacation in Alaska and want
to duplicate, but the wood is now purchased and cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I had no solution to this problem, because it is
exactly what I went through when I had a project involving screws
in white oak. I got it done, and swore I would never do it again,
an oath to which I have faithfully adhered.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ While looking through my home
files for a friend's birth date, a yellowed newspaper clipping fell
on the floor. The headline said ``Insect juice kills pests.'' The
Knight News Service article reminded me of two things: One, my
filing system sucks stump water. Two, how excited I was when I
first read this article about 25 years ago. The words in the
article written by Rich Kent caused my heart to race and a light
bulb to go on over my head. ``I'm going to be rich and famous,'' I
remember thinking. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ BONNEVILLE DAM, Ore. _
After 10 days on the road with the North Fayetteville Moyes in
their new land yacht, we are appoaching Portland and Delta back to
Atlanta. I'm still waiting on Alex to cook his specialty lamb
chops, the main reason I agreed to this adventure in the first
place. Unless I dozed through the film and got my facts mixed up,
Bonneville is the first super-dam Franklin Roosevelt decided to
build when he moved into the White House. The Columbia River,
bigger than the Savannah, the Chattahoochee and the Altamaha rolled
into one, has been spinning Bonneville's turbines since the middle
1930s. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ As a reporter, it's the ones

you that stay with you. That's the way it is with Heater and me.
All summer long, I pursued my prey. Heater is, of course, the
Dragons' mascot, that towering green dragon whose identity has been
more closely guarded than the last Survivor. (McCarty, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

   CAMP _ TUXEDO, N.C. _ It's 583 miles from our house in the

boyhood. (Deans, Cox News Service)

hurricane-prone one because earthquakes don't visibly creep up on

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Spectrum governs the wireless world.
Come September, the feds plan to put up for bid some of the

   EDs: Here are a package of stories from a special fall fashion
section from the Dayton Daily News:FALLSTYLE-INTRO _ DAYTON, Ohio _
Whatever happened to good manners? It's a question that's been
asked often in recent years. About the time we all fell in love
with blue jeans and sweats, it seems we stopped minding our P's and
Q's and began tossing our etiquette books out the window. If you're
one of those who mourns the loss, take heart. If this year's fall
fashions are any indication, significant changes are in store.
(Dayton Daily News) MOVED Thursday.FALLSTYLE -MAKEUP _ In an
ever-changing digital age, connoisseurs of style seem to be
reminiscing about things timeless and enduring. Perhaps that's why
hair and makeup stylists have abandoned the sleek minimalism that
ruled the late '90s and are revisiting classic femininity. (Dayton
Daily News) 8.

<P>
   FALLSTYLE-DINNERPARTY _ You're invited to someone's home for
dinner or a party and have no idea what to wear. Think about
``dressing like a lady'' and you'll be on the right fashion track.
Women won't go wrong this season if they pair a pretty sweater in a
yummy color with a suede or leather skirt or pant. (Dayton Daily
News) 7. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-MEN _ Men's fashions will complement their ladylike
counterparts. Designers have dipped into fashion's pool of
timeless, traditional pieces, and updated them with crisp tailoring
and high-tech fabrics. The classic, polished look that emerges
bridges the gap between formal business dress and casual
sportswear: Men will look smart and sophisticated around the clock.

<P>
   FALLSTYLE-MUSTHAVES _ Not many of us can afford to purchase a
new wardrobe every season. Luckily, it's not necessary. A few key
items will have you looking fashionable for fall. Must-haves for
fall. (Dayton Daily News) 13. MOVED Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-NOSTALGIA _ For some, fashion's nod to the past is
nostalgic. It reminds us of favorite outfits we _ or our mothers
and grandmothers _ wore long ago. For younger folks attracted to
old Hollywood films and vintage shops, it's a chance to get into
the act. This passion for ``dressing up'' is fun _ with an emphasis
on elegance, shine and glamour. (Dayton Daily News) 7. MOVED
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-ETIQUETTE _ The good news, says manners maven Peggy
Post, is the definite resurgence of interest in etiquette. And
while specific guidelines may change through the years, she says
the underlying principles of etiquette always remain the same.
(Dayton Daily News) 9. MOVED Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-TEENS _ Who says prim and proper can't be fun? Now
that baggy jeans and chunky shoes are out of style, polished, more
sophisticated looks have taken center stage. For teens and
collegians, that means this season's filled with blouses, skirts
and slacks. Though shapes are classic, they're anything but boring.

   EDs: Here are a package of stories from a special fall fashion
section from the Dayton Daily News:FALLSTYLE-INTRO _ DAYTON, Ohio _
Whatever happened to good manners? It's a question that's been
asked often in recent years. About the time we all fell in love
with blue jeans and sweats, it seems we stopped minding our P's and
Q's and began tossing our etiquette books out the window. If you're
one of those who mourns the loss, take heart. If this year's fall
fashions are any indication, significant changes are in store.
(Dayton Daily News) MOVED Thursday.FALLSTYLE -MAKEUP _ In an
ever-changing digital age, connoisseurs of style seem to be
reminiscing about things timeless and enduring. Perhaps that's why
hair and makeup stylists have abandoned the sleek minimalism that
ruled the late '90s and are revisiting classic femininity. (Dayton
Daily News) 8.

   FALLSTYLE-DINNERPARTY _ You're invited to someone's home for
dinner or a party and have no idea what to wear. Think about
``dressing like a lady'' and you'll be on the right fashion track.
Women won't go wrong this season if they pair a pretty sweater in a
yummy color with a suede or leather skirt or pant. (Dayton Daily
News) 7. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-MEN _ Men's fashions will complement their ladylike
counterparts. Designers have dipped into fashion's pool of
timeless, traditional pieces, and updated them with crisp tailoring
and high-tech fabrics. The classic, polished look that emerges
bridges the gap between formal business dress and casual
sportswear: Men will look smart and sophisticated around the clock.

   FALLSTYLE-MUSTHAVES _ Not many of us can afford to purchase a
new wardrobe every season. Luckily, it's not necessary. A few key
items will have you looking fashionable for fall. Must-haves for
fall. (Dayton Daily News) 13. MOVED Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-NOSTALGIA _ For some, fashion's nod to the past is
nostalgic. It reminds us of favorite outfits we _ or our mothers
and grandmothers _ wore long ago. For younger folks attracted to
old Hollywood films and vintage shops, it's a chance to get into
the act. This passion for ``dressing up'' is fun _ with an emphasis
on elegance, shine and glamour. (Dayton Daily News) 7. MOVED
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-ETIQUETTE _ The good news, says manners maven Peggy
Post, is the definite resurgence of interest in etiquette. And
while specific guidelines may change through the years, she says
the underlying principles of etiquette always remain the same.
(Dayton Daily News) 9. MOVED Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FALLSTYLE-TEENS _ Who says prim and proper can't be fun? Now
that baggy jeans and chunky shoes are out of style, polished, more
sophisticated looks have taken center stage. For teens and
collegians, that means this season's filled with blouses, skirts
and slacks. Though shapes are classic, they're anything but boring.

 &HT;    Looks, not math, guide rocker design
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today we'll discuss rockers for a baby crib, which
aren't a big problem, and working with oak, which can be a very big
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Williams wrote to say that ``We have an antique baby crib
from which the rockers were removed before it came to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to build rockers for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your thoughts on the correct size and `rocking
capability' for these rockers?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams went on to provide the dimensions of the cradle and
speculate on federal rules governing crib rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Rockers on cribs, and rocking chairs for that matter, are really
a matter of aesthetics rather than any kind of mathmetical formula.
All you really need to worry about is keeping their curve shallow
enough to promote gentle rocking.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want an older child to start rocking the baby so
enthusiastically that the crib tips over. To that end, some makers
work flats, or even recurves, into the ends of rockers to prevent
tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, I recommend drawing the end profile of the crib to
scale on a piece of graph paper, and then using a compass to work
out a pleasing curve for the rockers. Generally speaking, don't run
them so long that they present a hazard to traffic in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   The curve can then be enlarged full-size onto wrapping paper or
something similar and used as a pattern for bandsawing the rockers,
or for making the molds if you intend to laminate them.
</P>
<P>
   And, incidentally, laws regulating things like baby crib rockers
_ if there even is such a law _ are confined to products you offer
for sale. As far as I know, our lawmakers have not gotten into the
business of regulating what we make for our own satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shillington in Snellville, Ga., asks:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please advise (how in the world) one might drill holes and
pilot holes in 1-by-3 red oak for No. 10 wood screws. I am an
amateur woodworker at best, but am baffled as to what type of bit
to use to drill these holes. All I seem to be able to do is burn my
way through, using new bits and a 3/8-inch electric drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that, I have to start with a very small bit and then ream
out. I have about 60 holes to do for this project. The red oak was
probably a bad choice for an outside hanging planter of a unique
design that I saw and photographed on vacation in Alaska and want
to duplicate, but the wood is now purchased and cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I had no solution to this problem, because it is
exactly what I went through when I had a project involving screws
in white oak. I got it done, and swore I would never do it again,
an oath to which I have faithfully adhered.

CASEY CASE BRINGS JUSTICE INTO QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Penn State opens its season Saturday in the Meadowlands
against Southern California, Rashard Casey will be the Nittany
Lions' starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, that would be a ``dog bites man'' bit of information.
Casey started at times last season for the Lions, is a senior, and
is the only QB with experience on the Penn State roster.
</P>
<P>
   But May 14, in his hometown of Hoboken, N.J., Casey was involved
in a fight outside a nightclub/bar. He allegedly beat up an
off-duty policeman and was charged with aggravated assault, a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State officials and coach Joe Paterno immediately began an
investigation. Their conclusion? ``We know more than you do, and it
isn't as bad as it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Until more compelling evidence is revealed, Casey not only
remains on the Penn State roster but he will start against the
Trojans in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Nebraska coach Tom Osborne and Lawrence
Phillips? Florida State coach Bobby Bowden and Peter Warrick?
</P>
<P>
   The presumption _ as it should be _ is innocent until proven
guilty. And word from Hoboken is that the entire story has not been
revealed and the charges could be lessened to a simple misdemeanor
or dropped altogether. A grand jury has yet to rule whether it will
seek felony charges against Casey, and there is no timetable for
when it will move on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs a couple of questions.
</P>
<P>
   If Casey were a third-string QB instead of the only experienced
one, would Paterno act the same way?
</P>
<P>
   He says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a different standard of justice for athletes at
big-time schools?
</P>
<P>
   At Penn State, students who have been involved in fights have
been suspended for a semester.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has his own standard of justice. Two years ago, he
suspended a linebacker for a game for using fake identification at
a local bar.
</P>
<P>
   At some schools, regulations are in place that take the decision
out of the coach's hands. Florida State, for example, had a policy
in place that forced Warrick to miss two games for his
transgression, which involved buying clothing for a fraction of its
true cost.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens with Casey, no one disputes that
something happened.
</P>
<P>
   At 73, and within seven wins of passing Alabama's Bear Bryant as
Division 1-A's winningest coach, Paterno does not have to worry
about his reputation. He is almost bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems clear Casey needs to face some kind of consequences
for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Paterno will suspend him for a game, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   If Casey suffers no consequences, Paterno, who has spent half a
century at Penn State serving as coach and mentor to a couple of
generations of players, will have done himself and Penn State a
disservice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the hot seat
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No hotter coaching seat in college football exists today, or
most days, than the one at Notre Dame. After last year's 5-7
season, Fighting Irish coach Bob Davie knows his mission is simple:
Turn it around, and turn it around quickly. Word out of South Bend
is that a minimum record of 7-4 is required and that that might not
even be enough. Other coaches who need a quick fix are Rutgers's
Terry Shea, North Carolina's Carl Torbush, USC's Paul Hackett, and
Arizona State's Bruce Snyder . . . Games of Year, Decade, Century,
etc.: Sept. 9, Nebraska at Notre Dame _ It could be ugly, and
Nebraska has not been to South Bend since 1947; Sept. 30, Wisconsin
at Michigan _ Could be for the Big Ten title, even though it's only
September; Oct. 7, Florida State at Miami _ Just like the old days;
Nov. 18, Auburn at Alabama _ Tigers come to Tuscaloosa for first
time since 1901. Roll Tide? . . . Good surprises: Texas Christian,
Illinois, Toledo. Bad surprises: UCLA, Michigan State, Stanford.

MIAMI OR VICK? TOUGH TO PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Butch Davis hardly entertained the
hypothetical question. At last month's Big East Media Day, the
University of Miami coach firmly refused a proposed trade of
Virginia Tech's mercurial quarterback, Michael Vick, in exchange
for the Hurricanes' veteran defense.
</P>
<P>
   Straight up. No strings attached. No players-to-be-named-later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nooo, uh-uh,'' Davis said, wasting no time in nixing the idea.
``I mean, Michael's a great player and all, but I don't think you'd
trade seven starters for one guy. Nooo, uh-uh.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Davis knows he'll likely need his entire defense
to keep Vick in check when the Hurricanes host Virginia Tech Nov. 4
in a game that could likely determine the Big East conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Because it returns a solid nucleus of defensive starters,
including a veteran secondary that has been ranked among the
nation's best, Miami was picked first in the preseason media poll
to win the conference title ahead of defending champion Virginia
Tech, which must plug gaping holes on its defense and again pin all
its hopes on the talents of its Heisman Trophy-contending
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   With Miami and Virginia Tech expected to vie for the BCS and
Toyota Gator Bowl slots, Syracuse, picked to finish third, likely
will contend with Boston College, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh for
one of the three other postseason spots (the Insight.com Bowl, the
HomePoint.com Music City Bowl, and the Jeep Oahu/Aloha bowls). With
the new arrangement with the Oahu/Aloha bowls, which will pair a
Big East team against a Pac-10 opponent, the conference is
guaranteed at least four bowl spots and will get five any year
Notre Dame reaches a BCS game or does not qualify for postseason
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's flattering, but it really doesn't mean a great
deal, though,'' Davis said of his team's preseason perch atop the
conference poll. ``It's going to be where you finish at the end of
the year, which is a byproduct of how healthy you stay and how well
you play and how much progress you make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes sustained critical losses on both sides of the
ball when starting quarterback Kenny Kelly decided to leave school
to pursue his baseball career and the NCAA ruled starting
linebacker Nate Webster ineligible for his senior year after his
dalliance with the NFL Draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis has more than enough talent on the shelf to replenish
his team, especially on offense, where six starters return to help
sophomore quarterback Ken Dorsey. A solid supporting cast includes
running back James Jackson and game-breaking receivers Santana Moss
and Reggie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Vick is being counted upon to guide the Hokies back to the
Promised Land after leading his team to an 11-0 regular season and
a spot in the BCS title game opposite top-ranked Florida State,
which survived some palpitating moments to score a 46-29 victory in
the Nokia Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, he's going to keep improving,'' Virginia Tech
coach Frank Beamer said of Vick. ``He ran a faster 40 time this
year than he did last year and he's throwing the ball farther than
he did last year and as he throws more, he'll probably throw the
ball a little more accurate than he threw last year. I think where
you'll really see Michael Vick improve is in his decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one area Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni will definitely
need improvement. He waffled last year in deciding on a starting
quarterback, going back and forth between Troy Nunes and Madei
Williams. Robin Anderson and junior college transfer Chad Elliott
will enter the mix this year to further complicate the decision for
the Orangemen, who started last season 5-1 but wound up losing four
of their last five to back into a spot in the Music City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But if given the choice between Miami's defense and Vick, which
would Pasqualoni take? ``That's a tough question,'' he said.
``Miami's got great defensive skill and Michael Vick is probably
the best quarterback in America . . . to choose between them is
like being a little kid in the candy store, I guess. I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the heavy losses he sustained on defense, one would expect
Boston College coach Tom O'Brien to opt for Miami's defense. But
the Eagles, picked to finish fourth, will be solid on offense, led
by senior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback is always a good starting point,'' O'Brien
said. ``You need somebody who can win a game for you. But those
players have to be surrounded by good players, too.''

THERE'S ENOUGH TO GO AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston College is typical of most major college football
programs. Its games are on five television outlets: CBS, NBC, ESPN,
Fox Sports New England, and New England Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with generating revenue. Nor is there much
wrong with student-athletes having their schedules determined by TV
programming, especially if the school stands to make an additional
$200,000 if the game goes network instead of cable.
</P>
<P>
   BC's game against Virginia Tech Sept. 30, for instance, may air
on CBS at 3:30 p.m. or ESPN at 8 p.m. The same thing happens Nov.
25, when BC plays Miami at 3:30 p.m. on CBS or 7:30 p.m. on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the wild world of college football rights fees
has been good to television as well as the schools. Ever since a
federal court in 1984 ruled against the NCAA's control over
television deals, the rules of supply and demand have dictated the
course of some high-profile schools, such as Notre Dame, and most
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for the most part,'' said sports business
economist David M. Carter. ``The television revenue gives leagues a
chance to make money through their own individual athletic
departments, and the cash trickles down through the conference-wide
food chain. The only problem is the bickering among schools for
their fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Big East, BC shares the roughly $15 million
in annual television revenues from the league's television partners
_ ESPN and CBS. In what can only be described as capitalistic
socialism, the Big East teams with the highest demand and bowl
appearances receive more, while those at the bottom receive a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McElroy, the Big East's senior associate commissioner, would
not disclose the league's revenue-sharing plan. ``This is not the
kind of thing where it's the haves against the have-nots,'' McElroy
said. ``The have-nots get enough money, somewhere in the
seven-figure range. And the system rewards the teams that attract
the appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy said there are safeguards in the Big East's deals with
CBS and ESPN to make sure teams such as Miami and Virginia Tech are
not always shown on national television at the expense of the
league's lower teams.
</P>
<P>
   The real money is in the bowl games. Earlier this year, ABC and
the Bowl Championship Series agreed to a four-year, $400 million
contract extension. The new deal runs through the 2005 season,
which includes bowl games in January 2006. Each team playing in a
BCS game _ the Orange, Fiesta, Sugar, and Rose bowls _ receives
about $13 million, and the extension is expected to raise the
payouts to about $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said only a handful of teams make money each year and the
rich programs, such as Penn State and Florida State, get richer
because of their performance and marketability. But the vast
majority of college football programs need financial help to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with most of the schools is that traditional ways
of raising money are not enough,'' Carter said. ``The teams aren't
winning, and therefore are not as attractive to watch either in
person or on television. But their fixed costs remain, and as a
result, those programs are hemorrhaging badly.''
</P>
<P>
   TV outlets are only too willing to help. ESPN aired its first
college football game in 1979, on tape. The first live telecast _
Brigham Young against Pittsburgh _ aired Sept. 1, 1984. ESPN's John
Wildhack produced that game and has since become the cable
service's senior vice president for programming. Nowadays, ESPN and
ESPN2 air 93 regular-season and bowl games. On some Saturdays,
viewers can watch five or six games, from noon to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of importance, college football is clearly one of our
staples,'' Wildhack said. ``It's a critical component of our
programming. And college football performs well in today's
competitive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. ABC, ESPN's sister network, has 24 regular-season
games as well as nine conference championship and bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports New England will air 40 regular-season games,
including some Pacific-10 conference matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Trev Alberts, who played for the University of Nebraska in the
early 1990s and is now a college and pro football analyst for
CNN/SI, said the television money is a good thing but at some point
the athletes need to have some say over not only how the money is
spent but also how their schedules are determined. Whether the
athletes are paid is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the money,'' Alberts said. ``The athletes see
the money. They see the coaches and their salaries and endorsement
deals. At some point, they are going to want theirs.''

TEXAS IS AGAIN THINKING BIG

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The words come out of Darrell Royal's mouth
without hesitation, which doesn't mean he hasn't given the subject
of University of Texas football some thought.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows, Royal, now 76, has thought a lot about the Longhorns
the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   When you talk Texas football, it's impossible not to mention
Royal's name, not talk about the three national championships,
which are the main reasons the Longhorns now play in a place called
Darrell K. Royal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Royal sees signs of life in the Texas program he hasn't seen in
20 years. He sees a spark, a pride, and yes, almost an arrogance,
and he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference in Texas football from what it was?'' he
asked. ``Mack Brown. It's that simple. He knows what it's about.
And he's absolutely the best PR guy I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, at a Mexican restaurant on Sixth Street in
Austin, Brown, beginning his third year as the Longhorns' coach, is
told of Royal's assessment and he comes close to blushing, saying
how nice it was of Royal to say those things and how he just hopes
to be a part of the tradition that is now being rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   Texas. Football. No. 1. Think about that. There was a time when
you started a college football season and even if you didn't know a
thing about the Longhorns, you automatically would pencil them into
your preseason top 5, the way voters do Nebraska and Florida State
these days.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened after the Royal era, which ended _ some
say prematurely _ in 1976 when Royal took his three national
championships and 167-47-5 record to the athletic director's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Texas football started to slide. Not so much as you could see in
the early days of Fred Akers, but steadily each year until it
reached the point a few years ago when you didn't even hear the
Longhorns mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the national championship. Not even in the top 25. Not
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The facilities started to deteriorate. Texas kids who used to
put the Longhorns at the top of their wish list would look to
Oklahoma, Florida, Michigan, and, much worse, other Texas schools,
such as Texas A&AMP;M, Baylor, and Southern Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   The UT tradition was there, but it was peeling and covered with
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Texas is back. Some argue the program is still a
recruiting class or two away from being in the high-rent district
it used to occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Brown himself tries to put the brakes on the optimism that you
can find everywhere in Austin in what is still one of the best
cities in America to work and play.
</P>
<P>
   But with a schedule that does not include Big 12 heavyweights
Kansas State and Nebraska, with 18 wins in the last two seasons
(including two over the Cornhuskers), and with 18 starters
returning, the future is now for Texas, which realistically can
climb all the way to No. 1 next January in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown says the talk is premature. Texas No. 1? Texas in the top
10? ``We lost our last three games and we're in the top 10 in most
polls,'' said Brown. ``But that's the power and tradition of this
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal knows about tradition: He created most of it. In 20 years
under Royal, Texas won 11 Southwest Conference championships and
national titles in 1963, '69, and '70. When Alabama's Paul ``Bear''
Bryant wanted to jump-start the Tide by running the wishbone
offense, he called Royal, the man who invented it.
</P>
<P>
   Royal remembers when the president came by to visit. ``We always
knew when he was coming, because we could hear his helicopter,''
said Royal of Lyndon Johnson's arrivals. ``The Texas band played
`Hail to the Chief.' He loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown remembers the day after he took the job. They told him he
was going to be formally introduced at halftime of a Texas
basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, sitting next to George W. Bush, asked the Texas governor
for some advice. ``He told me to just say hello, but make sure that
somewhere I said, `the great state of Texas,' '' said Brown,
laughing at the memory. ``I got up and said how happy I was to be
coaching here in the great state of Texas. The crowd went nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``crowd'' is ready to go nuts. It's been too long between
coronations. The last time Texas was ranked No. 1 in any football
poll was Oct. 9, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When John Mackovic, who was a button-down guy in a
boots-and-jeans environment, was fired after a 4-7 season in 1997,
Texas football was a footnote in its own state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of passion, there was indifference.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of things,'' said DeLoss Dodds, who has sat in the AD's
chair since 1981. ``We were in a world then when people played by a
different set of rules. We just weren't getting the players. And we
let our facilities slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodds was referring to the scandal that resulted in penalties to
Southwest Conference schools SMU, Texas Christian, and Texas A&AMP;M,
implying that Texas could not keep up with schools that cheated.
</P>
<P>
   But in its heyday, Texas didn't have to cheat. It was Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Brown came from North Carolina, where he had built the Tar Heels
into a respectable football program that could deal with every team
except Florida State in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But the tradition at Carolina, despite the multimillion-dollar
improvement in football facilities he oversaw in his 10-year stay
in Chapel Hill, is basketball, not football.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas, there is no question about the sport of choice. Royal
told him that from the get-go. ``The good news,'' said Royal, ``is
that a lot of people care here. The bad news is that a lot of
people care here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has milked it better than any dairy farmer. Walk around
the state-of-the-art football complex and you are overwhelmed by
it. From the weight room, which is better equipped than the
plushest health club, to players' lounge, which is furnished with
soft leather couches, pool tables, big-screen television sets, and
saddles, yes, saddles.
</P>
<P>
   Ride in an elevator down to the locker room that is the equal of
any NFL team and you hear the ``Eyes of Texas'' along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do,'' said Brown, ``is geared to recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brown knows how to do it as well as anyone. Texas has 1,200
high school or prep football coaches. Brown has written or visited
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack embraces the tradition,'' said Royal. ``When he got
hired, he called me up and said, `Will you help me with Texas
tradition?' Right then, I knew we had something special.''
</P>
<P>
   When Texas called three years ago, Brown went to his friend,
offensive coordinator Greg Davis, and said, ``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was a no-brainer,'' said Davis, who came along
and has enjoyed the ride. ``Texas is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown wants Texas to be better. He knows he has a team that can
win. He knows he has not one, but two quarterbacks in Chris Simms
and Major Applewhite who can help him do it.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this summer in Austin has been about the quarterbacks.
Will it be Simms, the hot-shot sophomore and son of former Giants
All-Pro Phil Simms, or Applewhite, the tough kid who set 10 school
records, including throwing for 3,357 yards and 21 TDs as a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite went down with a knee injury during Texas's Cotton
Bowl loss to old SWC rival Arkansas and is now fighting for the job
that many people think will go to Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two No. 1s,'' said Brown with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says he is going to need both of them to win. He's going
to need help from fans and alumni. But he knows he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place,'' he said, ``is special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyes of Texas''?
</P>
<P>
   Make that the ``Eyes are on Texas.''

WASHINGTON COACH THINKS THE SCHOOLS CAN MAKE PAC-10 BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a clear, sunny day _ and there are more than you
think here at this time of year _ the view seems limitless from
Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   You can see Lake Washington, where many Husky fans arrive for
games by boat. You can see Mount Rainier, snow-capped and majestic.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're Washington coach Rick Neuheisel, you can see
beyond that. You can see across the country to Florida, where
Florida State is the reigning national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can see the heartland of America in Lincoln, Neb., where
the Cornhuskers are the preseason pick to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, in his second year as the Huskies' coach, came here
from Colorado with that vision. He came back to the Pacific-10
Conference, where he once was a UCLA quarterback and assistant
coach, to raise the bar on the level of play, not only for
Washington, but for the conference as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a passion for football here,'' he said. ``We've shown
we can be the best and we can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was referring to the Washington program, which climbed
to the summit in 1991 when it shared the national championship with
Miami, but he was also talking about the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 No. 1? Surely, you jest. If there are certainties in
the ebb and flow of a college football season, it is that the
Pac-10 will not be a survivor when the cutdowns of teams are made
for the national championship in November and early December.
</P>
<P>
   You probably will be right if you say the national champion will
be a team from the Atlantic Coast Conference, such as Florida
State, or a team from the Big East, like Miami or Virginia Tech, or
a team from the Southeastern Conference, such as Florida or
Tennessee, or a team from the Big 12, like Nebraska or perhaps
resurgent Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But you almost certainly will be right if you say the national
champion will not come from the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Not in football. If you want to talk about overall success in
athletics, then the Pac-10 becomes the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the Sears Cup standings, which grade schools in
all sports, and you'll find a staggering six Pac-10 teams in the
top 25.
</P>
<P>
   But in football? Forget about it. A year ago only Oregon at No.
19 in the Associated Press balloting cracked the top 25. This
season the top 10 doesn't include a Pac-10 team and only Washington
at No. 13 and Southern Cal at No. 15 made the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not that there isn't or hasn't been talent. The
National Football League is loaded with former Pac-10 players,
particularly at the skilled positions. The Pac-10 had nine players
make Street &AMP; Smith's preseason All-America first and second teams.
Only the Big 12, with 12, had more.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 25 years, eight Pac-10 players have been selected
with the first pick in the NFL draft, more than any other
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mentality seems to be that being good in football is
preferable to being great.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder grumbled that being good in
Olympic sports seemed more important than being good in football
and basketball to the Pac-10 powers that be.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. There is a perception that Pac-10
football is softer than other conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty-boy football with a lot of passing and catching but not
much hitting,'' said Houdini Jackson, a sophomore linebacker for
the Huskies who grew up in Houston, joined the Navy, and played at
the University of Hawaii before transferring here last year.
``That's what I thought when I was in Texas. But I think this place
may be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The results of last season's nonconference games don't help. The
Pac-10 was only 20-18 against nonconference competition. Its teams
were only 1-4 against opponents from the generally lightly regarded
Mountain West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the nonconference losses were so overwhelming that
no amount of spin control could help.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Arizona's 41-7 loss to Penn State in the opening game
of last season. Or Stanford, which went on to win the conference
crown, losing to Texas, 69-17; or Nebraska beating Cal, 45-0; or
Ohio State pounding UCLA, 42-20; or Arizona State losing to New
Mexico State; or Washington State losing to Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? No one is sure. Neuheisel thinks it might have
been the lack of experienced starting quarterbacks in the Pac-10
last season. Only four starters returned last season. Eight will
return this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. It's the parity, which seems to have
engulfed the league. No one is too good or too bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved last year that we prognosticators don't know what
we're talking about,'' said Snyder, whose Sun Devils were picked to
win the Pac-10 two years ago and went belly-up from the start,
finishing 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the last four preseason picks as conference champion
have not even finished above .500, which is not good news for
Washington, this year's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Pac-10 teams, they don't duck many people in
nonconference scheduling. This year, UCLA will meet Alabama and
Michigan; Southern Cal will play Penn State and Notre Dame;
Washington will take on Miami and Colorado; Arizona will oppose
Ohio State; Oregon will face Big Ten champion Wisconsin; and
Stanford will play Texas and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all rather play someone good and beat them than someone
not so good and beat them,'' said UCLA coach Bob Toledo. ``It does
something for your program. When we beat Texas, 66-3 (in 1997), it
jump-started our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey is still feeling the pain of last
year's pounding by Penn State on national television, a beating
that Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen correctly predicted the
conference would not recover from during that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a terrible feeling about a year ago,'' said Tomey.
``We contributed greatly to the image of our conference by the way
we played at Penn State.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches hope it's cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Pac-10 was 25-12 in nonconference games. It
was an impressive 28-8 in 1997. Arizona State in 1996 and UCLA in
1998 had unbeaten seasons within their grasp, which surely would
have meant consideration for at least a share of a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   And if you really want to break down the numbers, the Big Ten,
with only a share of a national championship since 1968, does even
worse in the debate over which is the best football conference. But
no one ever has characterized the Big Ten as ``pretty-boy
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington may be the Pac-10's best hope. The Huskies seem
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't seem to find the same intensity at other places (in
the conference),'' said Neuhesiel, who already has drawn the slings
and arrows of criticism from his coaching brethren. ``We have
62,000 season tickets sold here, which is twice as many as any
other school in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   In college football, battles are fought on the recruiting front
before they reach the field. It is an area Neuheisel knows well and
enjoys. But he also knows to win the ``arms race,'' as he calls it,
facilities have to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is in the middle of a $95 million expansion of its
athletic complex that will make it the equal of any team in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel said he is disturbed by what he feels is an attitude
where conference teams snipe at each other constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we strive to all being good?'' he said. ``Some of
the stuff I see happening reminds me of what happened in the
Southwest Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's point is well taken. The Southwest self-destructed
for a variety of reasons, but a primary cause was teams turning on
each other and turning each other in in a frenzy that brought the
death penalty to one school _ Southern Methodist _ and probation to
several others.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 is more diligent when it comes to playing by the
rules, but the attitude seems to be one of watching what other
people are doing as much as concentrating on what you are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can all flourish,'' said Neuheisel. ``But we've got
to do it carefully. We can't take any shortcuts without some
whistles going off.''

BOSTON COLLEGE'S SURPRISING 1999 RAISES EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This is how close Boston College's football team came
last year to playing for the Big East title: Oh so very close.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Had it not been for a pair of second-half
disappearances (a 24-24 loss to Temple Oct. 8, when the Owls scored
17 unanswered points to overcome a 14-7 halftime deficit; and a
heartbreaking 31-28 setback against Miami Oct. 23, when BC allowed
the Hurricanes to rally for 31 points in the final 17:11), BC coach
Tom O'Brien would have taken his undefeated Eagles to Blacksburg,
Va., for a huge Big East summit against undefeated and
second-ranked Virginia Tech in the regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   At stake: the conference title and a berth in the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one way of looking at it,'' said BC athletic director
Gene DeFilippo. ``But it's kind of like my golf game: I only think
of the putts I missed, but I never think about the 20-footers I did
make that I probably shouldn't have made.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Eagles left a few gimme putts on the lip, they
certainly canned their fair share of double-breaking, 20-foot
birdies from the fringe on the 18th, as Bob May did versus Tiger
Woods in the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   There was the 20-16 triumph over Pittsburgh Oct. 16 in which BC
quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, wounded wing and all, came off the
bench when backup Brian St. Pierre got his bell rung and connected
with Dedrick Dewalt on a pair of touchdown passes, including a
winning 36-yard score with 1:48 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Oct. 30 cliffhanger at Syracuse, where senior
linebacker Frank Chamberlin provided the gripping finish to a 24-23
victory when he stopped quarterback Madei Williams 1 yard short of
converting a critical fourth-and-13 scramble.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there was the rousing 31-29 victory at Notre Dame
Nov. 20. After spotting the Irish a 14-0 lead in the first quarter,
the Eagles rallied behind a stellar performance by Hasselbeck to
record their eighth victory of the season and third in the their
seven meetings against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful year and Tom and his staff has done an
outstanding job with this football program,'' said DeFilippo, who
awarded O'Brien with a one-year contract extension that will take
him through the 2005 season. ``The thing that you look for, as an
athletic director, it's not always the wins and losses, but you
look at the direction of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by direction, I mean, how's the recruiting? Well, our
recruiting has been very, very good the last two or three years.
You look at discipline on the team and we've had very, very few
players in trouble. You look at academics, and we've had very, very
few people who've even had to use summer school to get eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you look at, does this team play hard and do they do what
they're asked to do? The answer to both those things is `Yes.' All
those ingredients, to me, make up the direction of the program and
the direction of the program is headed due north.''
</P>
<P>
   But, because of those aforementioned lapses, the Eagles instead
went to Virginia Tech for a shot at a bid to either the Gator or
Insight.com Bowl. A 38-14 loss to the Hokies sent the Eagles to
Tucson, where BC's incredible 8-3 season and first bowl appearance
in five years ended with an unsightly 62-28 loss against Colorado
in the Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It left many to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Eagles had showed up for the second half against
Temple? What if BC hadn't blown a 28-0 halftime lead against Miami?
What then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' O'Brien said with a shrug. ``If you beat them,
then maybe you lose to Pittsburgh or to Syracuse. You never know.
You're going to play close games, but our previous two years here
we didn't win the close games. Last year we did. We won more than
we lost when it came down to the end of a football game, and that's
a positive and that's something we can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blemishes notwithstanding, last season's campaign proved to be a
breakthrough on many levels for O'Brien and his team. The Eagles
overachieved and surpassed all expectations by winning eight games,
recording a winning (4-3) conference record for the first time
under O'Brien, and finishing third in the league to earn their
first postseason berth since the 1994 Aloha Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think subsequent years will tell the tale of last year, but
I think it was important that, somewhere along the line, we had a
winning season,'' said O'Brien, who improved his BC record to 16-18
after going 4-7 in each of his first two seasons. ``I felt we were
capable of winning last year, but I never conceived that we could
win eight games, but a lot of times the kids have higher
aspirations. We stayed healthy, we caught a few breaks and we made
a few breaks of our own, and that led to a winning season. It was
very positive for the program and we have to keep it going this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles will face some challenges in duplicating last
year's win total.
</P>
<P>
   While BC's strengths rest with an offense led by Hasselbeck, who
will be back at the helm as a fifth-year senior, the most glaring
deficiencies are on defense, where O'Brien must replace four
starters from last year's front seven, including Chamberlin and
All-America defensive tackle Chris Hovan, a first-round draft pick
of the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck will be surrounded by a talented backfield led by
senior running back Cedric Washington, who rushed for 1,122 yards
last year, and sophomore William Green; a veteran group of
receivers that includes Dewalt, Jamal Burke and DuJuan Daniels; and
a solid offensive line, led by senior guards Paul Zukauskas and
Paul LaQuerre. O'Brien is so impressed by his line he was prompted
to say during BC's Media Day: ``From tackle to tackle, they could
be the best we've ever had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Eagles will not be as experienced or as deep,
especially up front where junior tackle Antonio Garay and junior
defensive end Sean Guthrie will be expected to help plug gaping
holes left by the departure of Hovan, Adam Newman, and Mike
Willetts. Senior Ryan Burch, who was converted from fullback to
middle linebacker, will join junior Scott Bradley, who was hailed
by O'Brien as having had a strong spring, and either sophomore
Marco Williams or redshirt freshman Josh Ott to help shore up the
linebacker position.
</P>
<P>
   Senior free safety RaMon Johnson, who started at corner last
year opposite talented junior Jonathan Ordway, will be the leader
of BC's secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not a dominant football team and have dominant
football players,'' O'Brien said. ``There's too many losses on
defense to graduation right now to project that we could win eight
or nine games again and be at that level. Who knows? I think we can
progress and get better as the year goes on, but all our experience
is on the offensive side of the football, so it's just the exact
opposite of where we were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, with that said, I still think we can have a winning
season, and if we do that, go to a bowl game. And if we did that
I'd still think it would be a great accomplishment four years
removed from where we started.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, that's what made last year all the more amazing.
It came only three short years after O'Brien inherited from Dan
Henning a program torn asunder by a fractious gambling scandal. Who
knew it would take O'Brien just three years to clean up the mess,
restore discipline and integrity to the program, and field a team
capable of winning eight games and going to a bowl?
</P>
<P>
   But, after helping George Welsh build programs at Navy and
Virginia, O'Brien had a good handle on the situation. He knew that
the third year would be pivotal. ``When I was at Navy and when I
was at Virginia, we won the third year,'' he said. ``So I kind of
expected it, following the same kind of logic and the same kind of
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't quite as hard as Virginia, because we inherited some
athletes. We inherited some athletes here at BC, but there were so
many losses because of expulsions and kids out of the program
(following the gambling scandal). At Navy, we had the problem of
coming off the Vietnam War, so I mean it was still a little tough
recruiting there, as it was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were still able to win seven games with Coach Welsh in
his third year there (at Navy and Virginia) and we were still able
to win here. But as I said, you want to be in a program where
freshmen play because they're good. You don't want to be forced to
play them because you have depth problems and not enough
scholarship kids or people at that position. In the next year or
two, we'll be at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   By his count, O'Brien said BC has 83 scholarship players. It is
a vast improvement from his first year when he relied on walk-ons
not only to fill out the depth chart, but in some instances, to
start games at key positions. ``We're still not at full force, but
we're much deeper than we've ever been,'' O'Brien said. ``The other
thing that is starting to manifest itself, it seems like, is the
continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some staff changes. Bill McGovern, a former
assistant at BC under Henning and most recently at Pittsburgh, was
brought back to The Heights to replace Al Golden as linebackers
coach. Former Northeastern head coach Barry Gallup is the new
director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still have had a core of four or five coaches
(including defensive coordinator Frank Spaziani, defensive line
coach Mike London, tight ends coach Don Horton, and assistant head
coach/recruiting coordinator Jerry Petercuskie) who have stayed
here along with the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   `At practices, kids understand what they're doing and where
they're going and from that standpoint we're more efficient in
practice and in everything we're doing in the program and I think
those things help to build a solid foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's athletic administration has taken steps to upgrade the
football facilities, undertaking an aggressive advertising campaign
to bolster season-ticket sales by extolling ``The Speed, The Power,
The Passion'' as virtues of BC football, locking in TV appearances
for all 11 games this season, and solidifying future home dates
against marquee nonconference opponents such as Notre Dame (2001
and 2003), Stanford (2002), and Penn State (2004).
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the grand plan to make BC's football program a
threat for the Big East title and a bowl berth on a yearly basis.
But can it really happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' O'Brien said. ``We can attain a conference
championship. This is not the ACC where it's Florida State and the
rest of the world. You go to the Big Ten and you could name all
four schools who have a chance to win it and everbody else is
fighting below. This conference has been won by Syracuse, it's been
won by Virginia Tech, it's been won by Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention West Virginia, whom BC will face in its opener in
Morgantown, W. Va., Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has taken a stranglehold on this thing,'' O'Brien said.
``So, if we can continue to build and to play, then we'll have as
much a chance as anybody to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at how close _ how very close _ the Eagles came to
doing just that a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Said DeFilippo: ``What I've done with last season is to say,
`Yeah, we may have missed some easy putts, but we sure did make a
lot of long ones, too.' So that's how I kind of look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were right there and that's what's exciting.''

&HT;     MAKING FASHION FIT FOR LARGER WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROSE MARY BUDGE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A perfect 10 might be able to get by with a few fashion
mistakes, but for a size 20, it's a different story. Big women need
to pay special attention to fit and style to focus attention on
positive features, hide trouble spots and look their best.
</P>
<P>
   Her are some fashion tips for the plus-size woman:
</P>
<P>
   _ If clothes push and squeeze, don't buy them. Tight clothes
won't make you more slender _ they'll accentuate the negative.
Garments that gently caress the body rather than giving it a bear
hug are the best choice.
</P>
<P>
   While tight clothes are bad, drooping silhouettes and styles
that are obviously too large are worse. They don't mask the pounds,
they add them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone knows that the black dress is a staple. But, if
you're big, don't get caught in an all-black rut thinking darker
colors will be more slenderizing.
</P>
<P>
   A bright print or a complexion-flattering pastel will add
pizzazz, not girth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big florals and animal prints look better on larger women,''
said Genie Alexander, manager of Avenue, a San Antonio plus-size
store. ``Bold prints can overwhelm someone small.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If you want to look more svelte, get rid of the dumpy flats. A
medium to high heel will look more graceful, emphasize nice legs
and instantly give a sexier look.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stretch materials will smooth out lumps and bumps and give a
smoother appearance. Because stretch materials move with the body,
they're more comfortable, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Obvious panty lines can ruin the best-looking slacks, but
pantyhose often can solve the problem. Another hint: When selecting
undies, always go with a full-cut brief, not a bikini. Briefs with
elastic waists cover tummy bulges, while bikinis emphasize them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Push-up or underwire bras that offer firm support can
instantly improve a larger figure. A bra-fit specialist can help
you find the right size.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pantyhose with a control top can provide a firm foundation for
almost any type of apparel and are preferable to girdles and heavy
Lycra undergarments that can push flab up and out around the
midriff or under the arms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus attention on your face by putting a bright scarf at your
neckline or a dramatic pin on your lapel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Designers are accentuating shoulders again, and shoulder pads
can help the woman with a thick lower half to focus attention
upward, creating the illusion of smaller hips and a narrower waist.
But shoulder pads aren't for the woman with a hefty upper body.
</P>
<P>
   A longer jacket that covers the derriere is generally more
flattering to plus sizes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small jewelry will look out of proportion on a big woman.
Large-scale pieces are best _ and don't wear too many at the same
time. Establish a focal point.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not every big woman is created equal. Study your shape and
determine if it's a triangle (narrow shoulders, wider hips), an
inverted triangle (wider shoulders, narrow hips), an oval (fuller
bustline and less-defined waist), hourglass (balanced shoulders and
hips with a well-defined waist) or a rectangle (roughly the same
width at the shoulders, waist and hips). Triangles should avoid
jackets and sweaters that stop at the largest part of the hips.
Inverted triangles should wear fuller bottoms in prints and bright
colors. Ovals should redirect the eye to the face or legs. The
hourglass figure needs to avoid tent dresses and styles without
shape. The rectangle should wear clothes that suggest a waistline.

GORE'S BOOST FROM RENO IS ACTUALLY WELCOME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore is on a roll, still bouncing from his successful
convention and still basking in the afterglow of The Kiss. The
once-boring vice president suddenly seems to be everybody's idea of
a great leader.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the scintillating speech that seemed to promise a
solution for every problem known to humankind? Or was it the
humanizing show of affection toward Mrs. Gore _ The Kiss _ that
stoked Gore's engine and revved up his sputtering campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Darned if I know.
</P>
<P>
   But I know this: Gore racked up another godsend the other day
when Attorney General Janet Reno refused to appoint a special
counsel to investigate allegations that he lied to investigators
about his 1996 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of stating the obvious, it must be noted that an
all-out federal investigation focusing on the possibility of vice
presidential perjury might have been detrimental to Gore's crusade
to succeed Bill Clinton as president.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's entirely possible that an investigation
wouldn't have affected him in the least. In fact, the American
people just might be so fed up with the recent trend of politics by
investigation that they'd have consoled Gore by giving him another
big jump in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, Clinton's job approval rating went up 10
points or so every time the special counsel's office leaked an
incriminating factoid during the Bill and Monica scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who had hoped that Gore would have to fend off a
scandal of his own from now until Election Day can salve their
disappointment by pondering the potentially disastrous effect _ for
the GOP _ of an anti-investigation backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-impeachment backlash, don't forget, darn near cost
congressional Republicans their House majority two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Backlash or no backlash, I must say that I'm glad Reno decided
to let Gore off the hook. It's not necessarily that I'm 100 percent
certain that he deserves to be off the hook; it's just that I am
100 percent certain that Reno was right when she concluded that
``there is no reasonable possibility that further investigation
would produce evidence to warrant charges.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gore lied about his involvement in questionable fund raising,
rest assured that he lied in a way that would never meet the legal
test for perjury. Politicians, sad to say, are professional
prevaricators. They weigh their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   You know how it works. It depends on what the meaning of ``is''
is.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind all that. The Clinton-Gore campaign's
fund-raising tactics have been investigated up one side and down
the other. Congressional committees, federal agents, investigative
reporters ...
</P>
<P>
   The White House coffees and telephone solicitations, the Lincoln
Bedroom sleepovers, the Buddhist temple check-passing _ it's all
been pursued, probed, plumbed and pummeled. Some of the most
ferocious Clinton-haters on the planet have tried to unearth
criminal wrongdoing by the president and/or his veep _ and all have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   So the last thing we need is another expensive, time-consuming,
populace-dividing investigation that leads to absolutely nothing
except more strife, more bitterness, more public disillusionment
with a political system that has already disillusioned far too
many.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is perhaps the most controversial, criticized and just
plain detested Clinton administration official this side of Clinton
himself, and her detractors greeted her no-special-counsel decision
with predictable scorn.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania accused Reno of
protecting Gore, saying that her refusal to authorize an
independent investigation on three different occasions was
``particularly troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But I'm an unabashed supporter of Gore's opponent, George
W. Bush, and I'm willing to give Reno the benefit of the doubt. I
say Reno simply did what she thought was right.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, by the way, also said that it's up to voters to make a
judgment about Gore's conduct. I will second that.

   Siesta. Power nap. Forty winks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the brief interval of rest is called, catching some Zs
in the afternoon is a tradition in many Latin American and
Mediterranean countries. And some companies in the United States
are promoting the midday snooze as a way to improve employee health
and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Now wake up and smell the coffee. A study by Hannia Campos, a
researcher in the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of
Public Health, says nodding off for 20 to 30 minutes during the day
could be bad for your health.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, published in the International Journal
of Epidemiology, found that those who napped every afternoon had a
higher-than-average risk of suffering a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Campos said she was not surprised by these findings, despite
what she conceded is a common perception that naps are
heart-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only published study I found on specific health benefits
of napping looked at a small group of agricultural workers who were
obviously very active and probably in fairly good health,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campos' study compared about 500 Costa Ricans who had survived a
heart attack with an almost equal number of healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   When surveyed, those in the heart-attack group were 50 percent
more likely to have enjoyed a daily siesta than those from the
other group.
</P>
<P>
   These findings appear to be backed up by research showing that
heart attacks are more likely to occur in the morning. This is
thought to be due to a complex chemical reaction that occurs in the
body shortly after waking and increases heart rate and blood
pressure. Such changes may trigger a heart attack in those who are
already at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Campos said an afternoon nap may trigger the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Not all specialists agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that this study found only an
association between napping and heart attack, not a
cause-and-effect relationship,'' said Nora Walker, a
board-certified sleep physician in private practice in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who've had heart attacks often suffer sleep disorders,
meaning they have trouble getting to sleep and often wake up during
the night. This makes them tired during the day so they'll tend to
nap more. So it shouldn't be surprising that they're more likely to
have a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts recommend that people get the majority of sleep
at one time, preferably up to eight hours per day for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said Pat Britz of the National Sleep Foundations, ``if
you need it, a short, 20- to 30-minute nap will leave you rested,
refreshed and alert. This can be particularly important, especially
if you'll be driving or operating heavy equipment.''

&HT;     HESITANT WINGS OF A BOY ENDURE IN `BUTTERFLY' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such a sweet, small film is ``Butterfly,'' such a touchingly
understated portrait of a Spanish boy's friendship with a kind old
teacher, that you might not notice the lack of an original plot.
</P>
<P>
   You might not notice the dog-eared edges to the tale, or the
fact that the boy-and-his-mentor motif has already been done to
death on the art-house circuit. Or maybe you will notice, but guess
what _ you won't care. Because ``Butterfly,'' for all its
derivative elements, is a film composed from perfect, tender
details, vivid snapshots that capture the innocence of childhood
and the sudden betrayals that shatter it.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and co-written by Jose Luis Cuerda, ``Butterfly'' turns
its soft focus on the boyhood travails of Moncho (Manual Lozano), a
small, quiveringly shy urchin entering his first year of school in
Republican Spain, 1931. So terrified is Moncho of his new teacher _
he's convinced the old man's a child-beater _ that he pees at the
head of class. His fears prove unfounded, however, as the gentle
Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan Gomez) leads his charges with a light
touch and a near-holy reverence for nature. He tells them of
beetles and birds and butterflies' tongues and takes them on jaunts
through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Into this sylvan paradise enters a few harsh political
realities, notably the tension between Republican activists who
helped depose the Spanish monarchy and disgruntled fascists loyal
to the military. Don Gregorio, an atheist with a poet's heart, is a
Republican; Moncho's father (Gonzalo M. Uriarte) is a Republican;
the wealthy businessman who tries to bribe Don Gregorio with a
couple of juicy capons is a fascist.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the political machinations are a nudge ham-handed,
the film never errs when it focuses on Moncho and the fickle shifts
of childhood. Lozano is wholly unaffected as the nervous
``sparrow,'' delivering a performance _ hardly the word _ of such
natural, pool-eyed boyness that his friendship with Gomez never
feels forced. It lacks the labored cutesiness of American buddy
flicks; the teacher never imparts his wisdom with any
condescension, and the boy, never bratty, fails to respond with
grudging admiration. He's simply a pupil with a mentor he adores
but takes for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The reflective power of ``Butterfly' (and the heartbreak of its
ending) lies in its most tranquil metaphor, that of the
spring-tongued butterfly that Don Gregorio handles so delicately in
his net. For Gregorio, who shelves anarchist-communist tracts
alongside ``Treasure Island,'' there's no difference between the
fragile liberty of life in a new republic and the translucent
beauty of an insect caught and loosed. ``Fly free,'' he says before
a crowded classroom on the day of his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez makes a wonderfully placid radical: He doesn't need to act
the firebrand, because his eyes speak volumes of suffering. As he
tells Moncho, ``an otherworldly hell doesn't exist''; the true
inferno roars around him, in the darting licks of human cruelty.
Cruelty has its day in ``Butterfly,'' but it's the hushed
resignation of Don Gregorio _ and the hesitant wings of a small boy
_ that endure.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You would do a great service to your readers by
telling us whether this e-mail message is real: ``Free e-mail no
more! Vote NO on Bill 602P!!! Bill 602P will permit the Federal
Government to charge a five-cent charge on every delivered e-mail.
... Our congressional representative, Tony Schnell (R) has even
suggested a `$20-$40 per month surcharge on all Internet service.'
''
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't Afford More Taxes
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CAN'T: I'm really disappointed in the quality of the hoaxes
we're seeing nowadays. In my time, when we wanted to mess with
peoples' heads, we did a much better job. Bet you thought there
really was a guy named Steve Jobs, didn't you? Ha! Pure fiction. I
mean, really, starting an industry in a garage? Get real!
</P>
<P>
   The claptrap you sent me is so full of holes it looks like my
laundry. You didn't really need me to tell you this is completely
bogus, did you? You did? Now I'm really depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Look, just because something is in writing and sounds
quasi-possible doesn't mean you should automatically accept it as
gospel. Hmmm. That's sort of how this column is supposed to work.
Let's try a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   When you get spam like this, please, please, please don't
forward it until you research it. The first thing I did was go to
Yahoo! and search for ``Bill 602P.'' The first hit I got was to the
Urban Legends Archive (www.urbanlegends.com). Does that give you a
clue about your e-mail tax?
</P>
<P>
   The site does a good job of picking the hoax apart, point by
point, but it's nothing you couldn't have found out for yourself.
The biggest giveaway is the name of the bill, 602P. Sure, most of
us slept through high-school civics, but it's pretty common
knowledge that House resolutions begin with ``H.R.'' A more
experienced hoax-meister would have called it H.R. 4602.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no Tony Schnell in Congress, as a quick trip to
www.house.gov would have shown. Third, there are other people,
addresses and firms mentioned in the full letter that don't exist
either.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that didn't stop Congress from reacting to the
nonexistent bill. Last May, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., actually
drafted legislation to block any such plan. And Rep. Michael G.
Oxley, R-Ohio, vice chairman of the Commerce Committee's
Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection,
has posted a strongly worded denial on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that denial raises other questions. Is Oxley part
of the hoax? You probably didn't know this, but his ``state'' is
just another urban myth, one of the nation's longest-running
practical jokes. In 1803, fun-loving President Thomas Jefferson
casually mentioned to a few gullible reporters that a 17th state
carved from American Indian territory would be added to the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The nonexistent ``state'' was christened Ohio. It was even given
electoral votes. To this day, anyone who professes to be from
somewhere in Ohio or to have seen the mythical Cincinnati Reds and
Cleveland Browns is in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   It's true! You read it here! Tell everyone you know!
</P>
<P>
   (What if ``Dr. Emilio Bombay'' is a hoax, too? Wouldn't those
things he said that were untrue be true then? Now we're all
confused. If you can clear this up, write to

<P>
   An NBC executive type was at a party last month in Universal
City, trying to tell a critic that the first pilot for ``The
Michael Richards Show'' _ the one they didn't let us see _ wasn't
all that bad, or at least as bad as we'd all heard.
</P>
<P>
   William Devane just pursed his lips. ``C'mon,'' said the new
cast member. ``It (stunk).''
</P>
<P>
   You have to love this guy _ the man known to millions of
``Seinfeld'' fans simply as Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the new NBC sitcom (8 p.m. Tuesdays) is now
being billed as an ensemble show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still up for an ensemble, understanding the strengths of a
good, character-driven ensemble show,'' Richards told television
critics last month. ``I don't feel like all the pressure is on me
to drive it along.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. It's not ``The William Devane Show'' or ``Tim Meadows
Show'' or ``Vic Nardozza,'' the name of the character Richards
plays. Your name is on it, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   (A side note to Richards: Drop the artiste persona. At best, you
come off as a ponderous airhead; at worst, you seem like a guy with
funny facial ticks and an incredibly inflated sense of your
talent.)
</P>
<P>
   Nardozza is a bumbling yet effective private detective in the
tradition of Columbo and Inspector Clouseau. That has been the plan
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   How good is the new sitcom? Who knows? Devane is optimistic that
the final product will be a lot better than the first tape slapped
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were right when they said the original script stunk,
because it did stink,'' Devane said. ``It didn't work. I got four
versions of this new script _ and it's very good. I'm very happy to
be involved with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This year not one but four big-name stars _ Richards, Bette
Midler (``Bette,'' CBS), John Goodman (``Normal, Ohio,'' Fox) and
Geena Davis (``The Geena Davis Show,'' ABC) _ have been given their
own sitcom. Richards and Goodman are retooling their pilots; Davis'
was extremely weak at best; only Midler's is passable.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent history of ill-defined comedic star vehicles
gone bad (the syndrome even has a name: ``Encore! Encore!'', after
Nathan Lane's 1998 disaster), Richards knows there are jaundiced
eyes looking at his project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what this show is,'' Richards said. ``There's no
trouble here. I mean, I know it seems that way because you haven't
seen a pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah Michael: That's the problem.

IF ELEANOR WERE TELEVISION, SHE'D BE PRIME TIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her first dispatch arrived near midnight on a Sunday, a rambling
voice-mail message about faith and destiny and life being what one
does with blown opportunities and sucker punches strong enough to
disorient the senses. Not until the end of the message was there a
hint of Eleanor's utter disgust over my column about the weekly
sameness of ``Touched By an Angel,'' what I called its superficial
messages of hope and triumph, and my growing annoyance with the
character played by Della Reese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Systematically flawed'' was the way Eleanor described the
column's contents, picking off each paragraph like a sharpshooter
at a firing range. Convinced we'd viewed totally different shows,
she asked, in a straightforward manner, ``Are you mentally stable?
Who in their right mind doesn't like Della Reese?''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks I thought Eleanor was a midnight caller, those readers
who call late so they don't have to talk to you and thereby get
what they truly want: a one-sided conversation with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   How so untrue. Eleanor called again one morning on another
matter, then a few days later, and in the early evening a week
after that. Our conversations _ or verbal duels or testimonials _
would settle into a routine of two, three times a week, usually at
midday, after Eleanor's two eggs, scrambled, with toast and coffee,
and definitely after ``The View.'' (''I wish that chubby Star Jones
would get a man and shut her trap.'') Sometimes we'd talk five days
a week, depending on my output and how systematically flawed those
stories were.
</P>
<P>
   In due time, the conversations became less confrontational, more
passionate than heated _ and always interesting, to the point, and
edifying. We talked race, gender, children, sports, politics and
even compared the merits of Target, Kmart and Wal-Mart. We were
close on some issues, far apart on many others, a byproduct of two
lives shaped from very different molds. I liked her because she
didn't care about agreeing with me.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor often called herself a typical reader, although I always
told her that such a person does not exist. There is no one
``typical'' reader, but there are people who pick up the paper
every day who know what they want out of it and who are less than
thrilled when they don't find it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who read TV columns are fanatics and cynics, the curious
and the bored; they are even people who sit and watch TV only when
they're too tired to think.
</P>
<P>
   There's a housewife in Arlington, Texas, with a workaholic
husband who simply likes to talk around 2 p.m., when house cleaning
is done and dinner is started and boredom has set in. There's the
retiree from Southlake married 52 years to a man whom she has never
seen watch a television program from beginning to end. There's the
16-year-old from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth who
thinks her boyfriend is lazy and wonders if dating outside her race
is social suicide. There's the 20-year-old Texas Christian
University student who rewrites episodes of ``Frasier,'' then
recites them over the phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that was a good one _ well-thought out, well-researched,
well-written,'' Eleanor would sometimes say to me. Or, ``Boy, did
you miss the boat on that one. Not feeling well, are we?''
</P>
<P>
   Hers were often the rants of a demanding viewer and reader, so
much a lover of television that the squandering of its promise and
power angered her. She was smart and sharp and frustratingly blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' I said to her one day. ``You're telling me
that it's OK for networks to totally disregard viewers over 50?''
</P>
<P>
   She told me that it was, that it was a business decision, that
advertisers are right when they say older viewers are set in their
ways and should therefore be ignored, and that few viewers want to
watch ``old folks like us'' play TV characters. Eleanor's
assessment was built on the notion that young people can't relate
to older characters and older viewers don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never paid much attention to commercials or print
advertisements _ she used the same product for the past 20 years as
long as it was available,'' Sadie, her youngest daughter, said the
other day. ``Same with TV shows. I don't think she's ever missed an
episode of `Law &AMP; Order.' Sadie told me that early life for Eleanor
was a two-room shack outside Greenville, S.C., a place kept clean
with old rags soaked in water pumped from a nearby well. Eleanor
came to TV late, after her marriage to Arthur, an insurance
executive, who died some 10 years ago in a boating accident.
Eleanor never worked outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur's job brought them to Fort Worth, where they raised three
girls and a boy, now all grown.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie says Eleanor's life became centered on TV after she was
diagnosed with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worried at first, but felt relieved, in a strange way, that
she was tied to something like TV programs,'' Sadie says. ``We'd
hear her talk out loud, `Oh, gotta call that Ken about this,' like
it had become her duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Remission brought more calls from Eleanor during the beginning
of last season. She fell for ``Once and Again,'' about
40-somethings navigating divorce, and the White House drama ``The
West Wing,'' which she called ``hokey'' but added, ``Oh, that
Martin Sheen is some looker.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite show was the '60s classic ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show.'' Her least favorite was ``Diagnosis Murder.'' Which made
sense, considering her respect for Van Dyke's talent.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor faded with the season last spring, as cancer returned
and series finales were being aired. The cancer had spread to her
lungs and other parts of her body. She died a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard the news, I thought of our last conversation, a
brief one concerning a column I'd written about the so-called
family hour. She phoned to say there was never such a thing, that
TV networks had always aired objectionable material at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor cut the conversation short, saying she was tired and
needed to get back to her tube.
</P>
<P>
   She'd missed ``Law &AMP; Order'' the night before but had had a
neighbor tape it. ``Hear that?'' she said of the humming sound
vibrating from her old VCR. ``Time to go. You be blessed, you
hear?''

&HT;     OLD MOBSTERS SCORE A HIT IN `THE CREW' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRIS WORRELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was ``Space Cowboys,'' an action movie about aging
astronauts returning to the final frontier. Now comes ``The Crew,''
a winning comedy about four old wiseguys who step out of retirement
to pull one more scheme.
</P>
<P>
   After endless juvenile drivel about hormones and horror and
fruit pies, perhaps Hollywood has finally noticed that a large
percentage of the population is over the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' is an irresistible hoot of a film about four
lifelong friends who have retired from the New Jersey mob and now
live together in the Raj Mahal, a rundown retirement hotel in
Miami's South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Once high rollers dressed in slick suits who had gobs of money
and women, they now spend their days sitting on the porch watching
the parade of bikinis go by and defending their now prime real
estate from yuppies looking for an ocean view.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said the good times were gonna last forever,'' growls Joey
``Bats'' Pistella (played to perfection by Burt Reynolds).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd be dead by now,'' says Bobby Bartellemeo
(Richard Dreyfuss).
</P>
<P>
   The film's greatest strength comes from the four main
characters, and like some geriatric boy band, everybody has a role
to play.
</P>
<P>
   There's Bats, who got his nickname from his choice of weapon as
well as his crazy temper; Mike ``The Brick'' Donatelli, a sweet and
dim guy played by Dan Hedaya, who so hilariously portrayed
President Nixon in ``Dick''; Tony ``Mouth'' Donato, a quiet type
who has a way with the ladies, played by Seymour Cassel, who
co-starred with Dreyfuss in ``Tin Men''; and Dreyfuss, who plays
the sensible one.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds shines as the hot-headed Bats, a man so angry at losing
his big-shot status that he cannot maintain a job at numerous
Burger Kings because he keeps harassing the customers. (``I know
what the commercial says, lady,'' he hisses at one woman. ``But
special orders do upset us.'') Confrontational and outraged, Bats
does some of his best thinking while unconscious, a state he finds
himself in frequently.
</P>
<P>
   It's after just such a ``senior moment'' that Bats gets an idea
about how to keep management at the Raj Mahal from raising the
rents and squeezing the geezers out. It is a simple and suitably
nutty plan, and it works like a charm. The guys are renewed and
celebrate like it was old times: a new car, fancy jewelry, a
friendly hooker named Ferris (played with ample bada-bing by
Jennifer Tilly).
</P>
<P>
   All except Bobby, who knows that wiseguys always mess things up.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, life gets considerably more complicated when Mouth
suddenly becomes quite talkative with Ferris, telling her all about
their scheme. Ferris makes the geezers an offer they can't refuse:
They must whack her stepmother in exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Their hapless plan sets off a series of shenanigans that involve
a reigning drug lord, the rich widow of a deli owner and a
pyromaniacal rodent.
</P>
<P>
   Of less interest are two secondary story lines, one involving
the dysfunctional love life of detectives and ex-lovers Olivia Neal
(Carrie-Anne Moss, who starred opposite Keanu Reeves in ``The
Matrix'') and Steve Menteer (Jeremy Piven), who have been assigned
to investigate the doings at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Another unnecessary plot involves Bobby's search for his
daughter, whom he hasn't seen since she was a child. It is meant to
lend the story some moral significance but ends up just weighing
down a film that is best when taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Dinner, whose film credits up until this point
include an annoyingly unfunny flick about a talking horse called
``Hot to Trot,'' does an admirable job of capturing the spirit and
speed of Miami with interesting editing (a corpse-filled drawer
closes, a file cabinet opens) and the rich golds and blues of the
beach town.
</P>
<P>
   He also gets some fine comic performances out of these veteran
actors. Dreyfuss is a steady straight man, and Hedaya is delightful
as Brick, a soft-hearted ex-mobster who still exchanges Christmas
cards with fellas from the old gang.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting in the car before one of their capers, Brick
announces, ``I gotta pee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just hold it,'' snaps Reynolds. Then, a beat later, ``Not with
your hands, you mook.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by Barry Fanaro, who also wrote the screenplay for
the comedy ``Kingpin'' and numerous episodes of the television
series ``Golden Girls,'' is filled with such quick and comic
exchanges. And producer Barry Sonnenfeld has struck a similar tone
here as he did with the smartly funny ``Men in Black'' and ``Get
Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if there are a few too many fuhgedaboutits and other
mobster cliches? There are still so many refreshing tricks in this
old dog that it doesn't matter.

THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON EXTENDS TO SEX AND MARRIAGE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex is one of those subjects not often discussed in church. But
a Texas pastor, the Rev. Tommy Nelson, thinks that should change.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has been talking about how to handle sex and its joys and
problems with his congregation in Denton for years. He's not
surprised by the popularity of his seminars on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an area our society is lost in space with,'' Nelson
says. ``We're not sure what marriage is or what sexuality is. Is it
something glorious or just a biological act?''
</P>
<P>
   He bases his teachings on the Song of Solomon or the Song of
Songs, one of those books of the Bible some rabbis and ministers
leave out of their sermons because of its provocative language.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the passionate words of the bride:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him kiss me with kisses of the mouth _ for your love is
more delightful than wine. ... Take me away with you _ let us
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The blushingly frank language continues with the man's
description of his alluring lover:
</P>
<P>
   ``How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful. Your
eyes behind your veil are doves. ... Your two breasts are like two
fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies.
... Your lips drop sweetness as a honeycomb, my bride, milk and
honey are under your tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic language becomes even more erotic later.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson doesn't back off from any of the passages in his treatise
on the Song of Solomon, ``The Book of Romance: What Solomon Says
About Love, Sex and Intimacy'' (Thomas Nelson, $14.99).
</P>
<P>
   It's a mystery book to many, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the distinction of being the only book of the Bible
that seems to have been edited and censured by the church,'' he
says. ``Most people don't read it, don't understand it, and have
never heard a sermon about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, senior pastor of the 3,000-member Denton Bible Church,
says the Song of Solomon is God's guide on how to fan the fires of
sexual intimacy, resolve conflicts and fall deeper in love as the
years go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think God would give us dating, sex and marriage
without any guidelines?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a former quarterback for the University of North Texas
and a graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, says his seminars
grew out of a Bible study he taught at Prestonwood Baptist Church
in suburban Dallas. Information on his book and seminars can be
obtained by calling (877) 456-SONG or calling up his Web site,
www.thesongofsolomon.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Sept. 23 seminar at the First Baptist Church of Dallas is
touted in a news release with the heading: Pastor Tommy Nelson
Teaches Dallas Residents How to Have Great Sex.
</P>
<P>
   But his seminars are not just about the joys of sex. He has
practical tips on dating, courtship and marriage, using humor along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often today, girls will say about a guy, `He's a real
hunk.' The question begs to be asked, `A hunk of what?''' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   He urges men and women to choose a partner based on character,
godliness, unselfishness, reputation and the reaction to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Nelson conducts untraditional seminars, he is a
traditionalist on the Bible. Sex should be within the confines of
marriage, he says, and wives should submit to the decision-making
authority of their husbands. He adds, however, that husbands should
cherish and protect their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Although some people interpret the Song of Solomon as an
allegory of God's love for true believers, the most common
interpretation is that it is a collection of lyrics celebrating
human love, says the ``Oxford Commentary on the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Solomon actually write those spicy love lyrics?
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars believe the verses were only attributed to Solomon
because of his reputation for wisdom. But Nelson believes Solomon
wrote the love poetry in his younger days, then wrote Proverbs and
Ecclesiastes in later years.

&HT;     COURT UPHOLDS ASYLUM FOR HOMOSEXUAL TEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A man who as a 14-year-old was harassed and
raped by police officers in Mexico because he looked and dressed
like a woman has been ruled eligible for asylum in the United
States by a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights lawyers said Thursday's 3-0 ruling by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco was the first by any
court to recognize persecution based on sexual identity as grounds
for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual orientation and sexual identity are immutable; they are
so fundamental to one's identity that a person should not be
required to abandon them,'' Judge A. Wallace Tashima said in the
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a groundbreaking decision,'' said Shannon Minter, a
lawyer for the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco.
``It's the first time the courts have held that sexual orientation
is an immutable characteristic, and the first time they've
recognized that some gay men have innately feminine characteristics
that make them vulnerable to persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Davidson, a lawyer for the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, said the case was significant for homosexuals from
other Latin American countries where, as in Mexico, gay men who
look effeminate are singled out for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, immigration judges already grant asylum
regularly to effeminate gay men from Latin America, said attorney
Sharon Dulberg, who has handled a number of such cases from Mexico,
Brazil and Venezuela. ``It's so clear that they'll be persecuted if
they return,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration authorities did not dispute the idea that
homosexuals and lesbians who were persecuted in their homeland
could apply for asylum, a position accepted by the Board of
Immigration Appeals in 1990 and adopted as a binding precedent for
all immigration judges by Attorney General Janet Reno in 1994. But
in seeking to deport Geovanni Hernandez-Montiel to Mexico, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said he was mistreated
because of the way he chose to dress and act, not because of his
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez-Montiel, described by his lawyer as a transsexual,
said he had started dressing and acting like a woman at age 12. He
was expelled from school, thrown out of his home by his parents the
next day, and stopped, arrested and strip-searched numerous times
by the police, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 14, in November 1992, he was sexually assaulted by
police officers on at least two occasions, the court said. He also
was attacked with a knife by a group of young men.
</P>
<P>
   He fled to the United States, was arrested and deported. He
entered the United States again in October 1994, at 16, and applied
for asylum after being arrested in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals said a
man who was abused because he chose to dress as a woman was not
being persecuted because of his membership in a fixed ``social
group,'' a legal category under the asylum law. The board said
Hernandez-Montiel's ``mistreatment arose from his conduct,'' a
statement condemned by the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Tashima said gay men with female sexual identities in Mexico
were a ``social group'' under the asylum law.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez-Montiel's lawyer, Robert Gerber, said the ruling was a
gratifying conclusion to a long legal battle. He said his client
had spent some time in a Los Angeles-area home for gay and lesbian
youth, but declined to discuss his whereabouts.

</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A quartet of rough-hewn men, old beyond
their years, sits at the diner's horseshoe-shaped bar,
commiserating about the day's headaches and heartbreaks. All four
suck on cigarettes, almost in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, a young couple quietly lounges in a tattered
booth, picking at the scraps of breakfast left on their plates. The
woman makes idle, whispered conversation; the man listens,
acknowledging her with a nod and a soft smile.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, three teen-agers laugh and cut up. They have school
in the morning but don't feel like going. One of them talks about
his girlfriend; another says he ``wishes'' he had girlfriend. ``No
you don't,'' the third one says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled in a corner, away from the rest of the restaurant's
patrons, is a single, rotund man who does not utter a word. His
hair is cut short in boot-camp style. Slight wrinkles run down his
cheeks. He is by himself, and wants to keep it that way. ``I'd like
to be left alone,'' he says before returning to his coffee, the
only thing on the table.
</P>
<P>
   This scene, representing something that's at the same time so
American and so universal, could be from any number of movies, from
``American Graffiti'' to ``Diner'' to ``Pulp Fiction.'' But the
setting is here, on the north side of Fort Worth, at a gritty,
all-night hole-in-the-wall called Irene's Pink Poodle Coffee Shop.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekday night, in just a matter of hours, the Pink Poodle
in all its variety and diversity epitomizes the greasy beauty of
the quintessential all-night diner _ how it can offer you either an
open-armed greeting or total anonymity; a full meal or just a cup
of coffee; someone to talk to or a place to escape into your own
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The all-night diner is an American icon, immediately
identifiable the world over from movies, plays, paintings and
novels. At one point in time, more than 6,000 independently owned
diners cut a swath through the American landscape, their flickering
signs inviting truckers, socializers, church-goers, students,
travelers, misfits _ anyone who wanted to eat or sit or chat.
</P>
<P>
   The country's race to merge this and duplicate that has wiped
out thousands of these institutions in recent years. There are only
about 2,200 today, says diner researcher Daniel Zilka, a
Providence, R.I., businessman who started a Web site,
dinermuseum.org, dedicated to preserving diners.
</P>
<P>
   The ones that remain, such as the Pink Poodle and Ol' South in
Fort Worth, the Metro in Dallas and the Iron Skillet in Arlington,
along with the Waffle Houses and Pancake Houses and
mom-and-pop-managed dives scattered throughout the country, still
honor diner traditions _ as do their patrons, even as they see
those traditions disappearing around them.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's 2:45 a.m. on a recent summer Saturday night, and the Metro
cafe in Dallas is jammed. Every booth is taken. Every bar stool is
occupied. Those waiting for tables do so outside, or linger near
the Metro's jukebox, occasionally slipping in quarters and tapping
their feet along to tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's easy to hear the music; the restaurant itself is
very noisy. Plates clatter. Waitresses scream orders to cooks. The
young customers are rowdy, hopping from table to table, friend to
friend, unintentionally evoking the scene from ``Swingers'' in
which Vince Vaughn drunkenly jumps on a cafe table and starts
goofing on co-star John Favreau.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette and grease smoke drift by the faces of Robert Perkins
and Clarence Gamble, two men who, huddled in a booth, are oblivious
to the roomful of action. Instead, they are focusing on finishing
off their pancakes and eggs and conversing about boxing. It's
almost a Norman Rockwell moment.
</P>
<P>
   Etched on their cheeks are the maps of their lives. Their hands
are calloused, savaged by hard times and hard labor. Lifetime
friends, they worked in steel mills most of their lives. Both wed
in their 20s, and both their wives have since passed away. Both
still wear their wedding rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think I could take mine off, even if I wanted,'' says
Gamble, 61. ``Been on there so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Together and alone, Gamble and Perkins, 63, have been visiting
the Metro on a nearly daily basis for about 10 years. It's a place,
they say, where you can escape Texas' unmerciful heat. But it's
almost 3 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still hot out,'' says Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   They do not consider diners a refuge, or historical monuments,
or gathering holes. They do not give a second thought to the diners
that are disappearing. For these two, the Metro is simply a place
to go and talk; it carries no special value or worth. If it closed,
Gamble says, ``we'd go somewhere else, Denny's or somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Others gathered here are far more attached to the Metro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' says Kelly Parker, a 19-year-old woman from
Dallas whose posse of friends spills over into multiple booths.
``There are so many weird people here. You never know who's gonna
walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night, the Metro hosts a cast of characters:
bikers, preppy SMU students, punk-rockers, hippies, old-timers and
young couples.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone gathered at this diner, where the red, speckled
booths are ripped and taped and the walls are made of wood
paneling, seems used to the swirling, roller-coaster chaos _ the
table of drunk cowboys and cowgirls who keep dropping utensils and
spilling glasses of water; the waitresses rushing from table to
table, delivering this, cleaning that; the cooks slinging grease;
the patrons singing along to songs on the jukebox. It is a big,
entrancing mess, a blur of every slice of America imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   You can pick out the ones who have never been here. One young,
preppy couple nervously waits for a table next to two big, burly
bikers. The couple's heads are down, their mouths shut.
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanna eat and go,'' the guy says uneasily when asked
why they've come here, to this remote area near downtown Dallas and
the Deep Ellum club district, so late in the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout we just go?'' his girlfriend says, tugging at his
arm.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly take off.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not everyone is cut out for diners.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   According to diner historian Daniel Zilka, the first diner was
not in a stainless-steel building, but in the back of a wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diner was invented (in Providence, R.I.) in 1872 in a
horse-drawn lunch cart,'' he says. ``A guy by the name of Walter
Scott set up shop outside the Providence Journal newspaper, and
people would just walk up and order things.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, entrepreneur Samuel Jones took the concept a
step further, creating wagons so large, people could walk inside
and dine.
</P>
<P>
   Zilka says the diner boom exploded in the 1930s, first in the
Northeast, then across the country. Truckers and deliverymen hungry
for food and conversation populated them, and as the highways tore
through the country, diners followed.
</P>
<P>
   Writers, musicians and, eventually, Hollywood noticed and
embraced them, immortalizing the eateries in books, songs, movies
and art. Edward Hopper's 1942 painting ``Nighthawks'' is often
cited as perfectly capturing the simple, somewhat romantic pleasure
of eating at a small diner in the wee hours of the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s, folk singer Arlo Guthrie penned an 18-minute
song focusing on a diner, ``Alice's Restaurant Massacree,'' that
has since become a staple of classic-rock airwaves. Countless books
have been written about the roadside restaurant. And Hollywood has
embedded images of plates of grits and long conversations into
America's subconscious via a seemingly endless string of movies.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a sitcom based on a diner, ``Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real cultural icons,'' Zilka says. ``That's why
writers and movie-makers love them, because they are a direct
reflection of society. You don't get any more `real' than a 24-hour
diner. The people who work there are real. The people who patronize
them are real. They are America.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Anita Brandon has spent a good chunk of her life working at
24-hour truck stops and diners.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hammond has spent most of his life eating at them.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, 43, is a waitress at the Pink Poodle, where she has
worked for two years. Hammond, 67, is a regular customer there. He
visits at least once a day, sometimes twice or three times.
</P>
<P>
   For both of them, it's a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a night person,'' says Brandon, whose apron is dotted with
pins of cats. ``I can't help it. I love working nights. It's all
I've ever really done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, a rancher who retired from Bell Helicopter five years
ago, says he goes to the Poodle mainly for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best coffee in town,'' says Hammond, who dons a
cowboy hat and pockets a pack of cigarettes. ``Whenever I get the
notion I want coffee, I don't make it (at home). I go up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Hammond and Brandon awhile, though, and it becomes clear
they are drawn to the Poodle for more reasons than the night hours
and coffee. It's the social atmosphere they enjoy, the warmth and
friendliness of the patrons and workers, the unpredictable
happenings that pop up every once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work the bar area (of the restaurant), so I get all the
drunks that come in,'' says Brandon. ``But some of those people are
so drunk, they don't know how or care how much money they're
leaving for tips. You can make good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond says that since he started going to the Poodle, more
than 25 years ago, he has seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, just about everything has happened over there,'' he
says. ``Lots of characters. Some people wanna fight, some are
drunk. But they got good people working there, and they'll throw
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Despite such attractions, the Poodle, like other small diners
and truck stops, is going through a tough time financially. Chain
restaurants and fast-food joints have definitely put a dent in the
popularity of diners, says Zilka.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like all owner-operated gas stations have become
convenience stores,'' he says. ``Every day, we're becoming more and
more of a homogenized society. Restaurants now are sort of like
grazing fields. Someone pours out the food and we all just eat it
up. How many people bake pies anymore? How many people make coffee
anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   As franchise-mania makes every town and city in America, and
increasingly every country, seem familiar _ and people with little
time unconsciously turn to the convenience of franchise stores and
restaurants _ the all-night diner has become an anachronism. But,
as it turns out, this pervasive corporate sameness might end up
being the savior of the diner. For as their utility as roadside
eateries and community gathering places diminishes, they remain
attractive as one of the last outposts for those seeking an escape
from cookie-cutter establishments and cookie-cutter people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those chain restaurants are the places where most people eat,
because they're fast and convenient,'' says Zilka. ``Eating in
America is almost a nuisance now. `Oh, we have to stop and get
something to eat.' Diners have the flavor of what America used to
be, but that's one reason why chain restaurants will never
completely wipe them out. They are different.''

   MURMANSK, Russia _ As visitors navigate the waterway snaking out
of Murmansk harbor, past rusted hulls of fishing vessels and cargo
ships filled with nuclear waste, the sinking of the Russian
submarine Kursk appears less a tragic accident than a disaster
waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   As the sound heads north along the Kola Inlet, toward the
Severomorsk headquarters for the Russian navy's Northern Fleet,
15-foot concrete walls topped with barbed wire rise ominously along
the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusted military ships are behind those walls. They think we
don't know about them but we all do,'' said Nikolai Semenov, a
sailor who moonlights as a fisherman so he can feed his wife and
three children.
</P>
<P>
   The corroding carcasses of a once-proud fleet are an apt
metaphor for Russia's navy, which now can barely feed or pay its
sailors. Patrols have been cut by 70 percent and the post-Soviet
economic collapse has forced the top brass to mothball
three-fourths of the submarine fleet in this Arctic port, where
nearly all of its 400,000 people rely on the military for their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin finally acknowledged the desperate state of the navy
and other branches of the armed forces _ though not in time for the
Kursk's 118 crew members who perished. On Aug. 11, one day before
the disaster, President Vladimir Putin told a Russian Security
Council meeting it was time to reform a military in which ''pilots
don't fly and sailors barely go to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to quickly reform poses not only a danger for Russians,
as the Kursk disaster shows, but to the United States and other
NATO countries as well. Leaking reactors on scrapped ships and
submarines imperil the world's most heavily fished sea. Poorly
trained and equipped Russian crews increase the possibility of more
disasters at sea, maybe next time involving U.S. servicemen.
Experts say there are risks of poorly-supervised or
badly-maintained Russian subs causing a collision with a U.S.
vessel in heavily-trafficked submarine channels. Likely to foot the
bill for such a catastrophe would be the U.S. taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of the navy poses a threat, not only to Russians but
(other) countries,'' said Pavel Flegenhauer, an independent
military analyst based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   All these scenarios raise the question of why landlocked Russia,
the world's largest country, needs a navy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet leaders viewed the remote, icy Barents Sea as a strategic
lake to base enough nuclear submarines to threaten Canada and the
United States with fiery destruction from the top of the globe. The
Arctic submarine force was Moscow's insurance in case its other
nuclear forces were knocked out in the early stages of missile
exchange with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy has survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, but
the funds to sustain the strategy have not. Russia's defense budget
plummeted in the mid-1990s, with the navy receiving only a fraction
of overall military spending, according to Dmitry Litovkin, a
retired navy captain.
</P>
<P>
   Litovkin, a former submariner, said the Northern Fleet's subs
did not receive maintenance in 1999, as admirals diverted most of
their budget to a new nuclear-powered battleship, Peter the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Although the causes of the Kursk's sinking are not known,
neglect may end up topping the list. Several reports have claimed
that the submarine left port without vital batteries to power
backup air-purifying and light systems in an emergency. Russian
newspapers, citing anonymous military sources, said emergency exits
and safety equipment aboard the vessel were substandard when they
were installed in 1994, a compromise hushed up at that time with
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kursk plunged 354 feet to the bottom of the Barents
Sea, the navy had no team to save the crew or retrieve the ship.
Russia's deep-sea diving unit mainly exists on paper _ all training
had stopped and its divers had left for better-paying jobs,
Litovkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of the disaster could be equipment failure.
Regular poaching of metals and other valuable items from naval
vessels has been a chronic problem. Sailors have stolen everything
from air conditioners to silver and titanium casings to supplement
their salaries. A mid-level naval officer receives only $100 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when everyone wanted to join the service
because of the prestige. The navy also promised a free home for
your family. Instead, we waited years for our apartment and months
for our salaries. We stripped metal off ships to resell it,'' said
Alexei Bergnikov, a thick-set 36-year-old father of one and
resident of Murmansk. He left the navy in search of better pay
after serving five years in the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the military, work is hard to come by in Murmansk, a
windswept city where the sun shines just four months a year. Grim,
hand-to-mouth living here makes safety concerns secondary,
compounding the possibility of environmental catastrophe to an area
extending far beyond Russia's borders, ecologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The Kola Peninsula has 270 military and civilian nuclear
reactors on its soil, the largest concentration in the world,
according to the Norwegian environmental group Bellona. The thin
strip of land, 1,000 miles north of Moscow and only 50 miles from
Norway, borders the Barents Sea, the world's most heavily fished
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety of the 140 Russian submarines based on the peninsula have
been decommissioned but not scrapped safely, according to Alexei
Yablokov, former President Boris Yeltsin's environmental adviser.
Thirty-five of the subs still contain nuclear reactors or fuel, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has neither the money nor facilities to transfer and
store the radioactive fuel. The result is a growing stockpile of
poorly stored nuclear waste, much of it heaped in docked submarines
or boats that require constant maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''These vessels are a catastrophe waiting to happen. They are
floating Chernobyls,'' Yablokov said. ''They require constant
cooling or else there is the possibility of an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those at greatest risk are in Murmansk. The town, built at the
end of World War I, has experienced its share of close calls in
recent years: In May 1998, radio stations warned people to take
iodine tablets after a fire on a nuclear-armed submarine set off
fears of nuclear fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Those who try to raise the nuclear waste problem publicly risk
persecution. Alexander Nikitin, a former Navy captain turned
environmentalist, has spent two years in prison and five years in
court after publishing a report detailing nuclear dumping by the
Northern Fleet. After winning acquittal on charges of treason
earlier this year, the Federal Security Service, the successor
agency to the KGB, has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial constraints and environmental dangers, the
question of abolishing the navy does not figure in the Kremlin's
calculations for military reform. In fact, Putin himself views the
navy as a vehicle to reclaim Russia's superpower status.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russia's new defense strategy published this
spring, Putin wants to reduce Russia's land-based nuclear forces in
favor of the underfunded conventional forces. To keep up a
semblance of nuclear parity with the United States, Russia would
rely heavily on its submarine-based nuclear missiles, with the
Northern Fleet. This would be a continuation of the same Soviet
policy of an Arctic-focused deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Russia does not have the funds to adequately carry
out these reforms. Moreover, the strategy itself is anachronistic,
says retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral James Carroll, vice president
of the Center for Defense Information based in Washington. He
believes that both Russia and the United States are pursuing
outdated military strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should quit trying to play the Cold War and preparing for
World War III,'' he said. ``They should be talking about
cooperation'' on environmental and other issues.

DON'T TAKE THIS ONE PLAY AND RUN WITH IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ OK, they ran it. So now what?
</P>
<P>
   The most called-for play in the Patriots' arsenal _ backup
quarterback Michael Bishop running the option at the goal line _
finally appeared, and the result was everything talk show callers
have been saying it would be.
</P>
<P>
   It was a touchdown. It was excitement. It was fun.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a play that's going to take this team to the Super
Bowl, but who's worrying about that these days?
</P>
<P>
   The former Kansas State All-American scrambled through half the
Carolina Panthers' defense on a 1-yard scoring run in the first
quarter. The touchdown capped a 13-play, 67-yard drive that had
been engineered by Drew Bledsoe. When the ball got stuck at the
1-yard line on second down, Bishop came in and tapped Bledsoe on
the shoulder, to the delight of the fans who noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry mate, you're out,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Bledsoe was low-fiving Bishop as he jogged off
the field. That solitary touchdown will launch a thousand calls to
sports talk hosts today, probably enough to send Verizon workers
back out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   This is what so many had envisioned for so long _ sit the
thick-legged Bledsoe down when the ball is near the goal line and
put in Bishop, who moves like a tap dancer, with rhythm and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, who obviously had been
listening to talk radio when he said he was working on his game
plans, finally opted to try it, and off Bishop went into the night.
</P>
<P>
   That Bishop didn't do another thing the rest of the game will go
unnoticed by Patriot loyalists who insist his scrambling ability is
the key to the success of this team.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop didn't throw a pass Thursday night because head coach
Bill Belichick wanted to see John Friesz and Tom Brady before he
makes a final decision on who will be the third-string quarterback.
Bishop's preseason passing performance was thus left at 22 of 44 _
a 50 percent completion percentage _ with as many interceptions (2)
as touchdown passes (2). But that won't mean a thing to Bishop's
followers, who'll argue Bledsoe is all about numbers, while Bishop
is about finding ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   What also will go unnoticed is the fact that before Bledsoe took
his leave, he went 7 of 8 for 78 yards in the Patriots' 29-21
victory, pushing his summer numbers to 35 of 56, a completion rate
of 62.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They won't even notice that while Bledsoe has been sacked only
twice this summer, the fleet-footed Bishop has been hauled down
eight times, in part because of his inexperience at solving the
riddles of NFL defenses even when they're being run by
second-stringers.
</P>
<P>
   All they will remember is Michael Bishop ran the option for a
score from the 1-yard line when he got his chance, so think of the
possibilities if he just were given the ball more often.
</P>
<P>
   A talk radio caller this week went so far as to suggest that
Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback Kent Graham would be better
for the Patriots' offense than Bledsoe, which made you wonder when
the people were going to come back to put the restraints on him and
take him back to his room.
</P>
<P>
   For any thinking football mind, there is no quarterback
controversy here, either in terms of who should be the starting
quarterback or who should be running the option. The answer is
Bledsoe to the first question and Bishop to the second. Each in his
own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' Bledsoe said of Bishop's cameo
appearance. ``He puts a different kind of pressure on a defense. He
can stretch the corner. It's going to be something defenses will
have to prepare for. If it helps us win games, I'm all for it. I'll
high-five him on my way out, and he'll high-five me on my way back
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Using that goal-line option was a brilliant move by Weis and
Belichick because it showcased what Bishop might do in a game and
forces opposing defensive coordinators to work on how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   What it also did was make clear that the play should be used
because Bishop ran it twice, first using a handoff to fullback Tony
Carter to read how the defense would play the option, then
jitterbugging through the Panthers' first defense. One thing is
clear: Bishop knows how to run the option to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corner hesitated for a minute,'' Bishop said. ``That's an
opportunity to cut it up. I think during the season it can help us
out in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can; Bishop will score on it often if given the
chance, and with touchdowns still in short supply around here, Weis
should utilize any way he can get his offense into the end zone.
Bishop is one of those ways.
</P>
<P>
   But getting Bishop in position to do what he does best is still
Drew Bledsoe's responsibility and no one else's.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Jose Offerman drives his Rolls-Royce to the ballpark,
perhaps the gaudiest set of wheels in a Red Sox parking lot jammed
with luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in Japan, Lou Merloni rode a motor scooter, a gift
from Bobby Rose, the former California Angel and his American
teammate on the Yokohama Bay Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Rose was the MVP of the team,'' Merloni said, ``so they
gave him a Saab, which meant his scooter was available, so he gave
it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The scooter proved handy when trying to maneuver through choking
traffic in search of a parking spot in Yokohama, the city of 3
million about 20 miles from Tokyo. ``It was crazier than having New
York City right next to LA,'' Merloni said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were times Merloni, who had never been on a scooter
before, longed for the creature comforts of home, a 15-hour plane
ride away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the most humbling moments of my life,''
he said. ``When things aren't going good baseball-wise, you're not
playing, and you've got to jump on a scooter to drive home through
a crowd. A couple of times I'd get so upset, I'd be screaming
inside my helmet. I mean, here I am, I'm in Japan, I'm not playing,
I'm driving a damn scooter. It was a very humbling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Kid, his career with the Red Sox apparently
having come to an end despite his key role as an emergency fill-in
for Nomar Garciaparra in the Division Series against Cleveland last
October, signed a deal last November with the Bay Stars, one of six
teams in Japan's Central League. The Sox have a close working
arrangement with the Bay Stars. Before he joined the Sox, pitcher
Tomo Ohka pitched for Yokohama, though he wound up being demoted to
the Bay Stars' minor league team.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni, promised a chance to play third base every day in
Japan, signed with Yokohama last November for a base salary of
around $650,000. That was over three times more than the big-league
minimum of $200,000 he probably would have gotten from the Red Sox,
who held little promise he would be with the big-league club.
</P>
<P>
   Spring training in Japan began the first week of February,
almost three weeks before position players report to camp in the
States. From his first day, Merloni-san realized that in Japan,
they do things a little differently than the sons of Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, players were required to report to the hotel
lobby to have their blood pressure checked, to make sure they were
in condition for that day's workout. Then the whole team, including
manager and coaches, would head out for a 10-minute walk to a
vacant lot, where the team did a series of stretching exercises
unknown to Yokohama's newest gaijin, the Japanese word for
foreigner or outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of really weird movements,'' Merloni said. ``That first
week, everybody was laughing at me because I'd never done this
stuff before.''
</P>
<P>
   His second day in camp, Merloni said, players lined up on both
baselines for some soft toss, each hitter with a bucket of balls
and a teammate to toss the ball in the air to be hit. ``The buckets
were the size of water coolers, full of baseballs,'' Merloni said.
``I asked my interpreter, `How many swings, 50?' He says, `No, the
whole bucket.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `How many balls are in there?' He said, `About 250.' I
said, `You can't be serious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Merloni said, he would have taken no more than 20 or
30 swings in the batting cage that early in camp. It was no
different for the pitchers. One Japanese teammate, coming off elbow
surgery, wanted to test his arm. Merloni said he threw 400 pitches
during a bullpen session. Bret Saberhagen, in similar
circumstances, would have thrown about 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first at-bat in an intrasquad game, I'll never forget,'' he
said. ``The first pitch I saw was a slider. Then two curveballs, a
splitter, another slider, and I struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going back to the dugout thinking, `Hey, this ain't
right. It's Feb. 6. I should be on my couch, watching TV, getting
ready for spring training in two weeks.' I saw five breaking balls
that first day, an indication of what I was going to see the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the adjustment in spring training. I gave up on the
fastball. I wasn't going to see one to hit. When I did see one, it
was just to set you up, so I just washed it out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni lived rent-free in Yokohama. It's one of the perks of
being a gaijin; he lived in a nice condo provided by the club. The
Bay Stars also furnished him with an interpreter who was always
with him, home and away, except if Merloni would step out for a
bite to eat or go to a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, he picked up enough language basics to
venture out on his own. There were a few English-speaking places in
town, usually full of Australians and Americans, though he gave up
on watching ESPN. ``They only showed cricket matches, soccer, and
Australian rules football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in touch with friends back home, including
Garciaparra, through e-mail and by phone. His mom and grandmother
came for a visit; together, they toured memorials at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki commemorating the victims of the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk out of there with a bad feeling in your stomach,'' he
said. ``The history, it had to be done, I guess, but it was tough
to see. You walk out of there and put yourself in their shoes. You
hear stories about people burning, and jumping into the water, but
the water was boiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this picture of a huge rock. You're looking at it,
staring at it and thinking, `What is this?' But when you really
stare at it, you see an outline of a woman, whose shadow has been
burned in this rock. I get chills just thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Merloni quickly learned that contrary to what he'd
been told, playing every day was out of the question. The Bay Stars
already had a native player at third base whose defense, Merloni
said, would have ranked him with the top big-league third basemen.
``I had to be perfect,'' he said. ``If I went 3 for 4 but made an
error, then I couldn't field. If I made three good plays in the
field but was 0 for 4, then I couldn't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans, he said, were uniformly encouraging. The reporters who
covered the team, relentlessly curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had about five reporters with us all the time,'' he said.
``They wanted to know why I was single, they wanted to know about
my personal life, what my nickname is, my favorite American word.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni said he never fell out of favor with the Yokohama brass,
but the manager, Hiroshi Gondo, didn't show much confidence in him.
``We'd get guys on first and third with no out and he'd hit for
me,'' said Merloni, who batted just .213, mostly as a pinch hitter.
``They'd pinch bunt for me. I'd tell them, `Hey, I was the guy who
pinch bunt for other guys in the big leagues.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni came away respecting the talent of the Japanese players,
but he was continually surprised by some of the quirks: the
determination to keep the identity of the starting pitcher secret,
for example, until just before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Teams would go to great pains to hide who was going to pitch.
One opponent, he said, had its pitcher taking ground balls at short
and turning double plays in an effort to lull the opposition into
believing he wasn't pitching that day. It wasn't until lineup cards
were exchanged, Merloni said, that anyone would know who was
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Why the secrecy? ``They told me, `If you know who's pitching,
you can go to bed and get yourself ready to face him,' '' Merloni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni had dressed in the cramped clubhouses of Fenway Park,
but he never shared his locker with a tractor, as he had to do in
one Japanese ballpark. The players changed in a storage shed.
Sometimes, it was worse to be in the clubhouse, because of all the
cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy might hit a home run,'' he said, ``and they'd put five
or six cartons of cigarettes on a table and everybody would just
grab 'em and be smoking everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the controversy sparked by Carl Everett's bumping
umpire Ron Kulpa, the incident couldn't compare with the brawl
Merloni witnessed after an opposing hitter was called out on
strikes to end the game with the tying run on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws his helmet down and pushes the umpire, then runs
after him,'' Merloni said. ``The manager came flying out, and he
shoves the umpire to the ground. It turned into a bench-clearing
brawl between the four umpires and their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing there watching, and I couldn't believe it. Guys
were swinging at the umpires, hitting them. Five guys were
suspended five games. The umpire had a broken rib and was out 2 1/2
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His playing time dwindling, Merloni was so desperate to leave
Japan he offered to give back part of his salary in order to return
to the States. Eventually, he reached a settlement, and was back by
the end of last month. Enough time, he figured, to finish the
season in the US. Even before he got back home, he was in touch
with the Red Sox, and they signed him to a minor league contract.
After playing very well in an 11-game stint at Pawtucket, the Sox
called him up at the start of their just-finished homestand,
allowing him to recoup the money he forfeited in Japan. Merloni has
played a big part in the team's resurgence, batting .366 in his
first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   While he's glad to be back, Merloni said he gained some valuble
insight _ as well as a measure of financial security _ during his
time in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought me a whole new level of appreciation,'' he said.
``Sometimes when you're in the big leagues, you get so caught up in
it. Every time I didn't do well last year, I was scared that I was
going to be sent down. I played scared that I would do bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I go 0 for 4, I don't care. Sure, I'm disappointed
that I didn't get the job done, but I'm not going to go home and
kill myself. They know that when I go out there, I'm going to give
it the best that I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things in this game you can't control. If what
I do ain't good enough, so be it. I've had some great moments, a
great career. I haven't had a `career' career, but for a guy like
me, one day in the big leagues is a great career. A home run in my
first Fenway at-bat, playing in the playoffs, that's a great career
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of career he can someday look back on with fondness,
when he's tooling around Framingham on his scooter.

A SHAM OF A SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that ``Survivor'' is over, CBS presents ``Helper.'' No one
knows if this new show will get 40 million viewers for the final
episode. No one knows if Americans want to see Americans do nice
things.
</P>
<P>
   They said ``Survivor'' was ``reality TV.'' They said it was real
because it was about ordinary people in an unscripted drama with a
surprise ending. Real-ly? As far as I can tell, the script was as
predictable as a day in Congress or in an overcrowded school. There
is no mystery as to who wins when 16 people are left on an island
and told that they have to vote one another off until only one is
left to win a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone actually think that the winner of such a contrivance
would be anyone other than a mean, manipulative son or daughter of
a female dog? Rush Limbaugh, Donald Trump, Mike Tyson, and Rudolph
Giuliani would have loved being in the final four after having
voted off Jesse Helms, Rupert Murdoch, O.J. Simpson, Mark Fuhrman,
Lorena Bobbitt, Klaus Von Bulow, Susan Smith, Charles Stuart,
Richard Nixon, Newt Gingrich, Don Imus, and the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of ``Survivor'' was supreme jerk Richard Hatch. Even
as the losers voted for him, one told Hatch, ``You are an openly
arrogant and pompous human being.'' What a surprise! A corporate
trainer winning a son-of-a-female-dog competition! Anybody ever
heard of George Steinbrenner?
</P>
<P>
   As an African-American, I found ``Survivor'' a prime example of
certain white folks with way too much time on their hands. If I get
this right, we were supposed to be gripped with the struggle of 16
people engaged in a primordial, back-stabbing Olympics, with
finalists who were rewarded with ``Got Milk'' ads and wore shirts
for sneaker companies even before the final show.
</P>
<P>
   You could have filmed ``Survivor'' for 400 years if it had been
African-Americans, from slave ships to plantations to lynchings to
shootings in housing projects to police brutality. Forget about
promoting products. How about exclusive CBS footage of black folks
being shafted for promotions?
</P>
<P>
   Latinos must be scratching their heads, too. How come the
cameras at the border were not from CBS but from the INS? Haitians
did not get a million dollars trying to flee to Florida from a
military coup. They got the baking heat of asphalt at Guantanamo
Bay. And do not forget the Golden Venture, the decrepit ship that
in 1993 spit 286 emaciated Chinese immigrants out into rough waters
off Queens after 100 squalid days at sea. Ten immigrants died
trying to swim to shore. The United States detained many of them
for more than three years and sent 170 of them back to China. None
of them ``Got Milk.''
</P>
<P>
   So now that you have gotten enough of jerks winning a million
dollars, isn't it time for a show that celebrates 13 weeks of
making America a better place? I'm talking about goodness that
builds on itself until it becomes good policy for all of us. Here
are possible plots for the 13 weeks of ``Helper.''
</P>
<P>
   Week 1: Alert teachers in suburban Dallas discover
Columbine-like plot to shoot up school.
</P>
<P>
   Week 2: Concern leads to after-school programs, gun control, and
George W. Bush's rejection of cash from the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Week 3: Daughter of vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney is
harassed by skinheads for being lesbian. Cheney drives up to scene
and pushes them away.
</P>
<P>
   Week 4: Cheney leads fight for hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   Week 5: Sixth-grader in Los Angeles is buried under debris as
dilapidated ceiling collapses at school. Child is rescued by
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Week 6: President authorizes $100 billion to repair the nation's
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Week 7: Man is demoted for wanting more than a week off to help
with newborn child. Hotel maid is fired after attending too many
school meetings for her child with learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Week 8: Congress enacts flexible family leave _ with pay.
</P>
<P>
   Week 9: Colin Powell's daughter is denied job because of racism.
Powell tells GOP to either support affirmative action or he'll
become a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Week 10: GOP rewrites platform to support affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Week 11: Five service workers leaving work suffer multiple
fractures in crackup. None has health insurance. All have wives and
small children. HMOs couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   Week 12: Congress enacts universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   Week 13: ``Helper'' cast gathers around the fire to hold hands
and say the Pledge of Allegiance, with liberty and justice for all,
and not a million dollars for the most manipulative son of a female
dog.

`SURVIVOR' WINNER HONED STRATEGIES EARLY ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, R.I. _ Richard H. Hatch Jr. was a survivor long
before he sank his toes into the sand on an uninhabited island near
Borneo, speared a stingray off the beach there in the South China
Sea, or strutted naked through the Tagi camp on his 39th birthday
to the shock and/or entertainment of one of the larger TV series
audiences in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   His history of overcoming obstacles began here in his hometown.
Despite appearances, life in this town close to the ocean and to
Newport, full of abundant hydrangea bushes and stone walls, was not
a charmed one for Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   He says he grew up in a family devoid of love. His parents
divorced after he and his three siblings were born. He dropped out
of school as a senior and battled a significant weight problem, all
while coping with the stigma of being gay in a strait-laced
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a loving home, by any stretch,'' Hatch said during
a telephone conference call Thursday. ``I don't remember being told
`I love you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of a teacher who encouraged him to join a
summer outdoor adventure program in Maine when he was 18, Hatch
began turning his life around. And eventually, he earned a diploma,
spent time in the Army and at West Point, jumped out of airplanes,
received a bachelor's degree in behavioral science, became a
corporate trainer, even adopted a troubled child of his own three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, he became the ultimate survivor, winning $1
million and a car for being the last man out on CBS's reality-TV
series ``Survivor,'' which had its final episode Wednesday night.
Although Hatch returned from Pulau Tiga in April after spending 39
days there, he had to lie to his sister and his son and keep the
results from his mother, to maintain the summer's best-kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   However, for those who know Hatch _ everyone from the contractor
working on his three-bedroom Cape-style house on a hill, to the
personal trainer at Newport Athletic Club who helped him shed 100
pounds before he started taping the program last March, to the
video production expert who filmed the audition tape that drew
CBS's attention _ he has been a man on a mission for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Smyth, his muscle-bound personal trainer, said Hatch began
devoting himself in February 1999 to a low-fat, high-protein diet
and intense workouts _ which eventually built up to four-hour
sessions after CBS chose him for ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick and tired of being overweight,'' Smyth said.
``When I first met him, he was not anywhere near as confident as he
was on the island.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing so much weight, Smyth said, gave Hatch drive.
</P>
<P>
   But something else was driving Hatch: his newly adopted son,
Christopher, now 10. The boy began gaining weight after getting off
some medication, and Hatch did not want to see another child
ostracized for being larger than his peers. Hatch said he believed
he needed to serve as a role model, and had to drop the pounds
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Christopher would sit in the hall at the gym and read
or play Gameboy while Hatch worked out, Smyth said. But the boy
soon joined his father on 6-mile jogs at 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, Christopher wanted to quit during
one of those runs, but Hatch put him in a headlock to try to force
him to continue. The boy complained at school. And the event
erupted into a legal battle with Rhode Island child welfare
authorities, who removed the boy, and later returned him, with much
emotional damage already done, Hatch believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a firm parent,'' said Tim Downes of Downes
Construction, the company that has been slowly overhauling Hatch's
modest house since 1998. ``And the kid probably needs to be treated
that way. He's a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   Downes, whose crew was hammering decorative cedar shakes on the
house, said he knew Hatch had a good chance of winning because of
what he does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch owns Tri-Whale training, a corporate management company he
founded in Washington, D.C., and later moved to Newport. (The name
reflects his love for whales.) Growing up in Middletown, it would
be hard not to be drawn to the surrounding ocean. In fact, Hatch
began college at the Florida Institute of Technology, majoring in
marine biology.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined the Army and went to West Point, left halfway
through, moved to Manhattan, studied accounting at Baruch College
of the City University of New York, attended George Mason
University in Virginia, and finished college at National Louis's
Washington campus with a degree in applied behavioral sciences.
He's continuing his education at Providence College.
</P>
<P>
   But the jump-start on his life _ and on his survival skills _
came that summer when he was 18 and signed up for the adventure
camp Horizon Bound in the Maine woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so life-altering for me,'' Hatch said of the
now-defunct program.
</P>
<P>
   So what's he going to do with the $1 million?
</P>
<P>
   Hatch says he wants to start a camp like that of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is juggling the onslaught of potential
managers, dealmakers, and interview requests. (He had 60 broadcast
interviews to tackle just Thursday, including another stint with
David Letterman.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to figure out what the smartest way of
handling them is,'' Hatch said. ``A book is a possibility. I think
I've had an interesting life, topping that off with having been on
`Survivor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although he declined to discuss any endorsement deals that may
be in the works with companies such as Reebok, Hatch has already
signed on with American Program Bureau, a Newton-based firm that
sets up speaking engagements and counts Mikhail Gorbachev and
Nelson Mandela among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Walker, American Program's chairman and CEO, said Hatch
will earn more from his speeches than his ``Survivor'' prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard is very hot,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hatch will be filling in next week on a Rhode Island
radio station's 9 a.m. hourlong broadcast. And he's not shy in
front of a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Brown, senior production director at Perspective
Communications Group Inc., a Middletown company that videotaped
Hatch's demo tape for CBS, said he hammed it up for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, shot in his favorite local restaurant, Hatch
jokingly asked the chef if he had anything to eat. The chef nodded
toward a piece of uncooked steak, waiting to be grilled for another
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch took a huge bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it was staged,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hatch returns to Rhode Island, he says, he hopes his
lifestyle will not change, and he claims he will not flaunt his
wealth. Although he may flaunt his body. He lost another 34 pounds
on ``Survivor,'' and he underwent surgery to remove the skin around
his midsection that had been stretched beyond the point that
exercise could make it taut again.
</P>
<P>
   He is not dating anyone, but would like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prize,'' he said, ``may complicate that.''

   WALTHAM, Mass. _ This is his home. This is the place where he
will hold his free basketball camp for 100 youths this weekend.
This is where you can find him Sunday afternoons, admiring the
skills of Drew Bledsoe, but still rooting for his hometown Bears.
This is where, from October to May, you can find Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? When will the Celtics finally do what they
have been hinting at doing all summer? When will they make their
best player a full-time New England visitor?
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, you have heard a lot about the Celtics'
24-year-old captain. At times, his own employers talk about him as
if he were Sherman Klump stuffed into basketball shorts. Lost in
the commentary is this: He's smart. And when you're smart, you know
when someone is trying to get rid of you.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are trying; Walker is resisting.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walker's friends called him earlier this week and asked
if he was keeping up with ``Survivor.'' Walker said he had never
heard of the show, even though surviving is the theme of his
Celtics summer. His bosses are apparently trying to vote him off
the team. While they make their calls, he'll be at HealthPoint
today, tomorrow, and Sunday, teaching and coaching young basketball
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother me in the beginning,'' Walker said of the
trade speculation, ``but there's only so much one person can take.
It's a business, so if you have a chance to improve your team with
a trade, you should do it. But after a while, after seeing your
name come up consistently in trade talks, it makes you feel
unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either (the Celtics) are going to make a move or they're not.
If they are, they should go ahead and do it. If they're not, let's
keep the trade talk to a minimum. It's the summer. Why is it so
hard for them to keep my name out of their mouths?''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who dreams of making a community impact the same way Mo
Vaughn did, was asked if he wants to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I like it here. I'd like to be a part of our
improvement. I'm tired of this team not being in the playoffs. It's
definitely not my first choice to leave. There's not a player in
the NBA who enjoys being traded. You don't want to pick up and go
play in a different city for a different coach.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Walker, Celtics management usually behaves like
an indecisive lover. (itals)I love you. I don't love you. I hate
you. I might love you. Check with me tomorrow.(unitals) Never mind.
Before the Heat traded for Eddie Jones, Miami and the Celtics could
have completed a deal involving Walker, Jamal Mashburn, and P.J.
Brown. The Pacers were willing to trade Austin Croshere for Walker,
but Croshere rejected the deal because, while he was interested in
Boston, he wanted to play with Paul Pierce and Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jerry West retired in Los Angeles, he was contemplating
another brilliant move: acquiring Walker and his salary without
giving up Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. If that trade had gone
through, the NBA wouldn't be fair anymore. Whom could you double
team with Walker, Shaq, and Kobe all on the floor? In the land of
the Oscars, Walker would be a 21st-century Oscar Robertson,
dropping effortless triple-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   He could do the same in Boston if management brought in more
help. (itals)Starting(unitals) help. Everyone can see the Celtics
have improved their bench, even though winning teams are usually
the ones that have the luxury of going shopping for spare parts in
the summer. When a team wins 37 games, loses its most rugged
rebounder (Danny Fortson), and adds more role players to its bench,
it is destined to win 37 games again.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, you have to wonder why Rick Pitino, Chris
Wallace, Leo Papile, and company would try to trade one of the few
Celtics players who would not anchor another team's bench. Just as
puzzling was Pitino's Don't Be Like My Best Player monologue to a
group of teenage summer campers in Pittsburgh. Pitino denies making
the remarks, which were recorded by Paul Zeise, a reliable
journalist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Pittsburgh, Walker realized the Celtics were looking
to move him. Because Pitino is the caretaker of this organization,
it is his right to do whatever he wants in terms of personnel. But
after all of his not-so-secret attempts to trade Walker, Pitino had
better hope he is successful before training camp. You can't try to
trade a player all summer and expect him to be enthusiastic about
playing for you in the fall. Larry Brown is making the same mistake
with Allen Iverson in Philadelphia, and his actions are more
foolish than Pitino's because the 76ers are a winning team. Why not
moan about your stars' flaws in private?
</P>
<P>
   The irony, though, is that Walker's weaknesses seem to be
shrinking while the Celtics' seem to be growing. Thursday, fatigue
was draped on Walker like a designer scarf. He had taken a Los
Angeles-to-Boston red-eye so he could be here for Boston's first
'Toine's Summer Camp (he has had four in Chicago). Banners,
itineraries, and basketballs were strewn throughout his condo. You
could tell he needed sleep, but you could also tell the idea of the
camp invigorated him.
</P>
<P>
   He was too immature to be invigorated by others when he first
arrived in Boston. That is no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen the team I had in Chicago,'' Walker said
of the camp team he coached. ``I had two little guards who were
putting crossover dribbles on everybody. And I had my brother
(12-year-old Jarvis, already 6 feet 1 inch) playing the post. Man.
We went 7-2 for the week. We lost the championship by 2 in overtime
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Before telling the story, Walker was nearly sinking in an
armchair. Retelling it, though, gave him a temporary lift. He is
predictable in that he has soft spots for kids and sports. He loves
talking about the Red Sox (``They don't have big names, but they
know how to win''), Tiger Woods (``I never watch golf on TV, but he
made me a fan on Sunday''), and the achievements of his teammates
(``I played with Jerome (Moiso) and Paul (Pierce) at UCLA; they
both look good'').
</P>
<P>
   He's also honest. He wants to ``give back'' with his free camps,
but he also wants ``to watch the kids play ball. I like watching
young talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was at the Capital Grille Thursday, treating his
volunteer coaches to dinner. He'll be at the Celtics practice
facility all weekend. If you care about the future of this team,
you should hope he'll be at the facility in the fall, too.

IPO VALUE IS STILL HAZY, BUT VERIZON'S POTENTIAL IS CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of it as an 800-pound gorilla with a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Wireless Inc., with more than 25 million customers the
nation's largest mobile phone business, filed papers for an initial
public stock offering Thursday, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company, majority owned by the phone company Verizon
Communications, suggested in its documents that the IPO could raise
up to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the figure would make the Verizon Wireless IPO the
third-largest ever, analysts and investors widely believe it to be
a low-ball estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The best guesses we heard for an eventual, real number exceed
that of the biggest ever IPO, the $10.6 billion public launch of a
``tracking'' stock for rival AT&AMP;T Wireless Group four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is moving at breakneck speed to make good on the
huge potential of wireless Internet access and the growing demand
for voice communications over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   That takes a boatload of cash, creates unwieldy organizations
tangled by hypergrowth, and sometimes demands action before
important technical issues have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out whether Verizon Wireless makes sense to own depends
on how the IPO values the company, impossible to tell yet without
knowing how much of the business it wants to sell to the public and
at exactly what price. We have to wait for those details.
</P>
<P>
   But valuations aside, analysts and money managers point to
Verizon Wireless as perhaps the leading competitor among a top tier
of national wireless companies, such as AT&AMP;T Wireless Group, Sprint
PCS, and Nextel Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the greatest footprint in the country right now, the
highest number of customers, and a solid management team of
experienced people,'' said Mark Lowenstein, who runs wireless
research at the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The big ``footprint'' means that Verizon Wireless, based in New
Jersey, provides wireless service in 96 of the nation's 100 largest
cities. That kind of market generated sales of $13.5 billion last
year, and $7.3 billion through the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these guys and Sprint PCS are the two best-positioned
wireless players today,'' said John Lathrop, manager of the MFS
Global Telecommunications Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But its national market was made possible by a series of
rapid-fire mergers and combinations. Now, Verizon must figure out
how to meld four different operations into one smooth business.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created when Bell Atlantic merged its wireless
business with the Airtouch operation owned by Vodafone. When Bell
Atlantic merged with GTE Corp. (and changed its name to Verizon
Communications), it added GTE's wireless business to the pot. A
fourth business, PrimeCo, is the final piece of Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   They are all slightly different. And some, notably the old Bell
Atlantic operations, are run better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their biggest challenge right now is pulling together all
these different carriers they've acquired,'' Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all the combinations, Vodafone owns 45 percent of
the wireless company, and Verizon Communications holds the rest of
its stock. Those percentages will decline when public shareholders
take a slice of the pie in the Verizon Wireless IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Another big challenge for all the leading wireless companies:
Are they operating on the best technology standard for the future?
There is no obvious answer.
</P>
<P>
   Europe got a big jump on America when it comes to wireless
communications because the vast majority of systems there are
operating on one technical standard. Not so in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS, use a
system called CDMA. Others, principally AT&AMP;T Wireless Group, employ
another, called TDMA. The Europeans are operating on a third
standard.
</P>
<P>
   It's Beta vs. VHS, only much more complicated. And billions are
being invested in new or upgraded towers using different standards.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, like Lowenstein, believe multiple standards will
live on for years. For those who think the world will converge to
one standard _ or to several that can operate with each other
sooner rather than later _ most believe CDMA is the better option
for today.
</P>
<P>
   The Verizon Wireless IPO will be managed by Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs, a rich detail that did not escape close observers.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, Verizon Communications spun out an interest
of another giant operating unit, the Burlington, Mass. Internet
infrastructure company Genuity Inc., and employed Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney to handle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity shares have been a flop from the start, opening weakly
and trading more than $2 below their offering price.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill and Goldman Sachs carry some recent baggage of their
own. They managed the AT&AMP;T Wireless Group IPO in April, another
disappointment so far. Those shares finished about 16 percent below
their IPO price as of Thursday.

PROMISING TRAVERS FIELD HAS FADED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Going into the Kentucky Derby, run on
the first Saturday in May, this looked like the best crop of
3-year-olds in memory. Led by Fusaichi Pegasus, touted as a
superhorse, the sophomore division was supposed to be both talented
and deep. So, what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it looked like it was going to be a hell of a lot better
than it turned out to be,'' said Cot Campbell, president of Dogwood
Stable, which will run Impeachment in Saturday's $1 million Travers
at Saratoga. ``But I do think it's too early for people to make a
decision that it's a very bad group. We don't know that yet. It may
be that they do more than they've shown so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus did win the Kentucky Derby, but he was beaten
by Red Bullet, whose connections skipped the Derby, over an off
track in the Preakness. Fusaichi Pegasus then hurt a hoof in his
stall while in training for the Belmont Stakes _ from which Red
Bullet was also withheld _ and he has not run since. Following the
Belmont, Fusaichi Pegasus was syndicated to stud for $70 million,
making him almost too expensive to race, though his camp insists
he'll return in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was discovered Wednesday that Red Bullet, who had
run a dull third in the Dwyer at Belmont July 9, will go on the
shelf until next year after X-rays revealed he had sustained a
slight fracture of the left front leg that his camp feared would
only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is the Triple Crown, which had started out so
strongly in May, had faded completely by the Belmont in June, when
Commendable, a plodder at best, won the third leg. Of the 19 horses
who started the Derby, only three have made it to the Travers:
Impeachment, who finished third in the Derby; Curule, who was
seventh; and Commendable, who wound up 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what happens with a horse who has a problem
(hello, Red Bullet), but I can't understand not running in a big
race when you've got a shot (hello, Fusaichi Pegasus),'' said
Campbell, 72, who has owned horses since 1969. ``What, $1 million
is not enough, so you're going to wait for a race worth $4 million
(the Breeders' Cup Classic in November)? The classics are our best
races, and the Travers is a classic. I'm from the school that says,
`When you're horse is doing good, run him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, after seeing him in the Derby, that Fusaichi
Pegasus was a superhorse, but I don't think that anymore. He's in
great hands (trained by the cautious Neil Drysdale), and he has a
great pedigreee (by the late Mr. Prospector), but you couldn't call
him a superhorse now, as little as he's run.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, listed at 12-1 for the Travers, is far from
special, but he does have one accomplishment. He was the only horse
to race in all three legs of the Triple Crown this year, finishing
third in the Preakness and fifth in the Belmont. A son of Deputy
Minister, Impeachment also came back in the Haskell Aug. 6,
finishing sixth, and is, by today's standards, an iron horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rugged kind of horse,'' said Campbell. ``He likes to
mix it up. He likes to get bounced around. The more they bounce
him, the better it makes him. Twenty or 30 years ago, Impeachment's
campaign would have been considerd moderate. Now, it's a grueling
campaign. But he's never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could drop him down, but he's better off running for big
money. He comes on late and gets us a piece of the purse. The
Haskell wasn't his best race, but it set him up for the Travers.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment may be slow, but at least he's tough. That's more
than can be said for most of his fellow sophomores, and that's why
this class is considered a disappointment.

<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ The great Arnold Palmer has played with and
against most of golf's legends over the years. Few players have a
greater respect for the game's tradition and history. Indeed, he's
been a major part of that tradition and history.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer, in town for the Senior PGA FleetBoston Classic,
which kicks off Friday at Nashawtuc Country Club, says one player
may stand above the rest. He speaks, of course, of 24-year-old
Tiger Woods, who recently won his third major of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he has surpassed everyone in his ability
to play,'' said Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem Woods is likely to face as he continues his
assault on the PGA record book is a lack of competition, Palmer
said. Woods, and the Tour, need competition to get better.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's accomplishments to date have been well documented,
particularly his record-setting performances at the Masters and the
US and British Opens. Two things left to shoot for are Byron
Nelson's mark of winning 11 consecutive tournaments in 1945, which
will be awfully tough to match given the expansion of the Tour, and
Jack Nicklaus's 18 major tournament victories. Woods is off to a
good start on that one, having won five majors, including four of
the last five.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say there's never going to be anything like this
again,'' said Palmer. ``Unless something jumps the track for Tiger
Woods, he's going to set a lot of records. He has brought a
tremendous amount of attention to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``How it is affecting him personally, and if that's going to
affect how he does in the future, I don't know. He's still only 24
years old,'' said Palmer, noting he himself didn't start on the pro
Tour until he was 25. Woods already has four years as a pro, and
millions of dollars, under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said Woods's utter domination may not be the best thing
for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to tune in to see what he's doing, and at
what point are they going to get bored with Tiger?'' Palmer asked.
``It's going to take a lot of enthusiasm. You're going to see how
he can keep doing this with the steam he has displayed this
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer recalled a conversation he had with Nicklaus at the 1997
Masters, Woods's first year as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so in awe with his game that there's no telling how
many Masters he'll win or how many tournaments he'll win,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer said Woods needs someone to keep him honest, a rival.
``What an impact it would have,'' Palmer said. ``It would be
tremendous for the game of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer thinks he has a candidate in Charles Howell, an Oklahoma
State graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to put pressure on him, but Charlie is only 20. He's only
slightly built, and on a slight downhill on a tee shot, he hit it
374 yards,'' Palmer said. ``That's a start. He's very good and can
play. He's confident; just how much discipline he has will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare Woods with Nicklaus in his prime, Palmer said
he likes aspects of both players' games.
</P>
<P>
   He gives the driving edge to Woods. ``He's longer than Jack was,
and maybe a little straighter,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus gets the nod on iron play. ``Jack was probably as good
an iron player as I've ever seen, particularly with the long
irons,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer also praises Nicklaus's mental side. ``He's very good and
has a good mind; he thinks very positively,'' he said. ``Jack has
the ability to isolate himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Both get high marks in putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack was a great putter in a lot of critical conditions,''
Palmer said. ``But look at how many three-putts (Woods) had in the
US Open, British, and PGA. I don't think he's had a handful,
total.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who turns 71 next month, has played in 10 Senior events
this year and hopes to play in about 15 before the season is out.
Of course, when considering golf's all-time greats, Palmer's name
can't be discounted. He won 60 PGA events and seven majors,
including four Masters.
</P>
<P>
   There are some more figures Woods can shoot for.

CURLEY LAWSUIT TESTS FINE LINE ON FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a legal tactic that's been used against a wide array of
controversial groups, from gun manufacturers to antiabortion
protesters and the Grand Knights of the Ku Klux Klan: File a
lawsuit seeking millions of dollars in damages in the hope that a
massive verdict will force your opponents into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Man/Boy Love Association _ a group that
advocates legalized pedophilia and, according to some opponents,
facilitates for its members sex with boys _ is the latest in a
growing number of groups that could face astronomical damage awards
that would effectively drive them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Long seen as protected by the constitutional guarantees of free
speech and free expression, these groups are being targeted in
civil lawsuits for acts of violence committed by third parties, but
believed to have been facilitated by the groups' activities or
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a Middlesex County jury awarded the family of Jeffrey
Curley, a murdered 10-year-old from Cambridge, Mass., $328 million
in damages from Charles Jaynes and Salvatore Sicari, the two men
convicted of his murder.
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyer admits there is no chance of collecting from
Sicari and Jaynes, both imprisoned for life, but touts the verdict
as an important benchmark in the family's other legal battle: a
$200 million federal lawsuit against NAMBLA for allegedly inciting
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of such suits say they're a legitimate way to hold
groups morally and financially responsible for facilitating
criminal acts. But to some free-speech advocates and civil
libertarians, the suits are a disturbing end-run around the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree, however, that the legal strategy has become a
key weapon in some of society's most controversial ideological
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really new tactic and an interesting one,'' Harvard Law
School professor Heather Gerken said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Curleys' attorney, Lawrence Frisoli, said the family intends
to enjoin NAMBLA ``from doing any acts in which they encourage
members to profile children, approach children, deceive parents of
children with the intent of having sex, (or offer instructions) on
how to act to impede law enforcement investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Such activity, Frisoli said, is distinct from the group's purely
political advocacy, which essentially advocates the abolition of
laws establishing an age of consent for sexual activity. That kind
of advocacy is protected speech, Frisoli agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Gerkin said the Curley case appears to be a difficult, though
not impossible, one to win, since numerous courts have held that
there is some speech that is not protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line is often hard to draw and the courts are often
scared to draw it,'' she said. ``The hard part is proving the
causal part, that it was foreseeable that the conduct would lead to
this kind of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Frisoli has alleged that Jaynes viewed NAMBLA's Web site just
hours before he and Sicari lured Curley into a car, and that he had
amassed a substantial collection of NAMBLA literature.
</P>
<P>
   The Curleys' federal case has drawn comparisons with a string of
cases brought against the Ku Klux Klan in recent years by the
Southern Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for instance, the Klan in South Carolina was ordered to
pay $37.8 million for inciting the burning of a predominantly black
church.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok, editor of the center's Intelligence Report, said
there is a misconception that the cases against the Klan involved
only racist rhetoric. In each one, Potok said, there was a direct
connection between the people involved in the violence and the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think they can win cases because (a group) put out
unpleasant propaganda and someone has gone on to kill someone,'' he
said. ``The reality is that there has to be more of a connection
between the speech of the group and the actions of the actor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Curley case, he said, ``If the group is involved in
teaching ways of avoiding the law, there very well may be
liability,'' Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerken also compared the Curley suit to ones filed against gun
manufacturers for selling cheap weapons, and to one of the most
controversial recent verdicts: a federal jury's award last year of
$107 million in damages against abortion opponents who listed the
names of doctors who performed abortions on mock ``Wanted'' posters
on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Since the site contained no direct threats, some legal observers
say they believe the verdict will be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   One question that remains unclear is whether NAMBLA is as
influential as some of the other groups that have been sued for
large damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by the Globe to contact the group have been
unsuccessful, and its Web site has been off-line for more than a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Echols, a former social worker and journalist and a
one-time undercover informant for the FBI who operates a Web site
that tracks the group, said its membership has dwindled from as
many as 1,300 in the 1980s to as few as 400 in recent years. But
NAMBLA, he said, is still helping members prey on children by
trading names of vulnerable boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an active organization hiding behind a political
movement,'' Echols said. ``Their real agenda is to facilitate their
own access to children.''

SONGWRITER JESS KLEIN STEPS FORWARD

<P>
   Six years ago Jess Klein was a typical college student. She
studied, partied, and had plenty of creative outlets: writing short
stories, dancing, painting. Then she traveled to Jamaica for a year
abroad. On a whim, she asked her dad to borrow his guitar, and she
had a friend show her some chords before she left. Little did she
know it would alter the course of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a musical, colorful place,'' says Klein, a native
of Rochester, N.Y. ``You don't have to be a professional to play
music there. Lots of people just make music at the end of the day.
One day I sat down and was working on the three chords I knew, and
I just started writing a song. It was about culture shock. And as
soon as I wrote it and sang it for people, I felt like something
had been clarified for me. I realized that was my unique gift: the
ability to think of a song and write and sing it and perform it.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Klein _ who moved to Boston after returning
from Jamaica and has been a growing presence on the local folk
music scene _ is this city's latest entry in the musical big
leagues. Ryko-Palm released Klein's major-label debut, ``Draw Them
Near,'' this week, and the album, which was produced by label
president George Howard, is getting the kind of support most new
artists can only dream about. A high-profile New York publicist is
spearheading the charge. Klein is booked on tour in this country,
Japan, and the United Kingdom through March. There's a prominent
display devoted exclusively to Klein's CD at Tower Records. It's a
sea change for a singer-songwriter who's used to accompanying
herself on guitar. But Klein, soft-spoken and thoughtful, is
unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't feel pressured. I've done a lot of work on my own
and with my manager (Gabriel Unger), and I really feel that I'm
ready to take this step with my music,'' Klein says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draw Them Near'' marks a departure from both the coffeehouse
setting and pared-down aesthetic with which Klein's Boston audience
is familiar. The songs incorporate rock, blues, and pop while
retaining the immediacy and organic feel that are fundamental to
Klein's sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always considered myself a singer-songwriter, and
I have performed a lot solo,'' Klein says. ``I really understand
the beauty and purity of one person with an acoustic guitar. But I
also understand the beauty of layers of music and how that can
express the meaning of a song.''
</P>
<P>
   A key piece of that process, Klein says, was joining forces with
Howard, who signed her in addition to producing the album.
Following the independent release in 1998 of Klein's first CD,
``Wishes Well Disguised,'' a handful of independent and major
record labels expressed interest in her. ``Howard,'' Klein says,
``really understands my music. His production ideas really clicked
with me. I like that he has a rock sensibility, and he had great
ideas about who to use.'' Musicians on the album include Wilco
drummer Ken Coomer, bassist Brad Jones (Ron Sexsmith, Matthew
Sweet), and guitarist Will Kimbrough (sideman for Kim Richey and
Josh Rouse).
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Klein relishes the idea of being out on the road
for months. She writes more when she's busy, she says, and is eager
to ``let the world educate me. Already, the songs I've been writing
since finishing the record have been different. The melodies are
sort of expansive. I'm just really excited to follow what comes
into my head.''
</P>

<P>
   Dan Hicks isn't one to stick to a schedule. It's been 24 years
since the venerable avant-swing guitarist and musical eccentric
released a studio album. But when his new label, Surfdog, suggested
that the world might be ready for another album from Dan Hicks and
His Hot Licks, he graciously agreed. ``It is a good name,'' he says
on the phone from his home in Mill Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has been out of the mainstream spotlight _ playing small
clubs, writing music for a children's show on HBO, appearing in the
band at the party in the 1991 film ``Class Action.'' But he hasn't
been forgotten. Among the guest performers on the new CD ``Beatin'
the Heat'' (in stores Tuesday) are Tom Waits, Elvis Costello,
Rickie Lee Jones, Bette Midler, and Brian Setzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a mutual admiration thing,'' explains Hicks.
``But the idea wasn't to have an all-star lineup. It's really about
the new songs, and the vocal thing with the girls, the call and
response. The stage show is more like my old deal: no drummer, and
the girls are playing rhythm instruments.
</P>
<P>
   While he'll focus on material from the new album, Hicks also
mixes in favorites from his halcyon days in concert. ``I do `How
Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away,' `Where's the
Money?,'`Buzzard Was Their Friend,' '' Hicks says. ``Maybe I'll do
a couple that have never been recorded.'' It is, Hicks adds, and we
don't doubt it, ``a pretty lively show.''
</P>

<P>
   On Jan. 19, Wyclef Jean will become the first hip-hop artist to
play Carnegie Hall, where he'll perform with children's choirs,
orchestras, and a handful of as-yet-unnamed guests. . . . U2 has
finally announced the name of its much-anticipated new studio
album, due out in stores in late October: ``All That You Can't
Leave Behind.'' The first single, ``Beautiful Day,'' goes to radio
next Friday. . . . Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann will come
out of semi-retirement in Hawaii to join Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and
Bruce Hornsby's Other Ones at the Fleet Center Sept. 15.

READY, SET, DATE: SINGLES TRY A SPEEDY RITUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The date lasted maybe seven minutes, eight tops,
and it was as blind as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of his guy friends had encouraged him to call her. None
of her gal pals had sworn he was a hottie. All they knew about each
other when they met over coffee were their first names,
conveniently emblazoned on ``Hello My Name Is'' tags stuck to their
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhere between hopeful and leery,'' Howard Shapiro, a
33-year-old immigration attorney, said before his date.
</P>
<P>
   Before hers, Vicki Karlan, a health care researcher who is also
33, said, ``I have no idea what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no expectations _ OK, low expectations _ was part of
the appeal of the pairing, just one of the more than 250 that took
place on a recent Sunday night. Joining the couple, were 43 other
men and women also hoping to pair off, if not with the first person
they met, then with the second or third or sixth or seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The dizzying night of dating represented the latest trend on the
Jewish singles scene. Aptly named SpeedDating, the program aims to
match Jewish women with Jewish men and eliminate the awkward pauses
and unfulfilled hopes that so often accompany more traditional
first dates.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in Los Angeles a year or so ago, SpeedDating was Rabbi
Yaakov Deyo's solution to what he saw as the coldness and
coarseness of the singles scene. As educational director of Aish
HaTorah, a nonprofit Jewish resource group with branches around the
world, he saw the dating system as a hip way to hook up unmarrieds
interested in marrying Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are more than 70 ``coffees'' a month, including ones
in Kiev, London, and Melbourne for singles in four age groups: 25
to 35, 30 to 40, 35 to 45, and 45 to 60. SpeedDating sessions are
planned in Vienna, Paris, Rome and, most recently, Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L.A. dating scene is not a user friendly market, and the
coffee shops make it very painless,'' Deyo said. ``Here they're
socially comfortable. There's no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, rules. SpeedDating is like musical chairs
without the music, and that requires enormous organizational skill
on Aish HaTorah's part and impressive conversational skills on the
part of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: First names only, plus an identifying
number. Verboten topics include age, job, housing status, and
telephone numbers. The idea is to talk about something meaningful
in seven minutes. That's when a bell clangs and the men switch
tables. Then the banter starts all over again, date after date, for
seven dates, or about 90 minutes, breaks included. The cost: $15,
or about $2.14 a date, lattes and iced cafe mochas excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the men fill out yellow cards, checking off the names
of the women they're interested in seeing solo. The women do
likewise. Calls go out informing them they're a match. The rest is
up to them, although another of the rules requires matched pairs to
phone each other at least once.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent gathering at Starbucks, 28 people out of 43 made
matches, or 65 percent. Deyo said the figure sometimes approaches
70 percent. So far in Los Angeles, six SpeedDating couples have
raced to the altar. The number of success stories is even higher in
New York, which has seen 15 weddings. Any day now, the first
SpeedDating baby is expected to be born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really takes a lot of pressure off, especially for the
women,'' said Rabbi Shalom Denbo, who, as the evening's emcee
suggested, as a sample conversational topic, discussing the best
vacation ever taken and why. ``Here you don't have to ask yourself,
`Is he really trying to get to know me or is he just trying to get
me?' We're trying to show people that there's more to a date than
the superficial `how do you look.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Few at the Starbucks, in fact, dressed up for the occasion,
although that may have been as much a function of their ages _ 25
to 35 _ as their outwardly casual attitude. Before the SpeedDates
began, many of them sounded nonchalant. But more than a few,
perhaps embarrassed about the mission before them, also declined to
give their full names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not into the whole thing,'' said one 33-year-old woman, a
three-time SpeedDater who works in computer graphics. ``I want to
expand my horizons, I guess. OK, to tell you the truth, I'm looking
for a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the evening, with every table filled with
couples conversing and other potential twosomes stuck leaning
against a countertop, 28-year-old Julie, a health insurance company
analyst, said she had yet not met anyone who struck her fancy. Beth
Braun, a 29-year-old psychologist, was having better luck. She
already had several yesses to mark on her card.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a yes? A pulse,'' joked Braun, adding that a
girlfriend had signed her up and ``forced'' her to come. ``I'll
feel so rejected if no one marks me down. Thank God I have
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike T., a 33-year-old computer consultant on his fifth round of
SpeedDating, credits several relationships of a month or more to
the program. ``To a certain degree, you are performing, because
you're being judged so fast,'' he said. ``If you're not a good
conversationalist, it's going to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yamorsky, 32, entered Starbucks cautiously hopeful. He
left happy, with a number of matches marked on his yellow card.
Still, he had been there before. At previous SpeedDating events, he
met other women he liked. But three proved too busy for a real
date, he said, and a fourth joined him for lunch then never
returned his calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice meeting everyone, but nothing worked out,'' said
Yamorsky, a publishing company credit manager who described his own
free time as limited.
</P>
<P>
   Like Yamorsky, many of the participants said they were not
necessarily looking for a Jewish partner, although finding one
would be nice. Instead, they said they consider SpeedDating another
avenue to meet people, get a date or two and, maybe just maybe,
spot ``the one'' in the man or woman sitting across the table.
</P>
<P>
   As Shapiro, the immigration attorney, put it, ``You can't gauge
if it's forever in a few minutes, but you can have a clue. You can
probably tell it's `no' faster than you can get a `yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis who run the program don't pretend that bells will
ring for everyone. All they're trying to do with SpeedDating, Deyo
said, is give people a reasonably comfortable way to consider
whether a person is worth seeing again _ and then to follow through
on their intuition.
</P>
<P>
   Devora Fond, for instance, had decided by the break that she
would see two of her speed dates again, although she said she was
not particularly attracted to either one. But as a rabbinical
student at 31, and a two-time veteran of SpeedDating, she has
discovered that potential partners often consider her too religious
or not religious enough, depending on their own practices. She has
learned to be open to any possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I thought I wouldn't like anyone,'' said Amanda
Koblin, 30, a casting director. ``I ended up liking two. I don't
know if they're love connections, but two out of six or seven ain't
bad for one night.''

DUNST CARRIES THE SQUAD IN `BRING IT ON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BRING IT ON 
Directed by: Peyton Reed 
Screenplay by: Jessica Bender 
Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, Grbrielle
Union 
Running time: 
Rated: PG-13 (sex-related material and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' is 90 minutes of cheerleading angst. It's a
pom-pom comedy about a pom-pom world, but Kirsten Dunst has carried
lesser entertainments than this piece of candy-colored bubble-gum
for the eyes and she makes the difference here. She's the big
reason the film rises above instantly rejectable formula to campy
pop, although, to be fair, Jessica Bendinger's screenplay
occasionally rescues itself from its own styrofoam mindlessness
with a neat tweak here and there.
</P>
<P>
   You can't be altogether down on a comedy in which the athletic
abilities of the cheerleaders tower above those of their suburban
San Diego high school football team, as they do here, or where the
cheerleaders kid their own neuroses by wondering aloud if there's
such a thing as diet Prozac. The film almost trips over a fleeting
desire to be taken seriously when it pits Dunst's mostly white
cheerleading squad against crackerjack African-American rivals, The
Clovers, from East Compton.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Dunst's upbeat team captain, her own squad, the
Toros, has been using routines stolen from The Clovers, so when
they compete in the national finals there's a little something
extra at stake. But before you lapse into wondering if ``Bring It
On'' is going for a Rodney King why-can't-we-all-just-get-along?
moment here, let it be made clear that it has something less than
the social relevance and intellectual density of, say, ``Coyote
Ugly.'' Most of the fun in watching ``Bring It On'' lies in
watching Dunst gidget her way through it with squeaky
irrepressibility.
</P>
<P>
   The film is easiest to take when it relaxes into its own
essential vapidity. Its romantic complications aren't exactly a
series of cliffhangers. Most of its bright lines are put into the
mouths of brother-and-sister LA refugees played by Jesse Bradford
and Eliza Dushka, the latter appealingly poised. Ian Roberts
seethes amusingly as a pill-popping, icepick-tongued Bob Fosse
clone hired to choreograph a new routine to replace the one the
cheerleaders didn't know was stolen from The Clovers. The latter
are led in winning style by Gabrielle Union. Her warmth and easy
authority convince you she could win the Olympics, much less a
cheerleading competition.

TAPING JOINTS WILL FIX CRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August   27, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I plan to paint the rooms in my house, but in an addition 20
years ago, no one taped the drywall joints, so there are vertical
cracks every four feet. How can I fix them?
</P>
<P>
   SARA KILKENNY, Stow, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems impossible that someone would not tape joints in a
dry wall (plasterboard). It is sheer negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Several things you can try. Some are better than others.
</P>
<P>
   1. Fill the cracks with a flexible caulking, the only thing that
can be inserted in such a small crack. Press it in with your
fingers. The caulking will expand and contract with the movement of
the wall, and the patch might work for a while. Not the best fix.
</P>
<P>
   2. Paper the walls with Wall-Tex. This is a real cloth, not
paper, that will span the cracks and the cloth itself will resist
cracking. Patterns are limited with Wall-Tex, and since you want to
paint anyway, buy a plain white Wall-Tex, some with a slight pebbly
surface. You can leave it white or paint it. This will work fairly
well.
</P>
<P>
   3. The real fix: Chip out the old compound _ all of it _ over
each joint, then apply new joint compound, then apply a paper tape
and continue plastering over the tape, three thin coats. Anything
fewer than three and the joints will show.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to the paper tape is to install self-adhesive
nylon mesh tape to the joint where you removed all old compound,
then apply the compound for a smooth finish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Half of my basement floor is dirt, and half is concrete. I'd
like to cover the dirt part with rubber roofing, to keep moisture
out as much as possible. Is that OK? Can I insulate the basement
ceiling? If so, how? Will mold grow under the rubber roofing?
</P>
<P>
   BEVERY PELLEGRINO, Mattapoisett, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. In four words: yes, yes, and probably not. Yes, you can cover
the dirt with rubber roofing, Grace's Ice &AMP; Water Shield, or
polyethylene plastic. It will help keep moisture from coming up
through the dirt. Actually, the rubber roof is overdoing it, but if
you have some with no use for it, go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can insulate the basement ceiling. It is a good idea
because your house loses heat through any uninsulated barrier,
including the floor over the basement. To do so, buy 6-inch
fiberglass insulation with paper backing; put the paper up,
touching the floor above, and secure the insulation with steel
hangers, pointed wires stuffed between joists every 24 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Mold might grow under the rubber roofing over the dirt floor, if
water vapor gets caught under the roofing and condenses into water.
This is less likely if you flatten and even the dirt, and put the
roofing material on in full contact with the earth. In other words,
no air pockets. This way, there will be no air space for water
vapor to enter and condense.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to prevent mold under the roofing is to ventilate
the basement, from May 1 to Oct. 31. This will also keep water
vapor from building up in the basement itself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The windows in my 30-year-old split-entry ranch are original
to the house, and are losing a lot of heat each winter. I thought
of replacements, but what kind?
</P>
<P>
   NICOLE WALDRON, York, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A. In many cases the handyman has preached against replacements
for two reasons: The high cost of new windows and the fact that old
windows can be weatherstripped with storm windows added, to achieve
the equivalent of a replacement window at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   But hold it, brothers and sisters. Thirty-year-old windows are
probably of pretty low quality. It's amazing how many companies
started making windows of poor quality, then went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   So, to replace your windows, replace only the movable sash, the
part that goes up and down. The frames in your house are probably
still good, certainly good enough to hold new double-glazed sash.
You can get wood sash clad on the outside with vinyl, all-wood
sash, or vinyl. I think the vinyl-clad wood is best. The
replacement sash will cost from $175 to $250 per window. And as a
bonus, you can leave your old storms on or replace them for about
$100 per window.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to paint the mahogany boards on my deck floor. A
neighbor said you can't paint mahogany because it will peel. What
can I use?
</P>
<P>
   DENISE LEBICA, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course paint will peel from mahogany floorboards, just as
it will peel from every kind of wood floorboards. This peeling is
guaranteed on an outdoor surface.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope: Seal the mahogany, and do it every year, with
a clear masonry or tile sealer. Or, better yet, because it will
last three to five years, coat it with one coat of a
semitransparent oil-based house stain.
</P>
<P>

THE JAYHAWKS LIGHTEN UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of trying, the Jayhawks finally scored a hit this
year with ``I'm Gonna Make You Love Me,'' a rocking,
mandolin-spiced song that singer Gary Louris originally wrote at 4
o'clock one morning about a lover who had just left him. It later
grew into ``a more universal song about perseverance,'' Louris
says, ``and about someone who is not going to take no for an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the song could also describe the Jayhawks, the
Minneapolis rock-and-alternative-country band that has worked hard
for respect and _ if given the right breaks _ might have achieved
stardom long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks have often been called ``the best band you've never
heard of.'' They have built a reputation as critics' favorites who
would land on year-end top-10 album lists, yet elicit puzzled
frowns from the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, we still remain. And right now, we're focusing on
playing, and we're getting kind of good,'' says Louris, who has a
deadpan Woody Allen air about him. He's been trained never to get
his hopes too high, but he's not about to dismiss the attention
that has come at long last _ a full 15 years after the Jayhawks
formed.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, that attention has been aided by Bob Ezrin _
better known as the producer of classic KISS albums and Pink
Floyd's ``The Wall.'' Ezrin found a way to present the Jayhawks in
a more commercial fashion on the new ``Smile'' CD without erasing
the songwriting subtleties that have been a band trademark on such
CDs as ``Hollywood Town Hall'' (1992) and ``Tomorrow the Green
Grass'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob wasn't familiar with the Jayhawks' history when we first
met, but he later said that we were the weirdest band he ever
worked with,'' says Louris, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   So what attracted the Jayhawks to Ezrin?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is a facilitator and energizer who really focused us and
encouraged experimentation and irreverence toward any particular
genre,'' says Louris. ``He gets very involved, and he really drove
certain songs to completion. If he had his way, he'd also be
writing our set lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as a cerebral band that could rock but didn't
rock enough, the Jayhawks were determined to take a more
high-energy, rhythmic course this time _ and they knew that was one
of Ezrin's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our drummer (Tim O'Reagan) said, `I'm tired of seeing
people just standing there at our shows. I want to see people
shaking their (butts) at a Jayhawks show,' '' Louris says.
</P>
<P>
   Fans should be able to do that to such new Jayhawks tunes as
``Queen of the World,'' the Beatles-sounding ``Broken Harpoon,''
and the rocking ``(In My) Wildest Dreams.'' There's even some drum
sampling included to push the rhythmic boundaries further.

<P>
   ``We'll never be a drum-machine band,'' says Louris, ``but there
were some sounds that were kind of cool, so we put them in.
Basically, the rhythm section pushed for more rhythm, and they got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a welcome turnabout from the last Jayhawks disc, ``Sound of
Lies'' (1997), a dour record written when Louris was going through
a romantic breakup. He is now remarried and has a 1-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything would be more positive than the `Sound of Lies'
record, though I'm proud of that record,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible mood of the new album, however, could just as
easily have been something different, says Louris, referring to how
prolific the Jayhawks were in preparing for it. ``We wrote 50 to 60
songs. We could have picked 13 other songs, and it would be a much
darker record,'' he notes. ``The mood of the record was shaped by
the choice of the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Jayhawks' mood is more upbeat these days, helped
further by the addition of new member Jen Gunderman on keyboards.
She replaced Karen Grotberg, who completed work on the new album,
then left to be with her baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard decision for Karen to leave, but Jen has been
great. I don't know what we'd do without her,'' says Louris.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks have finally earned some breakthrough respect, yet
Louris admits he's been too busy to hear much of the Jayhawks' hit,
``I'm Gonna Make You Love Me'' (which went to No. 3 on the Triple A
charts), on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic, isn't it?'' he says. ``Because I've only heard it
on the radio once. But, hey, we hope it sounds good coming out of
those little speakers.''

A BLAND PLOT DRAGS DOWN THIS `CREW' OF WISEGUYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CREW 
Directed by: Michael Dinner 
Screenplay by: Barry Fanaro 
Starirng: Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya, Seymour
Cassell, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jennifer Tilly, Lainie Kazan, Miguel
Sandoval, Jeremy Piven 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual content, violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with the crew in ``The Crew,'' but they're
trapped on a terminally flimsy vessel. Which is another way of
saying that this comedy about geezers with guns largely wastes
Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya, and Seymour Cassell on
a script that plays as if written on automatic pilot. As retired
mob wiseguys sedately rotting in a down-market Miami Beach hotel
until a rent increase galvanizes them into messing up on a grander
scale than anything they've tried in years, they're asked to supply
inordinate amounts of charm to a mob-cliche-ridden script that
never stays with anything long enough, amusingly enough, or deeply
enough to involve us. Space cowboys they're not.
</P>
<P>
   Their problems begin when a scheme involving an ill-chosen
corpse involves them with a druglord and some unplanned arson. Not
having the sense to lie low when they somehow emerge intact, they
ask for trouble by flaunting fancy cars, Rolexes, and young dates,
much to the consternation of Dreyfuss's ringleader. One reason he's
disinclined to join in the mindless fun is that he has a
sentimental problem. He hasn't seen his daughter for 30 years and
hopes to locate her in Miami, where he has learned she lives. What
he doesn't count on is that she'll be the investigating police
detective assigned to the case in which they become embroiled.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss has most of the few snappy lines. Carrie-Anne Moss
brings almost superhuman appeal to the thinly written role of his
long-estranged daughter. Jennifer Tilly enlivens matters as a
prostitute, or, as she prefers to call it, one affiliated with the
leisure profession. A newly svelte Lainie Kazan adds warmth as her
stepmother and sometime target. The old-timers do their best,
especially with their air of swagger as they enter a bingo hall, or
parody the ``GoodFellas'' walking-through-the-Copacabana-kitchen
scene during a deli's early-bird dinner special, or steal Woody
Allen's notion-idea-concept bit from ``Annie Hall.'' Well, they are
thieves, after all. Too bad they couldn't have stolen a better
script. For all its violent gestures, this one screams safety,
safety, safety, never taking anything like a real chance, never
going anywhere unruly or unpredictable in its dogged allegiance to
blandness.

   MEXICO-ARGENTINE _ MEXICO CITY - A high-profile Argentine
businessman in Mexico has confessed to police that he is the same
man who is wanted by a Spanish judge on alleged charges of murder,
torture and other crimes during Argentina's ``dirty war'' against
the left in the late 1970s, according to Mexico's Reforma
Newspaper. Although he had changed his name slightly and aged,
Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was accused by Reforma of being a former
intelligence officer back in Argentina who was identified by
victims. Cavallo is the director of a controversial privately-run
national car registry program in Mexico to prevent car thefts.
Ironically, one of the accusations against him is stealing victims'
cars. Spanish lawyers are reportedly demanding that Mexico deport
Cavallo to Spain - a move resembling the attempt to extradite
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to face similar accusations by
the same Spanish judge. Cavallo was detained Thursday by Mexican
police as he was attempting to board a flight from Cancun to
Argentina, where former military officials now enjoy an amnesty
against crimes. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   RUSSIA-NAVY _ MURMANSK, Russia _ Take a look out towards cold
waves of the Barents Sea from this Arctic city, and the problems of
the Russian navy become clear. Dozens of rusting hulks of
submarines and ships sit idle, mothballed by a crippled economy
that has made them _ and the men that serve on the vessels _
increasingly difficult to keep afloat. Unlike in the United States,
where the presence of a naval base is a boon to the local economy,
Murmansk has little to boast about from the base here. The home of
the ill-fated Kursk submarine that sank to the bottom of the
Barents Sea with 118 crew members is a sad example of the problems
and concerns (both within, and without Russia) that surround
Russia's military. Developing. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   HOUSEWORK-MEN _ Guys, you're busted. Throughout the South,
husbands are claiming to do more housework than wives claim their

housework in general than women allowed, a new AJC poll of married
adults found. In the housework category, for instance, 40 percent
of men said they either do it themselves or are an equal partner in
the housework. Meanwhile, just 23 percent of women said men do it
all or equally. Paula Jhung, author of ``How to Avoid Housework,''
isn't surprised. ``I think housework is like sex in that people lie

before it came to us. ``I wish to build rockers for it. ``What are

these rockers?'' Williams went on to provide the dimensions of the

HARCOURT HIGHER EDUCATION LAUNCHES CYBERSPACE U. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no ivy-covered walls, no bell towers, no high-tech
science labs. Indeed, there are no classrooms, and the full-time
academic staff numbers only nine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is the computer, which is king.
</P>
<P>
   This is Massachusetts' newest degree-granting college, named
Harcourt Higher Education. It's a for-profit subsidiary of Harcourt
General Inc. of Newton, a publishing conglomerate that had $2.1
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harcourt Higher Education maintains offices in Boston,
for most purposes it exists only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Its students will lead ``virtual'' lives _ applying for
admission, attending classes, going to the library, taking tests,
and engaging in classroom debate _ entirely online.
</P>
<P>
   When they graduate, that will happen online, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uniqueness of what we offer is that everything is
online,'' said Robert V. Antonucci, who quit as state education
commissioner in 1998 to oversee development of Harcourt Higher
Education as the Northeast's first for-profit Internet-based
provider of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education voted to
license the result of this work, a move that authorizes the online
school to grant associate's and bachelor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Classes begin in November, with students enrolling in groups
that will take course ``modules'' that last six or 12 weeks,
keeping in touch with professors and each other by e-mail and
through chat-room discussions. The first catalog will carry about
30 courses; by June, there will be about 120.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 US colleges currently offer online, for-credit
studies. About 50 offer programs leading to degrees, including a
master's degree in business at Suffolk University in Boston, a
master's in electrical engineering at Stanford University, and
advanced education degrees at Lesley College in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Northeastern University, offer courses leading
to certification in specific skills, including technical writing,
electric commerce, or Web management.
</P>
<P>
   In the for-profit realm, however, Harcourt Higher Education's
program is only the fourth in the nation, said Michael Teitelbaum
of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York, which awards grants
to accredited schools to build online courses.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the University of Phoenix, which combines online
and classroom work and has branches in several cities; Nova
Southeastern University, in Florida, and Jones International
University, in Colorado. All are private.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum expects more. ``There is definitely a movement in
that direction,'' he said. Traditional colleges' online programs
also are expanding rapidly, with state university systems in
Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, and Michigan leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the potential for revenue, several blue-ribbon private
schools have created for-profit affiliates to manage and market
their online courses, including Columbia University, New York
University, and Temple University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Harcourt Higher Education will be $900 for each
three-credit-hour course. Antonucci said he expects about 1,000
students to enroll during the school's first year, and projects
revenue of about $18 million, including fees from licensing the use
of Harcourt teaching materials to other schools.
</P>
<P>
   He said licensing discussions are at various stages with
Northeastern University, the School of the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts, Endicott College (where Antonucci is a trustee), and
Fitchburg State College (Antonucci's alma mater).
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, Antonucci said, the school expects to have about 20,000
students taking an average of 2.5 courses each, a class load that
would yield about $45 million in tuition revenue. The school
expects to break even by 2003, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While these projections represent barely a blip on the parent
company's ledgers, analysts say this online presence could
influence Harcourt General's efforts, announced in June, to sell
some or all of its assets. Other publishing companies are seen as
the most likely bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if a buyer isn't interested in online, they might just
choose to shut this operation down,'' said Marta Nichols of
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General shares, which jumped more than 30 percent
following the June announcement, closed Thursday in New York Stock
Exchange trading at $59.63, down 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Board of Higher Education vote gives Harcourt Higher
Education authority to award both two-year associate's degrees and
four-year bachelor's degrees. School officials say they expect most
students to be adults, studying while working or raising families.
Many will have some college credits, which Harcourt will apply
toward its degree programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges can elect to reject Harcourt credits, though,
until the school is accredited by the New England Association of
Schools and College _ which can't happen until at least one student
is awarded a degree.
</P>
<P>
   And evaluating a one-of-a-kind institution where everything is
electronic will be challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may think we have the appropriate criteria, but in two or
three years, or even in six months, things can change,'' Charles
Cook, who will oversee this process for the assocation, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of personal contact between students and faculty is the
biggest criticism leveled against Internet-based education. But
Teitelbaum said online teaching got a boost at a Sloan-sponsored
conference last year, where directors of college-based programs
reported almost no difference in test scores between their students
and those who took identical courses in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt, as an online-only institution, won't be able to make
such comparisons in the business, health studies, and information
technology programs about to be launched.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Weir, who heads Harcourt's business education
program, said the fledgling school has taken pains to ensure its
courses match those at universities. Faculty from schools such as
McGill University, Carnegie Mellon University, and New York
University were hired to write course outlines and lecture
material, with other educators reviewing their work.
</P>
<P>
   Weir, a former advertising executive and administrator at
Emerson College, is one of four deans hired to oversee a total of
four full-time instructors for the school's start-up. The bulk of
their work will be managing up to 30 part-time adjunct instructors
who will be teaching the majority of courses.
</P>
<P>
   Adjunct faculty will post lecture texts; designate textbook
readings from textbooks or files that can be downloaded from a
Harcourt General database center in Florida; grade tests and other
papers; provide individual advice and criticism via e-mail; and
coordinate online class discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Because most homes don't have high-speed, broadband Internet
access, Harcourt and other online programs avoid using audio and
video. But e-mail and chat rooms take on extra importance to
stimulate participation. ``What we want to avoid, at all costs, is
a disconnect, a sense of loneliness,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum, at the Sloan Foundation, said online educators
generally have found students to be more communicative via e-mail
than they might be in a classroom. ``Students who are shy and would
never think of raising their hands in a classroom have no fear
about sending their professor an e-mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even by Internet-age standards, the development of Harcourt
Higher Education has been fast. Antonucci said he was hired in
January 1998 to run Harcourt General's ICS Learning Systems unit,
which sells correspondence courses.
</P>
<P>
   ICS at the time was changing its name to Harcourt Learning
Systems and beginning to distribute its courses on CD-ROM discs
from another Harcourt General unit, Archipelago Productions, of
Monterey, Calif. But it was clear that college online course
offerings threated that plan. Antonucci moved the Harcourt Learning
Systems headquarters office to Cambridge from Scranton, Pa., and
began overseeing development of an online program.
</P>
<P>
   One mandate was to use existing Harcourt General resources
wherever possible. The results include location of the school's
digital library at Harcourt's server computers in Florida;
assigning ICS staff in Scranton to screen applications; using
Archipelago software; and adoption of Harcourt-published texts for
about half the courses being offered this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time faculty were chosen in part for their experience in
``distance learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald D. Babcock, a former associate chancellor at the
University of Masschusetts in Boston, was one of the first, hired
as provost and vice president for academic affairs. Babcock had
administered UMass-Boston's off-campus courses for health care
workers, delivered via videoconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone among the current Harcourt faculty, Babcock, who
previously taught literature courses, keeps an office cluttered
with books, from works of Aeschylus, the ancient Greek writer, to a
text titled, ``Navigating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock believes online teaching's popularity will explode once
broadband connections are widespread so instructors and students
can communicate via video. But he also advocates in-person
meetings. ``I don't believe Web-based education will ever replace
face-to-face communication, nor should it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, hoping to build some sense of identity and
school spirit, Harcourt Higher Education is considering selling
sweat shirts, coffee mugs, and the like _ bearing a school seal
that includes an image of a computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately for an exclusively online institution, the seal
now exists only as a digital file on its computers.

CBS WINS LOOT IN `SURVIVOR' RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by bubbling water cooler chatter and intense media
attention, CBS's ``Survivor'' finale on Wednesday night shattered
the summer doldrums by reaching the kind of mass audience that has
nearly vanished in today's 100-channel TV universe.
</P>
<P>
   With network spokesman Chris Ender declaring Wednesday ``a
magical night at CBS,'' the final ``Survivor'' episode attracted
nearly 52 million viewers, making it the second most popular TV
broadcast of the year behind the Super Bowl. While those ratings
may not match such indelible television moments as the final MASH
show in 1983, the 1980 ``Who Shot J.R.?'' episode of Dallas or even
the Beatles original 1964 visit to ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' they
reflect a show that tapped into the zeitgeist in way that no one
could have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these days, that's awful good,'' says TV historian Alex
McNeil, of the ratings. ``It was a real phenomenon and good for the
medium of television, (which) can still galvanize and still attract
big audiences,''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying his trademark cockiness, winner Richard Hatch,
speaking to journalists Thursday, boasted that ``I did tell CBS
that I thought it was going to be their highest rated show ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As a national story, the voting on Pulau Tiga island has proved
far more riveting than the election of a new president. Wednesday's
52 million ``Survivor'' viewers dwarfed the broadcast television
audience for this summer's national conventions when Al Gore and
George Bush each attracted around 18 million viewers for their
crucial acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, CNN's political debate show ``Crossfire'' examined
that very issue, exploring why, in the words of co-host Mary
Matalin, ``more people are interested in voting people off the
island than in voting for president of the United States.'' One
guest, ``Politically Correct'' executive producer Jerry Nachman
suggested that there was a better story unfolding on the island
than in the convention halls.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Survivor' was well conceived and well executed and it does
say something basic about human nature, the instinct for the self
as opposed to the instinct for the group,'' says McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it captures a lot of things in the culture,'' adds
critic Steven Stark. ``In a Darwinian culture, it's a Darwinian
show.'' Comparing its basic appeal to that of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' Stark says, ``you can see ordinary people like
yourselves trying to win money.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor in Wednesday night's success was the airtight
silence that hid the identity of the winner in the months since the
taping ended. Despite feverish Internet rumors and one security
company's reported attempt to identify the winner through voice
analysis, Hatch's victory came as a shock to many viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no interest in'' divulging the outcome, Hatch
said Thursday, admitting that ``he blatantly, outright lied'' about
the results to his son and sister. CBS spokesman Ender says
contestants had to sign confidentiality agreements stipulating that
any leaking would cause them to forfeit their winnings. But he says
the secret stayed safe largely due to ``a little bit of good
planning and a little bit of luck...They (the contestants) wanted
to be part of something successful.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time, Wednesday's episode rolled around, that success had
become a media obsession. ``Survivor's'' handful of remaining
competitors graced the Aug. 28 covers of Newsweek, Us Weekly, and
People magazines. On the morning of the show, pop-culture savvy Wed
USA Today led the paper with a story teasing the finale and
featured stories about the show on the first page of three of its
section.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly produced four dummy covers with each
finalist depicted as the winner, pushed back its deadline and then
rushed its ``All Hail The Champ: The Ultra-Conniving, Buck-Naked
Corporate Trainer Richard'' version out to newsstands. Thursday
morning, the ubiquitous photo of a bug-eyed Hatch reacting to his
$1 million victory even graced the front page of The New York Times
next to the headline, ``Machievelli, on a Desert Isle, Meets TV's
Reality. Unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, TV's reality also means corporate synergy and there
was plenty of ``Survivor'' success to pass around. After the
two-hour Wednesday night closing episode, CBS ``Early Morning''
host Bryant Gumbel -- whose own sagging ratings have been lifted by
the show's coattails -- hosted a ``Survivor'' reunion that
attracted almost 39 million viewers..
</P>
<P>
   At one point Gumbel asked Hatch why he seemed to be an unpopular
winner with the public. ``I think it just must be the press,'' he
replied, taking a final chomp out of the hand that turned him into
a household word.

HOFFMAN'S TALE NEVER GETS OFF THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
STEAL THIS MOVIE! 
Directed by: Robert Greenwald 
Screenplay by: Bruce Graham (based on Abbie and Anita Hoffman's
``To America with Love: Letters from the Underground'' and Marty
Jezer's ``Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel'' 
Starring: Vincent D'Onofrio, Janeane Garofalo, Jeanne Tripplehorn,
Kevin Pollak, Donal Logue, Kevin Corrigan 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: R (language, drug content and some nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before there were yuppies, there were Yippies. ``Steal This
Movie!'' is an earnest but ultimately scattered effort to put
Yippie radical Abbie Hoffman's best foot posthumously forward. The
film (playing off the title of Hoffman's brassy manifesto, ``Steal
This Book!'') plunges us back into the counterculture ferment of
the late '60s and early '70s, convincing us that the government
could have taught _ and frequently did teach _ any and all would-be
revolutionaries, including Hoffman's Yippies, a thing or two about
illegal behavior. It gets off to a nice bloody tongue-in-cheek
start when Hoffman, after being beat up by two angry men in the
East Village, is told to call the cops. ``They are the cops,'' he
replies.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent D'Onofrio throws himself at the central role with his
customary dedication and gusto. Still, ``Steal This Movie!'' is
uneven, as bland and choppy as it is rambunctious, perhaps
inevitably so, given the necessarily contradictory perceptions of a
man who mocked the American flag in attacking government mockery of
the American Constitution. Hoffman was in the grand tradition of
American dissenters, opposing the Vietnam War with hormonal
exuberance, wit, and a genius for marketing. Packaging himself as
Uncle Sam on acid, he wrapped himself and his rude antics in the
Stars and Stripes and kicked street theater into a superheated
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   With Jerry Rubin, he was miles ahead of most politicians of his
time in knowing just how to plug into the electronic media. When he
accused the FBI of persecuting him, he wasn't delusional, although
his drug habit didn't help. Neither did the effects of the bipolar
disorder from which he suffered. His activism, which began with
voter registration in the South, led him to go underground, where,
after leaving his wife and child behind, he began a relationship
with a new woman and six years later under an assumed name
championed a new cause _ fighting unrestricted freighter travel on
the St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is not an easy figure to get a handle on dramatically,
which perhaps explains why he seems to elude both the film and
D'Onofrio. The latter is as versatile an actor as America has,
immersing himself so totally in a wide variety of characters that
he never has, and never will, take on the big star persona. He's
simply too good an actor. And yet his work here seems uneasy,
making us feel for the first time that he hasn't quite nailed the
ringmaster of the circus who transformed political protest for a
few years, while struggling with his own messed-up family life and
trying to keep his idealistic impulses alive.
</P>
<P>
   The film suffers from having to crowd a lot of information into
its less than two-hour running time. Much of it unfurls in
superficial TV biopic style as a journalist in 1977 interviews
Hoffman and resorts to frequent flashbacks. These are either shrill
or prosaic. Never do they convey a sense of heat or giddiness, or
stride purposefully off in a definite direction. Better dramaturgy
than this is required to give us Hoffman's zigzag life, including
its personal dimension, as he woos and wows Janeane Garofalo with
his rock-star charisma, then plummets downhill under the twin
pressures of radical factionalism and government persecution, but
not before showering money down upon the New York Stock Exchange
and ridiculing the judge and the police at his trial for disrupting
the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's ability to project wryness and toughness indicate the
key to Emily Hoffman's survival in the face of adversity until she
died of breast cancer in 1998, nine years after Hoffman himself
died of a drug overdose. Jeanne Tripplehorn does what she can with
the limited role of Johanna Lawrenson, who sustained Hoffman during
his underground period. The film fails to address the subordinate
position of women in the radical movement, or the schisms among the
radicals. Nor does it have time to present the other radicals in
anything more than the most cursory terms. And its flatfooted
device of having a journalist interview Hoffman in 1977 to provide
a framing device for most of the historical flashbacks plays as if
it should have been buried after ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   The film can't even achieve much liftoff after Hoffman's
longtime lawyer, Gerry Lefcourt (one of the film's producers,
played onscreen by Kevin Pollak), uses the Freedom of Information
Act to point the journalist to the FBI files detailing the
Nixon-Hoover dirty tricks effort to discredit left-wing dissenters.
The belated bonding between Hoffman and his estranged son has a
cosmeticized feel. So does the saintly truce between the two women
in his life. It's too bad ``Steal This Movie!'' comes up so short.
We're not likely to get another telling of this story of an
important player in an important time. Shortcomings and all, it's
worth circulating, if only to inject a few images of idealistic
activism _ undeniably one of its components _ into today's
depressingly mercenary and mostly devitalized socio-political mix.

KITSCH RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF TASTE WHILE ICONS OF STYLE SINK TO
NEW LOWS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GAILE ROBINSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standards. What has happened to standards?
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and his family, will
move into a triple-wide while renovations on the Governor's Mansion
are being made. The 2,131-square-foot, $110,000 manufactured house,
which was trucked to the site in three parts last month, is located
in the mansion's back yard. The first lady has promised to give
tours of the new digs, as soon as her family is settled.
</P>
<P>
   This should be an early warning sign _ a Republican governor
thinks manufactured housing is a perfectly acceptable substitute
for a mansion. Even though it is Arkansas, where, according to the
1990 census, 12 percent of the population live in mobile homes,
this is only one of the indicators that kitsch is not what is used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Elevating manufactured housing to mansion status is just one of
the dramatic changes in the hierarchy of the style pantheon. Things
that used to be considered less than cool, garden gnomes for
instance, are becoming quelle swell.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that sales of the kitschy
yard-art creatures are up 75 percent over the past two years. Other
staunch examples of Americana are buttressing the economic good
times.
</P>
<P>
   Cool Whip and Velveeta are propping up Kraft. Well, maybe not
solely, but the giant parent company, Kraft Foods, is posting
record growth, up 8.1 percent since 1997. Although individual
products are not credited with the big bounce, processed foods are
a large portion of the Kraft family.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks, the unglamorous workhorses of the automotive
industry, are the sustaining life force in American vehicle sales.
Those close to the balance sheets say that GM's profitability in
1999, $5.6 billion, came from sales of its new pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   This uptick has induced a frenzy of bigger-better-more. Both
Ford and General Motors are unleashing ``luxury'' pickup trucks in
2001. Look for the deluxoid Cadillac Escalade SUT (sport utility
truck), and Lincoln's Blackwood pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Conveyances, foodstuffs and housing are not the only items in a
taste turnaround. Pamela Anderson Lee has become one of America's
most guilty pleasures and recognized exports. Her self-produced,
2-year-old television show, ``V.I.P.,'' was 1999's No. 1-rated
first-run syndicated one-hour drama series, as well as being one of
America's most popular television exports.
</P>
<P>
   As chunks of American kitsch free-float their way into honor and
respectability, icons of style and taste are passing them on the
way to becoming bottom feeders. Gianni Versace advertisements, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian house of tarty high fashion takes a turn for the
tacky in its fall advertising campaign, featuring a social
skeleton-style model with a mane of teased Texas big hair and
raccoon-style eye makeup. In European capitals, this look may be
novel; here, it is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion always strikes the first blow. Is it any wonder, then,
that the latest state of denim is dirty? Calvin Klein jeans ads are
using models literally rolling around the ground in what looks like
dirty denim.
</P>
<P>
   Bleached, stone-washed, baggy-to-the-point-of-public-exposure or
tight-enough-to-cause-oxygen-deprivation, jeans have run the gamut
of shape and finish. The latest retail come-on _ crud-encrusted.
</P>
<P>
   There is no significant mark on the style timeline to indicate
when the poles began to reverse, but right now we are witnessing a
confluence of common items from mid-America flowing upstream,
acquiring status at every whirlpool, with the formerly fashionable
sliding downhill toward bottom-feeding decrepitude.
</P>
<P>
   The collision course in the middle ground will render both
average. Nothing will be left at either end of the scale.
Everything will hover in the middle. Median has become the land of
lost cachet.
</P>
<P>
   When there are no extremes, there is no scale. We are left with
a plinth on which to build a new world order of style succession.
Or, we can strike a new course of equality where a garden gnome is
equal to a Michael Graves teapot. A place where first families can
live in trailers or mansions, either worthy of public tours.
</P>
<P>
   There may be liberation when we're not ruled by the flow chart
of what's hot and what is merely tepid.

RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS DIVIDED OVER THE DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mattie Compton describes her personal position on the death
penalty as ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth woman has a strong sense of the need to keep
society safe and the importance of the criminal justice system,
especially when dealing with horrific crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But as an African-American, she sees that the death penalty
disproportionately affects her community and also the poor. And as
a Christian, she feels called to act with compassion, forgiveness
and care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people of faith are certainly struggling with the
issue,'' said Compton, chairwoman of the trustees at Mount Zion
Baptist Church in Fort Worth. ``... It is a moral, ethical issue,
and it is one in which people of a very strong faith are indeed
still human and where we have great difficulty in following Christ
and not seeking vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of many faiths have officially expressed opposition to
the death penalty, and some have recently reiterated their
position, joining those who have called for scrutiny of how capital
punishment is administered.
</P>
<P>
   But others, particularly leaders of the Southern Baptist
Convention, support the death penalty. Still others, like Compton,
continue to struggle with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in attitude were evident in the results of a Gallup poll
released in June that showed 66 percent of Americans favor the
death penalty as punishment in murder cases, down from the 80
percent who did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Christian Life Commission of the Baptist General
Convention of Texas gathered a group of about dozen people _
including Compton _ to develop a statement on the death penalty,
said Phil Strickland, director of the Christian Life Commission of
the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee as a whole expressed various views,'' Strickland
said. ``There is a consensus about how the death penalty is used in
Texas and also at the point of our penal philosophy being more
oriented toward retribution than restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are differences of opinion within the committee,
the group could well find itself on the opposite side of the debate
from the Southern Baptist Convention, the national organization of
Southern Baptists. This summer, the group, the largest Protestant
denomination in the United States, approved a resolution in support
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   At a June meeting in Orlando, Fla., the Southern Baptist
Convention voting members for the first time approved a resolution
that supports ``the fair and equitable use of capital punishment
... as a legitimate form of punishment for those guilty of murder
or treasonous acts that result in death,'' the resolution states.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty can be found in both the Hebrew
Bible and the New Testament, said Richard Land, president of the
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bible says that civil government is divinely
authorized to protect citizens and does so by executing those
convicted of capital crimes and in declaring war, said Land, who
also hosts the daily radio program ``For Faith and Family.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age in which sophisticated methods are used to collect
evidence, the justice system can ``virtually guarantee that an
innocent person is not going to be executed,'' but cannot ensure
that convicted murderers will not kill again, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to expect that, if you kill my wife, the
government will exact justice; not revenge, justice,'' Land said.
``If I did it, that would be revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hugghins, pastor of Elkins Lake Baptist Church in
Huntsville, Texas, said his opinion of the death penalty is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he accepted capital punishment as the price of justice in
an imperfect society, Hugghins said. But in the community where
Texas houses its Death Row, Hugghins has been a pastor to church
members who work in the justice system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he recognizes that capital punishment can be found in the
pages of the Bible, the message of Jesus Christ is one of
redemption, he said. It is through this prism that the death
penalty should be opposed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Jesus is real thrilled about putting a final note
on anybody's life,'' Hugghins said. ``I think the Jesus ethic is,
`Always look for redemption.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, opposition
to capital punishment is now considered consistent with the
church's teachings on the sanctity of life, said Dan Misleh, a
policy adviser for the United States Catholic Conference's
department of social development and world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Catholic Church has not always been doctrinally
opposed to the death penalty, Catholic bishops in the United States
began discussing their concerns about it in the mid-1970s. In 1980,
the conference of bishops issued a formal statement that clearly
denounced capital punishment, Misleh said.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Catholics, a firm call to oppose the death penalty
came in a 1995 message from Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, the pope said that modern penal systems made
it unnecessary to protect society by executing dangerous criminals,
Misleh said. Then in a speech during his 1999 visit to St. Louis,
the pope called capital punishment ``cruel and unnecessary'' and
urged Americans to end the practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Church has taught that capital punishment is
legitimate, that door is pretty much slammed shut,'' Misleh said.
</P>
<P>
   That door may not be slammed shut for Orthodox Jews. The Hebrew
Bible allows for the death penalty, said Rabbi Gedalia Schwartz,
the chief presiding judge of the rabbinical court of the Rabbinical
Council of America, a professional association of Orthodox rabbis.
But when viewed in the context of the Talmud, the body of teaching
and interpretations of Jewish law, it is clear that capital
punishment is only to be used in rare cases and after extreme
scrutiny of the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the actuality of the Scriptures, of the law, the
death penalty, to be carried out to its conclusion, was extremely
rare,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   For the governing body of the United Methodist Church, carrying
out the death penalty should not just be rare, but prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Methodist church's governing body approved a
statement against the death penalty in any form and urged ``the
abolition of capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the quadrennial meeting of the General Conference this
summer, the group supported a moratorium on using the death penalty
and proposed steps Methodists can take to oppose the death penalty
in their own states, said Frances Jett, a program director for the
United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society.
</P>
<P>
   The church also supports a network of capital punishment
opponents, United Methodists Against the Death Penalty, started
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has come to light about the death penalty being so
unfair,'' Jett said. ``... With the heightened awareness ... it has
given new life to the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) has opposed
the death penalty since 1959, said the Rev. Kathy Lancaster, who
works in the denomination's National Ministries Division.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unclear how many believers in the pews see the
death penalty the same way denomination leaders do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 survey of 5,164 Presbyterians showed that 63 percent of
church members favor the death penalty in murder cases, but only 34
percent of pastors do, Lancaster said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Southern Baptists, most agree with the convention's
resolution in support of the death penalty, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Southern Baptists would agree that (convicted
serial killer) Ted Bundy deserved to die for what he did to those
young women,'' he said.

RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS DIVIDED OVER THE DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TARA DOOLEY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mattie Compton describes her personal position on the death
penalty as ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth woman has a strong sense of the need to keep
society safe and the importance of the criminal justice system,
especially when dealing with horrific crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But as an African-American, she sees that the death penalty
disproportionately affects her community and also the poor. And as
a Christian, she feels called to act with compassion, forgiveness
and care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people of faith are certainly struggling with the
issue,'' said Compton, chairwoman of the trustees at Mount Zion
Baptist Church in Fort Worth. ``... It is a moral, ethical issue,
and it is one in which people of a very strong faith are indeed
still human and where we have great difficulty in following Christ
and not seeking vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of many faiths have officially expressed opposition to
the death penalty, and some have recently reiterated their
position, joining those who have called for scrutiny of how capital
punishment is administered.
</P>
<P>
   But others, particularly leaders of the Southern Baptist
Convention, support the death penalty. Still others, like Compton,
continue to struggle with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in attitude were evident in the results of a Gallup poll
released in June that showed 66 percent of Americans favor the
death penalty as punishment in murder cases, down from the 80
percent who did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Christian Life Commission of the Baptist General
Convention of Texas gathered a group of about dozen people _
including Compton _ to develop a statement on the death penalty,
said Phil Strickland, director of the Christian Life Commission of
the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee as a whole expressed various views,'' Strickland
said. ``There is a consensus about how the death penalty is used in
Texas and also at the point of our penal philosophy being more
oriented toward retribution than restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are differences of opinion within the committee,
the group could well find itself on the opposite side of the debate
from the Southern Baptist Convention, the national organization of
Southern Baptists. This summer, the group, the largest Protestant
denomination in the United States, approved a resolution in support
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   At a June meeting in Orlando, Fla., the Southern Baptist
Convention voting members for the first time approved a resolution
that supports ``the fair and equitable use of capital punishment
... as a legitimate form of punishment for those guilty of murder
or treasonous acts that result in death,'' the resolution states.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty can be found in both the Hebrew
Bible and the New Testament, said Richard Land, president of the
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bible says that civil government is divinely
authorized to protect citizens and does so by executing those
convicted of capital crimes and in declaring war, said Land, who
also hosts the daily radio program ``For Faith and Family.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age in which sophisticated methods are used to collect
evidence, the justice system can ``virtually guarantee that an
innocent person is not going to be executed,'' but cannot ensure
that convicted murderers will not kill again, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to expect that, if you kill my wife, the
government will exact justice; not revenge, justice,'' Land said.
``If I did it, that would be revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hugghins, pastor of Elkins Lake Baptist Church in
Huntsville, Texas, said his opinion of the death penalty is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he accepted capital punishment as the price of justice in
an imperfect society, Hugghins said. But in the community where
Texas houses its Death Row, Hugghins has been a pastor to church
members who work in the justice system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he recognizes that capital punishment can be found in the
pages of the Bible, the message of Jesus Christ is one of
redemption, he said. It is through this prism that the death
penalty should be opposed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Jesus is real thrilled about putting a final note
on anybody's life,'' Hugghins said. ``I think the Jesus ethic is,
`Always look for redemption.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, opposition

BRITNEY SPEAKS (OOPS, SHE SAID IT AGAIN!) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's been probed, prodded, maligned, molded, sold, adored, and
sold some more. She's fabulous. She's talentless. She's adorable
and horrifying. She is the face of the youth culture, the goddess
of teen fanzines, the proverbial life of the global all-ages party.
Britney Spears is bigger than music, and much, much larger than
life _ a phenomenon that's been chronicled extensively in these
pages. Which is why it seems fitting to let the 19-year-old
chanteuse speak for herself. Following is an actual, uncensored
transcript of Spears's reflections on singing, the Stones, school
supplies, swimming with dolphins, her haircut, Eminem, the
pressures of fame, and the promise of the future, culled from a
tele-press conference held earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Spears's opening statement: Hi, everybody! This is Britney! And
I'm really excited I can talk to you guys about my tour!
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. : Tell us what we can expect from the tour _ the staging, the
set pieces, what everything's going to look like.
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Yes, it's going to be fun. Like the first part of the
show I hit them strong, really, really hard. And then I come out
and I have, like, you know, the sets are really amazing. Like I
have one bedroom set. And it's just, like, really cartoonish
looking. And then I come back and I start doing the harder songs.
And it just has, like, the show flows really, really well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of critics commented on how bold a move it was for you
to remake a classic like ``Satisfaction.'' How did that come about?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Well, really, I really liked the song a lot when I was
younger. And I wanted to do, you know, a remake of the song so I'd
have the opportunity to work with Rodney Jenkins, because I'd
talked to him at a party once. And I was like, well, we should do
something together.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard that you've entertained the idea of a career as a
lawyer. Can you tell me about that?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Well, when I was younger, we had Career Day one day. And
I didn't want to come to school and say, `I want to be a pop star,
or a singer, or whatever.' And so, yes, I wanted to be an
entertainment lawyer. But that's not something I want to do now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you talk a little bit about any back-to-school memories
that you have?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Back-to-school memories?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Really, I remember when I was like in the second grade
or third grade, my favorite thing was to, to _ I know this sounds
really retarded _ but to go to Wal-Mart and get all my supplies.
That was so much fun when I was younger.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what was
the most exciting thing that you got to do when you were in Hawaii
(filming a Fox television special).
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Probably the parasailing and swimming with the dolphins,
because they say that dolphins have a certain kind of vibrations.
So even people who are, you know, mentally ill or something like
that, they go there. And it's kind of very therapeutic for them. So
when I went there, it was really _ it was a nice experience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This spring you also got to be part of another hit single,
the Eminem song. Do you take that as a crude, good-spirited joke,
or is it really a dis?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: I think it's cool. You know, it's just flattering when
someone will, you know, write about you in their song.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are your biggest pressures, your biggest day-to-day
headaches, and how do you deal with them?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Well, really, I mean, every day is different for me.
Like today, I'm focusing on trying to sing and dance at the same
time. And yes, I mean, it's really _ I mean, it varies for me. You
know, and I mean, one week I'll be worried about an award show
coming up. And the next week, and now, you know, right now I'm
really _ it's really hectic and crazy because I have a video coming
up in between tour rehearsals. But the ways I relax is just, you
know, finding time for yourself and, you know, getting massages,
spending time with my mom, you know, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was wondering if you could comment on what it's like to be
a role model for so many teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Well really, I don't really _ I try to think of myself
not as a role model. You know what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did it feel like the first time a fan recognized you on
the street?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: The first time somebody recognized me on the street was
probably when me and my friend Felicia, we were walking in New
York. And we were by Times Square. And you know how there's, like,
a lot of fans by there because of `TRL' (MTV's ``Total Request
Live'')? And a girl noticed me. And I was like, `Oh, goodness.
Someone noticed me.' I felt so cool. You know, it's like, `Oh my
god, they recognized me.' And now I'm just like, `Oh, I'm over it.'
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you feel about your shorter haircut?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: Actually, a lot of people thought it was really cute and
sassy. But I just wanted it shorter because, I don't know, it's
summertime. And it's just a lot easier. And you can always put
extensions in if you want to change it up. But this is more me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the hardest thing for you to get used to as far as
being famous?
</P>
<P>
   Spears: You can't really just chill out. But just lately, you
know, I've been having to deal with the realization that you're
famous and you can't _ there's no turning back. You know what I
mean? There's no turning back at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was wondering if you're thinking in terms of longevity, and
what sort of things you're doing to ensure that you're still going
to be vital in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Spears: You know, there's really nothing, I don't think, that
you can do to ensure that. You know what I mean?

GOOD GOLLY, MISS MOLLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little girls with big voices have become as common as candy in
pop music. Most of them, however, don't have a kangaroo for a
drummer. Or a pink limousine with a built-in skate ramp. Or a hit
single about wetting the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Molly O!, 8-year-old international singing sensation and
star of the new Kids' WB cartoon ``Generation O!,'' which premieres
Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Molly's timing is, to say the least, uncanny. One might
logically assume that the current tidal wave of young female pop
stars (Britney, Christina, Mandy, Jessica) _ or more accurately,
the massive, school-aged fan base they've created _ was inspiration
for an animated series aimed at 6-to-11-year-olds that features a
famous singer who's in third grade.
</P>
<P>
   But when children's-book author Jim Proimos, writer/director Tim
Newman (singer-songwriter Randy Newman's cousin), and writer David
Hale (who moonlights as a singer for the Blind Lemon Peel Blues
Band) dreamed up the idea several years ago, Britney wasn't even a
blip on the pop music radar. Rather, kids' music consisted of a
milquetoast folk singer, a purple dinosaur, and four fluffy Brits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we started talking, music for kids was Raffi or
Barney or the Spice Girls,'' says executive producer Ken Olshansky.
``There was really no smart, well-produced music that spoke to
things kids cared about. All three of the guys who came to us with
the idea have daughters, and music was central to where the show
came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial response to the Generation O! concept was the same
across the board: `` `If you turn this character into a boy, we can
sell it,' '' recalls co-creator David Hale, whose daughter Isabel
was the inspiration for Molly O!. ``The rule of thumb in children's
television has always been girls will watch boys, but boys won't
watch girls. We decided we wouldn't waver, though. Boys already
have that smugness, that noblesse oblige. This is a real female
empowerment thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Molly O! is about as far from Britney et al. as one
more girl with a microphone and a pop song can be. Neither blonde
bombshell nor demi-diva, Molly rocks out _ that's right, she rocks
_ in baggy shorts and T-shirts. She bums out about her bedtime and
bickers with her annoying brother. She dutifully obeys her dad, who
works in a cheese factory, and respects her unflappable mom, deputy
fire chief in imaginary suburban Appleton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what really sets Molly apart is the fact that unlike her
real-life contemporaries, she writes her own songs _ with a little
help from the Boston-based band Letters To Cleo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I'm totally in touch with my inner 8-year-old,''
says Kay Hanley of Quincy, who sings the part of Molly and co-wrote
_ with her husband, guitarist Michael Eisenstein _ the songs for
``Generation O!'' ``Not to be mushy or gooey or method-actory, but
this winter I felt like I was Molly. I just get her. When I was her
age I always wanted to be the center of attention. I was always a
spotlight hogger.''
</P>
<P>
   Songs like ``Girls Rule, Boys Drool'' and ``Damp Sheets''
contain ``some of the best lyrics I've ever written,'' says Hanley,
and she's dead serious. ``They needed to be clever and smart, but
the kind of smart thing that an 8-year-old might say.''
</P>
<P>
   To the producers' credit, they decided against casting a band
composed of session musicians and set out to find a real singer to
bring the sound of Generation O! (also the name of Molly's group)
to life in an organic, vibrant way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really good list of young women,'' says Olshansky.
``We looked at Garrison Starr, Juliana Hatfield, Maria McKee
(formerly of the band Lone Justice). We needed someone who could
nail the emotional level of an 8-year-old, who wouldn't play by
other people's rules, who's fresh. We didn't want imitation.
Letters To Cleo took smart songwriting and applied it to kids'
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At the suggestion of his daughter Annie _ a longtime Letters To
Cleo fan _ co-creator Proimos contacted the band during the summer
of 1998, when they happened to be in LA working on music for the
film ``Ten Things I Hate About You.'' Hanley says their interest
was piqued almost immediately. ``They didn't want it to be a
cartoony, jingle-writer version of a band. So I wrote some lyrics
for a theme song. Who knew what would come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to the summer of 1999. Hanley was 8 1/2 months
pregnant with her daughter, Zoe (now 14 months), when she got the
call from her manager. ``I had to write, record, mix, and mail the
first song in four days. The whole thing has been very methodical,
and it's very different for us to work like that. But we busted it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the songs are true-blue pop-rock, drenched in both
youthful exuberance and rebellious bluster. In addition to the
impossibly peppy ``Generation O!'' theme, Hanley and Eisenstein
have written 13 songs that are integrated into the story line of
each of the season's episodes. (Letters to Cleo recently broke up,
but Hanley says if the show is picked up for a second season the
band will reunite for the project.) Over jangly guitars and
smashing drums in ``Strange World,'' Molly grapples with her
confusion over ``when to stand out, when to blend in'' a conundrum
that strikes to the heart of a classic, age-appropriate issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are being spoken to better now, but there's not a lot of
content in a song like ('N Sync's) `Bye Bye Bye,' '' Olshansky
points out. Adds Hanley: ``There's nothing sexualized about Molly.
It's a whole different message.'' Timely and right-minded as the
concept may be, one has to wonder if a generation that's already
been indoctrinated into the sexually charged, pristinely packaged
world of today's young pop stars will find it hard to relate to a
middle-class Midwestern girl like Molly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bit of a concern,'' Olshansky concedes. ``Aspiration
is very important for kids. They want to be something bigger than
what they are, and the other stars are so packaged there could be a
disconnect there. But I think the combination of her being a star
and being accessible is appealing. You could aspire to be like
Molly, but you already are like Molly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy in the series comes when the worlds collide. Molly O!
may be the voice of a generation, but her mom insists on picking
her up at 10 sharp after a concert, and won't let her get her ears
pierced 'til she's older. It's juxtapositions like that, believes
Hale, that will appeal to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we love about Molly is that she's the biggest star
in the world, but in Appleton they think she's an odd little girl.
She's not as well-liked on the playground as she is as Wembley
Stadium or Madison Square Garden,'' Hale explains. ``Molly's
offbeat. Like other kids, she can't express it in words. But when
she sings it, everybody listens.''

audiences, they would do well to tear a page out of a new book by
Liz Carpenter titled: ``Start with A Laugh.'' Carpenter, one of
President Lyndon B. Johnson's speechwriters, offers her sure-fire
formula: ``Start with a laugh, put the meat in the middle and wave

EXHIBIT REVEALS FEMALE RELIGIOUS LEADER'S POWER IN A POWERLESS AGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ She was a single parent and a homeless woman with
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   She was an author, a journalist, a newspaper founder, a healer
and a spiritual leader who still has followers 100 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist in
the late 1800s, had a life that is a lesson in overcoming hardship.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit on her accomplishments is on display through Sept. 28
on the third floor of the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library in
Dallas. A separate exhibit on Eddy is planned for the Dallas
Women's Museum, which will open in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have many women role models that are as
multidimensional as Mary Baker Eddy,'' says Virgina Harris,
chairman of the Christian Science board, based in Boston. ``She was
able to break through the challenges and limitations placed on
women in the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddy relied on inspiration from the Bible and on prayer to aid
in spiritual and physical healing, one of the early American
examples of the quest to connect the mind and body with the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas library exhibit features newspaper clippings,
photographs, videos and audiotapes describing how Eddy founded
Christian Science, a church based on physical and spiritual healing
through prayer. Audiotapes include testimonials of people who have
turned their lives around through prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is not funded by the church. It is a project of The
Writings of Mary Baker Eddy, a nonprofit group that circulates
Eddy's works and is led by Harris, who also leads the church's
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibit is not so much about the theological side of her
life, although she is a spiritual leader,'' Harris says. ``She is
an author, a health reformer, a journalist. Her life was so
large.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddy, born in 1821, suffered as a child from what is remembered
in history as ``a spinal malady,'' which was compounded when she
injured herself in a fall when she was 45. She turned to the New
Testament of the Bible, and said she felt she learned lessons about
the healing powers of Jesus. Although she had little formal
education, she spent years working on a philosophy, which was first
published in 1875. Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures is
regarded by her followers as divinely inspired and it serves them,
along with the Bible, as a Scripture of the Christian Science
faith. She founded The Christian Science Monitor, a newspaper in
its 90th year of publishing. She died in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy accomplished all this without being able to vote, without
being able to own property and after her child was taken away from
her _ against her will _ in the years before custody laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas library, 1515 Young St. at Ervay Street, is open 1-5
p.m. Sundays,
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays, and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Fridays and
Saturdays.

AMERICAN EVANGELISTS ARRESTED IN CHINA RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beijing _ Three American evangelists who were detained in
central China on Wednesday along with a large group of Chinese
Protestants were released Friday afternoon, Chinese officials told
the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Henan province, where the arrests were made, told a
U.S. diplomat that the three U.S. citizens had been detained for
``activities incompatible with the tourist status under which they
entered China,'' the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   All three Americans were born in Taiwan and belong to a
California church that sends members on brief missions into China
to lend moral and financial support to the so-called house
churches. These are fervent Protestant groups that refuse to accept
the leadership of the government-sponsored church, and their
members often suffer police harassment and detention.
</P>
<P>
   The three were detained along with nearly 130 Chinese followers
of the China Fangcheng Church, a large Protestant group whose
leaders were sent to labor camps last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night the whereabouts of the released missionaries was
unclear, but in similar cases in the past, people declared in
violation of their visas have been required to leave the country
quickly. Chinese officials have not discussed whether any of the
detained Chinese believers would face criminal charges or
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans belong to the Chinese Vineyard Church
Fellowship in Los Altos, Calif., and were identified by the group
as Henry Chu, 36; his wife, Sandy Lin, 28; and Patricia Lan, 25.
They had traveled to China on Aug. 13 for a two-week mission.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign missionary work is illegal in China, though informal
outside aid to churches is sometimes tolerated.

&HT;     AIR FORCE IS COMING TO A MOVIE THEATER NEAR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force began running Hollywood-produced
advertisements at movie theaters Friday as part of its ongoing
strategy to boost recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers can see the first Air Force advertisements directed
by Academy Award-winner Bob Richardson, the photography chief of
``JFK'' and ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong, $28.2 million ad campaign at National Cinema
Network and AMC theaters around the country is a new twist for a
service with recruiting and retention problems.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spots that accent the Air Force's benefits, the six
new 30- to 60-second commercials, which also are to air on prime
time television starting Sept. 2, appeal to nobler qualities _
among them camaraderie, service to the nation and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   One advertisement depicts an F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon
in a mock dogfight. Another spot shows a mother reading to her
three children, while a woman's voice in the background sings,
``Guardian angels will attend thee all through the night.'' The
camera then zooms out from a cockpit to reveal an F-117 stealth
fighter flying high in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half a million remarkable individuals serving their country,
and they all believe they have the best job in the world,'' the Air
Force's top enlisted man, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
Jim Finch, says as one spot closes. ``Join us.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters and Undersecretary Carol
DiBattiste said the ads are a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appeal to patriotism, they appeal to service before self
and they appeal to people wanting to be part of a team, and the
music,'' DiBattiste said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are thematically consistent, and they match what
our marketing research tells us we need to do to get our message
out to the American public,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   If the message is new, the airing of advertising on television
is not. The Air Force spent $74 million in 1999 on its first paid
TV ad campaign and earmarked $54 million for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The switch from free public service ads that had been run in the
past to paid advertising came amid the Air Force's first recruiting
shortfall since 1979, a stunning development that prompted the
formation of new strategies to reverse the service's sagging
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has funneled its cash into TV, radio and print
advertising, billboards, a revamped Web site and a roving 18-wheel
truck with simulators dubbed the ``Air Force Experience,'' as well
as the spots running in movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But it also expanded bonuses last year for many career fields,
with payouts ranging from $1,000 to $12,000, and added hundreds of
new recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces are competing with a strong job market and have
resorted to advertising, bonuses and other incentive to attract
qualified young people. The services also are fighting to keep
those in the enlisted and officer ranks from leaving for
higher-paying jobs in the private sector.

   U.S.-HISTORY-PLURALISM (Undated) _ The writing of American
history underwent a significant change in the 1960s and '70s _ one
that remains in place today _ when younger historians shifted their
emphasis from the public life of the nation to the private lives of
its citizens. But critics of the new history have worried about the
fragmentation of the past, with each group telling its own story.
And even advocates have wondered about the place of so many
categories in the larger scheme of things. By David Oshinsky.

   PRISON-AUTHORS (New York) _ With more Americans than ever in
prison, an exhibition in New York is offering a survey of American
convicts' writings. For almost as long as there have been prisons,
prisoners have turned into authors for diversion, creative
expression, solace, penance, vindication, vengeance and release
(physically and metaphysically). By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLISH-JAPANESE (Undated) _ Although English is becoming the
dominant language around the world, few outside Japan are probably

   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politics, like chess or basketball, becomes more sophisticated
as the history of the game progresses. Players study each other's
habits, learn from past mistakes and anticipate moves and
countermoves further in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate in this year's presidential race will ignore
attacks as Michael Dukakis did in 1988, write off an adulterous
opponent as George Bush did in 1992, or ally himself with an
unpopular Congress as Bob Dole did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, victory will go to the player who figures out what his
opponent can't do _ win an all-pawn endgame, shoot the ball while
moving left, discuss foreign policy intelligently _ and steers him
into it. That's what Al Gore has just done to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to the primaries. Gore was in danger of losing to
Bill Bradley. What was Bradley's strength? Tuning out the opponent
and inspiring the audience. Bradley's style was slow, abstract, and
uplifting. He despised and refused to engage in petty conflict.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore engaged him. Gore's implicit message was: ``Come on,
Bill. Hit me.'' Bradley refused. Gore went on pummeling Bradley's
platform, exposing real flaws and distorting fake ones. When
Bradley realized the blows were doing serious damage, he tried to
hit back. But he couldn't. It wasn't his style.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, after New Hampshire, Bush was in danger of losing to
John McCain. What was McCain's strength? Character. He delivered
straight talk. He had suffered for his country in Vietnam. He
wasn't just another politician.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bush made him act like one. He targeted McCain's weakness:
his temper. With a few hard jabs in South Carolina, he provoked
McCain to declare on camera, ``Bush's ad twists the truth like
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush delivered the decisive counterpunch: ``When John
McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was untrustworthy,
that's over the line. Disagree with me, fine. But do not challenge
my integrity.'' Suddenly, McCain looked like the politician and
Bush looked like the wronged man of honor. McCain lost South
Carolina badly and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Now put yourself in Bush's shoes on Super Tuesday. You face Gore
in the general election. You're ahead in the polls. Your opponent
must find a way to take that lead from you. How will he do it? The
same way he beat Bradley: attack. What will he go after? Your
gubernatorial record, your tax cut, your plan to privatize part of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In elementary politics, the next question would be how to defend
these targets. But in advanced politics, the question is more
ambitious: How can you deprive your opponent of the attacking
option altogether? By making it futile and counterproductive. How
can you make it futile? By forcing your opponent, in the course of
his attack, to call on an asset he lacks. And how can you make it
counterproductive? By arranging your defense so that his failed
attack exacerbates his chief weakness.
</P>
<P>
   You send a defender down court so you can rebound the opponent's
miss and throw a long pass for a dunk. You arrange your bishops to
shred the enemy's king side when he opens it by pushing pawns at
you.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Bush campaign had in mind. The asset Gore lacks
is credibility. He lost it by defending the Buddhist temple
fund-raiser, claiming there was ``no controlling legal authority,''
hyping his role in the Internet, praising Clinton during the Monica
Lewinsky scandal and generally coming across as a shameless spin
artist. Bad credibility, in turn, implies a weakness: bad
character.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bush set up the media and the electorate to judge any attack
by Gore as a question of credibility and character. Again and
again, Bush predicted that Gore would attack him out of desperation
and carnivorous instinct. And each time Gore breathed anything
negative about Bush's ideas or his record, the Bush camp issued two
replies: You can't believe anything Gore says, and this just shows
what a ruthless hit man he is.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore had used his convention to attack Bush personally, as
Democrats did to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, or had launched a
full-scale assault on Bush's gubernatorial record, as Bush's father
did to Dukakis in 1988 and Clinton in 1992, Bush's counterpunch
strategy might have worked.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore didn't do that. Instead, he defined the race in
populist terms: ``They're for the powerful. We're for the people.''
True or false, the charge was substantive. It was political, not
personal. And to back it up, Gore cited a series of issueshealth
care, prescription drugs, tax cuts, family leaveon which the
Clinton administration and the Republican Congress had tangled for
six years. He promised, if elected, to pass a patients' bill of
rights, crack down on polluters, and secure the solvency of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   How was Bush to respond? The answer consistent with Bush's
long-range game plankeeping the election focused on character, not
policywould have been to dismiss Gore's populism as yet another
costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever else Al Gore is, we all know he's never been a
fighter against powerful interests,'' Bush could have chuckled.
``He's been taking money from business folks his whole life. He's
just trying to reinvent himself again.'' And the press would have
bought this critique, because it's essentially true.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't how Bush responded. Instead, he opened two new
lines of attack. He called Gore's promises a list of what Clinton
and Gore had failed to accomplish in seven years. And he blamed
that failure on their cynical, divisive partisanship, freshly
illustrated by Gore's ``class warfare.'' The day after Gore's
speech, Bush declared at a rally in Tennessee:
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have a clear choice. They got one candidate who
wants four more years of finger-pointing and politicizing and
blaming ... who wants to wage class warfare to get ahead. I've got
a different purpose. ... A leader is somebody who finds common
ground. Last night we heard a laundry list of new promises, which I
thought was an attempt to cover up old failures. ... [Gore] tried
to separate himself from the squandered opportunities of his own
administration. ... Last night they were talking about making sure
the Medicare system has prescription drugs. It's amazing they're
still talking about it after seven years of power. It's time to get
a president who's willing to work with Republicans and Democrats
that will say there will be a prescription drug program for seniors
who need it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday talk shows, Bush's two principal surrogates,
strategist Karl Rove and communications director Karen Hughes,
reinforced those two arguments. As Hughes put it on CNN's ``Late
Edition'':
</P>
<P>
   ``What people saw on Thursday night in the vice president's
speech was, one, a litany of the promises unfulfilled from the
Clinton administration. For example, they talk about prescription
drug benefits for senior citizens yet, for the last seven years,
have failed to do anything to provide prescription drug benefits
for senior citizens. But I think what they also heard was a vice
president who talked about fighting, fighting everybody, and I
think the American people are tired of all the fighting in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with these lines of attack is that they carry Bush
into enemy terrain. They shift the debate away from character
toward policy. Worse yet, they shift it from the future to the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gained the upper hand in the election by doing two things:
1) concentrating the public's attention on Clinton's scandals
rather than Clinton's excellent economic record or his popular
positions on issues; and 2) focusing the policy discussion on the
popular things Bush promises to do in the future rather than on the
unpopular things congressional Republicans have done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   By portraying Gore as a warrior and associating his warfare with
the major policy battles of the past six years, Bush undercut his
whole game plan on the most important weekend of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The talk shows illustrate this blunder. On ``Meet the Press,''
Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley was shown the video clip of Bush
blaming Washington gridlock on Gore's ``class warfare.'' Daley
replied, ``Al Gore has worked in the Senate, in the House, and as
vice president with Republicans when they would work with us. Newt
Gingrich and his group wasn't too quick to want to work with the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Rove charged that Gore's ``class warfare'' had
obstructed progress on prescription drugs, a patients' bill of
rights, and shoring up Medicare and Social Security. Again, Daley
carried the argument to the GOP's doorstep: ``Newt Gingrich and the
Republican leadership in the House and Senate over the last eight
years haven't been exactly willing to work with President Clinton
or Vice President Gore, and that's one of the reasons why we've had
a stalemate on important issues as Karl has talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``This Week,'' Hughes said of Gore's speech: ``People across
America heard a long list of the failures of his own
administration. For seven years, they failed to provide
prescription drug coverage. For seven years, they failed to get a
patients' bill of rights. ... He wants to talk about fighting.
They're fighting in Washington.'' To which Gore adviser Bob Shrum
gladly rejoined:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to hear Karen talk about the failure to enact
some of these things. Almost every Democrat in the House and the
Senate is for these. Very few Republicans are. George Bush could
move this process right now. If he's really for a prescription drug
benefit for all seniors under Medicare, which by the way is not in
his budget, he ought to pick up the phone and call Trent Lott. ...
The reason he doesn't pick up the phone and call Trent Lott is
because he doesn't want to stand up to the pharmaceutical
companies, the HMOs, and the insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a debate Bush can't win. Politically, the Clinton
position has beaten the Gingrich position every time. Bush's whole
campaign was designed to stay out of this quagmire. So how did he
stumble into it?
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that he and his advisers blundered. They
thought ``class warfare'' was another character issue. It isn't.
It's about class. And the Bush people themselves have unwisely
identified it with all the health-care and retirement-security
debates on which Democrats keep whipping Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush folks should have accused Gore of a political
misdemeanor: lying about being a populist. Instead, they tried to
nail him for a political felony: thwarting progress on important
issues in Washington, through populist partisanship. They wanted to
raise the stakes, and they didto their own ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Bush's plunge into the Gingrich-era
policy morass was inevitable, because in the long run, content
beats tone. Gore has been the candidate of content: policies,
positions, and a record of battles in and against Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been the candidate of tone: decency, integrity, honor,
purpose, optimism, compassion, leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, content is more essential, because while
content can convey tone, tone is always about content. Leadership
is on Social Security. Compassion is toward single mothers.
Fighting is for a patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   On this theory, there was no way Bush could have made it all the
way to Election Day without having to discuss exactly what policies
should beand should have beenfought for and about. And sooner or
later, as the Republican nominee, Bush would have been obliged to
go around the country saying to congressional Republicans what he
now says at every campaign stop: ``Help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The third possibility is that Gore forced Bush's hand. His
selection of Joe Lieberman as his running mate, Clinton's speech to
the Democratic convention on Monday, and Gore's speech three nights
later shattered Bush's front-running game plan. Post-convention
polls showed that in the space of two weeks Gore had sharply
diminished his association with Clinton's misconduct, reassured the
public of his ability to lead, shored up his support on the left,
and persuaded swing voters that he shared their values and would
advance their interests in areas where they had previously
preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Gore had achieved this while persuading many voters
of his trustworthiness and polarizing the election along the lines
of the Washington policy wars rather than of incumbency,
competence, or Bush's Texas record. He hadn't even mentioned Bush's
name.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bush struck back,which suddenly became essential, he had
to do so in Washington policy terms. Whether by force or
temptation, Gore provoked Bush to attempt the one maneuver he
couldn't afford. Bush will be lucky to survive it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   His once-sore knee nearly back to 100 percent, Valencia
marathoner- in-training Eric Heilbrun continues to rack up the
miles on the way to his goal: the Honolulu Marathon in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went 10 miles (last) Saturday,'' said Heilbrun, a sales
agent with the Southern California Automobile Club. ``Then I did a
10K on the weekend, just for the heck of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That 10K was to benefit the Exceptional Children's Foundation _
dubbed the ``Home Run'' because of its proximity to Dodger Stadium.
For his pains, Heilbrun came out with a ribbon that reads ``I
conquered Cardiac Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That second mile is all up hill,'' says Heilbrun. ``Brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Formerly a light exerciser who used to play tennis, Heilbrun is
getting himself into shape with the Joints in Motion team of the
Southern California Arthritis Foundation. In addition to getting
into marathon running shape over five months of training, each team
member has to raise $3,100 for the foundation. The Joints in Motion
provides the professional coaching and training.

   Heilbrun recently sent out his first batch of 125 pledge request
letters. After gauging the response, he plans to send out up to 100
more. Although team members have until Nov. 15, Heilbrun plans to
have his fund-raising completed by Oct. 1 so he can concentrate on
the training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might actually start mailing to some of the businesses,
too,'' he says. ``All it takes is one guy with deep pockets to say,
`You know what? Here's $500.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not terribly concerned about making the goal yet. In
another month, if I'm not doing as well, I'll start getting
aggressive, knocking on doors and making phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll keep running _ 10 miles one day, six the
next, eight the week before by a man-made lake near Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding I'm not the fastest guy around,'' says Heilbrun.
``But even after 10 miles, I still feel fine. Before, the thought
of running 10 miles would have inspired the same fear as running a
marathon _ the thought that if I tried to run a marathon, I'd kill
myself. It's not the case.''

<P>
   There is no truer place for a thirtysomething to feel among the
ranks of the geriatric than at a Third Eye Blind concert.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we were there at the Greek Theatre where the San
Francisco-born band brought its Red Summer Sun tour for an
energetic but largely forgettable set Thursday night, but we were
greatly outnumbered. To the right: the barely and not-quite legal,
celebrating the dog days of summer with beer after $5 beer. To the
left: the preteen ``Buffy''-watching set who could probably tell
you exactly which episode of ``Dawson's Creek'' first featured the
band's anthem ``How's It Going to Be.'' To their right: permissive
parents who, no doubt, had some explaining to do when
guitarist/lead singer Stephan Jenkins introduced a song with ``Oh
my God, she's 10 days late'' or made musical reference to having
``some blow to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, all groups seemed to get in a party mood as the band and
its two opening acts _ Vertical Horizon and Nine Days, virtual
sound-alike bands, each with a top-40 hit _ got things fired up.
Third Eye Blind, the evening's headliner, finally took the stage at
a curfew-challenging 9:35 p.m. Its stage was a psychedelic
assemblage of ramps overlooked by a giant Amazonian mask with
glowing eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a natural showman often sporting an Edwardian coat and
top hat to match, was all over that stage. And off it. ``These
seats are getting in the way of our fun,'' he declared a few songs
into the set. ``So I'm coming in.'' Which he did, taking a
perimeter tour of the theater and ending up halfway to the nose
bleed level where he led the crowd in a sing-along version of the
suicide-themed ``Jumper.'' It's still the band's best song and an
evening highlight.
</P>
<P>
   The band, which included drummer Brad Hargreaves and guitarists
Arion Salazar and Tony Fredianelli, divided its set evenly between
songs from its 1997 self-titled debut album and the
November-released ``Blue.'' The songs are still largely about
drugs, sex and relationships present and failed. Lyrically, Third
Eye Blind has yet to top the tongue-twisting surrealism of its
first hit, ``Semi-Charmed Life'' (no easy number for a sing-along).
</P>
<P>
   But good luck making sense of any creative lyrics underneath the
rumbling bass line and pounding drum beats. Not that it matters.
The expectation was for a rousing light and sound show of familiar
pop tunes delivered by eye-friendly singers. And that's exactly
what the audience _ ages 9 to 35 _ received. &QL;

  CSUN programs train deaf graduates to achieve greatness 
(For by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside the 2000 Miss Deaf America Pageant program is an ad from
the California State University, Northridge, National Center on
Deafness. It offers congratulations and good luck to eventual
pageant winner Lauren Teruel (the former Miss Deaf Illinois),
Alexis Marman (Miss Deaf California) and Tami Lee Santimyer (Miss
Deaf Florida) _ all of them CSUN students.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are all,'' the ad reads, ``winners in our eyes!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by now the accomplishments of Teruel, her Miss Deaf
America predecessor Amy Wong, Marman and Santimyer are considered
noteworthy, but are hardly unexpected. Accomplished deaf or
partially deaf alumni are becoming the norm rather than the
exception at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pageant contestants, CSUN alumni include
high-level officials at Boeing, Sprint, IBM and Real Estate
Investment Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at `Who's Who in Deaf America,' most of those
people came through here,'' says Dr. Merri Pearson, director of
CSUN's National Center on Deafness (NCOD). ``We have people who
have high-level government positions, (positions in) community
service organizations, advocacy organizations, several school
superintendents.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has far more programs and opportunities than the bulk of
universities in the nation, including a deaf fraternity and
sorority, a student government and a political action committee. An
average of 250 deaf or partially deaf students attend the
university each year _ all in mainstream classes with the same
academic requirements as their hearing classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a critical mass here,'' says Robert Sidansky,
administrator of student services at the NCOD. ``The deaf and
hard-of-hearing students here socialize with their own peers
instead of being isolated. They have lots of leadership
opportunities and lots of support from the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 38th year of existence, NCOD makes CSUN one of the
premier educational resources for deaf students in the United
States. Students have access to interpreters, note-taking,
real-time captioning and tutoring. The center's special projects
division provides students with career service assistance, and
helps train faculty in other academic departments.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson also uses the term ``critical mass'' when she talks
about the community available to deaf students. ``By that, I mean
there are more than just one or two deaf students here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deafness is more than having a disability,'' adds Pearson, who
is partially deaf. ``It's having a cultural identity. There's deaf
humor, theater, dance, language _ everything you can think of when
you think of what defines a culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in order to celebrate and learn and grow, quite frequently
it's important that you surround yourself with the people who share
your cultural heritage.'' &QL; 
---Even before she became the fourth student from California State
University, Northridge, to be crowned Miss Deaf America, Lauren
Teruel figured to have one of those just-out-of-college resumes
that practically screams ``well-rounded individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In her final semester before graduating from CSUN with a
bachelor's degree in English, Teruel was a full-time student and
held down a full-time job at the University's National Center on
Deafness (NCOD) as an assistant grant coordinator. She also
performed as a dancer with a traveling vaudeville troupe, Defywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was on the Dean's List, first time!'' says Teruel, 22,
who has been deaf since early childhood. ``It's strange. The busier
I seem to be, the better I do academically.''
</P>
<P>
   Busy she certainly is. Teruel has talked about literacy at a
national conference and was the facilitator for a satellite class
on the topic of diversity. And she's a volunteer storyteller at the
new ``Sign Language Story Time'' program at Borders bookstore in
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   This summer was supposed to be a break for Teruel before she
would begin applying to graduate English programs in the fall.
Instead, she was crowned Miss Deaf America, an honor that will give
her a two-year reign as a national spokeswoman for the more than 28
million Americans who are deaf and partially deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``My free time is really going to be reduced,'' says Teruel, at
NCOD's offices before giving a presentation. ``While I was
preparing for the pageant, I already had some insight into what
could potentially happen if I were crowned. So I prepared myself in
case it happened. And in fact it did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   She would do well to be prepared, says the departing Miss Deaf
America, Amy Wong, who gave Teruel some friendly advice during the
months leading up to the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her it's a lot of work and a lot of responsibility, and
that she'll have to maintain a good image successfully,'' said
Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it advice, not only from a friend, CSUN alumna and
former classmate, but from someone who can truly claim to have
``been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong, who has been deaf since infancy, completed her reign as
Miss Deaf America 1998-2000 in July. During the past two years she
has traveled all over the country, giving speeches and appearing at
festivals, graduations and awards presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in four languages, including American Sign Language, Wong
has studied classical ballet and competed in horseback riding
competitions. Since graduating in December with a degree in fine
arts, Wong has worked in the feature animation department of Disney
Studios. Last summer, she was one of only 15 people from across the
nation to land a paid internship at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   So, like Teruel, Wong simply goes from being busy to being
busier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel, as a deaf person, you always have to work harder than
people who have normal hearing,'' says Wong, 23. ``But that does
not give us excuses. I believe that no matter what, you have to
work hard.'' &QL;

&HT;     ALL EYES ON DIXIE UNION AT MIDSUMMER DEBRY

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Dick Mandella has been a thoroughbred
horse trainer since 1974. In all those years he had never entered a
horse to run in the prestigious and tradition-soaked Travers
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And when Mandella makes his maiden Travers voyage Saturday, he
won't have just any horse. He will have the horse many think will
win the 131st running of the Midsummer Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella's Dixie Union was installed as the 5-2 morning-line
favorite at Thursday morning's draw, which was held at the At The
Rail Pavilion in Saratoga Springs. Mandella, whose home base is in
California, has been in Saratoga with Dixie Union since the colt
won the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being the favorite,'' Mandella said after the draw. ``I
wish all the other horses weren't here. I would just as soon be
able to have him gallop around the track by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he won't get that wish. Eight other colts will test Dixie
Union in what many think is a wide-open race.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brew, who was third in the Haskell, has been made the
3-1 second choice and Unshaded, the third-place finisher in the Jim
Dandy, is third choice at 7-2. Also in the field are Curule (6-1),
Albert the Great (8-1), Postponed (8-1), Commendable (12-1),
Impeachment (12-1) and Country Coast (30-1).
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union earned the favorite's status after the impressive
score in the Haskell. He is the only colt in the Travers field who
is coming into this race off a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella had hoped Dixie Union would be a force in the Triple
Crown this past spring but a knee injury forced him to skip the
Classics. Now it appears he is attempting to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a small chance we could have made it to the Triple
Crown but not a good one,'' Mandella said. ``You always have to
worry when you stop on them and work on an ailment. You don't know
if they will come back the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union has been first or second in all four of his starts
thisyear and one of his losses came by a neck. He has six wins in
his career; no one else in the field has more than four.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one else in the field is going to ship the Travers
Trophy to the stakes barn, where Mandella and Dixie Union have been
holed up the last few weeks. There are those in here that think
they have more than a big chance.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Nafzger, the trainer of Unshaded, is confident after seeing
his colt finish third in the Jim Dandy. Scotty Schulhofer will
saddle Postponed (fourth in the Jim Dandy). Earlier in the month,
Schulhofer had said he was not going to run in the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   However, after reassessing the Jim Dandy, he changed his mind.
It also didn't hurt that Preakness winner Red Bullet and Jim Dandy
winner Graeme Hall are going to sit this race out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out of the Jim Dandy in good order,'' Schulhofer said.
``Some of those defections helped make our decision. I think this
is a wide-open race and I hope that he is the best horse. I think
he should run really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito, who trains Albert the Great, and Todd Pletcher, the
conditioner of Impeachment, make the same types of comments. The
only true outsider in the field would appear to be Country Coast,
who comes into this off a second-place finish in an allowance race.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Amoss, Country Coast's trainer, wasn't thinking Travers
Thursday morning. When the draw for the race was being held, he was
said to be fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The main speed horse in the field is Albert the Great, who had
won four straight races before falling apart and finishing last in
the Jim Dandy. He drew the nine hole and will start from the far
outside.
</P>
<P>
   That led to speculation that Zito would have to gun the colt
straight to the lead to avoid being strung out wide on the first
turn. Zito was not at the draw but said later that was not
necessarily what he is going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to do anything,'' Zito said. ``This is America,
isn't it? This isn't a totalitarian government, is it? No, I really
don't know about the post. We'll just have to see what happens. Who
knows? It could hurt him.''

   LOBBY-AROMATHERAPY (New York) _ What does the lobby of your
building smell like? Disinfectant? Wet dog? If you're one of the
purchasers of multimillion-dollar apartments in the Loft SoHo
building opening here in the fall, expect ylang-ylang and rose oil.
The idea was subtly to affect the mood of Lenny Kravitz and the
other extremely well-heeled residents, who will soon be closing on
apartments where aromatherapy hits them when they walk through the
door. The scents will change with the time of day and the season.
By Jennifer Steinhauer.

</P>
<P>
   JOURNALISM-CHIC (Undated) _ Is the Fifth Estate experiencing a
rehabilitation? NBC has a new fall series called ``Deadline,''
about a dapper columnist who solves crimes in his spare time.
Cameron Crowe, in his movie ``Almost Famous,'' opening Sept. 15,
recounts his days as a 15-year-old Rolling Stone writer during an
era when rock journalists could still pretend to be almost as cool
as their subjects. And in the pipeline, there's ``Serendipity,''
which began filming in New York last week, and may be the first
movie in which the dramatis personae include an obituary writer for
The New York Times. Not since Hoffman and Redford played a
better-looking Woodward and Bernstein has the profession been made
to look so cool. By Rick Marin.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   GAP-NEWLOOK (Undated) _ Filtering into Gap stores since
mid-July, when the chain sold off the last of its summer cargo
shorts, are lace-bordered tank tops, filmy skirts and leathers in
hothouse hues of carmine, pink and mauve. Clearly these
trend-driven looks were intended by the retailer to shake up
shoppers lulled into a torpor by last year's surfeit of khakis,
cargo pants and polo shirts. By Ruth La Ferla.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-JOAN-JETT (New York) _ Nite out with Joan Jett, the
goddess of tight-leathered '80s rock, and a New York Liberty
fanatic. By Douglas Century.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Many a gardener grows coral bells, but
only a few do for the sake of their flowers. Not that coral bells
don't have lovely flowers. They do. They send up spikes covered
with small bell-shaped blossoms in colors from pure white to
purple-scarlet. The flowers, bobbing atop stems so slender they are
almost invisible, look as if they are floating above the plant, not
tethered to it at all. What's more, coral bells have an
extraordinarily long season of bloom for perennials. By Cass
Peterson.

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Watching these 16 idiots whittle themselves down to one
tiki-torch-bearing winner is going to be great lazy-mind summer
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   _ My take on ``Survivor'' after the first episode aired.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to my fellow ``Survivor'' viewers: Our addiction to the
best game show since ``Beat the Clock'' does not end with Richard's
surprise triumph.
</P>
<P>
   I know we have the ``Survivor'' book, the ``Survivor'' board
game, the four finalists doing a ``Got Milk?'' ad campaign, all the
contestants doing a special ``Top 10'' list for Letterman, Sean's
acting career, Richard's radio gig, the second season and maybe
Jenna posing for Playboy to look forward to, but that's not enough,
is it?
</P>
<P>
   So here's what CBS should do. Load all 16 ``Survivor'' stalwarts
onto a bus, take 'em to the ``Big Brother'' house, kick out those
boring losers and lock in Rudy, Richard, Susan, Kelly and Co. for
the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   To further spice it up, let Jordan the stripper from ``Big
Brother'' come back to the compound and do that trampoline routine
we were promised but never got to see.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine the possible dramas that could unfold if the
``Survivor'' gang took over that house?
</P>
<P>
   Crusty old Rudy would finally snap at Machiavellian Richard and
would enlist Susan to help him re-enact a scene out of ``A Few Good
Men'' _ a code red-type of hazing ritual on a nude-and-sleeping
Rich as the night vision cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen and Greg would be like Sandy and Danny in ``Grease,''
reunited after a near-romance bloomed at the beach. (``He got
friendly, holding my hand'' _ ``Well she got friendly down in the
sand!'')
</P>
<P>
   Sonja could torture everyone with a nightly ukulele jam session.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Stacey Stillman, last seen snarling at Susan, ``You
switched your vote!'' as her torch was being extinguished, could
settle the score with her double-crossing former pal.
</P>
<P>
   They've got a pool, so the curiously incompetent YMCA coach
Gervase could learn to swim.
</P>
<P>
   It would be magic, my friends. Start that e-mail campaign to CBS
president Les Moonves immediately.
</P>
<P>
   I'll not apologize for buying into the ``Survivor'' hype. What,
we should yearn for the golden days of summer TV when reruns, bad
variety shows and moldy pilot episodes ruled the airwaves?
</P>
<P>
   Of course ``Survivor'' is an exploitative exercise in national
voyeurism _ but it's also a brilliantly conceived, flawlessly
executed petri dish, a masterpiece of casting and editing that
reveals much about who we are and how we live at the outset of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The petty bickering, the manipulative machinations, the
flirtations, the tears, the bitching about who's carrying the
workload, the high-fiving moments of triumph, the silly fits of
laughter _ all these vignettes are reminiscent of what takes place
in any work environment, or among any extended group of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or within any family, come to think of it.
</P>
<P>
   I think most of us figured ``Survivor'' would be a blend of
``The Real World'' and one of those extreme sports shows. We'd see
impressive physical specimens climbing trees and hunting wild boar
and swimming with sharks as they competed with one another but also
worked together to make it through another challenging day on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Well. There was a little bit of that, but we also had fat naked
guy Rich and vomiting layabout Ramona and shaved-chest Sean and
lazy-ass Gervase and trash-talking Susan and Bible-thumping Dirk
and cute little Colleen and crabby old Rudy, who's just this side
of John Rocker with some of his cracks. (In the latest Newsweek,
which has the four finalists on the cover instead of the Democratic
National Convention or the Russian submarine, Rudy says,
``Personally, I don't hang around lesbians, queers, hippies,
doctors and lawyers ...'')
</P>
<P>
   These people aren't triathletes, they're the descendants of the
castaways on ``Gilligan's Island'' crossed with the cast of ``Days
of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than three months, consider the catch phrases and quotes
from ``Survivor'' that have wormed their way into the national
lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Immunity challenge. ``I liked him before I knew he was a
queer.'' Tribal council. ``Women are the stupidest thing on the
planet next to cows.'' The alliance. ``On the island, fire is a
sign of life.'' Pagong and Tagi. ``The tribe has spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you hated the show or never tuned in, you cannot deny
its impact on the popular culture. Some day, all the retrospectives
and books chronicling the '00s will include ``Survivor'' as one of
the first major pop events of the decade. God knows where we go
from here.

 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN  
 c.2000 Michael Kimmelman  
 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to talk seriously about the painter Bridget Riley,
then let's dispose of Twiggy and Mary Quant and the whole '60s Op
Art craze. Thirty-five years ago, Riley was the That Girl of
contemporary painting. Her suave, buzzing, high-octane
black-and-white abstractions woke up sleepy English art and caused
a transcontinental sensation. Her first show in New York sold out
before it opened. But some kinds of success are deadly, or at least
they could be in the days before celebrity at any price was
considered the same as ambition.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Riley was in a car on her way from the airport
to the Museum of Modern Art, where she was one of the stars of a
big multi-artist survey. As she drove up Madison Avenue, she saw _
in one store window after another _ dresses by a variety of makers
whose designs were lifted from her paintings. ``The whole thing had
spread everywhere even before I touched down at the airport,'' she
recalled years later.
</P>
<P>
   She was horrified and tried to sue _ never mind that the dresses
looked awful. Fame turned to fad. The show was a mess. Americans
lumped her with artists whose paintings were one-note eye-teasing
stunts. Op enjoyed its 15 minutes as a gimmick hitched to
psychedelia, Carnaby Street and groovy wallpaper before dropping
into oblivion. ``It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks
at my paintings seriously again,'' Riley predicted.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 30, in America at least. But now abstract art
is accepted in art's inner circles again. The art of the '60s is
being mined, and Riley has become a touchstone to an eclectic
generation that includes Damien Hirst, Diana Thater, Julian Opie
and Rachel Whiteread. Even if they don't relate to her old-style
Modernist ideals for pure abstraction, they can't help
acknowledging her intelligence, style, perseverance and moral
rectitude, which manifests itself in the astringency of her art.
Besides, the work looks great.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been rapid. Two years ago, a modest overview of
her career, in the out-of-the-way Lake District, got raves in the
London papers. Then last year, a London exhibition of her '60s and
'70s pictures at the Serpentine Gallery surprised even her,
attracting 130,000 people, the most ever for a show there, with
lines literally out the door. Now, the Dia Center in New York is
opening a show next month of her pre-1984 work, while the
PaceWildenstein Gallery surveys her work since the early '80s and
presents a group of '60s drawings. At 69, Riley is finally
receiving her long-deserved second look.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking
very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she
keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She
is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice.
</P>
<P>
   Her character was focused during childhood. A distant descendant
of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she
describes as ``not badly off but not wealthy, either.'' She spent
the war in a primitive cottage near the coast in Cornwall with her
mother, sister and aunt, a household of women. Her aunt had studied
art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for
Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several
fortunes, was ``very visually aware,'' she says. During the war
years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the
countryside in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about different light effects and the intricate
characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not
focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence: Riley's father, a
British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced
labor on the Siamese railway but, like many war prisoners, took a
while to readapt to family life. ``He had learned to live in a
self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomena hunting,'' as she has called her intense encounters
with nature, became for her a form of constructive distraction. To
look very closely at a certain thing, after all, means you are also
looking away from something else. This is one way, at least, of
explaining what separates her work from shallow, gimmicky Op and
gives it its intensity. Her abstract patterns, mesmerizing, are
similarly expressions of psychological displacement. Their
eye-riveting quality makes them like self-contained and beneficent
universes, independent from, and overwhelming of, what's around
them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she
studied for three frustrating years, getting no guidance from the
old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but
not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at
the London art scene _ small, male, conservative and insular _
which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art
school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Her parents
resettled in London, where it was easier for him to get around, in
the Kensington town house that Riley now occupies. Riley helped
nurse her father for a year, and the combined stress of that
commitment and trying to become a painter caused a nervous
breakdown. Briefly hospitalized, she fell into a job at the J.
Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1958, she went to a Pollock show in London that, she
says, ``made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear
that modern art was alive and I had something to react to.'' The
next year, she began
</P>
<P>
   an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older
painter and innovative teacher whose deep interests in Klee,
Cezanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it
was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance in
her work. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of
dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark to the effect that
you find what you love only by first giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrongly attached to this person, who knew a lot more than
me, everything that I had experienced with him, which was the
history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when
I'd lost him, I'd lost that,'' she says. ``I decided to paint one
last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small
voice still in me, which looked at the painting and said: 'This
doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I
put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the
other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not
touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of
light. That was 'Kiss.' It seemed good. And so I told myself,
'O.K., just one more painting.' I was off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss'' led to the early black-and-white Op works, like
``Movement in Squares'' (1961), a flat checkerboard that seems to
collapse or fold into depth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Riley got a serendipitous boost. Still working part
time at the ad agency, she was dodging a downpour on the way home
from the office one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to
be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in,
offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her
first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something
English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   That first show was in 1961. Three years later, her fame at its
peak, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to
London. The Dia show is the first museum exhibition in New York
since the Modern's survey, 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Riley's six-story all-white Kensington house, four of the six
stories are studios that Riley uses for different purposes. The
place is clean, efficient, unpretentious. Riley also has houses
with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow
in the East End, a loft, with adjacent apartments she uses for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's life is her work. She has never married. She has no
children. A few of Riley's latest pictures are here: vividly
colored multipanel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves
that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked
constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each
style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal
but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s she realized that the effects she achieved in
black and white already implied colors, as black and white can do.
From simple patterned stripes in basic colors like red and blue,
she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colors, which she
found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early '80s now)
to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by
a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient
Egyptians, using just a few colors, had conveyed the effect of what
she has called the ``light-mirroring desert.''
</P>
<P>
   The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated
arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and
parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works,
still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and
diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less
dizzying planes of interlocking colors.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has always hated when people say her works are hard on the
eyes or create optical illusions, because that's not her point, and
because it implies that they're just tricks _ once seen, no longer
interesting. As she has said, ``Illusion used in that sense is a
kind of cheat or deceit.'' But even so, her art can be tough to
look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up.
With a classic stripe painting like ``Apres-Midi'' (1981), the
stripes seem magically to unfold, like an accordion, into depth.
Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the
image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at
irregular intervals. The effect is syncopated. No wonder Riley
relates her art to music.
</P>
<P>
   The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is
about as good as traditional abstract painting gets these days. The
two most obvious qualities of Riley's art, like her life, are
control and self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '60s, assistants have carried out her pictures
based on her preparatory drawings or, in recent years, on the works
she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This
is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for
centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now
being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and
strange.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't quite true that Riley dropped off the map after Op went
the way of the Hula-Hoop. America, nationalistically myopic, mostly
stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and
Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing
to sell through the mid-'70s. She remained a formidable presence in
English art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting
prize at the Venice Biennale, where she represented Great Britain,
a huge honor at the time. Still, it was becoming more difficult for
her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called
London School of figurative painters, men like Bacon, Freud and
R.B. Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally
with contemporary English art.
</P>
<P>
   She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an
abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to
accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't
abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her
guns and stood toe to toe with the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I was protected by being a woman,'' she
acknowledges. ``I was granted independence, freedom, and I didn't
have to get involved in the ambitions and problems that involved
other artists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, you could buy a classic '60s Riley drawing at
Christie's East in New York for $1,500 and a '60s painting for
$20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000.
The funny thing about Riley's up-and-down status is that it has
always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the '60s, it
was that she had to do with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now,
it's postfeminism, postmodernism and '60s retro chic.
</P>
<P>
   When the new Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room
to Riley, another clear sign of changed times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets
the upper hand it spells a vacuum,'' she says. ``During the periods
of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or
distractions. I have never wanted celebrity, but I do want
recognition, fair and just, not praise. I believe the work will
communicate. We'll see. I am getting older.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Sorlien, a lean, sunburned fisherman in rubber overalls,
was loading his boat along the wharf at Point Judith, R.I., not far
from the spot where the ``Tuna Capital of the World'' sign stood
three decades ago. Back then, you could harpoon giant bluefins
right outside the harbor. Today, you would have a hard time finding
one within 20 miles. Since the early 1970s, the tuna have declined
_ along with cod, swordfish, halibut and so many other species in
the ruined fisheries of the Northeast. Sorlien, like the other
fishermen in this harbor just west of Newport, is surviving thanks
to New England's great cash crop, lobsters, but he wonders how much
longer they'll be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my only incentive is to go out and kill as many
fish as I can,'' Sorlien said. ``I have no incentive to conserve
the fishery, because any fish I leave is just going to be picked by
the next guy.'' Like the men who wiped out the buffaloes on the
Great Plains in the 19th century, Sorlien is a hunter-gatherer who
has become too lethal for his range. He is what's known in the
business as a highliner _ a fisherman who comes back with big hauls
_ but every season the competition gets tougher.
</P>
<P>
   When he got started 16 years ago, at the age of 22, he used a
small boat and set traps within three miles of shore. These days,
he doesn't even bother looking in those waters, which fishermen now
refer to as ``on the beach.'' He has graduated to a 42-foot boat
and often goes 70 miles out to sea for lobsters, which can mean
leaving the dock at midnight and not returning until 10 the
following night. Each year, he has had to go farther and haul more
traps just to stay even.
</P>
<P>
   Solien was starting the season on this May morning by loading
hundreds of the traps onto his boat, the Cindy Diane. The
four-foot-long steel cages, each baited with a dangling skate fish,
would spend the next eight months at sea. Sorlien would be tending
800 of them in all. On a typical day, he would haul 300, sometimes
400, up from the ocean floor to remove lobsters and insert fresh
bait. As he stacked one 40-pound trap after another on deck, it was
easy to see why he and so many other lobstermen have back problems.
``My chiropractor says he can always tell when it's lobster
season,'' Sorlien said.
</P>
<P>
   The chiropractor is treating the consequence of what fishery
scientists call ``effort creep.'' Over the years, as Sorlien got a
bigger boat and gradually doubled the number of his traps in the
water, other lobstermen were doing the same. It was an arms race
with no winners and some definite losers: the lobsters. Their life
expectancy plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lobsters used to live for 50 or 75 years,'' recalled Robert
Smith, who has been lobstering at Point Judith since 1948. ``When I
started, it was not unusual to get a 30-pound lobster. It's been 20
years since I got one that was even 20 pounds.'' Last year, the
biggest one he caught was four pounds, and that was an anomaly.
Most lobsters don't even make it to two pounds. Biologists estimate
that 90 percent of lobsters are caught within a year after they
reach the legal minimum size at about age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious remedy would be to restrict the amount of fishing
going on, as lobstermen have traditionally done in some
communities. They have created informal local groups _ called
harbor gangs by anthropologists _ in which they divvy up the nearby
seabed, determining who can fish where, how long the season will be
and how many traps each man can use.
</P>
<P>
   The harbor gangs are built around the management principles of
Tony Soprano. If a fishing trawler drags a net through their
waters, destroying their traps, the lobstermen may dump an old car
onto the seabed, which will rip the trawler's net the next time
it's dragged. If an outside lobsterman intrudes, he might find that
someone has removed his lobsters and left the traps conspicuously
open or maybe applied a chain saw to the steel cages. If he doesn't
take the hint, his boat might be burned or sunk.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactics generally work only in waters close to the
gang's home. The open ocean is harder to defend. Most stretches of
open ocean are governed by state and federal governments, which is
why the fish are in so much trouble. Tuna do not vote. Lobsters do
not make campaign contributions. There may be future benefits from
limiting this year's catch, but politicians don't want the fishing
industry to suffer while they're up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Even when fish populations start to decline, officials are
reluctant to impose strict limits. Instead, they have often tried
to help struggling fishermen with subsidies, which merely encourage
more overfishing. The Canadian and American governments devastated
one of the world's most productive fisheries, the Georges Banks off
the coast of New England, by helping to pay for bigger boats. Now,
even as scientists urge limits on lobstering, state and federal
governments continue to offer tax breaks and other incentives to
the lobstermen at Point Judith.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Allen, a member of the Rhode Island Lobsterman's
Association, has been lobstering for nearly 30 years and preaching
reform for a decade. He journeyed to a port in Australia and
returned with stories of a place with thriving lobsters, plenty of
fat tuna, lots of prosperous fishermen _ and no Soprano strong-arm
tactics. It sounded like the maritime version of the Happy Hunting
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing has been very good to Port Lincoln, a little fishing
town on a remote peninsula of Australia's southern coast. The
fishermen have gleaming $600,000 boats in a pristine private marina
flanked by new white stucco town houses. Compared with the decaying
public wharfs in Point Judith, Port Lincoln feels like Palm Beach.
The town's 13,000 inhabitants are said to include the highest
number of millionaires per capita in the southern hemisphere. That,
at least, is a factoid you keep hearing there.
</P>
<P>
   Lobstering is an excellent job here thanks to a system of quotas
that was pioneered in Australia and New Zealand. It is basically a
version of the New England harbor gangs, run by the lobstermen
under government supervision. The government started it in the
1960s by setting a limit on the total number of traps used by the
fleet in Port Lincoln. Licenses for those traps were assigned to
the working fishermen, and from then on, any newcomer who wanted to
set a trap in those waters had to buy a license from someone
already in the business. It's like New York's taxicab system, which
has a fixed number of taxi licenses or ``medallions'': A newcomer
who wants to own a cab must buy a medallion from someone who is
retiring. One lobsterman, Daryl Spencer, bought his first trap
licenses in 1984 for $2,000 apiece in Australian dollars. Nowadays,
they would sell for $35,000, which means that Spencer's are worth a
total of $2.1 million, or about $1.2 million in American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians are not any more altruistic than the Rhode
Islanders _ they too have mortgages to pay _ and in the old days
they used to howl when anyone suggested reducing their catch. But
they began taking the long view as soon as they saw the rising
price of their licenses for their lobster pots, as they call the
traps. Like any property owner, they began thinking about resale
value. ``Why hurt the fishery?'' Spencer said. ``It's my retirement
fund. No one's going to pay me $35,000 a pot if there are no
lobsters left. If I rape and pillage the fishery now, in 10 years
my licenses won't be worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides building up nest eggs, Port Lincoln's lobstermen have
made their own jobs easier. While Rhode Island lobstermen are
sometimes on the water 240 days per year, the Australians are not
allowed to work more than 187 days of their 211-day season. And
their days are a lot easier on the back, as a young lobsterman,
Hubert Hurrell, demonstrated one March morning in his appropriately
named boat, Fine Time.
</P>
<P>
   Hurrell and I left the dock at 7:30 a.m. and sped out to his
traps in barely an hour, cruising at 22 knots in his 60-foot boat.
The wheelhouse and staterooms had the space and amenities you
expect to find on yachts, not lobster boats. There was a television
and VCR, a video-game player and a wraparound console with six
screens showing data from computers, instruments and satellites.
Hurrell shook his head and winced when he heard about the 800 traps
tended by the typical lobsterman in Rhode Island. In Port Lincoln,
the lobstermen have limited themselves to 60 traps each. It took
Hurrell and his deckhand just an hour to raise their 60 traps and
to extract an assortment of lobsters, including some hefty
long-lived ones. After a leisurely lunch, they dropped the traps
back into the water and were back on shore by 3. It was not quite
an eight-hour day, and Hurrell was satisfied with the financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``No worries, mate,'' he said, which was not a bad summary of
the prevailing view among the scientists who study the lobsters.
``Fishing may be the only economic activity in which you can make
more money by doing less work,'' said Rick McGarvey, a biologist
who monitors the fishery for the South Australian government. ``By
fishing less, the fishermen leave more lobsters out there to
produce more eggs, which will make it easier for them to catch
lobsters in the future. It's a win-win for the fish and the
fishermen. The lobsters are thriving and the fishermen are spending
more time at home with their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also makes McGarvey's job easier because he is spared
the controversies that American scientists endure when they try to
protect a fishery. In New England, a proposed conservation measure
typically inspires a decade of battling that leads, at best, to an
ineffectual compromise. In South Australia, the lobstermen act
quickly to prevent overfishing, sometimes imposing stricter limits
than the ones suggested by scientists. ``We don't have to fight
with the lobstermen,'' McGarvey said. ``The old philosophy of
fishery scientists was, 'We're philosopher kings and the fishermen
are children who don't know what's good for themselves or the fish,
so we have to impose regulations.' Now we just tell them what our
research shows about the fishery, and they do a great job of
regulating themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have documented similar success stories around
the world, including many from traditional societies that have used
property rights to protect the environment. In the South Pacific,
where coral reefs have been destroyed by fishermen using dynamite
and cyanide, the best-preserved reefs are the ones controlled by
local villagers and closed off to outsiders. Japanese fishing
villages have long prevented overfishing in local waters by using
versions of harbor gangs. Louisiana's privately leased oyster beds
are much healthier than the public ones in Mississippi. These
results have won over most academic experts on fisheries. Last
year, Australian-style quotas were endorsed in a report to Congress
by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences. Property rights enable fishermen to avoid what ecologists
call the tragedy of the commons: the destruction of a common
resource because it is open to all. Just as the closely tended
herds of cattle thrived on the same plains where the buffaloes
perished, fish stand a better chance of surviving if they belong to
someone instead of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But there are, of course, a few political problems in persuading
hunter-gatherers to become homesteaders. The biggest is how to
divide up the range. Do you allocate the quotas and licenses
equally among all working fishermen or according to how many fish
each has been catching ? Do you calculate each one's catch by
considering the past year or the past 10 years? Do locals get first
dibs on fishing rights?
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the U.S. government successfully introduced
Australia-style quotas in a few fisheries. But then Alaska's
politicians got worried that fishermen from Seattle would end up
with most of the quotas in their waters, so in 1996 they persuaded
Congress to declare a national moratorium on any new quotas. The
moratorium could end soon, which gives hope to Richard Allen, the
Rhode Island lobsterman who has been preaching the Port Lincoln
gospel. ``Most people start with the feeling that the ocean should
be open to anyone who wants to fish,'' Allen said. ``They complain
that it's unfair to lock anyone out of the fishery. My answer is
that with the current system, we already have fisheries that we're
all locked out of. I can't go out and fish for halibut or swordfish
_ there aren't any left. I would rather have a healthy fish stock
and the option to buy access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has been gradually winning converts on the wharfs in Point
Judith, but it hasn't been easy. ``We're our own worst enemy,''
Sorlien said. ``We're like the cattlemen in the range wars who shot
at each other because they were claiming the right to the same
property. Somewhere along the line, they figured out it made more
sense to divide up the land and set up a system of property rights.
That's the rational solution for us, but we can't bring ourselves
to go through the pain of allocating each person a share. We're so
far away from being South Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that _ just 60 traps,'' Sorlien said. He had been
working for six hours, since 5:30 a.m., and the workday wasn't even
half over. ``You'd be done for the day now. You could be home
counting your money, and you wouldn't have to worry about where the
next lobster was coming from.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are various ways to meet celebrities in this media age,
many of them involving publicists looking at their watches and
saying that the Musician or the Actor has been unavoidably delayed.
So it is a little surprising to be greeted promptly at the airport
in Cleveland (Cleveland itself being a departure from standard
practice) by the slight, smiling figure of the jazz singer Jimmy
Scott. He is holding up a cardboard sign with my last name inked in
as if he is an especially cheerful limo driver charged with taking
me to see somebody really important. ``Hey, baby,'' he greets me,
``how was the trip?''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Scott's first and only bona fide hit, the ballad
``Everybody's Somebody's Fool,'' was recorded in 1950, you wouldn't
expect him to be overburdened with the trappings of success. Still,
ever since a quartet of albums in the '90s, Scott has held a
special fascination for music cognoscenti and show-business
notables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Scott is the only singer who makes me cry,'' says
Madonna, who gave him a cameo spot in one of her videos. Lou Reed
had Scott sing backup vocals on a track from his 1991 ``Magic and
Loss'' album. He may well have put the Scott genuflection
competition out of reach: ``It's like seeing Hamlet or Macbeth all
rolled up into a song.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lou Reeds and Madonnas of this world are presumably
attracted to Scott because he remains, in spite of their pro bono
publicity, perhaps the most unjustly ignored American singer of the
20th century. But the appeal of the man David Lynch featured in the
final episode of ``Twin Peaks'' is also about something else. At
worst, Scott's newer fans are drawn to a superficial freakishness,
the voice that is pitched well up in the conventionally female
range and the hairless face, for decades perpetually boyish, that
in recent years has taken on the noble, withered aspect of a
tortoise. At best, one could imagine certain show-business types,
aware of the smoke and mirrors that go into their own
celebrityhood, simply wanting to be in the presence of the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The humble limo driver guise notwithstanding, these are
thrilling make-or-break days in the career of James Victor Scott,
now 75. If in the '90s he went from presumed-dead status to musical
cult figure and celebrity pet, at the millennium he has a shot at
becoming, well, who knows, something more. The most compelling
evidence of a Scott renaissance is ``Mood Indigo,'' released in
May, a collection of ballad standards that finds the singer in his
best voice of recent vintage and in the company of worthy
supporting musicians like the alto saxophonist Hank Crawford and
the pianist Cyrus Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Scott, for perhaps the first time in his
long, harum-scarum career, has empathetic and competent management
behind him, as well as an enthusiastic, if modest-sized, new record
label in Milestone. Todd Barkan, a respected jazz producer, has
worked his longtime connections in the Japanese jazz world to help
create for Scott a nascent Far Eastern stardom _ steady touring
punctuated by regular standing ovations. Having just finished a
sold-out engagement at Birdland in Manhattan earlier this month,
it's clear the singer is on a roll at home as well.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Scott doesn't just play the part of a limo
driver; he also comes armed with a real limo, his boatlike 1992
Lincoln Town Car. Scott's license has lapsed, so he hands over the
keys to his younger brother, Kenny, a retired factory worker whom
the singer recently put on the payroll as his right-hand man. Kenny
and I take the front seat; Jimmy prefers the back, where he can
keep up a steady conversational patter and dandle Princess, a
2-year-old pug with bulging black eyes. ``She's the lady of the
house,'' Scott says. A veteran of four failed, turbulent marriages,
Scott these days reserves his most effusive attentions for
Princess. ``She likes the music on the radio. She gets so
comforted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Scott speaks, unstoppably, in a high-pitched voice,
roughened and phlegmy after a lifetime of smoking and drinking,
with none of, for instance, Michael Jackson's girlish lilt. It's a
hip voice, a match for the singer's 1960-vintage street-cat rap.
Almost everyone is ``baby'' to his face, usually ``hey, baby.''
Someone not present is customarily referred to as ``a hip little
cat.'' That lingo mixes effortlessly with his core vocabulary of
show-biz abstractions: ``expressions'' (his East Coast working band
is named the Jazz Expressions), ``dramatics,'' ``stylings'' and
``flair.'' A typical Jimmy Scott pronouncement will run something
like this: ``Yeah, baby, Cleveland used to be a hip little town for
the jazz expression but then that rock 'n' roll flair came in. You
dig?''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's uniqueness goes well beyond his redoubtable verbal
flair. From birth, Scott was marked as ineluctably different,
afflicted with a hormonal disorder, Kallmann's syndrome, that
interferes with normal sexual maturation. In Scott's case, it gave
him that boy's alto voice, which is, of course, what made him Jimmy
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I learned that it was a gift,'' he says after a pause,
``that I was able to sing this way.'' Not that he always embraced
it. He was in his 30s before he gave up hope that his range would
drop, not so preposterous when you consider that Scott was then
still routinely being mistaken for a teenager. ``Many times,'' he
says with a laugh, ``I'd think, I'd love to try this in a lower
register ... but then after a while you think, Sing with what you
got.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been enough. Over the years, Scott has invented his own
deeply theatrical brand of American art song, the connection to his
own emotional pain so palpable that the lachrymose standards in his
repertory (``Why Was I Born?'' ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless
Child,'' ``When Did You Leave Heaven'') sound like episodes in an
autobiographical melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the male voice in the higher registers has always
exerted its own special pull. Think of the all-boy choirs, of Irish
tenors and, disconcertingly, of the castrati in the 16th through
18th centuries in Italy. Jimmy Scott is, vocally, a natural
castrato. In the 1960s, at the height of his vocal powers, Scott
possessed what was arguably the most ravishing, penetrating and
powerful vocal instrument in American popular music. In every other
respect, Kallmann's syndrome was an unqualified drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today,'' Scott says, ``cats in the grocery store say,
'Miss, what do you want?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Scott, gender or sexual ambiguity is what's in other
people's minds. He's a heterosexual male; he's pretty clear about
that. But whether he likes it or not, Scott's sound and his look
strike the gender notes in between the piano keys, the discordantly
interesting ones.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Scott began his career in the early '40s as a teen-age
singing prodigy from the Cleveland ghetto. Soon enough, he was
snapped up by Estelle Young, a shake dancer and contortionist, who
led her troupe through the second-tier clubs and theaters of the
African-American Midwest, a training circuit of sorts for more
prestigious ``chitlin' circuit'' venues like the Apollo Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He moved on to the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and then won a
contract with Savoy, but was never able to break beyond his core
audience in the black community who caught his act in the little
clubs. By 1962, then in his late 30s, he had broken with Savoy and
was adrift in the business. Ray Charles, always a passionate fan,
signed him to his new Tangerine label. The record that Charles
produced and played piano on, ``Falling in Love Is Wonderful,'' is
by critical accord Scott's finest, but it stayed on the shelves
only a matter of weeks before Herman Lubinsky, the owner of Savoy,
claimed an exclusive contract with Scott, and the record was
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put that Tangerine record on,'' recalls the record
producer Joel Dorn, then a Philadelphia D.J., ``the phones just lit
up. Everybody was asking, 'What's her name?''' (``Falling in Love
Is Wonderful'' has never been rereleased; LPs from the original
pressing are among the most sought-after, and expensive, on the
jazz collector's market.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Dorn, by now a successful producer at Atlantic, teamed
up with Scott to make ``The Source,'' his first album since
``Falling in Love Is Wonderful,'' but Lubinsky moved in again, and
the album never went beyond a first pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle proved too much for Scott, and in the early '70s he
packed in the singing career and returned to Cleveland. Over the
next 13 years, he worked as an aide at a nursing home and as a
shipping clerk at the Cleveland Sheraton. ``When the gig ain't
there, you still got to pay the rent,'' Scott says with an
unembarrassed smile. ``I learned that a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's comeback began in 1984 when a friend from his East Coast
days, Earlene Rogers, called up the jazz station WBGO in Newark,
N.J., to ask why Scott, an ex-local hero, was never on the radio.
They told her he was dead. Persuaded otherwise, the station invited
him to appear on an afternoon talk show, an experience that so
energized Scott that he moved back to Newark, wound up making
Rogers wife No. 4 and resumed his career full time. But he was, in
the main, singing in the same joints and dives that had demoralized
him the first time around. One of his closest friends, the eminent
songwriter Doc Pomus, even published an open letter in Billboard
beseeching the industry to take note of Scott before it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   It would take Pomus's death in 1991 to turn things around. Scott
sang at the funeral, overwhelming Seymour Stein, the legendarily
tough record executive, which led to the album ``All the Way.''
Scott remembers: ``The next day, this cat from Warners comes over
with a contract. It was like Doc's hand reaching out from the
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's compact living room is dominated by a white piano
(ornamental _ he doesn't play) and a large white teddy bear. It
makes for an interesting place to talk about the death of his
mother, the original source of the seemingly bottomless well of
pain he draws on in his work. Scott was 13 when she stepped into a
Cleveland street to pull her daughter Shirley out of harm's way.
Justine Scott, mother of 10, was struck by a car and died of
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's adolescence was marked not only by the overwhelming
thing that did happen, his mother's death, but also by the one that
didn't, puberty. When he was young, shame and secrecy were constant
companions. (He is capable of sex, incapable of reproduction.)
Today he deals with the syndrome with admirable, even surprising
candor. His attitude with women is this: ``I'm not looking for
sympathy. This is me. I come to you honestly and fairly, and if
there's anything you want to know about me, I'm here to explain it.
And if we have a relationship, then we have a relationship. If we
don't, then yes ma'am, howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jimmy Scott has the energy of youth without its
distracting, in his case even disastrous, passions. He is locked in
on the career. ``He is mentally prepared for this now,'' says
Maxine Harvard, Scott's new manager and a jazz industry veteran.
Hardly a disinterested party, Harvard is nonetheless blunt in her
assessment of Scott's moment on the verge. ``I have told him that
if I see him self-destructing with drinks or anything else, then
I'm gone,'' she says. ``There are probably five years there.'' For
his part, Scott indicates he's ready to do what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps his time has finally come. In the '60s, the
corporate labels were so leery of Scott's unusualness that they
replaced him on the album covers of ``The Source'' and ``Falling in
Love Is Wonderful'' with a pretty young woman and an amorous
couple, respectively. In the '90s, a decade infatuated with sexual
ambiguity, Scott's aging androgyny undoubtedly helped him secure
his cult status, but also threatened to keep him there. Mainstream
America has embraced some pretty odd characters (see Liberace), but
Scott has the inconvenience of being a real artist with fewer
obvious pleasures in his arsenal. With age, the voice has shed much
of its prettiness _ the tone is thinner, the vibrato can sound a
little cracked. Listening to his reprise of ``Day by Day,'' on
``Mood Indigo,'' anyone who recalls his near operatic original from
``The Source'' can be filled only with a sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time that loss is more than compensated for by
the smoke-cured timbre of his voice, by a phrasing so idiosyncratic
as to become a private language. No one sings slower or farther
behind the beat than Jimmy Scott; his long, melismatic flights
freeze conventional time.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, his performances have been magnets for
the socially dispossessed _ pimps, prostitutes, gays. Sometimes the
scene had a farcical aspect: ``These old pimps used to tell me,
'Well, I'm coming in tonight, Jimmy Scott, with four women, and you
better sing that song.''' But Scott could relate all too well to an
underlying loneliness at the social margins. ``You can understand
that from the songs I sing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps, that loneliness can be appreciated by a new
generation.

<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ As visitors navigate the waterway snaking out
of Murmansk harbor, past rusted hulls of fishing vessels and cargo
ships filled with nuclear waste, the sinking of the Russian
submarine Kursk appears less a tragic accident than a disaster
waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   As the sound heads north along the Kola Inlet, toward the
Severomorsk headquarters for the Russian navy's Northern Fleet,
15-foot concrete walls topped with barbed wire rise ominously along
the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusted military ships are behind those walls. They think we
don't know about them but we all do,'' said Nikolai Semenov, a
sailor who moonlights as a fisherman so he can feed his wife and
three children.
</P>
<P>
   The corroding carcasses of a once-proud fleet are an apt
metaphor for Russia's navy, which now can barely feed or pay its
sailors. Patrols have been cut by 70 percent and the post-Soviet
economic collapse has forced the top brass to mothball
three-fourths of the submarine fleet in this Arctic port, where
nearly all of its 400,000 people rely on the military for their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin finally acknowledged the desperate state of the navy
and other branches of the armed forces _ though not in time for the
Kursk's 118 crew members who perished. On Aug. 11, one day before
the disaster, President Vladimir Putin told a Russian Security
Council meeting it was time to reform a military in which ''pilots
don't fly and sailors barely go to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to quickly reform poses not only a danger for Russians,
as the Kursk disaster shows, but to the United States and other
NATO countries as well. Leaking reactors on scrapped ships and
submarines imperil the world's most heavily fished sea. Poorly
trained and equipped Russian crews increase the possibility of more
disasters at sea, maybe next time involving U.S. servicemen.
Experts say there are risks of poorly-supervised or
badly-maintained Russian subs causing a collision with a U.S.
vessel in heavily-trafficked submarine channels. Likely to foot the
bill for such a catastrophe would be the U.S. taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of the navy poses a threat, not only to Russians but
(other) countries,'' said Pavel Flegenhauer, an independent
military analyst based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet leaders viewed the remote, icy Barents Sea as a strategic
lake to base enough nuclear submarines to threaten Canada and the
United States with fiery destruction from the top of the globe. The
Arctic submarine force was Moscow's insurance in case its other
nuclear forces were knocked out in the early stages of missile
exchange with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy has survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, but
the funds to sustain the strategy have not. Russia's defense budget
plummeted in the mid-1990s, with the navy receiving only a fraction
of overall military spending, according to Dmitry Litovkin, a
retired navy captain.
</P>
<P>
   Litovkin, a former submariner, said the Northern Fleet's subs
did not receive maintenance in 1999, as admirals diverted most of
their budget to a new nuclear-powered battleship, Peter the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Although the causes of the Kursk's sinking are not known,
neglect may end up topping the list. Several reports have claimed
that the submarine left port without vital batteries to power
backup air-purifying and light systems in an emergency. Russian
newspapers, citing anonymous military sources, said emergency exits
and safety equipment aboard the vessel were substandard when they
were installed in 1994, a compromise hushed up at that time with
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kursk plunged 354 feet to the bottom of the Barents
Sea, the navy had no team to save the crew or retrieve the ship.
Russia's deep-sea diving unit mainly exists on paper _ all training
had stopped and its divers had left for better-paying jobs,
Litovkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of the disaster could be equipment failure.
Regular poaching of metals and other valuable items from naval
vessels has been a chronic problem. Sailors have stolen everything
from air conditioners to silver and titanium casings to supplement
their salaries. A mid-level naval officer receives only $100 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when everyone wanted to join the service
because of the prestige. The navy also promised a free home for
your family. Instead, we waited years for our apartment and months
for our salaries. We stripped metal off ships to resell it,'' said
Alexei Bergnikov, a thick-set 36-year-old father of one and
resident of Murmansk. He left the navy in search of better pay
after serving five years in the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the military, work is hard to come by in Murmansk, a
windswept city where the sun shines just four months a year. Grim,
hand-to-mouth living here makes safety concerns secondary,
compounding the possibility of environmental catastrophe to an area
extending far beyond Russia's borders, ecologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The Kola Peninsula has 270 military and civilian nuclear
reactors on its soil, the largest concentration in the world,
according to the Norwegian environmental group Bellona. The thin
strip of land, 1,000 miles north of Moscow and only 50 miles from
Norway, borders the Barents Sea, the world's most heavily fished
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety of the 140 Russian submarines based on the peninsula have
been decommissioned but not scrapped safely, according to Alexei
Yablokov, former President Boris Yeltsin's environmental adviser.
Thirty-five of the subs still contain nuclear reactors or fuel, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has neither the money nor facilities to transfer and
store the radioactive fuel. The result is a growing stockpile of
poorly stored nuclear waste, much of it heaped in docked submarines
or boats that require constant maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''These vessels are a catastrophe waiting to happen. They are
floating Chernobyls,'' Yablokov said. ''They require constant
cooling or else there is the possibility of an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those at greatest risk are in Murmansk. The town, built at the
end of World War I, has experienced its share of close calls in
recent years: In May 1998, radio stations warned people to take
iodine tablets after a fire on a nuclear-armed submarine set off
fears of nuclear fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Those who try to raise the nuclear waste problem publicly risk
persecution. Alexander Nikitin, a former Navy captain turned
environmentalist, has spent two years in prison and five years in
court after publishing a report detailing nuclear dumping by the
Northern Fleet. After winning acquittal on charges of treason
earlier this year, the Federal Security Service, the successor
agency to the KGB, has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial constraints and environmental dangers, the
question of abolishing the navy does not figure in the Kremlin's
calculations for military reform. In fact, Putin himself views the
navy as a vehicle to reclaim Russia's superpower status.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russia's new defense strategy published this
spring, Putin wants to reduce Russia's land-based nuclear forces in
favor of the underfunded conventional forces. To keep up a
semblance of nuclear parity with the United States, Russia would
rely heavily on its submarine-based nuclear missiles, with the
Northern Fleet. This would be a continuation of the same Soviet
policy of an Arctic-focused deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Russia does not have the funds to adequately carry
out these reforms. Moreover, the strategy itself is anachronistic,
says retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral James Carroll, vice president
of the Center for Defense Information based in Washington. He
believes that both Russia and the United States are pursuing
outdated military strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should quit trying to play the Cold War and preparing for
World War III,'' he said. ``They should be talking about
cooperation'' on environmental and other issues.

   NEW DELHI, India _ Torrential monsoon rains and raging rivers
have caused the worst flooding in decades across broad swaths of
north India over the past two months, wreaking havoc in the lives
of 4 million to 5 million people. And this week, sudden violent
downpours caused piteous scenes of suffering in south India, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in an Indian Air Force rescue helicopter hovering over
the swollen Kandu River on Thursday in the southern state of Andhra
Pradesh spotted a woman in swirling, chest-high flood waters. Her
baby and young son were clinging to her.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers lowered a large bucket to her, then watched
helplessly as first the older boy, then the infant slipped through
her arms as she struggled to lift them to safety. Then she, too,
fell into the turbulent waters. All were swept away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady could not hold her sons properly, and they slipped
from the bucket,'' Adhar Sinha, the civil servant in charge of the
Cuddapah district, said in an interview Friday. ``Then the lady
also fell in the flood waters. They all drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the rains largely stopped Friday and the flood waters
slowly receded, the flooding has killed 120 people over the past
three days and left a trail of heavily damaged rice paddies,
washed-out roads and thousands of heavily damaged homes, according
to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The rains in Andhra Pradesh, which dumped almost ten inches of
water on the capital, Hyderabad, on Thursday, shocked state
officials because weather forecasts had been for only half that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just poured,'' said Randeep Sudan, an adviser to the
state's governor. ``The roads were like rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   While the deluge in Andhra Pradesh struck with sudden ferocity,
northeastern India has endured flooding since late June. From
Himachal Pradesh and Bihar into West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal
Pradesh, heavy, persistent rains have caused devastation. Assam,
already one of the wettest places on earth, has been hardest hit.
More than 300 people have died in north India from the rains,
officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the rains are not the only culprit in flooding in India and
Bangladesh. Relief officials say they believe that man-made
factors, including global warming and deforestation, have worsened
the problem in recent years. Global warming may be increasing the
snow-melt from the Himalayas that is carried into India by the
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   And the cutting of forests has increased soil erosion. That
earth has then flowed into the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, among
others, settled and raised the level of the river bottom _ and the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Embankments built to contain the rising waters have been more
easily breached as a result. The embankments also prevent the
rivers from spreading into the broad flood plains where they used
to deposit rich soil that fertilized the land. That, in turn,
deposits yet more silt on the river bottom. And when these gushing
rivers, squeezing between embankments, reach areas without
embankments, they are moving even faster and more ferociously than
before, causing massive erosion of river banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whole villages are crumbling into the rivers,'' said Patrick
Fuller, a spokesman for the International Federation of the Red
Cross in South Asia, based here in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said the Red Cross has so far raised only about a fifth
of the $3.5 million requested in an appeal two weeks ago for flood
relief in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `Oh, floods in India again,''' he said. ``It's a
perennial problem. But so many people are affected, and they have
no choice but to live in these areas. It doesn't take much to tip
people into debt. And that's a very difficult cycle to break out
of.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, over 1 million people have been affected by
flooding, but the problem has not been as serious as in 1998.

TAILHOOK CONVENTION AGAIN MARRED BY MISCONDUCT ACCUSATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story will be updated as necessary.) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy is facing a new accusation of misconduct
at the annual convention of the Tailhook Association, officials
said Friday. The accusation comes nine years after drunken
debauchery and sexual assaults at a Tailhook convention roiled the
service, leading to resignations, fines and changes in the
military's treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   A man and a woman staying at a hotel in Sparks, Nev., where the
association held its convention last weekend, reported being
verbally and physically assaulted in a hallway by a group of men
attending the convention, according to Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whom the Navy did not identify, reported the
allegation to Navy officials on Tuesday, two days after the
convention ended. The Navy's inspector general and its criminal
investigation division have begun an investigation into the
accusations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Navy official said it was not yet clear how many men
were reported to be involved, though it appeared at least some of
them were active duty officers.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation could prove particularly embarrassing for the
Navy since it restored its official recognition of the association
only eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The association, named for the steel hooks on jets that enable
them to land on aircraft carriers, is a private group based in San
Diego that acts as a sort of booster club for naval aviation and
has long been associated with the Navy and its officers corps.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy withdrew its recognition of the association following
the public furor over the group's 35th annual convention in 1991,
where 83 women, some of them in the Navy, reported being assaulted
or harassed in a Las Vegas hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The misconduct reported last week did not appear to be as
serious or widespread at that; a senior navy official said the men
in the hallway were accused of ``inappropriate physical contact''
with the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allegation could once again force the Navy to
reconsider its relationship with the association.
</P>
<P>
   When the Navy restored its recognition last January, the
secretary of the Navy, Richard Danzig, said that the association
had given its assurances that there would be no repeat of the kinds
of incidents that made Tailhook synonymous with the mistreatment of
women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Friday that Danzig would not comment on the
incident until the investigation was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Tailhook's president, Lonny K. McClung, a retired Navy captain
and pilot, expressed concern about the accusations, but said he
knew little about what was alleged to have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you it was a very successful convention,'' he said
in an interview. ``There were only two noise complaints from the
hotel.''

drunken Navy aviators groped several female officers in after-hours
parties. The incident eventually cost senior Navy officials their

   HINES-COLUMN (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ As the primeval drama of Richard

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, on a sultry August morning, Ken
Aretsky was playing golf in Southampton, N.Y., and riding high
indeed. That regrettable public unpleasantness at the ``21'' Club
was long behind him (more about that later). He was loving his life
as the doting father of two small children (more about that later,
too). And he was basking in critical accolades for having created
two successful new Manhattan restaurants, Patroon and Butterfield
81 (much, much more about that later, as well).
</P>
<P>
   That's when the phone call came: The U.S. government was
charging him with violating the Trading With the Enemy Act. Such a
transgression can be a felony punishable by 10 years in prison and
a fine of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents armed with search warrants had seized dozens of
boxes of cigars from the upstairs cigar bar of Patroon, Aretsky's
three-star restaurant at 160 E. 46th St. The next day Aretsky and
his cigar bar manager stood in federal court, accused of buying and
selling cigars made in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In a stogie-crazed city afire with aficionados overwhelmed by an
abundance of bootleg Cuban Cohibas and Montecristos, cigar
worshipers bristled at the news.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, cigarophiles loudly contended that the arrest was a
publicity stunt. For though the United States had imposed a trade
embargo on Cuba in the early 1960s, for decades American cigar
smokers had hidden Cuban stogies in their luggage and had had
cigars mailed to them from London tobacconists.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said they were following up on a violation of
federal law. Customs agents had tracked a large illegal shipment of
Cuban cigars to a house in Connecticut. A raid there had revealed a
list of clients that included Aretsky, his manager and five others,
who were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' said Aretsky, now 59, in his first
interview since that time. ``I was shocked. I suppose some people
think that notoriety is cool, but I didn't, and neither did my
family. It was rough for them. I worried about the future of my
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Aretsky had never had a brush with the law before. He grew up at
504 Grand St. on the Lower East Side, took over his father's
seltzer-gas supply business, sold it, then made a 1972 success of
his first restaurant, Truman's, in Roslyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in Manhattan as a stockbroker (one co-worker was
the future domestic diva Martha Stewart) he opened the thriving
Upper East Side saloon, Oren &AMP; Aretsky. He followed that with
Arcadia at 21 E. 62nd St., which flourished until the lease ran out
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Aretsky was asked to turn around that power-lunch
dinosaur, the ``21'' Club. He amended the food and attracted a
devoted, less geriatric following. His genial presence was marked
by his signature wardrobe, for which the word ``dapper'' is hardly
dapper enough.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight years at the helm, ``I still had no equity
position in the restaurant,'' he said, adding that he was fired in
1995 after a dispute with the owners. He sued for breach of
contract, but says the case is in limbo because the company that
hired him filed for bankruptcy last year.
</P>
<P>
   Aretsky jumped back on the horse immediately by opening an
American bistro, Butterfield 81, then opened his competitor to
``21,'' Patroon, which won three stars from The New York Times in
1996 and again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By then Aretsky was enjoying mature fatherhood. He and his third
wife, Diana Lyne, a former Tiffany &AMP; Co. senior vice president who
is a consultant there, had two children, Grace and Eugene, now 7
and 6. (He has two grown children from his first marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   And then federal agents came through the door. Aretsky
acknowledged that ``Cubans were sold here with my knowledge,'' he
said on a recent afternoon in the former cigar bar, now a banquet
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we did something wrong and were punished
accordingly,'' Aretsky said. The U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan says he ultimately pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and
paid a $5,000 fine. He was sentenced to serve 200 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   What Aretsky never anticipated was that he would become so
passionate about his court obligation, as he journeyed to the
city's inner-city high schools, mentoring students and working with
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He is doing so through the auspices of a 10-year-old nonprofit
group called C-Cap, which promotes restaurant careers among
inner-city students. ``I'm trying to get these kids interested in
working as line cooks and pastry chefs and managers,'' Aretsky
said. ``There aren't enough bodies to fill all these jobs, and
restaurants need these kids' tremendous energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aretsky's supervisor, Richard Grausman, founder and president of
C-Cap, said, ``Ken has put his whole heart into this,'' referring
to the group that reaches out to 2,200 students a year. ``Ken has
been wonderful with the kids and the teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, this August, Aretsky is about to embark on a new
multimillion-dollar restaurant venture on the Upper East Side.
``It'll be a fabulous neighborhood American brasserie,'' he said,
name and location to be revealed ``imminently.''
</P>
<P>
   What of his missionary work with students? ``It's a new world to
me, something I knew nothing about,'' he said. ``I hope to keep
involved with these kids for the rest of my life.''

GOOD TIMES ROLL ALONG AT HOTELS AND CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great advantage of a hotel,'' George Bernard Shaw once
observed, ``is that it's a refuge from home life.''
</P>
<P>
   With the economy booming, hoteliers are entertaining lots of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has noticed. For the first seven months of the year,
an index of 20 hotel operators compiled by Salomon Smith Barney was
up 18.5 percent, drubbing the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which was down
2.6 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   And it looks as if the good times will keep rolling, because
business travel picks up in early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rietbrock, head of lodging and gaming research at
Salomon Smith Barney, took time last week to discussed the
conditions in his segment of the travel industry. Following are
excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Retailing stocks have been weak recently, largely on fears
that the economy will slow. Do you see any signs of a slowdown
coming to gambling and lodging stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. The stocks have been strong performers this year, but off of
very depressed levels. Most of these stocks, for example, are well
below their 1999 highs.
</P>
<P>
   And the outlook remains extremely strong. The fundamentals are
better than they were last year, and earnings are 25 percent
higher, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does assessing the lodging industry compare with
forecasting the overall economy?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is the easiest business in the world to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Supply of new hotels grows with new construction, and new
construction, which has been high for three years, is showing signs
of slowing down. But it is still pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   And demand for hotel room space is very highly correlated with
growth in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This is very much a ``people'' business. How is this
labor-intensive industry adapting to the Internet age?
</P>
<P>
   A. The hotel industry is way behind other travel industries,
most notably the airlines, in cutting travel agency fees.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is working hard to develop online booking services,
and in most cases, right now online bookings are less than 2
percent of total bookings. Within five years, we could see that
percentage rise to 10 percent to 15 percent. That will save the
hotel companies a lot of money, and put a lot of pressure on travel
agent fees.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think it will go much further than that, because the
inherent problem with direct booking is that when most people
travel they want to book their airline, rental car and hotel
together.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a lot of talk about a joint booking portal for the
hotel industry, but so far the coordination hasn't been there. The
big hotel companies, the Marriotts of the world, don't have a lot
of incentive to give smaller brands equal shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the strong economy helping gambling companies, too?
</P>
<P>
   A. Business is healthy coast to coast, and that is a function of
the economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Las Vegas has surprised everyone. A lot of new casinos
were built out there last year, and all that construction has not
only been absorbed, but the companies continue to grow their
earnings against tough year-over-year comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that has been great is Las Vegas' ability to transform
itself. It used to be all about gambling. But now it is gambling,
entertainment, shopping, great restaurants, golf. It is more like
Orlando. That, in turn, has made it a much more acceptable place to
hold large conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Atlantic City continues to grow moderately but
steadily, and the riverboat casinos are doing great, mainly because
several of those markets have liberalized their boarding policies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which gambling stocks do you like?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are recommending Park Place Entertainment, which is the
old Hilton gaming business. In the last year they bought Caesar's
from Starwood and have dominant positions in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   We also like Harrah's Entertainment. They have a lot of big
properties and have developed the first frequent-gambler card,
which tracks gambling patterns and gives management a much better
understanding of what gamblers like and don't like.
</P>
<P>
   And MGM Grand is a neat company, although we recently downgraded
it because the stock has gone up a lot. The management team is very
shareholder-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any picks among hotel operators?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our key recommendations are Starwood, Four Seasons and
Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood has a lot of exposure to the big urban markets in the
United States and has become a pretty successful turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   We like Four Seasons because of the strength of the upscale
market in big cities, and because of its growth internationally.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Marriott is the brand: It is something like
McDonald's.

THE IPO LULL MAY BE OVER, BUT NASDAQ IS STILL STUCK IN SIDEWAYS
MODE

(For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The law of supply and demand is a powerful thing. And right now
that power may be why the Nasdaq Composite seems stuck in a
maddening sideways groove.
</P>
<P>
   From June 1 to mid-July, Nasdaq ran up 26 percent, teasing
investors back into technology stocks that had gotten hammered just
weeks earlier. Then, to the disappointment of investors, the stocks
lost steam. In addition, while other broad indexes have recently
seen an improvement in breadth _ increasing numbers of stocks that
are rising _ the Nasdaq has not.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hickey, editor of ``The High-Tech Strategist,'' an
investment newsletter in Nashua, N.H., is surprised by none of
this. The action in Nasdaq this summer is inextricably linked to
changes in the supply of and the demand for its companies' stocks,
he believes. As supply dwindled, stocks rallied. When supply rose,
stocks stalled.
</P>
<P>
   There are several sources of Nasdaq supply, of course, the
biggest being the issuance of new shares by fledgling companies.
The number and size of initial public offerings waiting in the
wings has ballooned since the spring as the market has proven
unwilling to absorb the supply. According to First Call/Securities
Data Corp., some 280 companies are currently awaiting their debuts.
These companies, mostly technology concerns, hope to raise around
$36 billion from investors by the end of the year. That is about
the same amount raised in initial public offerings in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey senses that issuers and bankers are increasingly antsy
about getting these deals done. ``With the Nasdaq as weak as it has
been this year and all the stories of internet bankruptcies, there
is a tremendous urgency to go public,'' Hickey said. ``Wall Street
is going to feed as much as they can and more to the market here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another considerable source of supply comes from stocks that
recently went public whose insiders are allowed to sell their
shares. Under the terms of so-called IPO lockup restrictions,
insiders cannot sell their shares until about six months after a
public offering; at that time, millions of shares of stock can be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey believes that when huge numbers of lockups expire, Nasdaq
struggles. In May, according to IPOlockup.com., insiders at 63
companies were free to sell 2.7 billion shares. Nasdaq fell 12
percent during the month. In June, the shares available for sale
dwindled to 1.3 billion shares and Nasdaq rose 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the lull is over. By the end of August, some 1.7
billion shares issued by 53 companies will have been unlocked. And
in September 1.8 billion shares in 45 companies will be free to
trade for the first time. Happily, the shares available for sale
drop to about half that level in October.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the insiders whose shares are unlocked may not want
to sell their holdings. But since so many of these stocks are
trading well off their highs, insiders may want to get out while
the getting's good.
</P>
<P>
   There are other sources of supply that may put pressure on
Nasdaq in coming weeks. Hickey pointed out that there will be
enormous stock and bond offerings by European telecommunications
companies looking for funds to pay for spectrum technology licenses
they are buying in government auctions. The Netherlands, Britain,
Germany, France and Belgium are all auctioning Internet spectrum to
companies that will have to issue securities to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Will demand for these shares and bonds be sufficient to soak up
the supply? Perhaps. But Hickey noted that early fall is a season
that is not known for strong mutual fund or stock market inflows.
</P>
<P>
   This fall could be different, of course. But swallowing $36
billion of new equity issuance will be a lot for even this bull
market to stomach without a hint of indigestion.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS GETTING MILLIONS FROM FEDS FOR INTERNET SERVICES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Gore had to devote part of his
acceptance speech last week to rejecting a position taken by his
running mate, saying he would not approve any voucher plan that
would ``drain taxpayer money away from our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians perform obeisance for the nation's
teacher unions by opposing public funding for school choice
programs, but skip one detail. Private schools already participate
in federal K-12 programs. In addition, through a relatively new
Internet subsidy that Gore supports, private and religious schools
receive funding directly from a nonprofit agency set up by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Religious and other private schools get e-rate money from the
Washington-based Universal Service Administrative Company.
Established by the Federal Communications Commission, USAC
distributes e-rate funds to schools and libraries that apply for
it. The money pays for Internet wiring and deep discounts in online
services. Breaks range from 20 percent to 90 percent, depending on
the level of poverty in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private schools are eligible,'' said USAC spokesman Melvin
Blackwell. ``They apply in the same fashion as everybody else. They
do it directly. There's no middleman in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the first two years, private schools collected about
$34 million of the available e-rate funding. The program doled out
$1.6 billion in its first year and $1.9 billion in its second.
</P>
<P>
   About 80,000 private schools' classrooms, including 45,000
classrooms in Catholic schools, have been wired to the Internet
through e-rate money, according to FCC Chairman William Kennard.
More than 1 million classrooms, predominantly in public schools,
have been wired to the Internet through the program since its
inception in January 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters do not consider the e-rate a public subsidy for
private schools. The USAC, they say, is running a private trust.
The USAC receives payments from phone companies, and distributes
the money to schools and libraries. The companies recover their
costs by charging consumers about 25 cents to 35 cents each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not public money, per se,'' said Jeff Burnett, a lobbyist
for the National Association of Independent Schools. ``You and I
are paying for this on our phone bills. As the lawyers would say,
it's a fee, not a tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act deregulated the telephone and
cable industries, cutting fees that long distance companies had
paid for access to local phone lines by $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the package, lawmakers compelled phone carriers to
offer Internet discounts to schools and libraries. The FCC launched
the e-rate in January 1998. The companies' decision to pass the
cost along to consumers came as a surprise to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, we had no idea you were going to pick up the tab on
your telephone bill,'' said U.S. Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,
chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. ``It
was never discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is technically true the e-rate doesn't offer public
money to private schools, it does afford religious and other
private institutions an equal opportunity to benefit from a public
program. Private and religious schools are eligible if their
endowments do not exceed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Clinton administration said they wanted to help all
schools get online, they made it very clear they meant `all
schools,''' said Patrick Canan, a Washington-based education policy
analyst for the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``I didn't see it as a
big inconsistency, and I don't think they did, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the e-rate has overturned ordinary
politics.
</P>
<P>
   A champion of the Internet subsidy, Gore supports the e-rate
while denouncing any notion of funding private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who claim the government should fund private school
choice initiatives attack the e-rate as an improper tax on phone
bills.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   A new poll suggests that killing the e-rate could be politically
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Phi Delta Kappa on Aug. 22 released its annual survey of adult
attitudes about public education. It found that 69 percent of 1,093
people ``believe that the use of computer technology has improved
the quality of instruction in the local schools, and 82 percent
believe the schools should invest more in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   There has been no end of GOP attempts to snuff out the e-rate.
</P>
<P>
   A House bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, states
in a toothless resolution that ``the e-rate discount program for
schools and libraries should be terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Top Ten Terrible Tax Act, introduced by U.S. Rep. Tom
Tancredo, R-Colo., would repeal the monthly phone fee and a
collection of other levies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House
Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee,
last year introduced a bill to scrap the e-rate and start a more
modest, $500 million grants-to-states program in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a supporter of private school
voucher initiatives, is proposing to nix the e-rate. The Republican
presidential nominee would lump it into one $3 billion pot of money
to be administered by the U.S. Education Department. He would
combine the e-rate with $750 million in existing technology
programs, such as a $75 million initiative for training teachers to
work with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lisaius, spokesman for the Bush campaign, criticized the
e-rate application process as too much of a headache for schools.
Bush's plan, he said, would offer schools ``unprecedented
flexibility in using federal education technology funds.'' It would
fund the purchase of computer hardware, not just wiring and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats claim the Bush approach would not work. The Education
Department, they say, lacks the legal power to collect fees from
telephone companies and, as a fallback, would not be able to obtain
the needed money from Congress. Inevitably, Bush's plan would
result in a cut in funding, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply a wrongheaded proposal,'' said Linda Roberts,
director of the U.S. Education Department's technology office.
``The e-rate funding comes out of telecommunications law, not
education law. ... We have no jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Private schools, meanwhile, have come to regard the e-rate as a
godsend. It promotes their ability to purchase online services and
to wire their schools for new computers. And it provides seed money
they use as leverage with their alumni and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Sister Dale McDonald, an education policy expert at the National
Catholic Education Association, estimates that 3,400 out of 8,000
Catholic schools have received e-rate money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we speak to people who have received the funds, they are
extremely enthusiastic,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   One Catholic school, Aquinas High School in the Bronx, N.Y., has
received $506,000 in e-rate funding over three years. Every
classroom in the building is now linked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was a dream that wouldn't have been accomplished
without the e-rate opportunity,'' said Sister Margaret Ryan,
president of the school. ``It's a very exciting time here. We've
trained all of our teachers to integrate technology into their
lessons on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in May declined to hear a case about the
e-rate financing system, leaving the FCC's approach intact.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public and private schools and libraries are doing
everything in their power to obtain e-rate money. They have
requested $4.72 billion, more than twice what the FCC can provide.
</P>
<P>
   As the rush for e-rate cash continues, it remains up to the
presidential candidates, and voters, whether the government should
scrap the e-rate program. It is the clearest example of a
government initiative treating religious schools, secular private
schools and public schools as equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore wants to continue to use the e-rate to provide
low-cost Internet access to schools that serve our nation's most
disadvantaged students,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the
Gore campaign. ``Bush's proposal threatens the e-rate program by
removing it from its funding source.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisaius denied any risk of lost funding, claiming Bush would
work with Congress to get the $3 billion or more. ``It's a question
of leadership,'' he said. ``Leaders set goals and work with others
to accomplish them.''

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Gore had to devote part of his
acceptance speech last week to rejecting a position taken by his
running mate, saying he would not approve any voucher plan that
would ``drain taxpayer money away from our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians perform obeisance for the nation's
teacher unions by opposing public funding for school choice
programs, but skip one detail. Private schools already participate
in federal K-12 programs. In addition, through a relatively new
Internet subsidy that Gore supports, private and religious schools
receive funding directly from a nonprofit agency set up by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Religious and other private schools get e-rate money from the
Washington-based Universal Service Administrative Company.
Established by the Federal Communications Commission, USAC
distributes e-rate funds to schools and libraries that apply for
it. The money pays for Internet wiring and deep discounts in online
services. Breaks range from 20 percent to 90 percent, depending on
the level of poverty in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private schools are eligible,'' said USAC spokesman Melvin
Blackwell. ``They apply in the same fashion as everybody else. They
do it directly. There's no middleman in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the first two years, private schools collected about
$34 million of the available e-rate funding. The program doled out
$1.6 billion in its first year and $1.9 billion in its second.
</P>
<P>
   About 80,000 private schools' classrooms, including 45,000
classrooms in Catholic schools, have been wired to the Internet
through e-rate money, according to FCC Chairman William Kennard.
More than 1 million classrooms, predominantly in public schools,
have been wired to the Internet through the program since its
inception in January 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters do not consider the e-rate a public subsidy for
private schools. The USAC, they say, is running a private trust.
The USAC receives payments from phone companies, and distributes
the money to schools and libraries. The companies recover their
costs by charging consumers about 25 cents to 35 cents each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not public money, per se,'' said Jeff Burnett, a lobbyist
for the National Association of Independent Schools. ``You and I
are paying for this on our phone bills. As the lawyers would say,
it's a fee, not a tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act deregulated the telephone and
cable industries, cutting fees that long distance companies had
paid for access to local phone lines by $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the package, lawmakers compelled phone carriers to
offer Internet discounts to schools and libraries. The FCC launched
the e-rate in January 1998. The companies' decision to pass the
cost along to consumers came as a surprise to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, we had no idea you were going to pick up the tab on
your telephone bill,'' said U.S. Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,
chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. ``It
was never discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is technically true the e-rate doesn't offer public
money to private schools, it does afford religious and other
private institutions an equal opportunity to benefit from a public
program. Private and religious schools are eligible if their
endowments do not exceed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Clinton administration said they wanted to help all
schools get online, they made it very clear they meant `all
schools,''' said Patrick Canan, a Washington-based education policy
analyst for the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``I didn't see it as a
big inconsistency, and I don't think they did, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the e-rate has overturned ordinary
politics.
</P>
<P>
   A champion of the Internet subsidy, Gore supports the e-rate
while denouncing any notion of funding private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who claim the government should fund private school
choice initiatives attack the e-rate as an improper tax on phone
bills.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   A new poll suggests that killing the e-rate could be politically
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Phi Delta Kappa on Aug. 22 released its annual survey of adult
attitudes about public education. It found that 69 percent of 1,093
people ``believe that the use of computer technology has improved
the quality of instruction in the local schools, and 82 percent
believe the schools should invest more in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   There has been no end of GOP attempts to snuff out the e-rate.
</P>
<P>
   A House bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, states
in a toothless resolution that ``the e-rate discount program for
schools and libraries should be terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Top Ten Terrible Tax Act, introduced by U.S. Rep. Tom
Tancredo, R-Colo., would repeal the monthly phone fee and a
collection of other levies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House
Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee,
last year introduced a bill to scrap the e-rate and start a more
modest, $500 million grants-to-states program in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a supporter of private school
voucher initiatives, is proposing to nix the e-rate. The Republican
presidential nominee would lump it into one $3 billion pot of money
to be administered by the U.S. Education Department. He would
combine the e-rate with $750 million in existing technology
programs, such as a $75 million initiative for training teachers to
work with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lisaius, spokesman for the Bush campaign, criticized the
e-rate application process as too much of a headache for schools.
Bush's plan, he said, would offer schools ``unprecedented
flexibility in using federal education technology funds.'' It would
fund the purchase of computer hardware, not just wiring and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats claim the Bush approach would not work. The Education
Department, they say, lacks the legal power to collect fees from
telephone companies and, as a fallback, would not be able to obtain
the needed money from Congress. Inevitably, Bush's plan would
result in a cut in funding, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply a wrongheaded proposal,'' said Linda Roberts,
director of the U.S. Education Department's technology office.
``The e-rate funding comes out of telecommunications law, not
education law. ... We have no jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Private schools, meanwhile, have come to regard the e-rate as a
godsend. It promotes their ability to purchase online services and
to wire their schools for new computers. And it provides seed money
they use as leverage with their alumni and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Sister Dale McDonald, an education policy expert at the National
Catholic Education Association, estimates that 3,400 out of 8,000
Catholic schools have received e-rate money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we speak to people who have received the funds, they are
extremely enthusiastic,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   One Catholic school, Aquinas High School in the Bronx, N.Y., has
received $506,000 in e-rate funding over three years. Every
classroom in the building is now linked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was a dream that wouldn't have been accomplished
without the e-rate opportunity,'' said Sister Margaret Ryan,
president of the school. ``It's a very exciting time here. We've
trained all of our teachers to integrate technology into their
lessons on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in May declined to hear a case about the
e-rate financing system, leaving the FCC's approach intact.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public and private schools and libraries are doing
everything in their power to obtain e-rate money. They have
requested $4.72 billion, more than twice what the FCC can provide.
</P>
<P>
   As the rush for e-rate cash continues, it remains up to the
presidential candidates, and voters, whether the government should
scrap the e-rate program. It is the clearest example of a
government initiative treating religious schools, secular private
schools and public schools as equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore wants to continue to use the e-rate to provide
low-cost Internet access to schools that serve our nation's most
disadvantaged students,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the
Gore campaign. ``Bush's proposal threatens the e-rate program by
removing it from its funding source.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisaius denied any risk of lost funding, claiming Bush would
work with Congress to get the $3 billion or more. ``It's a question
of leadership,'' he said. ``Leaders set goals and work with others
to accomplish them.''

 &HT;    Sense of sight
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Microscopes and telescopes. Bifocals and
binoculars. Sunglasses and magnifying glasses. Opera glasses and
lorgnettes. Humans will do anything to improve eyesight. Why?
Vision is a major player in the sensory game. When eyes are not an
open window to the soul, they are picking up light and color, depth
and distance. Sending these pictures as electrical impulses to the
brain, the eyes feed the mind with images to be processed. The most
sophisticated cameras have failed to duplicate the process.
</P>
<P>
   Take the prominent physical position of the eyes. Think cavemen
ever noticed that as predators their eyes were in the front of
their heads? Convenient. All the easier to track and slay that
woolly-mammoth dinner. Prey, on the other hand, have eyes on the
sides of their heads. Side or peripheral vision comes in mighty
handy when being stalked. Just ask Wile E. Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you know about the sense of sight? Ever wonder which
substance in the iris determines eye color? What exactly 20/20
means? Or how often the average grown man cries? Have any idea what
colorblindness is? How many times a day you blink?
</P>
<P>
   This edition of the Greig Files is the third installment in a
series on the senses. So grab those drugstore reading glasses and
settle in. You are about to find out why seeing is believing.
</P>
<P>
   DID THE ANCIENTS SPORT RAY-BANS?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Emperor Nero watched the gladiators cavort though
green-tinted stones. To improve his vision, to deflect the sun or
to be stylin'? No one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The first assistive devices for the eyes were crude glass or
water globes through which objects or letters were magnified. By
A.D. 1000, a reading stone (polished magnifying glass) was commonly
held in front of the eye rather than on an object or paper. Glasses
developed by the Chinese were believed to protect the eyes from
evil forces.
</P>
<P>
   Generally those in the who-invented-it biz give eyeglasses an
Italian birth sometime in the 13th century. When Gutenberg's
printing press made books available to the hoi polloi, eyeglasses
were no longer a symbol of wealth. Credit the English with creating
the familiar earpiece-anchoring eyeglasses, and credit
Philadelphia's own Ben Franklin with bifocals.
</P>
<P>
   And contact lenses? Proposed by several folks _ da Vinci to
Descartes _ but the first glass lenses worn on the eyeball by a
human were made by Adolf Fick in 1887. Modern plastic lenses are
the refinement of Kevin Tuohy in the 1940s.WHAT DOES 20/20 MEAN?
</P>
<P>
   Merely a measure of distance vision _ shorthand devised in the
days of the paper eye chart. What a person sees at 20 feet is what
should be seen at 20 feet. Someone with 20/40 vision must be as
close as 20 feet to see what a person with normal vision can see at
40 feet, explains Dr. Jim McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   OH, SAY CAN YOU SEE?
</P>
<P>
   Just how is this miracle of sight achieved?
</P>
<P>
   The eye picks up light reflected by an object (e.g. a teddy
bear) through the pupil. The iris, a muscle, changes the size of
the pupil to control the amount of light. It also gives eyes their
color. The lens focuses on an object (thinning if the object is
distant, thickening if it is near). On the rear wall of the eye is
a thin layer called the retina. The retina contains two types of
visual cells _ rods and cones.
</P>
<P>
   Rods (about 125 million thin straight ones per eye) read shapes
in low light and report objects in black and white. Cones (7
million fat ones) identify color and take in the brightness. Cones
specialize in one of three colors _ red, green or blue. Rods see no
color, so humans cannot see color at night.
</P>
<P>
   The eyeball is protected by the cornea, a translucent tissue. A
clear gel provides steady pressure below the cornea to sustain the
eye's shape.
</P>
<P>
   Neurons pass the collected information along to the brain in
electrical impulses. The message is received by the visual cortex.
The visual cortex turns the message right side up and voila _ the
teddy bear!
</P>
<P>
   WHO IS VISUALLY IMPAIRED?
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 1 million Americans are legally blind, nearly
100 million are visually impaired without corrective lenses. The
leading causes of blindness in the United States are conditions
such as macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmingly, the trudge of the baby boomers to senior status
means those 40 and older affected by vision problems will double in
the next 30 years, according to Prevent Blindness America.
</P>
<P>
   What's an aging boomer to do? Schedule regular comprehensive eye
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MAKES THOSE EYES CRYING IN THE RAIN BLUE?
</P>
<P>
   A small amount of melanin, which is the only pigment in the eye.
The more melanin, the darker the eyes. In the absence of melanin,
the eyes are pink, as in albinos.
</P>
<P>
   WHO NEEDS A SWEAT BAND?
</P>
<P>
   When you have eyebrows, that is their function _ to protect the
eyes from dripping brow sweat. Lashes guard against small particles
and dust in the air that can get in the eye and cause problems.
Lashes also deflect glare from the sun's harsh light and are a
handy place to slather mascara.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAS A MAXIMUM OF SIX DOTS?
</P>
<P>
   The Braille rectangle. Invented by Frenchman Louis Braille in
1829, Braille uses one to six dots in various combinations (63 in
all) to allow the visually impaired to feel words. Braille
characters are embossed, and reading is accomplished by fingers
feeling across the page. There are individual Braille codes for
disciplines such as mathematics and science.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about Braille, contact the International
Braille Research Center at www.braille.org or (410) 659-9323.
</P>
<P>
   CAN YOU TRUST WHAT YOU SEE?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Fall leaves change color _ or do they? (Yes, readers, in some
parts of the world leaves alter colors as the weather cools.)
</P>
<P>
   The steady replacement of chlorophyll (the source of the green
in green leaves) ceases in cool weather. The absence of chlorophyll
allows the other colors that were always in the leaf to be seen.
Want to know more about vision and color? Consult Diane Ackerman's
``A Natural History of the Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS A DISADVANTAGE OF THE Y CHROMOSOME?
</P>
<P>
   The increased incidence of colorblindness. Approximately 8
percent of men vs. less than 1 percent of women are born with a
color vision defect.
</P>
<P>
   Remember those cones in the eye's retina? If the cones do not
properly develop, then perception of red, blue or green is
adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people see no color at all, a condition called
monochromasy, in which there are no cone cells. More common is
dichromasy, in which one cone does not have correct pigment and
usually a person sees blues and yellows but has difficulty with
reds and greens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, aging causes lenses to darken, making it difficult
to distinguish dark colors from one another.
</P>
<P>
   SO WHAT MAKES THAT TEAR CASCADE DOWN AN OTHERWISE STALWART
CHEEK?
</P>
<P>
   Some tears lubricate the eye, removing harmful substances. Some
assuage emotion, and others are shed in response to pain. Their
main purpose is to lubricate the eye and make those protective lids
move.
</P>
<P>
   Tears contain water, salt, protein, a few lipids, fats and some
sugars. Although rabbits, dogs and rats have tear ducts, only
humans cry for stress-related reasons. William Frey, author of
``Crying: The Mystery of Tears,'' reports emotional tears contain
more protein than tears shed over slicing an onion, but that is
about as exact as the chemistry gets.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the content of tears, a good cry lessens stress.
Is stress relief important? Of course. Stress causes or, at the
very least, is a contributing factor to physical illness. Frey
notes the chances of having a heart attack are 14 times higher in
the 24 hours after the death of a loved one or close friend. Tears
in the grieving process help reduce that stress.
</P>
<P>
   ARE TEARS REALLY TABOO-HOO HOO?
</P>
<P>
   In certain quarters, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Some literature suggests crying is a social signal motivating
sympathy and demonstrating trust.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to cry in front of the boss, but few can get
through a film like ``Brian's Song'' or ``Steel Magnolias'' without
a tear. Odysseus was a big weeper, and a few high-profile macho
types _ Bill Clinton to Mickey Mantle _ have cried publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Before the age of 12 or 13, the frequency of crying is about the
same for boys and girls. During the teen-age years, differences
emerge that are driven by hormones such as prolactin and
testosterone, notes Frey. On average, women cry five times a month;
men, 1.4. For women, that means tears spilling over cheekbones; for
men, merely brimming eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A tendency to cry is not related to genetics (at least parents
get a hall pass on this trait) or personality.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO MICHELLE PFEIFFER, BRAD PITT AND GLENN CLOSE HAVE IN
COMMON?
</P>
<P>
   They have all been fitted with special-effect contacts by Custom
Color Contacts, the company that turns baby blues into wolf eyes,
permanently dilated pupils or mirrored eyes. These hand-painted
laminated lenses run $1,250 a pair. Remember, Tom Hanks' milky
white eyes in ``Philadelphia''? Yikes!
</P>
<P>
   In addition to special effects, these lenses are purchased by
those with disfiguring eye injuries and are even used as a
cosmetic. (Should Paul Newman ever want to shed his baby blues for
hazel.)
</P>
<P>
   WHICH INNER CIRCLE IS BIGGER?
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha. They are both the same size. Optical illusions amuse and
confuse. The eye sends information to the brain for interpretation.
The brain estimates the size of the inner circles by automatic
comparison with the surrounding outer circles. It is no wonder
eyewitness testimony is frequently called into question.
</P>
<P>

Clinton and Al Gore, visit www.eyeillusions.com or
www.keystoneblind.org/illusion.htm for a few difficult ones.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE HECK IS BLEPHAROPLASTY?
</P>
<P>
   Eyelid surgery, which is the second most popular cosmetic
surgery procedure for men (after rhinoplasty) and the third for
women (after liposuction and breast augmentation), according to the
American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Eyelid surgery is
increasingly popular (more than 142,000 were performed in 1999).
This procedure removes excess fat, skin and muscle from around the
eyes. A possible side effect? Temporary inability to completely
close the eyes. Egads!
</P>
<P>
   What does an eye lift cost these days? Uppers, $1,775; lowers,
$1,894; combined, $3,030. Fees exclude operating room, anesthesia
or related expenses (e.g. _ recuperative spa time).
</P>
<P>
   EYE YI YI YI YI YI !!!
</P>
<P>
   The word pupil has its roots in the Latin pulpilla, a little
doll. Romans saw doll-size reflections of themselves in the eyes of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Caucasian eyes appear blue at birth and after death, greenish
brown.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns of colors and spots on the iris are as individual
as fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   The human eye weight is about 7 grams.
</P>
<P>
   On average a person blinks every two to 10 seconds for .03
seconds per blink. That is 30 minutes a day of total blink time
with closed eyes.

   EYE SPY: DEFINITIONS
</P>
<P>
   _ Aqueous humor: Clear, watery fluid found in the anterior
chamber. _ Cornea: The transparent tissue covering the front of the
eye. Does not have any blood vessels; does have nerves. _ Iris:
Circular band of muscles that controls the size of the pupil. The
pigmentation of the iris gives color to the eye. Blue eyes have the
least pigment; brown eyes have the most. _ Lens: The transparent
tissue that bends light passing through the eye. To focus light,
the lens can change shape by bending. _ Pupil: Hole in the center
of the eye where light passes through. _ Retina: Layer of tissue on
the back portion of the eye that contains cells responsive to light
(photoreceptors). _ Rods: Photoreceptors responsive in low-light
conditions. _ Cones: Photoreceptors responsive to color and in
bright conditions. _ Vitreous humor: Clear, jellylike fluid found
in the back portion of the eye. Maintains shape of the eye.

</P>
<P>
   THE EYES HAVE IT _ COMMON MALADIES
</P>
<P>
   Astigmatism: A condition that occurs when the cornea is slightly
irregular in shape, preventing light from focusing properly on the
retina. Vision may be blurred at all distances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amblyopia: Lazy eye is the loss or lack of development of
central vision in one eye and is not correctable with lenses. It
usually develops before age 6, and it does not affect side vision.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cataract: A clouding of the lens. Surgical removal usually
improves vision. _ Glaucoma: A disease destroying the optic nerve
and eventually causing vision loss. _ Myopia: Nearsightedness is a
condition in which near objects are seen clearly, but distant
objects do not come into proper focus. Nearsightedness occurs if
the eyeball is too long or the cornea has too much curvature. _
Hyperopia: Farsightedness is a condition in which distant objects
are usually seen clearly, but close ones do not come into proper
focus. Farsightedness occurs if the eyeball is too short or the
cornea has too little curvature. _ Presbyopia: A condition in which
the crystalline lens of the eye loses its flexibility, which makes

<P>
   Agreement is hard to come by in the fledgling science of
economics. The effect of a particular tax cut, or price increase, a
model change, depends on the behavior of millions of persons. They
having a way of trying to outguess not only the decision makers,
but one another as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the outcome is ``anybody's guess,'' but rather
that the range of possible outcomes usually is pretty broad. No
wonder that those projected federal surpluses, whose magnitude
depends on the behavior of any number of politicians over many
years, bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   Such verities as exist in science, therefore, are to be highly
prized. Perhaps the most universal of all this is the limit on the
speed of light. Ever since Albert Einstein in 1905 derived the
special theory of relativity and expressed the relationship between
mass and energy (E (equals) mc2), it has been universally agreed by
physicists that nothing in nature could exceed the speed of light
in a vacuum. That speed had been measured by A. A. Michaelson and
E. W. Morley in 1887 and was found to be the same in all directions
_ that being part of the mystery that Einstein explained.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some chagrin that I _ and perhaps you _ picked up
the paper a few weeks ago and learned that the cosmic speed limit
had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   There was the news on page one of The New York Times, the
Washington Post, The Boston Globe, and the Los Angeles Times. ``The
Speed of Light is Exceeded in a Lab; Scientists Accelerate a Pulse
of Light,'' headlined the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, N.J.,
looking for ways to speed up electrical circuits, had pumped two
laser pulses into a glass chamber filled with a vapor of cesium
atoms and created a laser that shot light out of the cell 300 times
faster than the statutory 186,000 miles per second. Their results
were reported in a July issue of the journal Nature; a fuller
account was pending peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting to reporters on the experiment, Aephriam Steinberg of
the University of Toronto said, ``The broadest message is never
trust your textbook.'' What wonders might be next? A new Einstein?
Interstellar travel? Time travel?
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was with greater-than-usual relief that I hit the ``read
mail'' button on my computer the next Friday afternoon. And read
``What's New,'' a weekly column for the American Physical Society
by Robert L. Park. ``Opinions are the author's and not necessarily
shared by the APS,'' reads the disclaimer, ``but they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Groan! ``The real news in physics (last week) was that the Tau
neutrino, the last of the fermions predicted by the Standard Model,
had been the discovered at Fermilab,'' the e-mail read.
</P>
<P>
   ``But front-page headlines across the country were proclaiming
`The Speed of Light Has Been Broken'. It's now going to be
impossible to characterize any claim as physically impossible
without people scoffing, `That's what they said about the speed of
light.' '' Already his newsletter was receiving a triumphant series
of letters and calls from Einstein-deniers, the PhD physicist
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he continued, the news stories and the Nature paper on
which they are based, probably involve an old and well-understood
sleight of hand. Already Charles Bennett had called from IBM's
Watson's Laboratories to assert that the news was ``little more
than a confused rehash of an old story where the peak of a wave
packet leaving the `superliminal' medium is causally related to
just the leading edge of the wave packet entering the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a few days later, Tom Seigfried of the Dallas
Morning News weighed in with a careful story debunking the claim
that the ``cosmic speed limit'' had been broken. Scientists had
been producing such effects for years. The experiment was a cartoon
special effect; the trick had to do with the excited atoms
interacting in such a way as to rearrange a new peak in the packet
of light, forward of the original peak.
</P>
<P>
   The authors themselves acknowledged that special relativity was
intact. The result was ``a direct consequence of classical
interference of different frequency components of an anomalous
dispersion region.''
</P>
<P>
   Park and the newspaper reporters who follow him have been doing
this for years: Assaying often ludicrous claims of those who
announce some kind of astonishing discovery whose mechanism has
been overlooked for years by a complacent scientific establishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that this sometimes doesn't happen. Indeed, there's
probably no more familiar story in science than the breakthrough
reportedly rejected by the referees who ``know'' that its results
cannot be so.
</P>
<P>
   But not every rejected paper is a breakthrough, and the more
comprehensive the claim to subvert the accepted wisdom of the
scientific community, the more intense the scrutiny to which the
assertion be subjected before it is reported out as fact.
</P>
<P>
   Park, a professor of physics and former chairman of the
department at the University of Maryland, pursues his
reconnaissance through a weekly electronic column (available at
www.aps.org). Director of the Washington office of the American
Physical Society since 1982, he keeps up a witty and well-informed
commentary on science, budget matters, security issues, and the
latest in pseudo-scientific fads _ everything from creationism in
Kansas to Florsheim's ``Magneforce'' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In general he has stayed away from ``supply-side economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Park published ``Voodoo Science: The Road
from Foolishness to Fraud'' (Oxford University Press). It's an
especially entertaining history of various scientific controversies
that have hit the front pages since Park took up his cudgel _ cold
fusion, homeopathic medicine, the supposed ill effects on health of
electromagnetic fields, the strategic Defense Initiative and its
mythical X-ray laser, the ``Roswell Incident'' and the UFO craze,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Park concludes, ``Voodoo science is a sort of background noise,
annoying but rarely rising to a level that seriously interferes
with genuine scientific discourse. Cold fusion might interrupt the
flow of science for a few months, but those who make extraordinary
claims must eventually produce the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The more serious threat, he says, is to the public, which has
less basis for judging competing claims when direct appeals to a
lay audience are made. Scientists may have an obligation to step
in.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Park's reflections on the story of how the cosmic speed
limit was broken _ or not. The scientists themselves may have been
relatively circumspect in reporting their results themselves, but
the press release from computer giant NEC adopted a rather
different tone. ``One can only speculate on (its) objectiveness,''
he wrote. ``But it's the first time I've ever seen a press release
on basic research that had the company's Nasdaq trading symbol in
the first line.'' He's right, of course. Textbooks are not always
the last word, but the broadest message of the story of the cosmic
speed limit is: Consider the source.

 &HT;    DEEP BLUE: THE CYPERSPACE CELEBRITY

   WASHINGTON _ When an advertiser needs a high-powered sports
figure for a product endorsement, booking agents check out the
Q-rating. Think Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Deep Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about high-powered. The IBM product has become the first
computer to attain celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steven Levitt, president of Marketing Evaluations,
the research company that has tracked Q-ratings of celebrities for
the past 36 years, Deep Blue ranks on a par with some real people
like Donald Trump and LL Cool J, and some fictional characters like
Austin Powers and Count Chocula.
</P>
<P>
   Q-ratings are calculated by combining popularity, rated on a
scale of 1 to 5, with familiarity. About one out of two people, the
survey shows, is familiar with Deep Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue's Q-rating of 9 was derived from a recent survey of
1,200 Americans. By comparison, Albert Einstein rates as a 56,
Mickey Mouse 44, Elvis 33 and NBC's Tom Brokaw 28. New York Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner will finish the season as a 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people can relate to somebody as a favorite, the more
they're likely to watch the television show in which these people
appear, the more likely they are to be persuaded by that person in
advertising,'' Levitt told National Public Radio this month.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue earns its keep as a top-of-the-line RS/6000 SP
supercomputer, plugging away at complex projects in an IBM Research
lab in Yorktown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It first won fame by playing Garry Kasparov, the reigning world
chess champion, in 1996. Deep Blue lost that time, but when an
improved model defeated Kasparov in a 1997 rematch, the computer
ended up on the cover of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   IBM let all comers watch the chess matches in real time on the
Internet, which was still in its embryonic phase. That decision, in
turn, helped bolster the early popularity of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after those games, Deep Blue has displayed its
staying power as a pop icon. Or, as an IBM spokesman put it: ``The
man vs. machine issues that drove initial interest are fading as a
technology-friendly Internet culture has fun with Deep Blue the
'personality.'
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Deep Blue has emerged as a celebrity character
in Internet comic strips, in political satire, in late-night talk
show humor and in a tech-savvy TV animated show, Fox's
``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, an episode of ``Futurama'' featured Deep Blue as an
intern as a ``Vice Presidential Action Ranger'' for Democratic
White House hopeful Al Gore. The computer was charged with the task
of protecting the Earth's time-space continuum.

chief executive had resigned and the company planned to restate its

more than $2 billion in Emulex's market valuation before the Nasdaq

BIT PLAYERS NO MORE: CORAL BELLS WITH FLASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By CASS PETERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many a gardener grows coral bells, but only a few for the sake
of their flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Not that coral bells don't have lovely flowers. They do. They
send up spikes covered with small bell-shaped blossoms in colors
from pure white to purple-scarlet. The flowers, bobbing atop stems
so slender they are almost invisible, look as if they are floating
above the plant, not tethered to it at all.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, coral bells have an extraordinarily long season of
bloom for perennials. In my Pennsylvania garden, plants in full sun
bloomed from April through June and, if the faded blooms were cut
back, again in September. The ones that got only half-day sun often
started in May and bloomed into August.
</P>
<P>
   But coral bells, botanical name Heuchera (pronounced
HEW-ker-ah), are usually valued most for their foliage. The leaves
are round or heart-shaped and sprout from a central crown, giving
the plant an attractive mounded form. Many perennials look a bit
tattered after they're done blooming, but coral bells look fresh
all season long. They even stay green in winter in most climates.
</P>
<P>
   Coral bells are sun lovers, especially in the North, and they do
best in soil that is moist but well drained. Sandy soil is fine,
clay is not. But while they flourish in a sunny spot with rich
soil, they'll also survive and look decent in fairly dry soil in a
partly shady spot. They'll even grow under a black walnut tree,
where few plants care to be.
</P>
<P>
   A plant that will grow where many plants will not can expect to
be planted there. I've seen many a garden with a collection of
undernourished coral bells hugging a western wall or grubbing for
moisture under the Rose of Sharon bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their subdued good looks and tidy growing habits
(they tend to stay where they're planted, rather than invade the
rest of the garden), coral bells often also see duty as foils for
more flamboyant plants _ as a ground cover in the rose garden, in
drifts between silvery-leaved artemisias or as an edging plant.
</P>
<P>
   But coral bells have recently been liberated from the backstage
and supporting roles in the garden. Plant breeders are turning out
some cultivars that deserve star billing. They're so flashy they
may need some background plants of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest of the new breed of coral bells was a
cultivar called Palace Purple, which had large bronzy-red and
purple leaves and white flowers on 18-inch stems. It was unusual,
looked great and was easy to grow _ prize-winning characteristics
that won it the Perennial Plant Association's designation of
Perennial Plant of the Year in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful as it is, I still use Palace Purple mostly in the
background or foreground to highlight more brightly colored flowers
and plants. It is spectacular growing behind flowering
forget-me-nots or soapwort, where it continues to look good after
those spring bloomers stop flowering. It is lovely growing in front
of Russian sage, woolly betony or any of the blue- or silver-leaved
ornamental grasses. I like it in drifts with day lilies, too.
</P>
<P>
   Palace Purple is a hybrid of Heuchera micrantha. Most of the
standard red-flowered cultivars are selections from the species H.
sanguinea. But there are around 50 other species of Heuchera, and
the breeders have used several of them to create stunning new
cultivars. There are cultivars with leaves up to 10 inches across.
Foliage colors range from metallic silver to chocolate brown and
olive green, some with ruffled or deeply cut foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newer cultivars are hybrids of several Heuchera
species, often including H. americana. This native species is even
more shade- and drought-tolerant than most Heucheras, and it is
resistant to the mildew that plagues coral bells in humid climates.
The result is a plant that is not only showier than standard coral
bells, but also more rugged in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, some of the newly introduced coral bells are a
mite overdone for my taste. I like the one called Plum Pudding,
which is richer in color than Palace Purple, and Regal Robe, which
has dark green leaves with a silvery overlay and black veins.
Pewter Veil is an interesting silvery olive color with reddish
edges to the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But the coffee- and chocolate-colored cultivars don't appeal to
me much, and the intensely silver cultivars, like Mint Julep and
Mint Frost, look more like caladiums than coral bells. These might
eventually grow on me; I wasn't keen on the white-leaved Lamiums
when I first saw them, either. But they can easily be overdone, and
one of the beauties of the old-fashioned coral bells is that it is
almost impossible to have too many.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be an immediate problem with the new cultivars, which
tend to be pricey _ up to twice the price of a more familiar
variety like Firefly or White Cloud. But like all coral bells, they
can and should be divided every few years.
</P>
<P>
   The flashy new coral bells are gradually making their way into
garden centers, or can be ordered by mail. Two sources are The
Primrose Path, 921 Scottdale-Dawson Road, Scottdale, Pa. 15683,
(724) 887-6756, www.theprimrosepath.com and Roslyn Nursery, 211
Burrs Lane, Dix Hills, N.Y. 11746, (631) 643-9347,
www.roslynnursery.com.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. The breeders also are working on cultivars of coral
bells that have extra-tall, extra-prolific stems of extra-large
flowers. The idea is to make the plant more useful for cut flower
production. I, for one, would happily grow them for the sake of my
garden.

 &HT;    Politics vs. sports: Olympics wins audience favor
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For about two weeks during the heart of the
presidential campaign the political gymnastics may have to yield to
the real gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweights of the White House race are trying to figure
out how to compete for attention with the little girls on the
uneven parallel bars and whatever other drama develops down under
during the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Olympics and presidential elections always happen in
the same year. But this year's games are unusually late. The
campaigns are trying to figure out what it will mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Karl Rove, top strategist for GOP nominee
George W. Bush. ``I think there is, at the least, going to be
competition on the evening news. And it's clearly going to be that
people's attention is going to be elsewhere. How much elsewhere we
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, Jano Cabrera, spokesman for Democratic
presidential nominee Al Gore, is sure about one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be watching,'' he said of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And, history and NBC tell us, so will millions of other voters.
Linda Fowler, director of Dartmouth College's Rockefeller Center,
has a pretty good idea of what happens when politics goes
head-to-head with sports.
</P>
<P>
   Sports wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like stopping the campaign for two weeks,'' said Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Dean of the University of Pennsylvania's
Annenberg School for Communication, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls will essentially freeze during the Olympics,'' she
said. ``If you are ahead in the polls you hope (the Olympics) are a
big success and you lock your lead in and people start paying
attention again at the first debate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate schedule has not been set, though it seems likely
none will occur before October.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth's Fowler believes Gore caught a huge break when his
post-convention bounce gave him a slight lead in most major polls
after trailing for months. Running second heading into the Olympics
would have been a problem for Gore, according to Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized how late the Olympics are going to be, I
thought, `Oh my gosh, this is terrible for Al Gore because he was
the one down in the polls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson and Fowler believe the Olympic effect is being seen in
the candidates' current schedules. Bush and Gore _ perhaps
anticipating the Olympic lull _ have been campaigning full-time for
months. It's a schedule that has rendered Labor Day _ the
traditional start of the fall campaigns _ as an artificial milepost
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are charging ahead,'' Cabrera said of Gore's Olympic
strategy. ``Our stance has been that the American people will be
able to distinguish between entertainment and the serious issues
they need to focus on in the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is operating under the theory that it is
always competing for attention. If it's not the Olympics, it's
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a regular basis, the American people go to the movies,
watch sports and attend their kids' plays, but that doesn't change
the fact that when it comes to the issues, especially when it comes
to electing a president, they understand how significant a decision
this is,'' Cabrera said. ``Obviously, there will be some folks who
do nothing but watch the Olympics. But there are also some folks
who do nothing but watch the Weather Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bush's Austin headquarters, campaign officials are trying to
figure out how to make the most effective use of the time during
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it even more important where he is during that period
of time because when he goes into a market during that period of
time he is going to be able to have an impact. But will he have
less of a national impact? I think so, but there is no way to
know,'' said Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said there is no doubt the impact will be reduced.
Given an option to yak about anything other than politics, many
Americans will, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dampens talk about politics,'' she said about the big draw
of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But a savvy campaign _ and Jamieson believes both are _ can take
advantage of the lure of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympics build viewership for TV it could increase the
audience for advertising, particularly if the ads are uplifting and
patriotic and visionary,'' said Jamieson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither camp will talk about its ad strategy. Bush has the
advantage of some experience with what happens when a late-breaking
Olympics intersects with a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 games in Seoul _ which came during the George
Bush-Michael Dukakis presidential race _ also were held during the
final two weeks of September. The elder Bush said this week that he
did not recall whether the games had a major impact on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said it's hard to place much value on anything from the
1988 race because it was ``such a bizarre election year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dukakis campaign was in total disarray and the Bush
campaign was using ads very effectively. The Olympics were not a
distraction from the Bush campaign in 1988 because the Bush
campaign was so effective at getting its message out and Dukakis
was so inept,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, as evidenced by the bounce each candidate got
from his convention, both campaigns have been effective in pitching
their messages and moving poll numbers. The next major opportunity
for that kind of effort will come during the debates.
</P>
<P>
   But those events also could face a peculiar threat from sports.
First pitch in baseball's World Series is scheduled for Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare scenario for the candidates is that the Yankees'
pitching holds up, the Mets finally figure out how to beat the
Atlanta Braves and the nation is treated to (suffers through?) the
wretched media excess that would be heaped upon the first-ever
Yankee-Met fall classic in the nation's media hub.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7, if necessary, is Oct. 28, 10 days before Election Day.

OVERPRICED SUV'S FOR OVERPAID MVP'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By JOE SIANO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If luxury can be defined as lavishness beyond any pretense of
necessity, what could be more of a luxury vehicle than a sport
utility with the horsepower of a sports car but the handling of,
well, a truck? But does the planet really need supercharged SUV's
with as much as 485 horsepower?
</P>
<P>
   A new class of aftermarket super sport utility _ with entries
from such tuners as Roush Performance, Lingenfelter and Beverly
Hills Motoring _ has found many eager buyers among professional
athletes who can afford to burn money the way these muscle-bound
trucks burn gasoline. Those who cannot hit .350 against Major
League pitching or average 30 points a night in the National
Basketball Association may wonder what they are missing. Recent
test drives provided some answers, as well as a look at a
more-affordable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Roush Expedition
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roush, who runs a multicar Nascar Winston Cup team,
specializes in aftermarket enhancements for Ford production
vehicles. Roush Performance, based in Livonia, Mich., presently
sells juiced-up versions of the Mustang, Cougar, F-150 pickup and
Expedition through selected Ford dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   The Roush Expedition announces itself to the world with Roush
decals across the top of the front and rear windows, in case the
five-spoke Argent aluminum alloy wheels leave any doubts. Other
exterior touches include a chrome tip on the end of the
high-performance exhaust system and a front bumper cover with
integrated fog lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is a wood steering wheel and walnut dash and door
trim, with what Roush advertises as machined metal pedals. A closer
look reveals that the pedals are metal plates screwed onto the
regular rubber throttle and brake pedals. The dash and door trim,
with wood grain that tries too hard to look authentic, have a
similar tacked-on look.
</P>
<P>
   The small video screens in the back of each front-seat headrest
are a much neater installation. The screens, linked to a VCR under
one of the rear seats, produced a muddy image when a videotape of a
black-and-white movie was played, but the color images were better.
Although the system can also pick up broadcast TV signals, it is
hit and miss; the TV audio, which comes through the radio, fades in
and out as you drive. There are 10 cupholders _ 2 large enough for
the biggest cup that 7-Eleven can throw at you. Passengers can also
listen on headsets, the preferred mode given the exhaust noise in
the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the engine, and the whine of the Paxton supercharger is
immediately noticeable. It produces eight pounds of boost, which
all seem to jump in at once with anything but the lightest prod of
the pedal. As a result, the Expedition keeps kicking down into a
lower gear in the four-speed automatic, a whiplash-inducing
phenomenon. Those who thrive on speed won't mind _ especially while
they're passing most cars on the highway. But the Roush Expedition
driver better get far enough ahead before the next corner comes up.
</P>
<P>
   On two-wheel-drive models, Roush has lowered the car two inches
and added a rear sway bar, new coil springs and Bilstein shocks and
a modified air suspension at the rear (optional). But the
suspension needs to be a good deal more taut; there's still an
unsettling amount of body roll. The brakes, however, provided sure,
steady stops.
</P>
<P>
   Roush said the professional football players Deion Sanders and
Nate Newton have been customers.
</P>
<P>
   Brute force is the Expedition's forte. Three passengers and 160
pounds of peat moss, compost manure and topsoil couldn't get it to
break a sweat. One caution: Time saved in the Roush Expedition is
somewhat offset by time spent at the gas pump. I averaged 11 miles
per gallon in 500 miles of driving, and I was at the pump so long,
I checked to see if the tank was leaking.
</P>
<P>
   Roush sells the converted Expedition for $46,834.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette OnShore
</P>
<P>
   This souped-up Chevy Suburban is produced in Tuckahoe, N.Y., by
A.I. Design, under a licensing agreement with Cigarette boats. The
spotless floors of A.I.'s workshop (one couple had no qualms about
allowing their toddler to crawl around the place while they
discussed a purchase) are a clue to what the vehicle is like.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Brown, vice president of A.I. Design, said it took 60
man-hours to produce the custom console inside the Cigarette
OnShore. A glimpse at the nickel-plated carbon-fiber interior trim
(neatly folded into the cabin treatment, unlike the Roush wood
trim), and you can believe numbers like that. Everything about this
conversion has a seamless, factory-quality look to it, including
the custom leather seats. The screen of the Alpine navigation
system slides away into the dash when not in use, and is linked to
a camera in the rear bumper that actuates when the OnShore is in
reverse (the camera image is reversed to give the driver a true
left-to-right image).
</P>
<P>
   As with the Roush Expedition, the rear-sear passengers have two
video screens to entertain them. In this case, they are connected
to an Alpine DVD player and Sega Dreamcast game player _ the latter
with wireless Internet access. The two screens can be operated
independently.
</P>
<P>
   A Whipple supercharger brings the horsepower up to about 485,
Brown says, along with a Gale Banks Engineering exhaust system.
Larger sway bars and firmer bushings at the front and rear are the
main suspension enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   In a short test drive, the OnShore demonstrated poised and
refined behavior. Its 7.5 pounds of boost came in smoothly,
bringing the vehicle up to speed rapidly (Brown estimates a
14-second quarter mile). The suspension is much more taut than that
in the Roush Expedition, allowing the OnShore to maintain a greater
degree of equilibrium (just don't enter any slaloms with it). Of
the three trucks tested, the OnShore had the best ride quality.
</P>
<P>
   The upgraded brakes include Brembo cross-drilled rotors and
calipers. The system worked well at stopping something that
combines this much mass and velocity, but the pedal feel was
relatively numb.
</P>
<P>
   The OnShore beats the Roush Expedition in all areas _ exactly
what it should do, of course, since it costs almost four times as
much as a full Roush conversion: $185,000 (or $155,000 for the Crew
Cab Dualie) fully equipped. Too steep? There's an entry-level
version for $135,000. If you need any more incentive, the OnShore
comes with a 3-year, 36,000-mile warranty. Only 200 are going to be
built.
</P>
<P>
   Ford SVT F-150 Lightning
</P>
<P>
   This 360-horsepower pickup was developed by Ford's in-house
Special Vehicle Team, which also created the SVT Mustang Cobra and
SVT Contour. The main exterior enhancements, beside the Lightning
badges on each flank, are a front bumper cover with integrated
driving lights and twin ceramic-coated three-inch exhaust tips that
both exit on the right side, just behind the cab.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the touches are understated enough that your gun rack
wouldn't be out of place. The seating is a combination bench-style,
with the driver and outside passenger getting extra lateral
bolsters on the seatback and bottom. Trim is a combination of cloth
and leather. The basic comforts are there: power mirrors, six-way
power driver's seat, a CD player, air-conditioning, automatic
transmission and cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   What the SVT Lightning offers is performance at a reasonable
price ($31,400, with destination and delivery charges included). An
Eaton supercharger provides eight pounds of boost that arrive
steadily and forcefully with some firm prodding on the gas pedal.
Ford claims that the truck can cover a quarter mile in 14.6
seconds, and that number may improve with the 2001 model, which is
scheduled for a slight horsepower increase and due out around the
first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lightning will never be mistaken for a sports car,
its lighter weight and shorter wheelbase compared with the Roush
and Cigarette make it the choice for someone seeking an enhanced
truck that is fun to drive, once you get comfortable with it. In a
week of mixed driving, the Lightning got 15 miles to a gallon. &QL;

 &HT;    Politics vs. sports: Olympics wins audience favor

   AUSTIN, Texas _ For about two weeks during the heart of the

the real gymnastics.

   The heavyweights of the White House race are trying to figure

   NEW YORK _ Journalism is no glamour biz. Bad hours, peanut pay.
Unflattering lighting. Or so the inmates complain. As for the style
sense, the women are more presentable. The men make casual Friday
look like the Oscars. Dockers and Rockport are their Gucci and
Prada.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the September issue of W magazine's 16-page men's
fashion spread is somewhat jarring. There's Joel Stein, Time's
nerdy humor boy, in a black corduroy Tommy Hilfiger suit, and Kurt
Andersen, the unironed magazine veteran and co-founder of
Inside.com, in Armani, among other working journalists. The
headline? ``Medium Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   A few gallons of Wite-Out are being applied to the old
ink-stained-wretch cliche. NBC has a new fall series called
``Deadline,'' about a dapper columnist who solves crimes in his
spare time. Cameron Crowe, in his movie ``Almost Famous,'' opening
Sept. 15, recounts his days as a 15-year-old Rolling Stone writer
during an era when rock journalists could still pretend to be
almost as cool as their subjects. And in the pipeline, there's
``Serendipity,'' which began filming in New York last week, and may
be the first movie in which the dramatis personae include an
obituary writer for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Redford and Hoffman played a better-looking Woodward
and Bernstein has the profession been made to look so cool. This
development raises important questions like these:
</P>
<P>
   _Is the Fourth Estate experiencing a rehabilitation?
</P>
<P>
   _What are the three other estates, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   But those are matters to be debated in The Columbia Journalism
Review. The issue raised by the W spread and this wave of movies
and television shows is that dressing up the image of journalists
requires careful thought about what they're going to be dressed up
in. As Marcus Teo, the men's fashion editor at W, explained:
``These are behind-the-scenes people not known for having much of a
clue about style or fashion. We wanted to turn the rumpled into the
fabulous.''

<P>
   Fabulous isn't quite the word for Oliver Platt, the Falstaffian
character actor who plays Wallace Benton, the crusading hero of
``Deadline.'' But he certainly looks distinguished in bow tie,
double-breasted blazer and flamboyantly draped scarf. Dick Wolf,
the show's creator and one of its executive producers, places
Benton ``in the tradition of Jimmy Breslin and Mike McAlary.''
Except neither Breslin nor the late McAlary were bow tie types.
</P>
<P>
   Benton's wardrobe is more ``Paper Chase'' than ``Lou Grant,''
maybe to remind viewers of his professorial duties, teaching
journalism to a class of eager cub reporters. The crime-solving
part of the show is done with the aid of his students in their
joint quest for ``nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Platt's brother, Adam Platt, is a journalist (a
restaurant critic for New York magazine). To get into character,
the actor brother spent time researching the writer brother's
milieu. He visited a newsroom, lunched with reporters at the Four
Seasons and _ more in keeping with the stereotype _ sought out free
booze at open-bar parties.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's movie has even more personal significance: It's
autobiography. Before he wrote movies, Crowe wrote magazine
articles. At the prodigious age of 15, he was assigned a story by
an editor at Rolling Stone who had no idea that the kid on the
other end of the phone actually was a kid. The movie is loosely
based on the callow Crowe's experiences following bands around and
writing about them, even though he wasn't much older than their
youngest fans. The boy wonder sees it all: Drugs, sex, stupid
arguments between the guitarist and the lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   And check out the crazy threads! William, the Crowe character,
dresses pretty much like 15-year-olds dressed in 1973. Sneakers,
T-shirt, ungainly satchel. But when he calls Rolling Stone's
offices, there's a glimpse of his grown-up counterparts: Editors in
Op Art polyester shirts and tinted glasses, brandishing cigarette
holders. Even the magazine's founder, Jann Wenner _ well, a young
actor playing him _ is there, looking in his pinstriped shirt and
hip-huggers like something out of a Tommy Hilfiger campaign. When
this movie comes out, the magazine may be deluged with internship
applications.
</P>
<P>
   William's idol and role model is Lester Bangs, the late rock
critic and gonzo editor of Creem magazine. ``Be truthful and
unmerciful,'' Bangs counsels his would-be protege. And a total
slob, he might have added. The Bangs look, and worldview, were pure
antichic: Droopy jeans, Guess Who T-shirt and a beat-up motorcycle
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made that T-shirt,'' said Betsy Heimann, the film's costume
designer. ``That's the only way I could be true to the
silhouette.'' The silhouette of the '70s being form-fitting _ no
matter how fit the form. (And Bangs, played by Philip Seymour
Hoffman, was not buff.) For the others, Heimann worked from
photographs of the staff in the Rolling Stone archive. The
fictional band in the movie represents the post-hippie, pre-glam
country rock interregnum of the Eagles, the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd
Skynyrd. ``The American rock star as cowboy outlaw,'' as Heimann
encapsulated it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a look many rock critics kept alive well past its, and
their, prime. As Robert Palmer once wrote in The New York Times,
you could always tell the rock critic in a punk or new wave club
because he was the only one with long hair. For years, Dan
Aquilante's column in The New York Post had the quintessential rock
critic photo byline: A tiny head encased in the world's largest set
of headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Rock critics may have been ripe for some image rehab, but if
ever there was an unlikely beat to be hipified it is that of the
obituary writer. Jeremy Piven, 35, plays the obit writer and best
friend in ``Serendipity,'' a romantic comedy with John Cusack and
Kate Beckinsale due to open early next year. The film's original
(since departed) costume person presented Piven with a get-up that
he felt was a little on the cliched side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have patches on my elbows, you know?'' he
said, looking around L'Uomo, a men's clothing store on Bleecker
Street last week. Asked to pick out a few items a typical obituary
writer would wear, he rejected most of the stuff as too expensive.
He said he imagined his character as an aspiring novelist
(accurate) who worshiped Hemingway (accurate) and therefore might
wear a guayabera shirt because Hem would have worn one in Cuba
``with a light spring jacket over it'' (iffy).
</P>
<P>
   At 'ino, a tiny restaurant across Bedford Street from the
apartment where he was staying, he reflected on his own brushes
with journalism. Piven has been in 35 movies, most recently ``The
Crew'' (which opened Friday) and has done his share of television
work (``The Larry Sanders Show,'' ``Ellen''). But his name is known
only to a small cult of fans. This he blames in part on the press
and his own disinclination to seek it out, as well as a former
publicist who advised him to wear berets on talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood, they know the press is bought and paid for, but
they still believe the hype,'' he said. As for entertainment
reporters, ``they'll take a quote and twist it up, so they can put
it out there and sell papers.'' But that's just his opinion. For a
guy like his character in the movie ``who went to Brown and
worshiped Hemingway, he would be more romantic about it,'' Piven
said. The Cusack character's best friend, he added, would not be
``a sellout punk.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion-forward W magazine shoot notwithstanding, what this
crop of fictional journalists have in common is nostalgia.
``Deadline'' romaticizes a mostly bygone era when columnists were
feisty characters with personalities as big as their circulation.
Described in NBC's promotional tape as ``a new breed of
journalist,'' Wallace Benton seems more like the last of a dying
one. ``Almost Famous'' wistfully recreates the bygone era of
unlimited access to the bands and stars of the day. Now, rock
reporters prescreened by publicists feel lucky to score an hour in
a hotel room with their subjects. And ``Serendipity''? We'll see
when it comes out, but at least we know the Piven obit writer gets
to pal around with John Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is that actual journalists might start
believing their press. That they might actually start wearing
fur-collared coats. They would do well to keep in mind Lester
Bangs' words of wisdom to his naive acolyte. ``You are not cool,''
he tells him.
</P>
<P>
   Not even medium.

FOR FIREFIGHTERS, IT'S BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHALLIS, Idaho _ They head out before dawn and trudge home after
dark, weary and covered in soot, still clutching the shovels and
axes that are their weapons. They sleep as many as 21 to a tent, in
makeshift camps pitched beneath smoky, lung-choking skies.
</P>
<P>
   That is how thousands of firefighters across the West have spent
summer 2000, a season so devastating that commanders say they
cannot help but view it as a war.
</P>
<P>
   Others are beginning to view it that way, too. In fact, the
United Service Organization, best known for organizing shows to
entertain U.S. troops overseas, has now come to this remote corner
of Idaho. With three former beauty queens dressed in red, white and
blue micro-mini-dresses cooing and flirting from a flatbed truck in
a roadside meadow, the scene along the Salmon River on Thursday was
perhaps only the most surreal in a summer in which fire has drawn
people from around the country to the most isolated of places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely something new,'' said Sgt. Craig Smith, 29,
of Birmingham, Ala., a Marine whose unit was dispatched to eastern
Idaho on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is among some 1,700 men and a handful of women in eastern
Idaho battling the largest of dozens of major fires burning across
the western United States. His coworkers include paramedics from
Tennessee, high-school dropouts from California, and federal
land-managers from all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After working 16-hour days on end, this group found itself
gawking on Wednesday and Thursday nights at the performers from the
USO, an organization whose past tours have almost always been
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our missions are primarily to remote and isolated places, and
there aren't too many places in the United States that qualify,''
said James Pearcy, the USO's director of entertainment. ``But I
guess sleeping on the ground for 30 days in a fire zone in the
middle of nowhere would have to count.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Victoria Reed, a former Miss Maine, the New York-based
troupe performed a medley of staples that included everything from
``America the Beautiful'' to ``All My Lovin','' while planting as
many lipstick-red kisses as possible among a whooping audience that
found it hard to believe what had come to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a year!'' John Wallace, 23, a contract worker from Tule
Lake, Calif., said in disbelief, commenting not only on the
performance but also on the record paychecks that have resulted
from the record fire damage. ``I'm planning on living through the
winter off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, well over 25,000 men and women are involved in the
firefighting, including what will soon number more than 4,000
military personnel from the Army, Marines and the National Guard,
in an operation whose cost is estimated at $15 million a day. But
with 1.4 million acres still burning in the West, the current force
is not nearly sufficient, federal officials say, and a shortage of
trained supervisors means that it cannot prudently be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   So federal officials have said there is little they can do to
fight many of the blazes. From fire camps like this one, the main
effort has been focused far from the flames, in efforts to
safeguard houses from danger and to make sure that the danger has
passed in areas where fires have already burned through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources have just run dry all over the country, and so
we've had to back off to wider lines,'' said Bill Cyr, 48, an
engineer with the Los Angeles Country Fire Department who since
Aug. 5 has bunked down under a yellow-tarp every night with a
20-man Marine unit, for which he is serving as a temporary adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, nearly 6 million acres of land have
now burned this year, and with hot, dry weather conditions in the
West showing no sign of abating, the devastation is likely to
become the worst in at least half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst fires are in western Montana's Bitterroot
Valley, where a wind-driven flare-up in the last two days has added
to a blanket of smoke so thick that on Thursday midday felt like
deepest dusk. But the Clear Creek fire, burning northwest of here
in the Salmon-Challis National Forest, remains the largest single
blaze in the country, spanning some 165,000 acres, with only about
one-third contained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,755 people, 16 helicopters, 66 fire engines
and 14 bulldozers have been assigned to fight the fire. But the
area is so vast and so isolated that commanders say that much of
their time and energy is devoted to logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest substantial airport, in Idaho Falls, is three hours
away from this camp, which is set on a highway so that it can be
resupplied. Reaching the fire lines takes the crews an hour each
way by bus, traveling on narrow Forest Service roads.
</P>
<P>
   And though the food served at the camp is far better than
standard military fare, it does not come cheap, said Dale B.
Thompson, a Park Service ranger based in Arizona who is managing
the food operation here. A Thursday dinner that included halibut
and au gratin potatoes dished up by the Big Sky Catering Co. of
Missoula, Mont., which specializes in providing for fire crews,
cost taxpayers $16 a meal, for a total tab of $12,000, Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The USO troupe flew in and out of Boise, Idaho, seven hours
away, and was returning to New York for regular weekend
performances on the USS Intrepid, the warship-turned-museum now
docked in New York. The Marines, who arrived here Aug. 5, have had
only one day off since, and receive no extra pay for their fire
service, said Lt. Alison Ake, a spokeswoman. The unit is scheduled
to return to California on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the civilian firefighters contracted by the Forest
Service and other federal agencies receive more generous treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They are required to take one day off for every 14 days of work,
or two days every 21, and most of them get time-and-a-half for
overtime, which adds up quickly over the long days. Wallace, the
23-year-old Californian, figures he will earn $3,000 a month this
summer as a member of what is known as a Type II, or second-tier,
fire crew. That is more than triple his regular wintertime wage.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks in the smoke, firefighters say, simple pleasures
feel like enormous rewards. Brian Crawley, a 33-year-old paramedic
from southeast Tennessee, was looking forward to a brief respite
from what would be two back-to-back 21-day fire tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm headed to the big metropolis of Challis,'' Crawley said,
``for two things I can't get here: a bed and a bath.''

COURT GRANTS ASYLUM TO GAY MEXICAN, SAYING HE FACES PERSECUTION AT
HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.) (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Expanding the circumstances that immigration
officials must consider in asylum cases, a federal appeals court
has ruled that a gay Mexican man who frequently dresses as a woman
is entitled to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers the western
part of the country, decreed on Thursday that Geovanni
Hernandez-Montiel should be granted asylum. A three-judge panel
sitting in Pasadena, Calif., unanimously overruled an immigration
judge and members of an immigration appeals board, who had said he
should be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez-Montiel, who is in his early 20s, told of repeated
assaults and taunts by Mexican police over the years because of his
homosexuality. An expert on Latin American history testified on his
behalf that gay men who dress and act like women are often singled
out for especially cruel treatment in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has sometimes granted
asylum in recent years to foreigners who claimed they were
persecuted because of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez-Montiel's lawyer, Robert S. Gerber of San Diego,
said he thinks this case is the first in which a federal appeals
court has held that sexual orientation can be sufficient basis for
asylum on the ground that the applicant merits protection as a
member of a ``particular social group.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agency has not decided whether to appeal the
decision, a spokesman said Friday. But the spokesman, Bill
Strassberger, said the agency generally does not contest Circuit
Court rulings unless government lawyers think the judges have
committed serious error.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``particular social group'' comes from U.N.
deliberations on the treatment of refugees, and it refers generally
to people who share common traits that have caused them to be
persecuted. These can range from fundamental characteristics like
sex, color and ethnic background to biographical details like
military service or land ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an asylum-seeker is a member of such a group is decided
by immigration officials on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, as the
appeals court noted, the definition of ``particular social group''
is still evolving. Generally speaking, the immigration agency says
the traits that constitute membership in a particular social group
must be ones that a person cannot change, or should not have to
change because they are fundamental to a sense of identity or
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude as a matter of law that gay men with female sexual
identities in Mexico constitute a `particular social group,''' the
appeals court decreed in a decision written by Judge A. Wallace
Tashima. (The ruling, in case No. 98-70582, can be read on the
court's Web site, www.uscourts.gov.)

   From hip-hop to God
</P>
<P>
   By Sonia Murray
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mase was the kind of rapper who talked about flashy
things like a Mercedes, was rich enough to own one and could crowd
his female admirers into a fleet of them and still have an
overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's a preacher, his focus has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Minister Mason Betha still looks like Mase as he
walks into Atlanta's Gladys Knight's Chicken &AMP; Waffles. In a blue
Fred Taylor football jersey, black jean shorts and scuff-free white
Nikes, the 23-year-old appears very much the young man who made his
way into the hip-hop world alongside Sean ``Puffy'' Combs. His is
not the look of a person leading a Christian crusade in Atlanta,
his adopted hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally settles into a booth along the wall you notice:
The platinum, diamond-encrusted Rolex he used to wear has been
replaced by a tasteful silver watch. On his right wrist, where a
similarly diamond-laden bracelet used to be, are two simple strips
of cotton: One is rainbow-striped with the letters W.W.J. D. (What
Would Jesus Do?); the other is green and says ``Yes I Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, though, giving up the showy jewelry and
fame _ and the kind of women that come with them _ was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only gave back the devil the stuff I got serving him,'' the
Jacksonville native says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was corrupting young people's minds to get that
money,'' he adds. ``I was telling guys things like, `If you don't
have sex with at least five women a day, you're nobody.' Leading
millions of people astray. Imagine how much more I can have doing
the right thing, and serving God?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the old life behind
</P>
<P>
   Betha left the world of hip-hop stardom last summer _ just as he
was at the peak of his success. He was known for a trademark
languid monotone that somehow came across as hip.
</P>
<P>
   And it had only taken him three years to have a No. 1 hit with
``Puffy'' Combs (the 1997 single ``Can't Nobody Hold Me Down''), a
3 million-selling solo debut album (1998's ``Harlem World'') and
such mainstream appeal that the chubby-cheeked rapper was asked to
do the theme song for a Nickelodeon movie (``Take Me There'' for
1999's ``The Rugrats'').
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I just woke up and I just knew everything I was
supposed to be doing,'' he says in his first interview in Atlanta.
``And it wasn't nothing that I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all made sense,'' he continues. ``You grow up with 11
friends and you're the only one still alive. Why? I was sleeping
with five women a day _ and (I) don't have no babies, don't have no
AIDS, no herpes, no nothing. It's nothing but God. I've been places
where people have been like this close'' _ his hand sweeps across
the width of the small table, then he pretends it's a gun ``and
shot. And I just started running and said, `How did that not hit
me?' It all just made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaving his old life behind wasn't without its own
challenges. First he had to tell Combs _ the president of Bad Boy
Records , that he wanted to leave. Combs had just lost his best
friend and biggest star, Christopher ``Notorious B.I.G.'' Wallace,
in a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to hear it for real,'' Betha says.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, when he told Combs ``it was God telling me to
do this,'' Combs released him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not crazy!'' Combs says of the conversation. ``How could I
tell that man, `No you can't do what God told you to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the folks in Betha's life weren't as easily
convinced. ``Friends, family _ everybody besides Puff _ didn't get
behind me,'' Betha says without a hint of hurt. But his eyes lower.
``I look at it like this,'' he adds, ``that's the position God
wanted me to be in to be a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   With nothing to really keep him in New York City, where he'd
lived since he was 5, he moved to Atlanta last year. It wasn't
unfamiliar territory. In fact, it was at Club 112 in Buckhead that
he first met Combs in 1996. In 1998, Betha formed his All Out
record label with producer Jermaine Dupri's Atlanta-based So So Def
Records. ``Atlanta has always been my favorite place to go, even
when I was `in the world,' '' he says. ``When I came down here,
people used to show me a lot of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Betha won't say where he lives in Atlanta _ merely ``Fulton
County'' and ``past Chastain Park.'' Or whether he lives with his
mother or five brothers and sisters. (Mason Betha Sr. left the
family months after he was born).
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain though: He hasn't been backpedaling into
Atlanta's nightly music scene. ``You would never know he lived here
if you looked for him at a party,'' Dupri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at church or shopping,'' in Phipps Plaza or Lenox Square,
Betha insists. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Last fall you could find him on the Clark Atlanta
University campus, where he pursued a math degree for a year.
That's where Betha met and befriended Detroit native Jasper
Littlejohn. ``We've developed like a big brother/little brother
kind of relationship,'' he says. ``He's someone I respect because
he's totally against compromising. That's the reason he didn't go
into gospel rap _ because, he's like, `you can't mix Jesus with
anything.' The people I tried to be around before, who said they
were about God, were compromising, saying crazy things like `You
can still drink as long as you don't get drunk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Betha so convincing, says Littlejohn, is that he is
more like a peer than a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to be disrespectful to anybody, but when a 50-year-old
pastor tells me `Don't have sex with someone,' it's hard for me to
hear that because he has a wife and kids. When Mase says it, you
know he's going through that same struggle with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlejohn has joined Betha's non-denominational S.A.N.E.
(Saving A Nation Endangered) Ministries, which he hopes to will
make appearances in every state over the next two years. Betha
won't say how the crusade is financed, but it has hit five cities
in the past three months, New Orleans, Dallas, Detroit, Memphis and
Miami. At each stop, it has generated enough offerings to pay for
the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about 2,000 people show up for each one,'' says Tina
Ellis, Betha's assistant. ``And at least 250 people in each city
get saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Betha's pastor at East Point's 1,500-member Siloam Baptist
Church, Jonathon Carter, witnessed his work in Dallas. And wasn't
surprised. After his 1999 move to Atlanta, Betha went to Carter's
small, red brick church at the recommendation of a Jacksonville
pastor. And he was ``terribly confused'' Carter said. ``But I still
knew that he had a call on his life the day he came... God's going
to do great things through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Betha has introduced his S.A.N.E. Ministries across the
country, he hopes to lead them to a church he thinks he'll start in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Why there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that's where the entertainers go for vacation,'' he
says. ``And I wouldn't be a man of God if I came from a world and
didn't go back to help that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Betha and Carter see the rapper called to lead a youth
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of them,'' Carter explains, ``and God is using this
young man they know from music to speak to them in a different
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But determinedly, and in that same languid montone that made him
a star.

 &HT;    4Him gives Christian hymnal standards modern treatment
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At a time when the hymn book, choir and organ are
becoming endangered species in many churches in favor of the
ubiquitous praise band and modern worship choruses flashed on a big
screen, the contemporary Christian group 4 Him has released a
collection of traditional songs called ``Hymns: A Place of
Worship.''
</P>
<P>
   If any group could pull off giving the pop treatment to such
songs as ``It Is Well, Savior Like a Shepherd'' and ``Great Is Thy
Faithfulness,'' it would be 4 Him, which will perform tonight at a
free concert at Island MetroPark. After all, this quartet recorded
some of the '90s' most significant lyrics, often written by member
Mark Harris. Such songs as ``The Basics of Life,'' ``The Message''
and ``Great Awakening'' encourage uncompromising faith that is
reflected in action that influences culture. They may be anthems
future generations look to for inspiration, just as the songs on
``Hymns'' have influenced so many others.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Chrisman of 4 Him agrees that the ``big'' songs are the
ones that seem to resonate with listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have learned our lessons over the years . . . that
we can try and hip ourselves up and . . . chase after the newest
sound, but really it all comes back to the big song, the big
ballad,'' he said recently from his home in Daphne, Ala., near
Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Success can breed pressure to repeat, however, and Chrisman
admits Harris has felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially after Mark wrote ``The Basics of Life,'' I think
that ever since then, he's felt a lot of pressure on different
levels . . . to deliver that song again on every record,'' Chrisman
said. ``My opinion is, you just let it come. Whatever songs God's
given us, we go with, and one of those songs always pops up.''
</P>
<P>
   Peer recognition has come with the hit songs. Since 4 Him went
solo in 1990 after working for three years with the group Truth, it
has been named group of the year three times by the Gospel Music
Association, as well as being its Dove Award-winning new artist in
1991. 4 Him also was nominated for a Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel
Grammy in 1997 for ``The Message.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, 4 Him is pondering the future. With a contract with
Benson expiring soon and with most members being husbands and dads
_ Chrisman, 34, has been married for 10 years to his wife,
Jacqueline, and has a son, Lucas, 7, and a daughter, Kayleigh, 4 _
they frequently discuss how much longer they should keep recording
and touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to that point . . . of saying, `Let's do this as
long as God is calling us and blessing us.' . . . And we're gonna
continue until he says stop,'' Chrisman said. ``But we feel like
there is a lot of life in 4 Him. We feel like we have a lot of
creative energy left to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrisman drew inspiration during the ``Hymns''project as group
members immersed themselves in the stories behind the songs. The
song ``Be Thou My Vision'' was particularly meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not somebody, whoever wrote this, who was sitting
around banging his brain on a piano going, `I've got to get this
lyric finished. I've got to get this lyric finished. I'm on a
deadline for our record.' This was a guy who was moved by the
presence of the Lord in his life, and these lyrics just poured out
of him,'' Chrisman said. ``It's just the most honest heart cry for
a relationship with God that I've ever heard. . . . When I read
this lyric and began to sing it and internalize it, it moved me
like nothing else ever has.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chrisman has no problem with the modern worship
movement _ in fact, he can see 4 Him moving more into ``making
music that causes people to stand up and worship'' _ he believes
the old hymns have their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Old Testament teaches us (that) God told the
Israelites so many times, `If you want to have the faith to know
that I'm going to get you out of this little bit of trouble that
you're in, I want you to look back and see what I've done for you
in the past.' And that's gonna give you the faith to say, `If God
didn't abandon us then, he won't abandon us now,' '' Chrisman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that's what the hymns do. I think we can look back
at those hymns and go, you know these are the songs that our
fathers worshiped to and our grandfathers worshiped to. Why do we
feel like we've got to throw them out just because we're the next
generation?''

   From hip-hop to God
</P>
<P>
   By Sonia Murray
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mase was the kind of rapper who talked about flashy
things like a Mercedes, was rich enough to own one and could crowd
his female admirers into a fleet of them and still have an
overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's a preacher, his focus has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Minister Mason Betha still looks like Mase as he
walks into Atlanta's Gladys Knight's Chicken &AMP; Waffles. In a blue
Fred Taylor football jersey, black jean shorts and scuff-free white
Nikes, the 23-year-old appears very much the young man who made his
way into the hip-hop world alongside Sean ``Puffy'' Combs. His is
not the look of a person leading a Christian crusade in Atlanta,
his adopted hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally settles into a booth along the wall you notice:
The platinum, diamond-encrusted Rolex he used to wear has been
replaced by a tasteful silver watch. On his right wrist, where a
similarly diamond-laden bracelet used to be, are two simple strips
of cotton: One is rainbow-striped with the letters W.W.J. D. (What
Would Jesus Do?); the other is green and says ``Yes I Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, though, giving up the showy jewelry and
fame _ and the kind of women that come with them _ was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only gave back the devil the stuff I got serving him,'' the
Jacksonville native says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was corrupting young people's minds to get that
money,'' he adds. ``I was telling guys things like, `If you don't
have sex with at least five women a day, you're nobody.' Leading
millions of people astray. Imagine how much more I can have doing
the right thing, and serving God?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the old life behind
</P>
<P>
   Betha left the world of hip-hop stardom last summer _ just as he
was at the peak of his success. He was known for a trademark
languid monotone that somehow came across as hip.
</P>
<P>
   And it had only taken him three years to have a No. 1 hit with
``Puffy'' Combs (the 1997 single ``Can't Nobody Hold Me Down''), a
3 million-selling solo debut album (1998's ``Harlem World'') and
such mainstream appeal that the chubby-cheeked rapper was asked to
do the theme song for a Nickelodeon movie (``Take Me There'' for
1999's ``The Rugrats'').
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I just woke up and I just knew everything I was
supposed to be doing,'' he says in his first interview in Atlanta.
``And it wasn't nothing that I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all made sense,'' he continues. ``You grow up with 11
friends and you're the only one still alive. Why? I was sleeping
with five women a day _ and (I) don't have no babies, don't have no
AIDS, no herpes, no nothing. It's nothing but God. I've been places
where people have been like this close'' _ his hand sweeps across
the width of the small table, then he pretends it's a gun ``and
shot. And I just started running and said, `How did that not hit
me?' It all just made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaving his old life behind wasn't without its own
challenges. First he had to tell Combs _ the president of Bad Boy
Records , that he wanted to leave. Combs had just lost his best
friend and biggest star, Christopher ``Notorious B.I.G.'' Wallace,
in a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to hear it for real,'' Betha says.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, when he told Combs ``it was God telling me to
do this,'' Combs released him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not crazy!'' Combs says of the conversation. ``How could I
tell that man, `No you can't do what God told you to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the folks in Betha's life weren't as easily
convinced. ``Friends, family _ everybody besides Puff _ didn't get
behind me,'' Betha says without a hint of hurt. But his eyes lower.
``I look at it like this,'' he adds, ``that's the position God
wanted me to be in to be a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   With nothing to really keep him in New York City, where he'd
lived since he was 5, he moved to Atlanta last year. It wasn't
unfamiliar territory. In fact, it was at Club 112 in Buckhead that
he first met Combs in 1996. In 1998, Betha formed his All Out
record label with producer Jermaine Dupri's Atlanta-based So So Def
Records. ``Atlanta has always been my favorite place to go, even
when I was `in the world,' '' he says. ``When I came down here,
people used to show me a lot of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Betha won't say where he lives in Atlanta _ merely ``Fulton
County'' and ``past Chastain Park.'' Or whether he lives with his
mother or five brothers and sisters. (Mason Betha Sr. left the
family months after he was born).
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain though: He hasn't been backpedaling into
Atlanta's nightly music scene. ``You would never know he lived here
if you looked for him at a party,'' Dupri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at church or shopping,'' in Phipps Plaza or Lenox Square,
Betha insists. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Last fall you could find him on the Clark Atlanta
University campus, where he pursued a math degree for a year.
That's where Betha met and befriended Detroit native Jasper
Littlejohn. ``We've developed like a big brother/little brother
kind of relationship,'' he says. ``He's someone I respect because
he's totally against compromising. That's the reason he didn't go
into gospel rap _ because, he's like, `you can't mix Jesus with
anything.' The people I tried to be around before, who said they
were about God, were compromising, saying crazy things like `You
can still drink as long as you don't get drunk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Betha so convincing, says Littlejohn, is that he is
more like a peer than a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to be disrespectful to anybody, but when a 50-year-old
pastor tells me `Don't have sex with someone,' it's hard for me to
hear that because he has a wife and kids. When Mase says it, you
know he's going through that same struggle with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlejohn has joined Betha's non-denominational S.A.N.E.
(Saving A Nation Endangered) Ministries, which he hopes to will
make appearances in every state over the next two years. Betha
won't say how the crusade is financed, but it has hit five cities
in the past three months, New Orleans, Dallas, Detroit, Memphis and
Miami. At each stop, it has generated enough offerings to pay for
the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about 2,000 people show up for each one,'' says Tina
Ellis, Betha's assistant. ``And at least 250 people in each city
get saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Betha's pastor at East Point's 1,500-member Siloam Baptist
Church, Jonathon Carter, witnessed his work in Dallas. And wasn't
surprised. After his 1999 move to Atlanta, Betha went to Carter's
small, red brick church at the recommendation of a Jacksonville
pastor. And he was ``terribly confused'' Carter said. ``But I still
knew that he had a call on his life the day he came... God's going
to do great things through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Betha has introduced his S.A.N.E. Ministries across the
country, he hopes to lead them to a church he thinks he'll start in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Why there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that's where the entertainers go for vacation,'' he
says. ``And I wouldn't be a man of God if I came from a world and
didn't go back to help that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Betha and Carter see the rapper called to lead a youth
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of them,'' Carter explains, ``and God is using this
young man they know from music to speak to them in a different
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But determinedly, and in that same languid montone that made him
a star.

 &HT;    MEXICAN NEWSPAPER SAYS ARGENTINE HERE COULD BE WANTED TORTURER
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A high-profile Argentine businessman accused of
being a wanted torturer during Argentina's dictatorship is in
custody here, pending possible attempts to extradite him to Spain
to face charges of terrorism, torture and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of an explosive newspaper report here, Mexican
police detained Argentine Ricardo Miguel Cavallo in Cancun, Mexico,
as he was boarding a Thursday afternoon flight bound for Buenos
Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican police stopped Cavallo _ who has offered conflicting
information about his past _ on suspicions he may have falsified
his identity. The bespectacled businessman has been working here on
a legal work visa, directing Mexico's privately-run National
Registry of Motor Vehicles, a program started to help control
Mexico's problem with car theft.
</P>
<P>
   The registry has been in the news lately because of complaints
that it is redundant and costly. A lengthy investigative report
published Thursday by Mexico's Reforma Newspaper on Cavallo's
alleged sordid past has added to a sense of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Based on testimony by five torture victims, Spanish court
documents and comparative photographs, Reforma's investigation
suggests that Cavallo, 48, is actually Miguel Angel Cavallo, a Navy
captain accused of atrocities committed against political prisoners
held during Argentina's 1976-1983 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Among other ex-military officials from Argentina, Spanish Judge
Baltasar Garzon has accused Miguel Angel Cavallo of committing
atrocities at Argentina's infamous Naval Mechanical School, a
well-known place of torture during the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish judge has implicated Cavallo in the murder of at
least two people, the disappearance of another and the torture of
others, according to Reforma. The judge also, ironically, accuses
Cavallo by of stealing the cars of victims and falsifying
documents.
</P>
<P>
   After being shown photographs, five former political prisoners
in Argentina told Reforma they believed Cavallo had tortured them
and others.
</P>
<P>
   They said he was known by various nicknames, including
``Serpico.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's him. I'd stake my life on it,'' a former prisoner named
Mario Villani was quoted in Reforma as saying. ``I can forget a lot
of things, but never the faces of those I met while in captivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is the same Spanish judge who tried to have Great Britain
extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain on
similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Angered at the failure to bring abusers to justice in Chile and
other Latin American dictatorships, activists have hailed
international attempts to extradite figures like Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy this month a former military officer was detained on a
request by French officials who want to question him about the
disappearance of a French woman in Argentina during the
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   An amnesty law in Argentina has absolved military officials from
prosecution for atrocities, although some have been implicated
recently in the theft and illegal adoption of babies born to
prisoners who were killed in captivity after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina recognizes that at least 9,000 people vanished and
were presumed killed during the military government, which went on
a witch hunt against anyone it deemed ``subversive.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cavallo is positively identified, the Spanish government
would have to officially request his extradition, said Mexican
legal expert Ignacio Burgoa.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish officials are reportedly reviewing the case now.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mexico extradited a suspected Basque terrorist to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday there were conflicting reports in Mexican and
Argentine news organizations on whether Cavallo had confirmed to
police that he was Miguel Angel Cavallo.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Mexico's Attorney General declined to confirm or
deny any of the
</P>
<P>
   reports.

&HT;     GORE AND BUSH: START WITH A LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Humor goes a long way in politics. If Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush want to grab
the attention of their audiences, they would do well to tear a page
out of new book by Liz Carpenter titled: ``Start with a laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, a former Texas newspaperwoman who was Lady Bird
Johnson's press secretary and a speechwriter for President Lyndon
B. Johnson, has a sure-fire formula for speechwriting: ``Start with
a laugh, put the meat in the middle and wave the flag at the end.''
Renowned for her warmth and wit, she always leaves them laughing.
</P>
<P>
   As the politicians drone on during the campaign, it is amazing
how little humor they manage to muster. Of course, there are still
some southern-style, suspender-snapping old-time politicians around
_ but not many.
</P>
<P>
   Some past occupants in the White House had a sense of humor and,
as Carpenter points out, it served them well at times.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy was noted for his quick wit and one-liners.
Johnson was a good storyteller and a great mimic, especially when
mocking his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Carpenter recalls some humorous presidential
anecdotes from the past.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that when Will Rogers called on an anxious President
Warren Harding during the Teapot Dome scandal, he told Harding:
``I'd like to tell you some of my latest jokes, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you won't have to do that, Will,'' said Harding. ``I
appointed them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers visited the White House in the FDR era, he asked
first lady Eleanor Roosevelt where the president was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever you hear laughter,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter also recalled a Kennedy speech to the White House
Correspondents Association. The president, who had been accused of
nepotism when he appointed his brother Bobby as the attorney
general, told the gathering that ``Bobby wants to practice law and
I thought he ought to get a little experience.''
</P>
<P>
   She also tells how Kennedy was able to disarm critics who
claimed that he was using his father's riches to buy the primary
election in West Virginia in 1960. Hubert Humphrey, Kennedy's chief
rival in that contest, thought so too. Nor were the rumors
dispelled after Kennedy won big. He managed to clear the air,
however, when he appeared at a Gridiron Dinner, pulled a piece of
paper from his pocket and said he wanted to read a telegram from
his father which said: ``Dear Jack, don't go after Alaska and
Hawaii. You don't need them and I can't afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since LBJ was her boss, Carpenter was able to recount Johnson's
humor best of all.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a well-known telephone addict. He once called Ohio
Congressman Wayne Hayes at 1 a.m. and said: ``Did I wake you,
Wayne?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Mr. President,'' Hayes replied. ``I was just lying here
waiting for your call.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said Johnson was always determined to have his words
understood by the man on the street.
</P>
<P>
   When he read a draft of a speech quoting Aristotle, the Greek
philosopher, he turned to the startled speechwriter and said:
``Aristotle! These folks don't know who Aristotle is.'' Then he
picked up a pen, scratched out the reference to Aristotle and
scribbled in: ``As my dear old daddy used to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter recounts President Ronald Reagan's one-liners when he
was shot in an assassination attempt in 1981. ``Honey, I forgot to
duck,'' Reagan told his wife Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   As he was about to go into surgery at George Washington
hospital, Reagan looked up at the surgeons and expressed the hope
that they were all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecating humor by presidents goes over big with
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the Whitewater investigation first surfaced, President
Clinton attended a White House Correspondents Association dinner
and said: ``I'm happy to be here. I am really delighted to be here.
If you believe that I've really got some land in northwest Arkansas
I'd like to show you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then recalled that the press dinners began in 1944 when
President Roosevelt delivered his fireside chats over radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not much different today except that you insist that the
president sit directly on the logs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter says psychologists confirm the bonding influence of
humor. The presidential candidates would do well to heed Mark
Twain's observation:``Against the onslaught of humor, nothing
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember that old adage that starts ``With friends like that''
</P>
<P>
   Can Vice President Al Gore be his own man only when President
Clinton is not around? Apparently so. In the manner of the
``Survivor'' television series, the president has been kicked off
the island and told to get lost so that he doesn't detract from
Gore's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is now telling reporters that he is willing to do
whatever is asked of him but he also says ``the most important
thing is for the candidates to carry the message to the people and
I think they are doing a good job.''
</P>

   NEW YORK _ What does the lobby of your building smell like?
Disinfectant? Wet dog? If you're one of the 13 purchasers of
multimillion-dollar apartments in the Loft SoHo building opening at
30 Crosby Street in the fall, expect ylang-ylang and rose oil.
</P>
<P>
   The developers of the luxury property had already planned
mind-boggling amenities _ a wine cellar and wine-tasting room,
leather walls, personal garbage systems, which automatically sort
the recycling _ when they decided that what they really needed was
a custom lobby scent. No other building in New York has one.
Nothing as bourgeois as, say, fig. And nothing as overt as the
stuff sprayed with stealth force by women in black overcoats on the
first floor of Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was subtly to affect the mood of Lenny Kravitz, Liv
Tyler and the other well-heeled residents, who will soon be closing
on apartments where aromatherapy hits them when they walk through
the door. The scents will change with the time of day and the
season. ``We decided that in the morning, there should be something
invigorating,'' said Edward Baquero, a managing partner of Landmark
Development, the building's developer. ``A sort of
great-day-seize-the-moment kind of scent. And when they come home,
it should be more a feeling of serenity. A sense of calmness.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer turned to Aveda, the aromatherapy behemoth, to
design the scents, which will circulate through the lobby via the
building's duct system, using a technology from England that pumps
the essential oils into the air. ``It won't be a blast,'' said
Daria Myers, the senior vice president for global marketing at
Aveda. ``It is very subtle. Very ambient. And you will feel that
change in moods as you walk through the lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said that while the Japanese sometimes waft aromas through
the air of office buildings or hospitals, the idea has not taken
hold in this country. Consultants from Japan and England weighed
in, and an herbalist was brought in on the project, as Myers said,
``to determine the organic certification and the functionality'' of
each essential oil. (This is the company, after all, that
trademarked the name Pure-fumes to describe its organic essential
oils.)
</P>
<P>
   Aveda executives did not want to reveal their special
concoctions for The Loft. In fact, the scents are still being
finalized. (Each component, Myers said, must undergo ``mood
mapping,'' which tests their psychological effects.)
</P>
<P>
   But the scent meant to do all the top-of-the-morning work is
likely to include a grapefruit note, which is known to be
refreshing, as well as essences of peppermint, orange and cinnamon,
which offer a similar boost. In the evening, residents will be
soothed by lavender, which is said to relax, and ylang-ylang and
rose oil. There might be some lemon in there, which is deodorizing.
</P>
<P>
   In cold weather, warming scents will be added; in the summer,
cooler notes. The building's interior designer, Benjamin
Noriega-Ortiz, will sign off on each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really go over the top,'' Baquero said. In a building where
apartments sell for $2.5 million to $7.5 million, does this seem in
any way surprising?

ENOUGH WITH THE KOMPYUTA! LET'S MAKURU!

  (Ideas) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although English is becoming the dominant language around the
world, few outside Japan may be aware of how extensively it has
transformed Japanese. Herbert Passin, professor emeritus of
sociology at Columbia University, reported on this upheaval in
``Japonica: How to Read the Japanese Language If You Know the
English Source Code,'' which appeared in the spring-summer issue of
Correspondence: An International Review of Culture and Society.
Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   From the Asuka period (A.D. 552-645) through the late Heian (end
of the 12th century), the Chinese language completely penetrated
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing, I would suggest, is happening today with
English. English is in the process of being completely absorbed,
and its entire vocabulary is becoming available for use in
Japanese. Today when new words are made up they will come from
English (or to a lesser extent, from some European language), no
longer from Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine modern Japan without English. Right now, I
am sitting at my desuku (desk), or teburu (table), with the rampu
(lamp) on, holding my kompyuta (computer), taipingu (typing),
making occasional notes with a boru-pen (ball-pen).
</P>
<P>
   I sip some kohi (coffee) from a gurasu (glass). When I need a
break, I move to the sofua (sofa), lean against the kusshon
(cushion) and read the nyusu (news) about the latest sekuhara
(sexual harassment) incident. I then turn to the puroguramu
(program) on the karar-terebi (color television) and watch a
homudorama (home drama).
</P>
<P>
   There is no ``l'' sound in Japanese so that all foreign words
with ``l'' are pronounced with an ``r.'' ``Flight'' becomes
``fright,'' or more exactly, ``furaito.'' A further pronunciation
problem is that Japanese syllables all end in vowel sounds, except
when there is an ``n.'' ``Book'' becomes ``bukku,'' ``size''
becomes ``saizu,'' ``pencil'' becomes ``penshiru.'' When the
syllabic ending is ``n,'' ``pen'' remains ``pen,'' ``downtown'' is
``dauntaun,'' a ``can of beer'' becomes ``kan-biru.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, because of the enormous increase in the velocity of
communications and the diffusion of literacy, the assimilation of
foreign languages requires mere decades, or even years, rather than
centuries. There are several fairly distinguishable stages in this
process. In the first, foreign words are taken in whole and used
passively.
</P>
<P>
   But once these words are domesticated, they immediately open up
a new stage in which they take on a life of their own. They are
used in ways that may not be instantly understandable to the
speakers of the original language. ``Mansion,'' for example
(pronounced ``manshon'' in Japanese), which usually suggests to
modern Western minds a large, residential estate, like that of the
titled aristocracy or the wealthy, is commonly used in Japan to
mean a pricey apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is essential for Japanese: abbreviation.
</P>
<P>
   There are now thousands of abbreviated English words used by
Japanese that without explanation usually cannot be understood by
English speakers. A few examples: ``register'' becomes ``reji'';
``negative,'' ``nega''; ``handicap,'' ``hande''; ``reportage,''
``rupo''; ``permanent wave,'' ``pama.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, or even thousands, of foreign compounds are taken over
with virtually no change (except pronunciation): ``golf bag''
(``gorufu-baggu''), ``software'' (``sofutouea'') and so on. Many,
however, even though close to the original meaning, are
abbreviated, and once this happens they begin to look a little
different and usually cannot be understood by English speakers. A
classic example _ by now, hardly used _ is the post-World War I
``moga'' (from ``modan gaaru,'' ``modern girl'').
</P>
<P>
   At the next stage, foreign words in full or abbreviated form are
combined with Japanese words (including completely assimilated
Chinese words as well) to make new compounds. An archetypal example
is the by now rather old ``tonkatsu'' (``pork cutlet'') made up of
the Chinese ``ton'' (``pork''), and ``katsu,'' the abbreviation of
``cutlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Japanese used to create new words out of Chinese freely
and autonomously, so now it is beginning to create a homemade
English. When I gave up smoking at my doctor's orders, this was a
``dokutu-sutoppu'' (``doctor-stop''), an example of what I would
consider brilliant new English.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples abound. I like ``bea,'' from ``besu-appu,''
``base-up,'' that is, a rise in the base wage from which other
calculations for the total wage are made.
</P>
<P>
   The penultimate stage comes when people are no longer aware that
the word is not native. ``Pan'' (``bread'') is from 16th- or
17th-century Portuguese. But it is so deeply rooted in Japanese
that we now find the baffling compound ``bureddo-pan''
(``bread-pan'').
</P>
<P>
   In the final stage, the foreign word is completely assimilated
to the grammatical form of Japanese. Normally, foreign words
(including Chinese) are formed into verbs by adding ``suru'' (``to
do''), into adjectives by adding ``na'' and into adverbs by adding
``ni.''
</P>
<P>
   A good example is the old standby ``saboru.'' Originally, it
came from the abbreviated ``sabotage,'' ``sabo,'' but it has become
completely Japanified by adding the Japanese verb form ``ru'' and
then taken on a somewhat divergent meaning: to play truant, to
evade doing something one does not want to do, not to do one's
part.
</P>
<P>
   More recent examples of this creative innovation are: ``makuru''
(to eat at McDonald's), ``saburu'' (to eat while riding a subway
car _ from ``sabuuei,'' ``subway'').
</P>
<P>
   All languages take in foreign loan words. In Japan, Chinese was
the first major penetration, and its impact was overwhelming.
Fourteen hundred years later, something similar seems to be
happening with English. In the centuries in between, Korean, Dutch
and Portuguese made significant, though lesser, contributions.
</P>
<P>
   English itself developed in a similar way. Shaped from Germanic,
then invaded by Norman French, its intellectual, legal, scientific
and religious vocabularies were also deeply influenced by Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, English continues to take in new language from
Anglo-Indian, Caribbean, South African, Irish, Scottish,
Australian, Yiddish and countless others.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese, therefore, is not unique in this process. However we
may come to rate the relative penetrability of languages _ and it
is debatable, say, whether English, Japanese, Turkish or Uzbek is
more open to foreign linguistic influence _ the process of
English-absorption that is going on before our eyes in Japan today
is awesomely inventive.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What with a climb in interest rates, poor weather and a hangover
from Year 2000 computer problems, retailers' stocks have been about
as popular as last year's fashions. The question is whether they
are distressed merchandise or a legitimate bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-April, the Standard &AMP; Poor's retail stores composite
index has tumbled 20 percent _ a decline that analysts attribute
mainly to market recognition that, sooner or later, the Federal
Reserve always gets its way. And the Fed's chairman, Alan
Greenspan, wants consumers to stop spending so much, lest inflation
heats up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have six rate hikes without people feeling nervous''
about a diminished impetus to shop, said Carole Cranmer, a retail
analyst at Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are divided. Some say retail stocks have probably
hit bottom, while others, like Ursula Moran of Sanford Bernstein,
advise patience, predicting that prices will be marked down still
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Fed wins, it means that spending decelerates,'' Moran
said. ``But history suggests we're not out of the woods yet.'' She
noted that it took about a year for retail stock prices to turn
higher after the Fed ended its last round of rate increases in
1995. And while the Fed passed up a chance to raise rates last
week, it is not yet certain that it is through for this round.
</P>
<P>
   Still, income and job growth are stronger than they were in
1995, and store executives have quickly learned to harness
technology to prevent too much inventory buildup, long a major
vulnerability of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still appears to be the ability to spend,'' said Susan
M. Sterne, proprietor of Economic Analysis Associates, which
studies consumer behavior. ``I think people are too negative on the
stocks; they're running away from them too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   With some notable exceptions, the stock prices show the damage:
Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, is 27 percent below its New
Year's Eve high of $70.25. Among others, Federated Department
Stores is down 45 percent this year, Gap 42 percent, Circuit City
40 percent, Saks 31 percent, Home Depot 26 percent and Lands' End
24 percent. And Gottschalks, a West Coast chain, trades at just six
times earnings, in contrast to an industry average of 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very weak spring season'' for merchants, Sterne said.
The expected business surge from Y2K has not occurred this year,
she noted, although it helped produce a fabulous final 1999
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies missed their profit and revenue targets in the
second quarter, and others, including Wal-Mart and Target, warned
of shortfalls in the current one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see the deceleration'' in spending that
Greenspan has been trying to engineer, said George Strachan, senior
retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, citing a small decline in
comparable-store sales in July, the first monthly contraction since
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Strachan has removed several of the stocks from his
recommended list. And he assigns only a market weighting for the
discounters, which generally cope best when business slackens,
gaining market share at department stores' expense.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey Feiner, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, is
upbeat. ``You typically buy the retail stocks when the news gets
most negative,'' because they tend to lead the business cycle,
Feiner said. ``Most of the downside is already fully priced into
the stocks.'' He predicted a rebound in the first half of next
year, perhaps earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Although some carriage-trade stores like Tiffany have thrived
during the economic boom, their stocks have not kept pace. For
bargain hunters, however, analysts favor companies like the rapidly
expanding Target _ formerly Dayton Hudson _ with a mostly
value-conscious core of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Another common recommendation is Wal-Mart. Although it has
withdrawn its ``always the lowest price'' pledge, it is still
oriented toward value. ``If consumers really cut back on spending,
many will be looking for bargains,'' Feiner said, and Wal-Mart can
use its muscle to beat the prices of the competition. Despite the
company's profit caution, Feiner reiterated his ``buy''
recommendation this month, as did Credit Suisse First Boston
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, however, downgraded the stock,
which carried a price-to-earnings multiple of 40 this summer, to
``market perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Venator, the former Woolworth's, has gained 111 percent this
year, and six Wall Street analysts forecast further gains, rating
it a buy or strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that Wall Street likes are Talbots, a retailer
of classic women's apparel that is one of Merrill Lynch's favorite
stocks in any group, and Kohl's, a Wisconsin-based chain that sells
what Moran of Bernstein called a ``carefully edited'' selection of
brand-name household goods at highly competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have spectacularly bucked the downward trend, and
the price of Kohl's stock is 58.5 times what the company is
expected to earn per share this year. But it could still be a
bargain, said Strachan of Goldman Sachs. With much of the country
yet to glimpse its first Kohl's, he called the company ``one of the
few blue-sky opportunities left in broad-line retailing.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    TIPS HELP LAWNS SURVIVE THE HEAT
 &HT;    BY KATHY HUBER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners continue to write and call with lawn questions. The
following advice was gathered from turf pros, and in large part
from the specialists at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Proper mowing and watering will help pull St. Augustine lawns
through the extreme hot, dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a healthy St. Augustine turf, mow at the proper
height _ 2 1/2 to 3 inches. Mow hybrid Bermuda grass at 1/2 inch to
1 1/2 inches. Mow frequently, removing no more than a third of the
blade height. Frequent mowing encourages thicker turf, which in
turn lowers evaporative water loss. Leave the clippings on the lawn
to break down and replenish nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid excessive thatch, the nondecomposed organic matter between
the soil surface and the base of the blades. Heavy thatch _ caused
by overfertilization, overwatering and improper mowing _ slows
water intake and can become a home for pests.
</P>
<P>
   Aerate. Not enough can be said about this simple practice that
improves air and water movement in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Water properly to promote good lawn health and to conserve
water. Do not apply water faster than the soil can absorb it. Water
early in the day, when the sun is less intense, temperatures are
lower and, in most cases, there's no wind. These conditions
decrease evaporation.
</P>
<P>
   Water deeply and slowly. If you sprinkle water lightly, you'll
only encourage the roots to rise to the moisture, where they will
be subject to higher temperatures and will dry quickly. Encourage
roots to grow downward by applying enough water to wet the soil 6
inches down. This, in turn, will better arm the turf against
drought stress.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M turfgrass extension specialist Gene R. Taylor II says
1/2 inch of water (irrigation or rainfall) every four to five days
should provide adequate moisture for the average Houston lawn. A
half-inch of water, he says, will wet a clay soil down to the
desired 6-inch depth, assuming the lawn has received irrigation or
rain in the past week or so.
</P>
<P>
   If a clay soil is completely dry, however, it will take a little
more than 1 inch of water to wet to a depth of 6 inches. Since
water infiltrates a clay soil at a rate of less than 1/4 inch per
hour, it's best to run sprinklers long enough to apply 1/4 inch,
turn them off and allow the water to soak in. This minimizes
surface runoff. Then turn the sprinklers on again to complete
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to A&AMP;M studies, it takes about 3/4 inch of water to
wet a dry loam 6 inches down, and 1/2 inch to travel 6 inches down
in a sandy soil.
</P>
<P>
   To measure how much your sprinkler waters in a set amount of
time, the A&AMP;M experts suggest placing three to five short-sided,
open-top cans in a line that starts near the sprinkler and
continues to the edge of the sprinkler's coverage. Let the
sprinkler run for 30 minutes, then measure and average the amount
in the cans. Determine the depth of wet soil. If there's 1/2 inch
in the cans and the soil is wet 6 inches down, irrigation is
complete. If the average amount is 1/2 inch of water and the
moisture depth is 3 inches, turn the sprinkler on for another
half-hour to wet soil to the desired 6-inch depth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if hot, dry conditions persist, apply another 1/2 inch of
water in four to five days.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Texas Nursery &AMP; Landscape Association's Web site at
www.txnla.org for more consumer drought information. Also useful is
www.waterwisetexas.org.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to keep nitrogen levels low during drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a high-potassium fertilizer in the fall to encourage good
root development over the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Could you please tell me where to get skyflower vine? &QL; 
_ L.M., Houston, Texas &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Local nurseries carry this vine on occasion. I would just
ask when it will be available. Skyflower (Thunbergia grandiflora):
A deciduous perennial vine, skyflower produces orchidlike
lavender-blue blooms late summer to frost or well into spring after
a mild winter. Plant this rapid grower in sun or filtered sun in a
soil rich in organic matter. It will freeze to the ground during a
cold winter, so mulch to protect roots. It should return from the
roots in spring.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: For free trade, but not Castro
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush pledged today to breathe new life into stalled
free-trade negotiations with Latin America if elected president,
and to retain all current sanctions on Fidel Castro's Cuba. ``My
word to you, Mr. Castro: Let your people live in freedom,'' Bush
said in a Miami speech outlining his foreign policy goals for the
Western Hemisphere. That statement prompted a standing ovation from
the Cuban-Americans in the audience. In advance of a meeting in
Dallas with Mexico's President-elect Vicente Fox, Bush also
reiterated an intention to hire more border enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN GOES IT ALONE
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman made his first solo outing as a vice presidential
nominee today, blasting the Republican tax cut plan and saying he
wants to help families ``win the competition'' against violence in
popular culture. In Claymont, Del., a suburb of Wilmington,
Lieberman promoted Al Gore's plan for targeted tax cuts for
middle-income families. He disputed George W. Bush's argument that
the Democratic plan would bypass many needy families. ``We believe
in using our prosperity to target tax cuts to the working class
families who need it most,'' he told a crowd of about 300
Democratic activists.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY: WORTH HIS PENSION
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney vehemently defended his work in the oil services
business, bristling at any suggestion that he was less than
successful as the CEO of Halliburton. And he insisted once more
that as vice president he would take steps to ensure that his
multimillion-dollar retirement package from Halliburton Co. did not
pose a conflict of interest. ``We went from being a second-tier,
second-rank energy services company to being the biggest in the
world,'' he said in Central Point, Ore. Cheney complained that the
New York Times report characterizing his record at Halliburton as
mixed was ``a distortion,'' ``bad journalism'' and ``seriously
flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN UNDER THE KNIFE AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is recovering at Washington Hospital Center after
undergoing a second round of surgery to treat gall bladder disease.
The Reform Party presidential candidate was suffering from what his
campaign called ``severe abdominal pain.'' ABC News reported that
doctors determined the pain resulted from a gallstone that wasn't
removed when his gall bladder was taken out in a previous surgery
last week. Buchanan is expected to be released later today or
Saturday morning. He is not expected to return to the campaign
trail until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE HEART
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his campaign began, George W. Bush has tried to shuck
one central notion: that he doesn't have the brains for the job.
But campaign officials recently have worked to head off a second
``Wizard of Oz''-style problem: that he doesn't have the heart for
a tough campaign. This campaign will be won on issues and ideas,
they say. The issue of drive bubbled up again last week as Bush,
after the Democratic convention, cut short a single stop in Memphis
to return to Texas to jog at a favorite athletic club. And Bush's
tentative schedule leading up to Labor Day also indicates that
he'll be on the campaign trail four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-SEMITIC GRAFFITI
</P>
<P>
   Someone scrawled an anti-Semitic message in the local
Gore-Lieberman campaign headquarters in Chico, Calif., a Democratic
Party activist says. Bob Ray said he arrived at the office and
found ``No Jew in the White House'' written in ink in big letters
across two large erasable boards and a planning calendar. Police
Lt. Mike Simpson said investigators were told a campaign worker
left the office unlocked Wednesday night, and there were no
suspects. Ray said he plans to keep the message up to remind them
of the importance of the election. Chico is 100 miles north of
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ADS AIMED AT SENIORS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign introduced a new TV spot today about
Social Security, Medicare and prescription drugs into 21 states
they had already targeted as the campaign ad war heats up. In
addition, the Republican Party is set to start next week with an ad
buy worth millions of dollars in just nine states. Says Bush in the
ad: ``We will make prescription drugs available and affordable for
every senior who needs them. . . . President George W. Bush will
keep the promise of Social Security. No changes. No reductions. No
way.'' The ad is a blend of Bush's comments with scenes of older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   BUSHES HIGH ON FLORIDA CHANCES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush rounded up $1.5 million for Florida's Republican
Party at a closed-door reception in a private Coral Gables, Fla.,
enclave. ``I intend to contest this state,'' Bush said as he
arrived at Miami International Airport. ``We have a good chance of
winning.'' Looking around and not seeing his brother, Gov. Jeb
Bush, the candidate joked, ``I'm a little disappointed the chairman
of my campaign is late.'' The Bushes are confident that they can
carry Florida, where Democratic presidential candidates have
prevailed only three times in 50 years. But the Democrats are
making a full-court press for the state.
</P>
<P>
   KOSHER MEAL AT FUND-RAISER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore pulled in more than $1.25 million at a pair of
fund-raising dinners in Washington for the Democratic Party. The
first dinner drew 30 people, most of them Indian-Americans. The
second dinner drew about 60 people, most of them friends of Joe
Lieberman, who also attended. Both dinners were served at the
Mayflower Hotel, but the second was a Glatt Kosher meal, the pure
form of Kosher food, blessed by a rabbi and provided by a
restaurant, Dahan of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE, OR THEY MIGHT SUE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has accepted a debate invitation from Judicial Watch, a
conservative group that is one of the Clinton administration's
harshest critics. The proposed Oct. 20 debate would be on how a new
president can ``return ethics to our government.'' George W. Bush
has yet to accept any debate proposals for the fall. The two
campaigns have squabbled in recent days over the timing and number
of debates between their presidential candidates and between their
running mates. Judicial Watch has filed a series of lawsuits
against the Clinton administration on issues ranging from access to
FBI files to missing White House e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE HEMLINES AND THE STOCK MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader shrugged off a poll that showed him mired in the
single-digits in California. ``They go up and down,'' said Nader,
who is on the biggest fund-raising swing of his campaign. ``Look at
Gore and Bush's numbers in the last few weeks: They go up and
down.'' Nader was in Sacramento, winding up a five-day trip to the
nation's most populous state, a favorite destination of politicians
hunting for campaign cash. The Field Poll showed Nader supported by
4 percent of likely California voters, statistically unchanged from
the 7 percent he drew in a June survey.
</P>
<P>
   SOFT MONEY FLOWS LIKE OIL
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee collected almost $800,000 in
unregulated ``soft money'' donations from energy companies after
George W. Bush tapped Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney as his running
mate. The $791,100 in energy contributions during the last week of
July were part of the $25.2 million in soft money that the RNC took
in last month. Some energy companies had not given any soft money
this year until Cheney joined the ticket. Cheney headed the oil
services company for five years after serving in Congress and as
secretary of defense; Bush also is an ex-oil executive.
</P>
<P>
   IT PAYS TO SAVE
</P>
<P>
   The head of the House Republicans' fund-raising arm is urging
GOP lawmakers to save their campaign treasuries for the fall, not
drain them to respond to Democratic ads now on the air. ``The most
important thing right now is for you to be frugal with your
campaign resources, resources that you will need to control
October,'' Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, head of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, wrote House Republicans this
week. Though it leads in fund-raising, the GOP committee has put
less money in the bank than its Democratic counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   MONUMENTS MADE TO TOPPLE?
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney raised the possibility that some of the new national
monuments created by President Clinton could be reviewed and
possibly rescinded if he and George W. Bush are elected in
November. ``Of course it's not my decision to make. It's the
president-elect who has to make the decision,'' Cheney said. He
said Clinton has used his executive authority ``willy-nilly all
over the West'' to create national monuments covering nearly 4
million acres without considering the desires of the people
affected. Many fear it could harm the Western economy by removing
land from uses like grazing, logging and mining.
</P>
<P>
   CUTTING AWAY ON TAX CUTS
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio, Hillary Clinton's Senate opponent in New York, moved
to distance himself from George W. Bush's tax cut plan by offering
a package that is nearly 40 percent smaller than Bush's. Lazio's
proposal includes a call to allow taxpayers to deduct Social
Security payments from their federal income taxes. Lazio said his
total proposal would save the average New York family about $3,000
a year. This week, Bush has found himself defending the fiscal
prudence of his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut, in the face of
attacks by Democrats and polling data suggesting that the idea has
not stirred much voter interest.
</P>
<P>
   MORE TEXAS INMATES GETTING OUT
</P>
<P>
   The July parole rate in Texas reached its highest point in any
month since George W. Bush became governor in 1994, but the parole
board head, Gerald Garrett, says politics played no role. Nearly 29
percent of eligible convicts were approved for parole in July,
statistics show. A year ago, the figure was 18 percent. The Texas
Department of Criminal Justice said July's parole rate was the
highest for any month since July 1994, when the board approved 31.8
percent of cases considered. Top lawmakers and state officials have
said Texas's $610 million budget overruns are in part to blame on a
higher prison population in county jails because of tougher parole
rules.

 &HT;    The skinny on a central tennessee fitness spa where sweat-soaked
guests lose for less
 &HT;    Eds:Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 27.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNE COUNTY, Tenn. _ The hills are alive with the sound of
groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how much we wail, grunt and pant, the rolling
countryside around the Tennessee Fitness Spa remains serene. It is
another hot, still morning in a week of such mornings, which means
we're on another March of Pain. Grudgingly we trudge toward
Heartbreak Hill, one of several aptly named rises along our walking
course.
</P>
<P>
   Gnats buzz about our ears and eyes, oblivious to our frantic
shooing. Turtles poke their heads out of a trailside pond. Tadpoles
dart to and fro in puddles along the rutted path.
</P>
<P>
   In the spa's emu paddock, a gaggle of pop-eyed ostrich wannabes
look on curiously as we file by, cursing the merciless late summer
sun. Their quizzical stares seem to say, ``Who are these mad
creatures, with their sweaty pelts and pinched faces?''
</P>
<P>
   We are a diverse group _ in age, class and temperament _ who
have come to this 100-acre retreat in Nowheresville, Tenn., 173
miles west of Chattanooga, for reasons various. We are a single
mother from Sandy Springs, Ga., taking a break from the rigors of
raising two kids under 7. We are a professor from Nashville fed up
with being stressed out and grouchy.
</P>
<P>
   We are an Indiana flight attendant looking for a vacation that
doesn't involve getting on a plane _ again! We are a travel writer
for a newspaper that covers Dixie like the dew, on an assignment
that has turned quite personal after a disastrous trip to the
scales.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are fairly fit, some fairly not. Our generational
touchstones range from the World War II to Watergate to Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Different people, united in soreness.
</P>
<P>
   And in purpose. For we don't consider this punishment, but a
means to a reward. Together, we walk for miles and miles along
forested trails and country roads, only to return to the spa
facilities and immediately begin lifting, lunging and stepping.
</P>
<P>
   We subsist on small meals _ scraps, really, compared with our
usual biggie-size rations. Evenings, we collapse exhausted into our
beds at an early hour, so we can get up and do it all again
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Because we all have one goal: to leave a part of ourselves
behind in this bucolic refuge.
</P>
<P>
   A big, jiggly part.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Value
</P>
<P>
   The place is misnamed. That soft, feminine three-letter word _
spa_ just doesn't fit. Suggesting pampering and luxury, it probably
accounts for the dearth of Y chromosomes here on any given day. The
spa averages 30 guests a week, and the ratio of female-to-male
guests is usually around 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing soft about the intense, exhilarating workout
one experiences under the guidance of the gung-ho staff. If you
feel ``pampered'' after one of drill sergeant, excuse me, fitness
director Pam Hampton's aerobics classes, then you've probably come
straight from a Louisiana chain gang.
</P>
<P>
   The backwoods setting doesn't scream ``spa'' either. The
compound is nestled next to a sorghum-slow creek in a thicket of
oak, poplar and sweetgum trees. It sits in front of Natural Bridge,
an awesome double-span rock formation that juts over a natural
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like camp,'' notes Jeanne Fuchs, 50, an elementary school
teacher from Gainesville, Fla. ``I'm an outdoor type of person, so
this appeals to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations are clean but spartan _ no TV in most rooms, and
if you want a phone, you have to rent one. The athletic facilities,
including a junior Olympic-size pool, a racquetball court and a gym
for aerobics and weight training are adequate but would never be
mistaken for a Bally's or Australian Body Works. Meals are served
in a quaint, countrified dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are the requisite facial-manicure-massage services
(which cost extra), but they take a back seat to the central
concept: no-nonsense fitness and nutrition instruction at an
affordable price. One of the cheapest of its kind in the country,
the spa attracts visitors who can't afford to put a foot in
California's Golden Door and other high-end retreats, which can
charge upwards of $5,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are rich people who wouldn't want to come here
_ they would want to go hang out with other rich people,'' says
Sandy Seidel, from Potomac, Md. (There are quite a few teachers
here this week. Could educators be more open to improving
themselves than other professions? Discuss.)
</P>
<P>
   Seidel, 54, isn't drawn to the deluxe lodgings and gourmet fare
offered at the posh spas. ``I don't need fancy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To save money, she caught a Greyhound to Nashville and met the
spa's shuttle there. She booked a bed in one of the four-person
``quads,'' which she shared with two strangers. Meals are included
in the price, so she didn't have to spend big bucks eating out.
``With transportation and everything, it cost me $800 for the
week,'' she says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Even affluent guests appreciate the cut-rate cost. Quoth Ainslie
Todd, aka Mrs. T. Hardy Todd III, a member in good standing of the
Memphis Garden Club: ``All women love a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   An inexpensive alternative to glitzy health retreats was what
owners Joe and Nancy Shaw were counting on when they opened the spa
in 1991. ``I wanted to do something for middle America,'' says Joe
Shaw, who admits that he also wanted to keep the risk low for his
first spa venture.
</P>
<P>
   Born in nearby Lawrenceburg, Shaw, 66, struck it rich as a gold
miner and real estate investor in Alaska before retiring to Florida
in 1980. Remembering Natural Bridge from family trips, he returned
to the once-popular tourist attraction in 1990 and found it ``a
shambles. The weeds were head-high, and all the buildings were
falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, a real estate agent was also visiting the
property that day and told Shaw it was for sale. He snapped it up
and began designing a spa based on others he had visited, including
the National Institute of Fitness (now called Red Mountain) in
Ivins, Utah. He spread the word through ads in fitness magazines
and regional newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled for the first few years,'' Shaw recalls, but says
the business is now profitable. He believes the spa has succeeded
because of its we're-all-in-this-together atmosphere. ``It's very
egalitarian here. Once you get your sweats on, it doesn't matter if
you're worth $5 million or $5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the Coca-Cola stock in the world won't help you when you
face ... the weigh-in.

<P>
   WAYNE COUNTY, Tenn.: you face ... the weigh-in.
</P>
<P>
   A plus-size surprise
</P>
<P>
   This can't be right. Surely the scales must be broken. 185
pounds? But I weighed 155 just recently. OK, 12 years ago, but
still ...
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, the ugly truth: All guests face the dreaded
``fitness assessment'' the day they arrive. The staff weighs you
and takes measurements of your chest, stomach, arms, hips and
thighs, then factors the figures to determine your body fat
percentage. For me, that result is bad enough _ I carry 30 percent
body fat, several notches over the norm. But it's the weight figure
that really smarts.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a window in the weighing room, I could have
watched my reporter's objectivity fly out of it. Suddenly, I'm in
this to lose _ and lose big _ just like my spa-mates.
</P>
<P>
   As I talk with them I begin to hear myself in their confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like to eat carbs and salt,'' admits Molly Wender,
the Sandy Springs single mom. (Don't we all, Molly.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the type of person who is good for three months, then bad
for three months,'' says Patye White, the Indiana flight attendant.
(Been there, sister.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to get away from the refrigerator,'' Walt Inge, a
free-lance medical writer from northeast Atlanta, confides. ``I
work at home, so I'm about five steps away from a big block of
cheddar cheese.'' (Mmmm, cheese.)
</P>
<P>
   Wender, 38, echoes the feelings of anticipation and apprehension
most of us have the first day. ``I'd love to lose weight, but I
don't want to set myself up for disappointment,'' says the pretty,
soft-spoken jewelry designer, who sells her sterling and pearl
pieces at the Dogwood Festival and Dakota J's in Altanta, among
other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Wender's sons, Max, 6, and Sam, 3, are visiting Dad for the
week, giving Mom a rare break to concentrate on herself. ``This is
like a dream,'' she says of her first spa visit. ``I can't believe
I'm really doing this.'' An athletic youngster _ she swam
competitively in high school _ Wender has found that there is
little room for exercise in a mother's hectic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be very careful with my time,'' she says. ``I've
tried to schedule an hour a day for me.'' She hopes the spa stay
will be the beginning of a more consistent fitness regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Most guests, in fact, say they came for a ``jump-start.'' If
that's so, the fitness staff here is more than ready to boost us
into action.
</P>
<P>
   Will work out for food
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't no powderpuff stroll'' reads the caption on one of
the spa's T-shirts. Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day workout program, Monday to Saturday, begins at 8
each morning with the walk. Guests select one of three groups.
``C'' group starts out walking two miles on Monday and works up to
five on Saturday. ``B'' group goes from three to eight miles, and
the superhumans in ``A'' group go from five to 10. Those who find
trekking too strenuous can take water walking classes in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Carolyn Everston started when she first came here
three years ago. ``I was too out of shape to do the walk,'' she
remembers. A research methodology professor at Peabody College in
Nashville, Everston, 65, says she first sought out the spa because
``I was in a high stress job, I had put on weight, and I was always
in a bad mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen visits later (``I come here whenever it gets to be too
much''), she's happier, slimmer, and charging ahead with the ``A''
group.
</P>
<P>
   Torn between macho pride and a fear of overexertion, I choose
``B.'' My main walking buddies for the week are Sharon Ponte, of
Vandalia, Ohio, and Michele Taylor, of Nashville, a mother and
daughter who came here for a little one-on-one time.
</P>
<P>
   We are constantly dropping our birdies.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the loose upraised fists walk director Jeff Holt
informs us we should stride with as if we were cradling baby chicks
_ instead of dangling hands. This promotes upper body toning and
prevents swelling in the fingertips, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have your birdies?'' Holt crows when he sees our hands
go slack. We are also supposed to clutch imaginary quarters between
our ... well, let's just says it's an exercise to tone the gluteal
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   After the walk, we head straight for stretch class, a soothing
half-hour of yoga-style flexing. Then it's back to the grind in a
daunting succession of workouts, including aerobic boxing,
abdominal toning, weight training, indoor volleyball (called
Wallyball), step aerobics and aquacise.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is optional for each _ the staff urges us not to
overdo it, but does suggest we stick to a daily program of two
aerobics classes, a weight-training class and a stretch class,
along with four abs classes during the week. After dinner, there
are more activities, from spirited games of water volleyball to an
aggression-relieving self-defense demonstration by a local police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few days, many of us try to do everything. By
Wednesday, we've learned to take a few much-needed breaks during
the day. ``That's the way it always happens,'' Hampton says. ``By
Thursday afternoon, the gym looks like a ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   The fitness regimen is only half of the equation. We're also on
a strict nutrition plan: 1,000 to 1,200 calories per day, not
counting trips to the all-veggie salad bar (no bacon bits here).
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a starvation diet, but kitchen magicians Angela
Creecy and Belinda Jones make a little go a long way. The simple,
satisfying fare includes omelets and bagels for breakfast, grilled
chicken and taco salads for lunch, spaghetti, lasagna and sauteed
trout for dinner. All meat dishes are made with turkey; vegans can
order one of several tasty tofu entrees. For between-meal snacks,
there are seasoned baked potato wedges and apples.
</P>
<P>
   Though Creecy and Jones serve up a few clunkers _ not even
Emeril could conjure edible French Toast out of low-fat wheat bread
and Egg Beaters _ most meals are downright delicious.
</P>
<P>
   And filling. There are few complaints of hunger, and most of
those potato wedges remain in the mini-fridge. As Inge puts it
midweek, ``I thought I'd being gnawing on the doorknob by now, but
I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing it all back home
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is Judgment Day. After our final walk, we are reweighed
and remeasured to see how many pounds and inches we've shed. Like
the initial assessment, this one is private, but that doesn't stop
everybody from gathering in the rec room to compare stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you do?'' we all ask excitedly, and cheer each other's
losses. Most of us have dropped between 2 and 6 pounds; Seidel took
off 5, Wender, 4. Taylor is celebrating even before she receives
her final body fat count. ``I've lost 5 1/2 pounds, the rest is
gravy,'' she declares, chuckling at the reference to forbidden
food.
</P>
<P>
   I am also 5 1/2 pounds lighter, perhaps a little more after I
burn a bunch of calories doing a happy-dance around the scales. And
my body fat has plummeted. OK, it's down 2 percent, but still, I
feel like Kate Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Even the people who didn't lose very much seem to think it's all
been worth it. White, who arrived in good shape, parted with only
three-quarters of a pound. Nevertheless, she says, ``This is the
best vacation I've had in my life. I love the way my days were
filled, I love the way my mind was healed, and I love the
camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fast friendships have bloomed all over the place. Like
kids at camp, we've forged attachments that look to last. At the
final lunch on Saturday, we're already reminiscing about our time
together.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget Mary Ellen Borgelt, of Austin, Texas, crooning
loudly along to ``Breaking Up Is Hard to Do'' in aquacise class? Or
Flower Fajardo, of Tampa, razzing Holt during a particularly fierce
game of Wallyball (``Your team should be called the cow pies!'').
Or Todd sneaking into the kitchen to nab a pan of low-fat cookies
to munch on while we watched ``Sleepy Hollow'' in the TV room, only
to sputter in disgust when I took them back. (``You'll thank me at
your final assessment!'' I responded, taking a stab at being the
voice of reason while wilting under her hot scowl.)
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Sandy Springs a few days later, Wender is suffering
from spa withdrawal. ``I miss it,'' she confesses, talking on the
phone as she prepares lunch for Max and Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trip, she had steeled herself against
disappointment, but now says, ``I'm only disappointed that I had to
leave. I just loved exercising and being out in the country. It
helped me get my head in the right place to achieve my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   We both admit we'd like to lose a couple to 20 pounds more, and
discuss our efforts to continue the program. I've been walking four
miles in the morning, Wender's been alternating walks with
abdominal workouts. Our eating habits are also getting an overhaul:
Wender has motored to Harry's Farmer's Market in Alpharetta to
stock up on tofu and soy, while I came straight home and threw out
the full-fat mayonnaise. Bonding over shared objectives, we make
plans to go on occasional walks together.
</P>
<P>
   If you see us out around Stone Mountain or Piedmont Park, stop
and say hi. You'll recognize us by the determined look on our
faces.
</P>
<P>
   And our newly baggy workout clothes.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Medical use of human embryos makes for challenging debate
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It seems, on its face, a step too far down a dangerous
road. The idea of destroying living human embryos so we can extract
cells to be used for medical research and treatment ... we can't go
there, no matter what benefits it might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Except...
</P>
<P>
   Except that the human embryos in question already exist and are
already being destroyed, even in the absence of stem-cell research.
As part of the process of in vitro fertilization, the increasingly
popular technique that allows infertile couples to have children,
more embryos are created than can be implanted. At the moment,
those surplus embryos are simply being destroyed and thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, embryonic stem cells might help the crippled to
walk again. They might restore minds lost to the ravages of
diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or to strokes. They
might also offer a cure to diseases such as juvenile diabetes and
some forms of cancer. In time, they may even be able to restore the
functions of almost any failing organ in the human body. Stem cells
have the potential capacity to perform all those healing miracles
because they can divide and create almost any kind of cell present
in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of people, none of those ``excepts'' matters much. I
can understand their feeling. But for others _ me included _ they
do make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we are willing to ban in vitro fertilization _ and nobody
in power is talking seriously about such a step _ human embryos
will continue to be created and discarded on a regular basis. Those
embryos are not being created for the purpose of being destroyed or
exploited; they are being created in honest hope of helping a
loving family bring a child into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once those embryo have been created for a good purpose, and once
it has been determined that their purpose has been served and they
are destined to be destroyed, the moral landscape changes. We then
face a choice of simply discarding the embryos, or using them as
sources for cells that can be used to save human lives.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health _ after a year-long process of
consultation with scientists, ethicists, religious and political
leaders and the general public _ has issued guidelines that dictate
how federally funded stem-cell research will be conducted. The
rules reflect a sober appreciation of the moral dangers and
potential benefits involved in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NIH funding guidelines, it would be illegal to create
embryos for the purpose of conducting stem-cell research or for
treatment. Only embryos that are created for the purposes of in
vitro fertilization, frozen for storage and then destined for
destruction could be diverted to such research. And to avoid the
commercialization of potential human life, embryos cannot be bought
or sold for purposes of research; they can only be donated.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH process _ and the dignity with which it was conducted _
can serve as an important model as we confront similarly complex
questions already on the horizon. The unraveling of the human
genetic code, for example, is certain to raise issues that our
existing moral guidelines do not address. Like stem-cell research,
genetic engineering spotlights the chasm that sometimes exists
between what we can do, and what we ought to do.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving such issues cannot be left to scientists alone; they
can and must play a role, but they are not equipped to make that
kind of decision for the rest of us, and it would be unfair to dump
that burden on them.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly, politicians can't handle the task either, at least
not without some help. Although in many cases the ultimate decision
will lay in the hands of elected leaders, they will need the
technical guidance of scientists and the moral direction of
religious leaders and ethicists. They'll also have to do some
searching of their own souls to guard against exploiting such
serious issues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.), for example, opposes use of
embryonic stem cells for either research or medical treatment.
That's a responsible, understandable position, founded in his
belief that human life begins at conception, even when that
conception occurs in a test tube. Unfortunately, however, Dickey is
unwilling to credit those who disagree with any similar degree of
thoughtfulness on the matter. In fact, after the NIH guidelines
were announced, Dickey dismissed them as a political ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration didn't have to bring this up right in the
middle of the election,'' he complained. ``Their concern is not so
much with science as it is with promoting the Clinton-Gore
pro-abortion agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that political gain might be wrung from such an issue
is of course nonsense. But Dickey's accusation does illustrate the
danger inherent in debating such complex, heated issues in a
political context. A little mutual respect for the opinions of
others might go a long way as we wrestle with the challenges coming
our way.

BRINGING NEW ORDER TO SUNBEAM'S CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By JANE TANNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ In the last two and a half years, Jerry Levin
has managed to bring some order to the chaos that once prevailed at
the Sunbeam Corp., the household appliance maker that installed him
as chief executive after the notorious ouster of Albert Dunlap in
1998. But it has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited a company that, after Dunlap's abrupt
reorganization, had factories that were in disarray, employees who
were demoralized and retailers who were infuriated.
</P>
<P>
   A former chief executive of both Revlon Inc. and the Coleman
Co., Levin, 56, was sent in by Ronald Perelman, the billionaire
financier who owns 34.5 percent of Sunbeam. Among Levin's burdens:
interest costs on $1.6 billion in long-term debt and $800 million
in zero-coupon bonds due in 2018 but redeemable in three years,
losses of $1.2 billion over the past two years and a continuing
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into accusations
of accounting fraud that date from 1998. Dunlap has not gone away,
either. He contends that the company owes him $5 million in back
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Also clouding the picture is a consolidated shareholder lawsuit
that was filed after Sunbeam's stock fell 50 percent in one month
in early 1998. On Aug. 17 of this year, the stock hit a new low,
$1.75, and it closed at $2.06 on Friday. The suit contends, among
other things, that the company misrepresented the health of the
operations and future prospects to inflate the price of the stock.
A trial is set for next June.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil, analysts and shareholders give Levin credit
for improving operations. William Steele, an analyst at Banc of
America Securities, pointed to a number of signs of health,
including increased cash generated from sales _ $28 million, up
from $20 million last quarter _ and increased manufacturing
efficiency, demonstrated by Levin's ability to keep the gross
margin flat despite a 3 percent decline in revenue last quarter.
``My belief is that they are working their way up,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his early days at Sunbeam, Levin said that on his
second day, he started calling the chief executives of major
discount retailers, like Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart, to begin
repairing fractured relationships. ``Once they finished venting, it
was my turn to beg,'' Levin said last week in an interview at
Sunbeam's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's most immediate challenge is the debt. The company's fate
is precarious until it can be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   He has held lenders at bay _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, First
Union National Bank and Bank of America have a $1.7 billion IOU due
in 2005 and 2006 _ and installed executives to rev up the product
segments. He is creating joint licensing agreements. And he
recently sold Eastpak, the backpack maker, for $89.9 million to the
VF Corp. Earlier this month, Levin also put up for sale a unit that
makes electric clippers and other products for barbers and animal
groomers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more: He tossed out product lines like a water
purifier that had been heralded as a $100 million revenue generator
but whose sales proved to be disappointing. And he pumped more than
$60 million into research and development that now is putting new
products on the shelves. Those include fuel-cell-powered generators
that are scheduled to go on sale next year, as well as linked,
high-technology household products like an alarm clock that
automatically starts a coffee maker. The company also introduced a
new line of Coleman outdoor grills and updated versions of pressure
washers for contractors and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   It may all be meaningless, however, if Levin cannot reduce the
debt. In the first half of this year, with interest expenses of
$109 million, the company lost $139.6 million on sales of $1.15
billion. This summer, Sunbeam had cash and cash equivalents of
$25.9 million versus total debt of $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot, well-known brands like Coffee, Coleman and Oster
may end up on the auction block. If Levin succeeds, however, his
long-term plan for recovery has a chance. ``Jerry's plan is well
thought out _ getting it executed is another thing,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   The first challenge is to restructure the bonds that the company
sold in March 1998 to provide cash to buy Coleman, the camping
outfitter. ``Now that we feel the businesses are fixed and doing
well, this is No. 1 on our list,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be. If Sunbeam cannot swap the notes for bonds with
different terms, bondholders could take control of the company.
Under current provisions, bondholders could start calling in their
chips in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam cannot pay cash because covenants with lenders forbid
it; the company has to offer stock. But if Sunbeam were to satisfy
the redemptions, bondholders could end up holding 61 percent of the
stock. The biggest loser would be Perelman, who owns 37 million
shares and has long looked to Levin as a strategist and turnaround
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Sunbeam made an initial offer to bondholders that could
have called in $500 million in debt, but when the offer expired on
Aug. 7, there were few takers. Sunbeam has extended the offer to
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But even Levin does not expect bondholders to accept the offer.
He has been flying around the country, meeting with them one on one
to negotiate a deal. The rub for bondholders is that the offer on
the table gives them only a 23 percent interest in the company, or
34.2 million shares. ``Sunbeam didn't offer them enough of the
company,'' said Shawn Foley, a bond analyst at Merrill Lynch Global
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Sunbeam was offering the same terms for all the
bondholders. Those who bought in initially at $37.42 on $100 do not
want to swap out on the same terms as speculators who more recently
paid just $5 to $10, said Jonathan S. Mack, a lawyer in Minneapolis
for four firms that got into the original bond offer and who filed
a lawsuit contending fraud similar to that claimed in the
stockholders' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Many shareholders besides Perelman are unhappy about inevitable
further stock dilution in any deal with bondholders. ``You know it
needs to be done, but you hate to get more diluted,'' says Douglas
Herold, a securities analyst at Invista Capital Management, a
subsidiary of the Principal Financial Group. Invista is the
third-largest shareholder, with six million shares, though it sold
about one million during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the bonds, there are tens of millions of stock
options floating around; many are exercisable at $7 a share.
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes, Perelman's company, has warrants to buy 23
million shares of common stock at $7 a share, part of a settlement
it made with Sunbeam after the stock price plummeted after the
purchase of Coleman. Lawsuits by other shareholders are challenging
that settlement. Other Coleman shareholders received warrants to
buy 4.98 million shares and lawyers in the case received 498,000
for fees and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When Levin and other top executives joined Sunbeam in the summer
of 1998, they received 2.8 million options exercisable at $7. Most
are Levin's. In the three-year contract that Levin signed in
January, he received options to buy three million shares at $4.125
each.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty about dilution has kept Sunbeam's stock in the
subbasement. ``It's difficult for Wall Street to come in and make
this investment,'' Levin conceded. ``They don't know how many
shares are going to be outstanding. It's hard to calculate. They
can take it right down to earnings, but can't take it down to
earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we give Wall Street some guidance about what we've done
to our capital structure,'' Levin added, ``it's a gamble, it's a
bet, it's a risk.''

 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.
 &HT;    A face behind the statistics
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They called themselves the Knights of the Round
Table, my dad and his poker-playing cronies. Every Wednesday night,
after the Lions Club meeting, the round poker table would be
liberated from its hiding place, and the knights would joust.
</P>
<P>
   They played some crazy games with names like Dr Pepper (10s, 2s,
and 4s wild); something called 7-Up (never did understand that one)
and Baseball (3s and 9s wild, and if you draw a four, you get
another card).
</P>
<P>
   Like sharks, the knights were fascinating to watch, but you
didn't want to get in among them.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a tight-knit group that they mostly took turns
winning. Like Blanche DuBois, the knights lived off the kindness of
strangers. ``There was this guy from San Antonio who got in our
game once. Said he was going to teach us how to play poker. And we
let him,'' Dad recounted on more than one occasion. ``All it cost
him to teach us was about $400.''
</P>
<P>
   Those games required card sense, knowledge of the other players
and nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Dad never had much money. He certainly didn't have a lot of
education. But in his heyday, he had nerve.
</P>
<P>
   In spades.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Dec. 14, 1919, in San Angelo to Crecencio and
Concepcion Garcia, the oldest boy in a family of eight children
(one of whom died in childhood). Growing up Latino in the Texas of
that era was a daily and daunting challenge. His father pulled him
out of school in the sixth grade and put him to work to help
support that big family.
</P>
<P>
   That background, combined with service in World War II and an
insatiable reading appetite, taught him lessons about life and
living you can't buy at the Harvard Business School. He worked for
more than 30 years as a salesman for an office supply and printing
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's wry West Texas wit made him a storyteller of the first
rank. He always had an ice-breaking quip, joke or observation to
charm his customers, friends and acquaintances. He used words the
way an artist uses a paintbrush. Dad described the drubbing handed
one of his candidates this way: ``That fella plowed up a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked on a lot of local campaigns, worked the Viva Kennedy
and Viva Johnson efforts in the 1960s. He was on the first Office
of Economic Opportunity board in Tom Green County. He served
frequently on grand juries and was tapped often for civic boards
and commissions. He was an officer in the American GI Forum and
president of his Lions Club. He is a good father to my sisters
Cynthia and Rebecca. He is a wise and loyal friend and one of my
best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, a group of the town's power brokers urged
him to run for the City Council. They told him he wouldn't have to
worry about money or opposition, he recounted. All he had to do was
say ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With all those assurances, I asked then, why did he refuse them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I told them that I don't have much education and I
didn't want to embarrass them or me. But, son, talk is cheap. They
can't control everybody and they can't really guarantee that the
money will be there. And if I run and lose, they won't need me
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me and winked: ``Better kingmaker than king.''
</P>
<P>
   I've got a million funny Dad stories, but I want to share these
few with you because there was another story about him in the
newspaper last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was the report on the rise of diabetes in the United States.
Almost 16 million Americans have diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Dad is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Complications from the diabetes, which has been his unwanted
companion for the past 30 years, dealt this knight a mighty blow
last year. So debilitated is he by the disease that he lost
mobility as well as his ability to communicate coherently. The man
who loved to tell stories can't tell us where he hurts. My mother
and his wife of 53 years was forced to make the heart-breaking
decision of putting him in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   So, as he begins this new stage of his life, I thought I would
introduce him to you. To politicians and researchers, he's just
another health statistic.
</P>
<P>
   But he's my dad.

   MEXICO-ARGENTINE _ MEXICO CITY - A high-profile Argentine
businessman in Mexico has confessed to police that he is the same
man who is wanted by a Spanish judge on alleged charges of murder,
torture and other crimes during Argentina's ``dirty war'' against
the left in the late 1970s, according to Mexico's Reforma
Newspaper. Although he had changed his name slightly and aged,
Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was accused by Reforma of being a former
intelligence officer back in Argentina who was identified by
victims. Cavallo is the director of a controversial privately-run
national car registry program in Mexico to prevent car thefts.
Ironically, one of the accusations against him is stealing victims'
cars. Spanish lawyers are reportedly demanding that Mexico deport
Cavallo to Spain - a move resembling the attempt to extradite
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to face similar accusations by
the same Spanish judge. Cavallo was detained Thursday by Mexican
police as he was attempting to board a flight from Cancun to
Argentina, where former military officials now enjoy an amnesty
against crimes. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

   RUSSIA-NAVY _ MURMANSK, Russia _ Take a look out towards cold
waves of the Barents Sea from this Arctic city, and the problems of
the Russian navy become clear. Dozens of rusting hulks of
submarines and ships sit idle, mothballed by a crippled economy
that has made them _ and the men that serve on the vessels _
increasingly difficult to keep afloat. Unlike in the United States,
where the presence of a naval base is a boon to the local economy,
Murmansk has little to boast about from the base here. The home of
the ill-fated Kursk submarine that sank to the bottom of the
Barents Sea with 118 crew members is a sad example of the problems
and concerns (both within, and without Russia) that surround
Russia's military. Developing. (Coker, Cox News Service).

After 10 days on the road with the North Fayetteville Moyes in

Bonneville is the first super-dam Franklin Roosevelt decided to

real world? Is Mach-The-Knife really the corporate trainer of the

DARIA NEVER SLIPS IN `FALL'

<P>
   Daria Morgendorffer may be the only teen-ager who has no use for
summer vacation, but she makes a compelling case for her viewpoint
in the MTV movie ``Daria: Is It Fall Yet?'' Daria, who has had her
own MTV series for three years after escaping from ``Beavis and
Butt-Head,`` extends her trademark deadpan sardonicism to feature
length and proves, as did her former acquaintances with ``B&AMP;B Do
America,'' that a one-note shtick can play that long if handled
delicately and smartly.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, Daria is overjoyed at the prospect of three
solid months of slacking and moping. Her parents, on the other
hand, have other ideas, signing her up to be a counselor at an
irksomely precious, insanely politically correct children's camp,
the OK-to-Cry-Corral. Her buddy Jane, who's still miffed at her for
stealing her boyfriend Tom _ Daria with a boyfriend? Who'd have
guessed she'd ever do anything so proactive? _ heads to a
pretentious art camp, where she's propositioned by a bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   Daria's airhead sister Quinn is subjected to a tutor's
attentions, but much to her mystification, finds she enjoys
intelligence, if it's also cute. And Kevin and Brittany, the class
airheads (and most popular kids), endanger lives as pool
lifeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Daria experiences much angst _ over her
boyfriend, who comes from an overprivileged, overmoneyed family,
and over a distraught, disaffected young boy she counsels at camp,
a younger version of her who hasn't yet learned to greet life with
a stiff smile and a caustic rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is It Fall Yet?'' is, like Daria, smart and low-key and
fatalistic in a bizarrely life-affirming way. The virtually
clip-art nature of the stylized graphics and minimal animation suit
the satiric tone of the show, and this film, perfectly. Like
``Beavis'' before her, ``Daria'' tells her youthful MTV audience
that most teens are essentially idiots, but from her point of view,
the smart kids get the last laugh. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Daria: Is It Fall Yet?'' &QL; 
What: Animated feature starring the sardonic refugee from ``Beavis
and Butt-Head.'' &QL; 
Where: MTV. &QL; 
When: 7 tonight. &QL;

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS AT IMAX
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: 2 Fact boxes below) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a large-format camera, computer-generated images and
quality 3D production, the opportunities to thrill moviegoers are
bounded only by the filmmaker's imagination, as is evident with
``Alien Adventure,'' now playing at Loews Universal Studios IMAX
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The history of three-dimensional art and film is the subject of
its companion piece, ``3-D Mania: Encounter in the Third
Dimension,'' an informative but less imaginative film from the same
Belgian company, nWave Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien Adventure'' brings a band of space gypsies to Earth in
search of a new home. The leader, speaking in the ancient French
dialect known as Walloon, dispatches two reconaissance teams to
check it out.
</P>
<P>
   The four bumbling aliens think they have touched down in a
modern metropolis, but instead they have landed in Adventure
Planet, a soon-to-open amusement park with state-of-the-art
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   With the large format, the subjective camera angle, 3D
projection and top-of-the-line LCD viewer headsets synchronized
with the projectors, the aliens' journey through four rides _
Arctic Adventure, Magic Carpet, Kid Coaster and Aqua Adventure _ is
the ultimate you-are-there cinematic experience.
</P>
<P>
   That's a great thing if you're the kind of person who dashes for
the front seat on the first run of any new thrill ride. It can be
difficult if you're the type who gets motion-sick on an escalator.
(I admit my churning stomach forced me to close my eyes a few
times, but the parts I saw were spectacular.)
</P>
<P>
   The Arctic Adventure in particular, in which a sled follows ice
blocks through flumes and chutes, is what a good ride might be like
while the conceptual, artistic types have free rein, before all
those practical-minded engineers suck all the fun out of it. It has
a few gravity-defying, plane-warping M.C. Escher moments in which
one thinks, ``How did I get here from there?''
</P>
<P>
   Kid Coaster is a lot of fun, with riders scaled about the size
of Lego men in a roller coaster through a boy's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The ``human'' animation looks stilted, but it's used only
briefly on characters that are fixtures of the Magic Carpet Ride.
As for the aliens, who can say whether their animation is
unnatural?
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien Adventure'' is the first fully digital feature length
giant-screen film released, and it has set the bar very high for
those that will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``3-D Mania: Encounter in the Third Dimension'' better fits the
mold of most large-format films, instructing its audience while
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   It looks at the history of three-dimensional art, from
Renaissance canvases to stereoscope photographs and viewers to the
Lumiere brothers' 1903 film ``L'Arrivee du Train,'' in which a
locomotive appeared to plow out of the screen, sending moviegoers
of that time shrieking from the theater.
</P>
<P>
   It showcases some of the 65-plus 3D films Hollywood cranked out
from 1952 to 1954, and it explains how filming with two lenses set
about 2 1/2 inches apart _ the same distance between an average
person's eyes _ fools the brain into perceiving depth on the flat
theater screen.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in the digitally created Institute of 3-D
Technology, which has an appealing Jules Verne look. Unfortunately,
the main characters are too standardized _ the absent-minded
professor (Stuart Pankin) and his hovering-robot assistant Max, who
could represent the darker side of the more likeable Weebo in
``Flubber.''
</P>
<P>
   When the professor finally works the bugs out of his
Real-O-Vision contraption, out pops Cassandra Peterson in her
Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, persona, to strut through a song and
dance about haunted houses. She burns through the fog of the film's
instructional tone, even while her infamous bust stays
two-dimensional.

   Although ``Survivor'' is over it still goes on and on and on ...
</P>
<P>
   First of all, for all of you who didn't get enough of it or want
to see what you missed or simply want to study the winner Richard
Hatch's moves so you can apply them to getting ahead at the office,
the record-breaking summer series will be repeated by CBS as
counter-programming to NBC's Olympic coverage in September.
</P>
<P>
   (On the other hand the Olympics, which are in Sydney, can be
used as a subtle reminder that ``Survivor II'' will take place in
the Australian outback. ``Survivor II'' will premiere following the
Super Bowl in January, and the record advertising prices that CBS
is expected to charge already has the network execs salivating.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime the perfect soundtrack for your own backyard
Tribal Council arrives Tuesday with the release of the ``Survivor''
album.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie, exotic score from the show was penned by 1995 new-age
Grammy winner Russ Landau and TV composer David Vanacore. It's the
the first in a planned series of ``Survivor'' albums.
</P>
<P>
   With titles like ``The Strong Will Survive,'' ``Survivor Yell''
``Tally the Vote,'' slap on this 19-track disc, light up a tiki
lamp, roast a couple of rats and vote one of your family members
out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corporate trainer Hatch, faces another challenge,
this time as a presenter at MTV's 17th annual Video Music Awards on
Sept. 7 at New York's Radio City Music Hall. He joins Chris Rock,
Sting, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and others. (Who should we vote out of
this crowd?)
</P>
<P>
   And for you literate minded, there's a ``Survivor'' book on the
way. ``Survivor: The Ultimate Game'' co-written by the series'
producer, Mark Burnett, hits bookstores Sept. 12. It recounts the
story and offers advice to potential contestants on future
``Survivor'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   A few chapters are now available on the Internet at
www.contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Booked for a good cause: Country radio KZLA-FM (93.9) is
sponsoring a children's book drive at Sunday's Clint Black show at
the Greek Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending are asked to bring a new kids book for the Los
Angeles Children's Hospital library.
</P>
<P>
   KZLA air staff and Black himself will be on hand to present a
donation from the ``Clint Black Book Drive'' to representatives of
the hospital outside the Greek at 6 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week at various KZLA events around town, listeners
have been donating books.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital library gives away around 2,500 books a year in
their ``Reach Out and Read'' therapeutic program.
</P>
<P>
   The concert takes place at 7:30 p.m. Sunday. Ticket information:

Supervisor is Pat Ryan (888-346-9867).
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-LATIN-AMERICA (Dallas) _ Gov. George W. Bush, in Miami on
Friday morning, charged that the Clinton administration had
neglected Latin American relations and ``squandered'' opportunities
to expand trade in the region, and he pledged to put countries in
Central and South America at the top of his foreign policy
priorities. Later in the day, Bush traveled to Dallas for a private
meeting with Vincente Fox, the president-elect of Mexico. By Frank
Bruni.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-TAX (Washington) _ In the shorthand of presidential
politics, Gov. George W. Bush's big tax cut proposal is either an
overdue effort to return to taxpayers what is rightfully theirs,
or, as Vice President Al Gore would put it, a risky scheme to
reward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   EMULEX-PLUNGE (New York) _ At 10:13 a.m. Friday, investors in
Emulex, a California company that makes fiber-optic communications
equipment, got some terrible news. Bloomberg News, a leading
financial news service, was reporting that Emulex had announced its
chief executive had resigned and the company planned to restate its
earnings for the last two years. Details would follow _ at 5:00
p.m., after stock markets had closed for the weekend. Investors
rushed to shed their shares, and Emulex stock promptly went into
freefall, plunging from 103 to 45 in 15 minutes. The drop stripped
more than $2 billion in Emulex's market valuation before the Nasdaq
stock market halted trading in Emulex stock. There was only one
problem with the story. It was not true. It was the latest _ and
most devastating _ in a lengthening string of fake press releases
and other hoaxes that are increasingly roiling the financial
markets. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   BURUNDI-CLINTON (Nairobi, Kenya) _ In December, Nelson Mandela
took on one of Africa's most frightening problems: the tiny and
beautiful country of Burundi, where Hutu and Tutsi have taken turns
massacring each other in the thousands for the last 40 years. Rumor
was that he accepted the task reluctantly, but he has worked hard
and pushed enemies near to a settlement. They are not there yet,
and that will present a dilemma when President Clinton arrives in
Tanzania on Monday to meet with Mandela and Burundi's leaders. By
Mandela's rigid timetable, the Burundians were to seal their
intention to end seven years of civil war in an accord signed in
front of Clinton and several dozen other heads of state. By Ian
Fisher.

</P>
<P>
   WEST-FIREFIGHTERS (Challis, Idaho) _ They head out before dawn
and trudge home after dark, weary and covered in soot, still
clutching the shovels and axes that are their weapons. For
thousands of firefighters across the West, these will be their
memories of summer 2000, a season so devastating that commanders
say they cannot help but see it as a war. By Douglas Jehl.

By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joan Jett stood outside the 31st Street VIP entrance
to Madison Square Garden at 7 p.m. on Thursday, looking fierce and
impatient. ``Let's go!'' she said, clapping, glancing at her
longtime manager and musical collaborator, Kenny Laguna. ``The
girls are already warming up!''
</P>
<P>
   Jett, the goddess of tight-leathered '80s rock, is such a
devoted fan of the WNBA's New York Liberty, that it pains her to
miss even a second of the team's preliminary shoot-around. What
Jack Nicholson is to the Los Angeles Lakers, Jett is to the
Liberty, a superfan and courtside fixture whose spirited cheering
seems to bring the home team luck. Jett's seat in the Garden for
every Liberty game is the same one occupied by Woody Allen at
Knicks games. While Allen always seems to be skulking moodily
beneath a floppy fishing cap, Jett is as loud and demonstrative as
she is on stage at one of her rock shows.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's Game 1 was crucial in the best-of-three playoff
against the Liberty's nemesis, the Houston Comets, the reigning
WNBA champs. And if the streets of Manhattan lacked the general
frenzy of a springtime Knicks playoff run, you wouldn't know it
once you stepped inside the Garden. These hoops stars may wear
ponytails with color-coordinated scrunchies, but for celebrities
like Jett, the Liberty has become the hottest sports ticket in
town. The talk show host Rosie O'Donnell, the actress Rosie Perez
and the rapper Queen Latifah are devotees of Liberty home games.
Men turn out, too: actors like Gregory Hines, Michael Imperioli and
the Baldwin brothers are frequently spotted in courtside seats.
Still, no one has come to embody the bulldog devotion to the
Liberty like Jett, rock's proto-riot grrrl.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she arrived, as Spike Lee often does at Knicks games,
decked out in every piece of officially sanctioned team regalia.
Jett looked very East Village, all tattoos and silver tribal
jewelry. She wore tight black leather jeans, of course, and a tank
top that said Dare Devil Tattoos. And though it was a steamy August
evening, the lithe, petite former brunette (her head has been
shaved for several months) sported a tiny black wool hat that was
somewhere between a longshoreman's cap and a yeshiva boy's
skullcap. Upon entering the Garden lobby, she was greeted by a
chorus of school girls shouting ``Hey, Joan!'' and ``We love your
new song!''
</P>
<P>
   On the escalator, Jett turned back to the crowd and offered a
word of advice: ``Be loud tonight! Everybody, be loud!'' Then she
and Laguna took their courtside seats, immediately behind the
official scorekeeper and announcer, and Jett began to shout
encouragement to Liberty players as they ran onto the Garden floor.
``We got the home court advantage, guys, don't forget it!'' she
said. Just before the opening, ``Unfinished Business,'' the Liberty
fight song Jett wrote in the vein of her ``I Love Rock and Roll,''
began blaring.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lobo, a Liberty star who is missing the playoffs because
of an injury, came by in her cornrows and a smart brown pantsuit _
``Your song's fantastic,'' she said, touching Jett lightly on the
hip.
</P>
<P>
   The game did not begin auspiciously for the hometown heroes.
Houston opened up an early lead, while the Liberty kept missing
easy chances. Jett led a raucous chant of ``L-I-B-E-R-T-Y!'' Then
she turned to berate her companion. ``You should have your butt up
yelling,'' she told Laguna, who with his graying blond hair and
glasses, black T-shirt and chunky gold chain, looked like a cross
between an aging 60s rocker and an extra on ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would but I don't know how to spell,'' Laguna said,
shrugging. As the Liberty sank further behind in the score, Jett
began a ferocious shout of ``Dee-fence!'' trying to psyche out the
Houston ballhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   Laguna explained, ``She totally believes her chants affect the
opposition _ like a hex.''
</P>
<P>
   Halftime brought no beer break for Jett. A WNBA official slipped
her a computer printout of the first-half statistics, which she
studied intently. Then she scanned the Garden, which was packed
with 19,500 fans, spotting many NBA stars: Stephon Marbury of the
Nets and Marcus Camby, the Knicks forward, cradling a baby boy
sucking a pacifier.
</P>
<P>
   For the Liberty, the second half began just as bleakly as the
first. But Jett kept trying to find something to root for. When a
third foul was announced on Houston's Tiffani Johnson, Jett jumped
up and screamed at the official: ``That's her fourth! That's her
fourth!''
</P>
<P>
   The scorekeeper realized his error; and the announcer, turning
to smile at Jett, acknowledged: ``Tiffani Johnson _ that's her
fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They get it wrong sometimes,'' Jett said, proudly.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, Jett's ``Unfinished Business'' fired up again, the video
projected overhead. Suddenly, the Liberty had new momentum; players
began making steals and converting layups; they closed to within
two points. Jett's fists clenched as she bounded up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the end, the Houston squad proved too disciplined, and
Cynthia Cooper, the Comets standout guard, drove a dagger through
the Liberty's heart with a final basket and free throw. The buzzer
sounded. Houston, 59; New York, 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough, but not impossible,'' Jett said,
contemplating the odds of the New York team winning two consecutive
games on the road. She and Laguna were leaving the next morning for
Houston, and Jett said she would be just as vocal, on the Comets'
home court. ``I'm gonna be just like this, except it's in
Houston,'' she said. ``Let's see if those Texas fans don't try to
kill me.''

FED CHIEF SEEN LEANING TOWARD `NEW ECONOMY' THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Alan Greenspan become a ``new economy'' convert?
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman seemed to move deep into that camp
in a speech Friday to an influential group of US economists who
met, as they do each August, in scenic Jackson Hole, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments held significance for monetary policy, Fed
watchers said, because they indicated his strengthening conviction
that a stunning surge in the productivity of US workers will
persist as a powerful check on inflation, ensuring that the
longest-running expansion in US history has no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The swing in the chairman's views made some economists nervous
that the Fed may even become too accommodating if his concerns
about inflation lessen.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, new economy advocates argue that the US economy
has undergone fundamental change in recent years, due to
unprecedented investments by corporate America in desktop
computers, servers, and assembly-line technology. Technology has
made US office and factory workers more productive, which, in turn,
has kept down companies' costs _ and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan agreed with that view, saying that technology
investment has ``stepped up the pace of capital deepening and
increased productivity growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that it would be ``difficult to find credible
evidence in the United States that the rate of structural
productivity growth has stopped increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's brief remarks about productivity, embedded in a
speech about capitalism's global reach, elaborated on reasons
hinted at this week, after Fed board members voted against an
increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on Tuesday was the second in which members did not
act, halting a year-long campaign to cool an overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in
New York, said Fed inaction Tuesday and on June 28 may indicate
Greenspan has prevailed over the more hawkish board members. Fed
governor Laurence Meyer, for one, has argued for aggressive an
interest-rate policy to preempt inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, a leading proponent of new economy ideas, said
Greenspan, in Friday's speech and in his July congressional
testimony, ``seems to be more and more convinced that the rebound
in productivity growth is sustainable, that's it's not just a
temporary, cyclical phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's main point was about the world economy and the
profound impact of technology and globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the meaningfully different views initially held of the
way the world does _ and should _ work, powerful global competitive
forces appear for now to be driving the economic and legal
paradigms of many nations into closer alignment around a more
competitive market capitalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his views on productivity that analysts said differed
sharply from a year ago. In July 1999, in testimony to Congress,
Greenspan said that ``history counsels us to be quite modest about
our ability to project the future path and pace of technology and
its implications for productivity and economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The new economy theory has gained credence in recent months as
productivity continues to rise. But it is still controversial among
academic and Wall Street economists, making Greenspan's remarks
Friday all the more surprising, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan keeps getting increasingly in awe of these new
economy factors,'' said Nicholas Perna, an economic consultant in
Ridgefield, Conn. But Perna said the country has not yet seen the
full effects on inflation of rising wages, due to a tight labor
market, or of the recent run-up in oil prices. ``This doesn't
happen instantaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, as always, hedged his views, saying productivity
would eventually crest and fade, as it has in the past. But, he
added, at present ``such a shortfall is not anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the US Department of Labor reported this month that
American workers' productivity increased at a blockbuster 5.3
percent annual rate during the second quarter, April through June.
</P>
<P>
   That was an acceleration from already-high rates, boosting the
one-year productivity gain to 5.1 percent, its highest since 1983,
when the current golden era of economic growth first got under way.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, yearly productivity gains were about 1.5 percent
during the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Fed said that it would leave the federal funds
interest rate, an overnight rate, unchanged at 6.5 percent. To
explain the vote, the Fed cited productivity for boosting the
nation's ``potential growth rate'' and ``containing costs and
holding down underlying price pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said such strong gains in productivity are unusual,
if not unprecedented. Productivity typically picks up speed in the
early years of an expansion. This time, it has persisted _ and even
gained strength _ as the expansion has matured.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that the advent of the railroads and the laying
of tracks from East to West in the 19th century ``helped elevate
economic growhth for a considerable period fo time. But the pace of
growth eventually slowed when full or near-full exploitation of the
newer techologies was achieved.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 27, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-AFRICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ This weekend, on a return
engagement in Africa, President Clinton is singing the praises of
President Olusegan Obasanjo of Nigeria, a former general who was
elected last year in Africa's most populous country. The Clinton
administration has seized on Obasanjo, whose victory ended years of
military dictatorship, as an anchor of democratic stability in
restive West Africa. But there are risks. Obasanjo presides over a
country that is fractured north from south by Islamic extremism.
Nigeria is the second-most corrupt nation on earth, according to
Transparency International, a nonprofit group based in Germany. The
former general's record on human rights has already been stained,
and his top aides have been selling their influence. By Blaine
Harden. (Will move in ``i'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   VOTER-TURNOUT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What if they gave an election
and everyone came? Turnout in the last three American presidential
elections has hovered at around half of the nation's voting-age
population, which has prompted a good deal of national
hand-wringing. It's obvious that if everyone eligible voted this
November, the number of ballots cast would roughly double. But
would all those millions of additional votes change the outcome for
the main contenders, George W. Bush and Al Gore? By Michael R.
Kagay. (Will move in ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   TIRE-DISPOSAL-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The deaths and injuries
attributed to failed Firestone tires are horrific, but recalling
6.5 million tires poses another problem: What to do with them once
they are taken off Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and other
light trucks? If someone figured out a way to stack the tires in a
column at a landfill, they would form a pile 949 miles high. By
Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ Long before anyone ever heard of
reality television, or its most recent efflorescence, ``Survivor,''
a group of scientists began putting ordinary people into unusual
situations and observing how they behaved. In perhaps the most
famous experiment, Dr. Stanley Milgram's study of obedience to
authority, the subjects meekly delivered what they believed were
potentially fatal electric shocks to another person when ordered to
do so by an experimenter in a white coat. Such research stimulated
heated ethical debate. Now, in a twist that oddly merges the
science of the past and the entertainment of the present, a
production company is planning to re-enact the Milgram study and
other social-psychology classics. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   ESTROGEN-HEART-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed so clear a decade
ago: Of course hormone replacement therapy would protect women's
hearts after menopause. After all, women's heart disease risk
starts to rise in middle age, around the time that their ovaries
stop making estrogen. And there was indirect evidence that the drug
was working. But now, new data are turning the estrogen hypothesis
on its head and showing that even the best-intentioned analysis can
go astray if it relies on indirect evidence. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES-SURVIVOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The two candidates
surveyed their voters and saw a group evenly divided _ loyal
stalwarts on each side, swing voters in the middle. Pundits and
fans who had followed the race closely had no idea who would win.
The venue was the nerve-racking finale of the CBS hit show
``Survivor.'' Richard, who won, excelled at defining his candidacy.
This year's presidential candidates tried to make similarly
effective speeches at their televised conventions. Comparisons
between the candidates and the survivors proved irresistible. By
Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE-VOTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week, riding a wave of
strong polls following his family-focused speech at the Democratic
National Convention, Al Gore reiterated his intention to make
families, particularly ``working families,'' the focus of his
campaign. Gore took great pains to project an image of himself as a
devoted husband and father who understands that all families want
the same opportunities for their children. But where does his
parent-focused campaign leave unmarried voters, a group that has
supported the Democratic party by a strong majority in recent
years? By K.A. Dilday.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Given that both sides are bracing
for a down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised
debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
could be especially crucial this year. The common wisdom is that
Gore _ the oratorical slayer of Ross Perot, Jack Kemp and Bill
Bradley _ is such a vaunted debater, and Bush such a novice, that
it would be like watching a karaoke competition between Barbra
Streisand and Britney Spears. The truth is that Gore and Bush are
more evenly matched than people think. Bush, in fact, could even
come out ahead. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MEXICO-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As Vicente Fox paid his first
visit to Washington as Mexico's president-elect and informally
presented his ideas for a more liberal northward flow of Mexican
workers, his proposals stirred a flurry of mixed emotions at home.
Among the poor, Fox's proposals have sparked hopes that they might
soon be able to cross the border with more protections and dignity.
For Mexico's middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a
necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's
ambiguous, love-hate relationship with the United States. Because
it is a gateway to the most powerful country in the world, the
border is at once a kind of mythical place, but also a place where
Mexico's disadvantages are magnified. By Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Berlin) _ As the 10th anniversary of
German unification approaches on Oct. 3, it seems clear that the
conjunction of recovered German nationhood with a diminished nation
state has had some disturbing effects. The giant of Europe is
edging toward its anniversary in a mood of some agitation,
wondering aloud what to do about rightist extremism, pondering
where the roots of xenophobia lie, lamenting the misunderstanding
between Wessis and Ossis (Westerners and Easterners), and groping
for a shared sense of German identity that is nonthreatening. By
Roger Cohen.

DIXIE UNION ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ This has been such a tumultuous season
for 3-year-olds that the morning-line favorite for Saturday's 131st
running of the $1 million Travers at Saratoga, the Midsummer Derby,
did not even race in the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union, who was an outstanding 2-year-old, chipped a knee
during the running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream in
November and has only recently returned to form. The injury kept
the son of Dixieland Band off the Triple Crown trail, but he
demonstrated that he was fit when he scored a hard-fought victory
in the $1 million Haskell at Monmouth Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky to have him back the way we hoped,'' said Richard
Mandella, who trains Dixie Union for owners Gerald J. Ford and
Herman Sarkowsky. ``He's doing great. If a horse doesn't do great
here, he never will do great. We thought from day one we had an
outstanding horse. He'll do whatever you ask him to do, that's the
kind of horse he is. He's generous and he has a lot of talent. But
until you actually do it, there are always a lot of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union actually did it in the Haskell, overcoming trouble
to win going away. He usually likes to run from just off the pace,
but in the Haskell he made a big late run under Alex Solis, who
will ride him in the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with him in the Haskell,'' said Mandella.
``He had a tough time early, but he made a nice move after getting
checked. He showed a lot of courage to dig in. He ran down a leader
(Captain Steve) who didn't back up. That was a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to have a target to run at. He's obviously
gifted with a lot of speed. He's both muscular and smart. He'll
cooperate and do what you ask him to do. He's got enough speed that
you can put him anywhere you want. With experience, he'll get even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Having missed the Triple Crown, Dixie Union, who is listed at
5-2 for the Travers, is not widely known. However, he has been
worse than second only in the Breeders' Cup, where he finished
fifth after hurting the knee, and sports a career record of 10-6-3,
with more than $1 million in earnings. He did not race this year
until May 7, a day after the Kentukcy Derby was held, winning an
allowance at Hollywood. He then finished second in both the Barrera
Stakes and Affirmed Handicap, before shipping east to dominate the
Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery was all done by the middle of November,'' said
Mandella. ``There was a small chance we could have made the Triple
Crown, but not a good one. The first excuse we had not to make it,
we called it off. You always have to worry when you stop on them
and work on an ailment. You worry whether they'll come back the
same. But I wouldn't have brought him to Monmouth if I didn't think
he was right. We got those races into him at home, and it was time
to see whether he was the real thing or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a beautiful colt. He's gone from being a boy
to a man, and he's intelligent, as well. He has that look about
him. I can't speak for the other 3-year-olds, but I do love my
horse. We're looking at the Travers and a lot more down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus won the Kentucky Derby, but has not raced since
losing the Preakness to Red Bullet May 20. Red Bullet has since
suffered a slight leg fracture and is out for the year.
Commendable, who plodded to victory in the Belmont June 10, has run
poorly twice since and is a 12-1 long shot for the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that if Dixie Union captures the Travers, on
the heels of his triumph in the Haskell, he takes the lead in the
division. It is difficult to believe that a horse who was an
afterthought when the Run for the Roses went to post could stake a
claim to the championship. But that's the way it's been for this

 (For release Sunday, Aug. 27)  
 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a fashion model, Anna Karlstrom has seen her share
of the good, the bad and the unwearable. So when a garment rates a
second look from her, it means something. Slipping on an
orchid-colored leather jeans jacket the other day, her eyes grew
wide. ``This,'' she murmured, ``is cool, for the Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlstrom, 19, who was modeling Gap clothes, didn't find the
pieces assembled for the camera cutting edge exactly. But they
were, in her view, a hip and wildly colorful departure from the
standard issue crew neck T's and khaki trousers that have long been
the retailer's mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Filtering into Gap stores since mid-July, when the chain sold
off the last of its summer cargo shorts, are lace-bordered tank
tops, filmy skirts and leathers in hothouse hues of carmine, pink
and mauve.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly these trend-driven looks were intended by the retailer
to shake up shoppers lulled into a torpor by last year's surfeit of
khakis, cargo pants and polo shirts. ``We are showing more
fashion,'' acknowledged Kenneth S. Pilot, the president of the Gap
brand. ``And we're providing it for a broader audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The change hasn't come a moment too soon. In the past year the
company has seen its profits slide as consumers defected to
competitors like American Eagle and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, which
served up Gap-style classics with a brash urban twist. To make
matters worse, Old Navy, the Gap's sister chain, has been stealing
customers from Gap stores, with lower prices for nearly identical
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the slowdown at the Gap is a perception by
consumers that the store is clotted with casual looks at a time
when fashion has moved in a dressier, racier direction.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's declining confidence in the chain's ability to
please shoppers has been reflected in its stock price, which has
plunged from a February high of 53.75 to around 28.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, there have been signs that the retailer is
beginning to climb out of its trough by veering from its
all-khaki-all-the-time formula, and courting current fashion.
``They missed the trends in the first half of the year,'' said Rick
L. Snyder, a retail stock analyst at Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co. in
Memphis, Tenn. ``But they got back on track for the second half
with fashion-driven merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jaffe, an analyst with Paine Webber, added, ``Clearly
the Gap has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on leather, a hit for the chain last fall, and
swinging away from the baggy, androgynous style to a trimmer,
snappier silhouette, the store is attempting to ingratiate itself
with a fashion-minded, slightly older and more sophisticated
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a very strong improvement in performance since
the Gap sold off its cargo pocket shorts in mid-July,'' Jaffe said.
``Consumers saw fresh product and spent.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says shoppers are plucking up crocheted halter tops,
swingy leather skirts and shapely jackets, lace bordered tank tops
in sherbet colors _ an array of items that might, in short, have
been snatched off the racks at Express, Wet Seal or H &AMP; M, some of
the Gap's newer competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gap looks cooler, and that's by design,'' said Lisa
Schultz, the retailer's executive vice president for product
development and design. Recently, Schultz, who oversees a
100-member design team, detected a sea change in fashion. The Gap,
which looks for direction to MTV, vintage stores and fashion
runways, sent small design teams to such fashion destinations as
Ibiza, Spain, and South Miami Beach, Fla. ``Even in these casual
places, we noticed that fashion had gotten dressier,'' Schultz
said. The Gap responded with coral-tinted crocheted halters and
wispy skirts in scarf-patterned silks and other overtly girlish
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz added that the chain's recent tendency to push fashion's
envelope is partly a measure of the design department's increasing
clout within the company. ``As in any company, I sometimes have to
push for new ideas that might make the merchants here
uncomfortable,'' she said. But lately, the corporate side has
proved more open-minded. ``These days there's a lot of respect for
the design office,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been cautious, however, about how and where to
expand the boundaries of hip. The Gap courts notoriously fickle
teen-agers, but also older consumers looking for stylish clothes to
wear to work, not just on weekends. ``Until now,'' joked Pilot,
``you couldn't leave home after Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift has been noticeable in the men's collection, enlivened
and dressed up with stretch button-down shirts and twill trousers,
and a vivid infusion of color in everything from Oxford shirts to
leather jackets, offered for fall, in a surprising olive green.
</P>
<P>
   But changes have been most eye-catching in the women's
collection. ``For us the style is more about evolution than
revolution,'' Pilot said. But a look at the collection would seem
to indicate otherwise. Among the Gap's decidedly un-Gaplike fall
looks: hobo bags in fringed leather or suede, snug-fitting
color-blocked sweaters and claret-colored swingy leather skirts _
the kind of things that blew out of H &AMP; M's Fifth Avenue flagship
last spring. Large Gap stores in major markets are also stocking
``1969,'' a collection of vintage-style denims bordered in stripes,
and tie-dyed designs, the last group inspired by Tokyo street
fashions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea,'' Schultz said, ``is to offer items that you can mix
with basic looks found elsewhere in the store, and by that strategy
keep customers in the store who might have ventured elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After Labor Day, the new merchandise mix will be reflected in
the retailer's windows and outdoor advertising. ``It has to,
because I can't look at khaki one more day,'' Pilot said,
chuckling.

CHINA TO RELEASE AND DEPORT ARRESTED BOSTON-BASED POET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-RELIGION) 
(EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Boston-based Chinese poet who was arrested two weeks
ago in connection with a literary journal he edits will be released
and deported to the United States on Saturday, a U.S. Embassy
official in Beijing said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 11 arrest of Huang Beiling, who is a Chinese citizen
with permanent-residence status in the United States, drew protests
from literary figures worldwide as well as from the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing. The police also confiscated hundreds of copies of his
journal, Tendency, which is published in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The police never said why they had detained Huang, also known by
his literary name, Bei Ling. He has lived in the United States for
more than a decade and had visited China in June. But a spokesman
for China's State Council Information Office said on Thursday that
he had been ``detained for further review by the Public Security
organization'' because of ``illegal business activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police can keep suspects in criminal detention for up to
30 days without filing formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's release defuses a situation that threatened to become a
major political embarrassment for China, at a time when its
government is preparing to open a $7 million celebration of Chinese
culture this week in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Western writers and scholars had said they would
probably boycott the event _ which includes performances, lectures
and exhibits in nine U.S. cities _ if Huang were still in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, PEN American Center, the writers group, sent a letter
of protest to President Jiang Zemin signed by well-known literary
figures including Susan Sontag, Arthur Miller and Seamus Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bei's arrest represents an especially alarming escalation
of the repressive and inhuman treatment of dissident writers and
intellectuals in China during recent months,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although China's publishing industry and intellectual life
generally have become more lively and open in the last few years,
the Chinese government has recently attempted to rein in the trend.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Distributing foreign magazines like Tendency is illegal in
China, where the state still officially owns and controls all
publications. Although visitors may generally bring in reading
matter for personal use without interference, the import of foreign
publications for distribution requires permits. Still, many such
publications are available in intellectual circles and even more
widely available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites of foreign publications are sometimes blocked by
the government, but many educated Chinese know how to circumvent
the restrictions, and individual articles are often posted in
Chinese chat rooms, which are more difficult for the government to
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Chinese government clearly regards the burgeoning of
information and intellectual discussion as a threat to its control.
And it has tried hard to discourage it in a serious, if
scattershot, way.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight months, the government has closed down or
warned several publishers whose books were deemed unacceptable. A
few private Web sites posting politically sensitive material have
been shut and their owners detained. And several prominent
academics have been publicly criticized by top government officials
and some have lost their teaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are known to have run into trouble are only the
most prominent tip of a very large iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Huang had come to China to conduct a forum on the latest issue
of Tendency, which focuses on Heaney, the Irish poet and Nobel
laureate. The Chinese-language journal offers a mix of translations
and original works by Chinese writers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it occasionally publishes work by and about dissident
Chinese authors _ and runs a list of underground Chinese literary
publications _ Tendency has little overt political content.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Huang is to leave on Saturday for San Francisco. His younger
brother, Huang Feng, who lives in Beijing and is also a writer, was
detained last week, and it was unclear whether he would also be
released.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the executive director of the PEN American
Center, Michael Roberts, said his group was ``thrilled'' with Huang
Beiling's release, but added: ``The international marketplace in
which China seeks full and normal status also includes a
marketplace of ideas, and it cannot expect to be welcomed into the
one while rejecting the other.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abnormal heat will persist from the southern Plains to the
interior Gulf Coast states as sinking air currents continue to
suppress clouds and rainfall. A few isolated afternoon
thunderstorms will form near the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
Farther north, at the edge of the hot, sultry air mass, clusters of
thundershowers will form from northern Kansas to the western Ohio
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast and Middle Atlantic states will be warm, with
ample sunshine. Isolated afternoon thunderstorms may form near the
Appalachians in Virginia and North Carolina. Meanwhile, a broken
band of thunderstorms will precede a cold front from Ontario to the
central Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, numerous afternoon thunderstorms will form from the
southern Sierra to the northern Rockies. Cooler air will spread
across the Northwest in the wake of a front.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HISTORIC HEAT
</P>
<P>
   At Wichita, Kan., the mercury has reached or exceeded 100
degrees on 16 days this August. The record for 100 degree days in
August at Wichita was set in 1936, when 22 days were recorded. But
this month's heat in the southern Plains pales in comparison to a
summerlong heat wave of 64 years ago. In Kansas City, readings
exceeded 100 degrees on 53 days in 1936. That summer, in the midst
of the Dust Bowl years, set records for absolute maximum statewide
temperatures that still stand in 15 states from the Plains to the
Middle Atlantic region. &QL;

LYCRA'S NEW REACH: ET TU, J. CREW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday,Aug. 27)  
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been dressing myself for 45 years now, and there have been
few surprises. But I got one last month. I bought my first piece of
tailored stretch clothing: a poplin dress shirt, in a cotton Lycra
blend, from Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It was blue. It was bouncy. On that Monday morning, I put it on.
I pulled it down by the shirttails to tuck it into my trousers. It
snapped back up. I looked over my shoulder in a panic and moved
away from the window. I pulled it down again, slowly, and we hung
there together in a kind of aerobic boing. It was clothing with a
vote _ my dictatorial sartorial days were over.
</P>
<P>
   I got to work, but my shirt and I were now in this together. I
moved, it moved _ my elastic shadow. I felt like a piece of
animation or a special effect. My shirt took a few flexes on its
own, with me inside. By noon, it had plans for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If the men's wear industry is to be believed, stretch _ once
confined in my mind to prom limos and the truth _ is here to stay
in tailored clothing, thanks to the general blur between business
wear and casual and an awakening on the part of men that fashion
can help them, too, feel sexual. The springy synthetic stretch in
bicycle shorts is invading the upper body, in shirts and sweaters.
The industry is also able to achieve synthetic-free stretch by
compressing the weave of natural fabrics like wool. This
``mechanical stretch'' is no longer the exclusive, big-deal domain
of expensive suiting by Jil Sander or Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles with a technological edge, like the nylon shine that is
now popular on denim jeans, fade in and out as fads. But stretch as
a trend might be here to stay, remaking the traditional men's
closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put it in everything we can,'' said Michael Smaldone, vice
president of men's design at Banana Republic, which had sales of
close to $2 billion last year. ``They're our best-selling items.''
Smaldone estimated that 50 percent of the men's collection in the
fall would be pieces with a stretch component, 40 percent involving
Lycra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who isn't doing it?'' said Stan Gellers, senior editor for
tailored clothing at DNR, a men's wear trade publication. ``Name
the line _ Nautica, DKNY, Slates, Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein _
everybody has stretch. It was a gimmick; now it's a given _ from a
young, cutting-edge customer to the mainstream in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Heusen is doing it for Regis,'' Gellers added, speaking of
the nation's No. 1 dress shirt manufacturer, Phillips-Van Heusen,
and its signature collection with Regis Philbin, the host of the
nation's number No. 2 television show, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic is widely credited with publicly bending the
mental barrier on stretch with an aggressive advertising campaign
last fall that featured business-suited models in yoga positions,
firing rubber bands and taking active strides in slim trousers that
would have split the difference on conventional pants.
</P>
<P>
   My poplin shirt, the model by which the company gauges continued
interest in stretch items, was introduced in 1997. ``It was very
quiet,'' Smaldone recalled. ``Like, `We'd better hold hands and put
it in the line and pray it goes.''' When it outsold every item in
the men's collection that month, which it continues to do three
years later, ``we made noise about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A staple of women's clothing, stretch didn't get the warmest
welcome from traditional men's wear retailers. ``It had a rough
time getting into the classic men's stuff,'' said Gray Maycumber,
senior editor for textiles and fabrics at DNR. ``Retailers thought
it cheapened the clothing.'' Brooks Brothers, for 182 years a gold
standard in conservative men's clothing, initially resisted the
innovation, said Jarlath Mellett, the design director _ but
eventually gave in. Stretch arrived without fanfare in 1996. Now,
two large fall dress shirt collections, including Brooks Brothers'
new color introductions, will be stretch fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing several new stretch items in its Fall Preview 2000
catalog, I called J. Crew, whose rollneck, chino-happy look I
equate with natural fibers, especially cotton. Lycra blends at J.
Crew _ that's like Quaker adding plastic packing peanuts to its
oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Formby, executive vice president of design at J. Crew,
choked back a surprised laugh when I called him. Yes, there was
``high-level discussion'' at the company over stretch, he said _
``a brawl,'' in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared a lot of people,'' he added. ``A lot of people
equated stretch with synthetic.'' They got over it. J. Crew
introduced a Lycra-blend suit in 1995; Formby estimated that 15
percent of the men's collection this fall will involve stretch.
</P>
<P>
   What he said next snapped me back to reality. The stretch
customer is different, he explained _ ``a little faster, a little
younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger than I am, that is. My age exceeded my jacket size in
1992. My stretch shirt was moving with the times, but was I?
</P>
<P>
   Gellers at DNR agreed with Formby that stretch's best buyers are
younger. ``Polyester double knits gave stretch the black eye in the
1970s,'' he said. ``But you're dealing with a customer in their 30s
who never knew polyester stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic describes that customer as being the company's
demographic ``sweet spot,'' a spokesman said. At 48, I am six
months away from the end of their plank, which is 49.
</P>
<P>
   Lycra is six years younger than I am. Invented by Dupont in 1958
as a replacement for rubber, the elastane yarn trademarked as Lycra
has 600 percent more memory for shape than rubber does, which is
why even 4 percent in cotton fiber can turn a shirttail into a
slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with growing sales and acceptance, Dupont introduced
a $40 million global advertising campaign for Lycra, created by
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York and Geneva, which includes magazines,
television, movie theaters and billboards. The television spots,
directed by Jeff Kennedy, a music video veteran who has worked with
Lauryn Hill, went on the air in July. They star Brian Delmonico, a
National Collegiate Athletic Association champion gymnast, the
first official ``face'' _ and body _ of the product since its
invention.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Delmonico is a man is not accidental. An in-house
Dupont magazine reported that by directing their sights at men, the
company was ``increasing the target by 250 percent.'' Print ads for
Lycra are scheduled for GQ, Esquire, Details and Men's Health.
</P>
<P>
   Delmonico was dubbed ``Lycra Man'' in Teen magazine's July
issue. In a survey conducted in 20 countries this year, Dupont
discovered that men's primary ``emotional image'' of Lycra was
``modern.'' Fashionable and sensual were up there, too.
</P>
<P>
   This information produced a long look in the mirror last week,
shirt-tailed and pantless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What men now face is the problem women used to face,'' John
Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at the State University
at Stony Brook, said when I called later that day. Gagnon studies
sexuality. ``Men are more comfortable with displaying themselves,''
he explained. ``But as men move out from behind the suit, into
sexual clothing, it means that their sexuality is on the line.
There's greater display, but there's a greater potential for
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Would I pick myself up? My stretch shirt, with a squeeze of the
arm and a suave synthetic come-on, was ready to make the move. Wait
until it finds out what I'm really like.

DUTCH FINANCIAL GIANT PLANS TO EXPAND TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Del., Iowa)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly a year after Congress cleared the way for
insurance companies to own banks and vice versa, most U.S. banks
and insurers are still on the sidelines, unable, analysts say, to
see how to turn the new opportunity into profit.
</P>
<P>
   But early in September, a big Dutch company that pioneered
banking and insurance combinations in Europe, ING Group, is
planning to break into the American field with a stripped-down,
virtual bank that will eventually sell insurance. It hopes to
become a model for getting the most out of both businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is part of a larger plan by ING, a financial services
giant with operations in more than 60 countries, to build a
brand-name empire in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose U.S. headquarters is in Atlanta, has already
amassed a stable of about a dozen insurance companies, including
two big recent additions bought for nearly $14 billion. It says it
plans to spend roughly $80 million _ a huge amount in the insurance
world _ to unite everything under one umbrella and establish its
name across North America.
</P>
<P>
   Before Congress scrapped the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act
and other laws that had kept insurance companies and banks
separate, two U.S. giants, Travelers Group and Citicorp, joined
together as Citigroup in the kind of merger that financial services
executives had long argued would better serve customers and add to
their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But since the bill became law last November, bankers and
insurers have been waiting for signs that customers would rush to
do their banking and buy insurance with the same company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citigroup has had some success,'' said Tom Brown, chief
executive of Second Curve Capital, a financial services fund, ``but
the jury is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   For European companies, however, the verdict is in. Banking and
insurance combinations have been operating in Europe for more than
a decade, some with considerable success. Whether ING can make it
work here is far from certain, but it will not be for lack of
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the U.S. financial services will eventually
consolidate down to maybe 10 major entities,'' said Colin Devine,
an insurance analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.``ING is obviously
serving notice that it intends to be one of the 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ING's newest addition, an online bank, will feature a savings
account paying 6.5 percent interest _ triple the rate at most
established banks, but about on par with Internet banks that
require minimum deposits of $1,000 or so to open an account.
</P>
<P>
   ING Direct will have no minimums, no limits on withdrawals and
no fees. The bank also plans to offer consumer loans, mortgages and
certificates of deposit. Term life insurance and mutual funds,
which ING now sells through its insurance outlets, will later be
added to the bank roster.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, the bank will be run out of a renovated
six-story warehouse in Wilmington, Del., where real estate and
labor are relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will not offer checking accounts, which often are money
losers. But it will electronically link checking accounts that
customers have at other banks to their accounts at ING Direct,
allowing them to transfer money in and out, much as banks now let
customers electronically shift funds to and from brokerage houses.
As in many banks, deposits in ING Direct will be federally insured
up to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of branches, the bank will have a scattering of
cybercafes where people can drop in to buy pastry and coffee, surf
the Web and perhaps check on their digital accounts. Ewald Kist,
the chief executive of ING, said ING came up with the idea of the
cafes, which it has used with its online banks in Canada,
Australia, Spain and France, because ``people like to feel
something, see something real.'' The first ING Direct Cafe in the
United States is set to open in early October in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have bought a bricks-and-mortar bank, but that would
be nothing new for the U.S. market,'' Kist said. ``We're not in
competition with hundreds of thousands of banks. We're doing a new
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   And somewhat like beaters in a grouse hunt, ING will have 10,500
financial planners with insurance and brokerage licenses around the
United States, the largest force of its kind in the country, to
point out the virtues of the new bank to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wicker, a banking analyst at Meta Group, a technology
research firm in Stamford, Conn., said he thought the bank would
``definitely make a dent in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are skeptical. James McCormick, president of
First Manhattan Consulting Group, which specializes in financial
services and telecommunications, said he sees the bank as a niche
player rather than as a challenger to big banks like Wells Fargo
and Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   Customers concerned primarily about high returns from a bank
``are not loyal,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while this segment is not small,'' he added, ``not
everybody goes with a bank on that basis. So you have limited
growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ING's effort stands out as a bold attempt to capitalize
on a new opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company's formation through the merger of a bank and
an insurer in the Netherlands in 1991, ING has been quietly selling
insurance in the United States through regional companies like Life
of Georgia. ING's insurance predecessor, Nationale-Nederlanden, had
owned U.S. insurance companies since the late 1970s. But you had to
read the fine print to know that the companies were related or
Dutch-owned.
</P>
<P>
   ING's latest acquisitions, ReliaStar Financial Services, a deal
announced in May, and the nonhealth insurance units of Aetna
Financial Services, announced in July, will make ING one of the
United States' biggest insurers. Now it is planning to shed its
cloak of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a lot of noise about ING in the U.S.,''
Kist said. ``We are a strong company, a world player, and we want
to capitalize on that strong name.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new strategy, all of ING's U.S. possessions _
including its New York investment banks, ING Barings and Furman
Selz _ are being tied together with the parent's name and its
orange lion logo. For example, Equitable of Iowa, which the Dutch
company bought in 1997, has become ING Equitable Life.
</P>
<P>
   ING's expansion is the latest foray by European companies into
the world's biggest market for financial services. Companies like
Aegon (also based in the Netherlands), the Dutch-Belgian Fortis,
AXA of France and Allianz of Germany have been attracted to the
United States by favorable economics and regulatory policies.
</P>
<P>
   And they are becoming substantial players. Early last year, for
example, Aegon bought Transamerica Corp., a big U.S. life insurance
company. And in June, a unit of AXA, which already was a leader
here, bought Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., the New York
money-management and institutional research firm.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though proposed foreign acquisitions in some U.S. industries,
notably telecommunications, have stirred nationalistic concerns,
there have been no such reverberations yet in the fragmented
financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   To European buyers, U.S. insurance companies, which generally
trade at lower price-to-earnings ratios than their European
counterparts, seem like bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with state-by-state regulation of insurance as
well as some aspects of banking in the United States, and even with
the European Union smoothing out the regulatory differences among
its 15 member nations, the Europeans say that doing business in the
United States is easier and less costly than it is in the patchwork
of countries and languages that make up Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, companies that want to be truly global feel
they must have a significant presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another lure is that with more and more Americans responsible
for managing their own retirement with 401(k) plans and the like
rather than traditional pensions, the personal investment business
is booming here far more than it is in Europe, where pensions are
still primarily a governmental obligation.
</P>
<P>
   And like their U.S. counterparts, ING and the other European
insurers doing business in the United States are focusing more on
investing these days than on insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So the Europeans have been steadily picking off U.S. companies.
And many are still on the hunt. But ING, Kist said, is finished
``with our shopping list for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The job at hand, he said, is to fit the pieces of the company's
empire together to maximize economies of scale and to centralize
different lines of business in headquarters around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The old marble and glass Georgia Life building, for example, set
on the edge of Atlanta deep in a hardwood forest, has been
designated ING's command post not only for the U.S. operations but
for those of Canada and Latin America as well. Des Moines, Iowa, is
to become the center for fixed annuities.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea of expanding ING's U.S. operations, Kist said,
was so that it would be able to become a low-cost provider. ``You
need to be well priced and you need to have a presence in all the
states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ING's U.S. competitors have also been consolidating, but so far
banks and insurance have largely remained separate. Banks have been
reluctant to buy insurance companies, experts say, because they
would have to tie up a lot of capital for generally sluggish
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurers cannot afford a bank big enough to give them a
national network of outlets for insurance, and even some that could
pony up the money say they regard banking profits as less
predictable than those from insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The industries, however, have been converging to some extent.
Many banks have contracted with insurers to sell policies through
their branches for a fee. And a handful of insurers have begun
experimenting with banking, mostly aimed at their insurance
customers.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the biggest U.S.
insurer of cars and homes, has started offering a range of
financial services online and through its agents. But unlike ING,
State Farm is completely new to banking and it concedes that it is
just getting its feet wet.
</P>
<P>
   So is MetLife, one of the biggest life insurers. On Aug. 16
MetLife said that it was buying a small New Jersey bank, Grand
Bank, and that it hoped to start up early next year _ perhaps,
analysts say, with an online operation.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ING is the company to watch. Brown, the financial
consultant and fund manager, said he expected that many competing
bank executives would open accounts at ING Direct to ``see how it's
going and to be a fast follower if it succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is among those who see long odds. ``In our experience,''
he said, ``pioneers usually end up with arrows in their back.''

JAPANESE EMBRACE E-COMMERCE, BUT CONVENIENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Slow to embrace e-commerce and online shopping, Japan is
finally embarking on its own Internet revolution. But it is doing
so in a very Japanese way: at the 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the 7-Eleven, as well as other convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   The stores, known here as ``conbini,'' have achieved a
remarkable commercial and cultural dominance they hope will give
them an edge in Japan's nascent e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, America has convenience stores, too. In fact, the
concept was born in the United States in the 1920s. Japan imported
the idea and opened its first one in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened on the trip over. The in-and-out,
beer-and-burrito concept disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the shell stayed American, the inside became pure
Japanese,'' says Mark Schilling, a pop culture writer and longtime
resident of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Conbini are more than just stores. They have become centers of
community life, functioning as town halls, culture clubs, and
venues for romance. And they are everywhere. Their bright shiny
signs, with names like FamilyMart and Just Spot and yes, 7-Eleven,
beckon you at nearly every street corner, in every city or town in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A convenience store is like air for people. Without it, you
wouldn't know what to do,'' said Yuji Fukuda, an analyst who
follows retail trends for Tokyo's Dentsu Institute for Human
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   People go to the conbini to pick up a ramen soup, a rice ball
wrapped in seaweed, or maybe an octopus snack. They'll pay a phone
bill or send a fax. They'll hang out with friends, spend hours
reading magazines, or check out the latest fashion in nail
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The conbini have become such an indispensable part of life that
rental ads promote an apartment's proximity to a convenience store.
Now, as the conbini start Web sites and turn their shops into hubs
for e-commerce, ``It could be a very powerful phenomenon,
especially among young people,'' Fukuda said.
</P>
<P>
   People in their teens and 20s have led the way in turning the
conbini into a retail force. In response to their whims and fads,
convenience stores turn over their inventories with remarkable
speed, creating and catering to the latest fads in soda or make-up,
or this summer's hot fashion accessory, paper leis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a pencil cannot be old-looking. It has to be cool and
new,'' said Hidetoshi Akiyama, a 7-Eleven Japan official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenience magic,'' said Junko Hasegawa, a 22-year-old
college student who likes to troll the aisles with her friends to
find the latest vitamin supplements or candy. ``There's always
something new, and it's impossible to leave without buying
something.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 35,000 convenience stores in densely populated Japan,
half of all customers live or work within five minutes of one.
That's a testament to the stores' popularity, but it's also forcing
conbini to scramble for new ways to attract customers. That's where
the Internet comes in.
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven, Japan's largest convenience-store operator (which got
so big and rich it took over the American chain in 1991) is leading
the pack. On July 1, it launched an online virtual mall that sells
everything from CDs to flowers to tour packages. The purchase is
then delivered to the nearest 7-Eleven, where the customer picks it
up and pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in October, the company will place Internet terminals
in many of its stores. The idea is to market the Web site, whetting
people's appetite for computers and the Internet. The number of
homes with personal computers in Japan is still a fraction of what
it is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce has been slow to take off in Japan because of the
smaller number of PCs, and because the Japanese have never really
taken to credit cards. Most merchants don't accept them because
card companies charge exorbitant fees, and the debt-averse Japanese
prefer cash.
</P>
<P>
   Buying an item online, and later walking five minutes to a
convenience store to pay for it and pick it up, seems like it might
appeal to many Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Japanese are used to conbinis as more than just
places to shop. They have been paying their utility bills at
convenience stores since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven is targeting online sales of $1.8 billion by the year
2002. It's also trying a few other Internet tactics, such as
getting the elderly online with a computer-based meals-on-wheels
service. The company has taken a stake in Sony's Playstation.com,
which means that customers can pick up their Playstation systems
and games at 7-Elevens.
</P>
<P>
   Others are following similar paths. Chains like FamilyMart and
Lawsons will soon install computer terminals, and through tie-ins
with companies like the computer giant NEC and Toyota Motor, plan
to sell all kinds of goods online.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of analysts here are skeptical about whether
consumers really want to buy goods like books or watches from
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers decide they want to use stores for certain purposes.
For example, food retailers have never been able to sell clothing
to anybody,'' said Mike Allen, a retail analyst in Tokyo with ING
Baring Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Allen doesn't think the convenience stores can go online quite
as easily as they think. ``They can't really start up a brand new
business without starting a brand new infrastructure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But 7-Eleven, for one, thinks it can be done, and without
bleeding red ink. Company officials point out that since they are
dealing with wholesalers, they won't have to hold inventory the way
the online giant Amazon.com must. And thanks to 8,200 or so
7-Eleven stores, the company already has a delivery system in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also trying to adapt itself to Japan's favorite
way to log on: the cellular phone. Like many companies, 7-Eleven
has created a Web site designed for the tiny screen of a mobile
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stores are betting they can once again change the
face of Japanese retailing. Over the last three decades, the
country's local neighborhood shopping streets have changed
dramatically. Dingy but friendly corner shops have been replaced by
the convenience stores' bright, impersonal aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Some complain of the loss of culture and community. But by and
large, Japanese don't seem too upset. No one gripes about the
``convenience store on every corner,'' the way some Americans
complain about the ubiquitous Starbucks and Baby Gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few complain about the conbini's cheapish culture, but most
people don't say that,'' said Fukuda. ``At least not yet.''

YOUNG ROSTER TROUBLING FOR PATRIOTS COACH BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Cutting a roster to 53 players is always a
troubling time for a coach. Well, it's that time for Bill
Belichick, who finished 3-2 in his first exhibition season as coach
of the Patriots after an impressive and innovative 29-21 win over
the Carolina Panthers Thursday at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said Friday he has one major concern, the ``overall
depth'' of the team.
</P>
<P>
   What Belichick faces is having to rely on younger players at the
end of the roster at virtually every position. The cuts won't be
tough, it's what you're left with that is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he will likely make the cuts Sunday, just before
the 4 p.m. deadline. His coaches and players will take Saturday
off, after coaches spent most of the day evaluating players.
Belichick will also have to get a few players through waivers so he
can put together a five-man practice squad, and he may cut beyond
53 so he can leave himself some room in case he covets a player cut
by another team.
</P>
<P>
   One decision was made, as Belichick placed guard Todd Rucci, who
is still recuperating from knee surgery, on the non-football injury
list since the injury did not occur on the football field. Where
did it take place, you ask? No answer was forthcoming. The
designation gives the Patriots a six-week window to figure out what
role they foresee for Rucci _ either on the active roster or on
injured reserve for the season. The Patriots will be on the hook
for his $2.05 million cap number, but don't have to count him on
the roster for the first six weeks of the season. Look for rookie
Adrian Klemm (knee) to join Rucci on that list, but middle
linebacker Ted Johnson (hamstring) and defensive tackle Henry
Thomas (knee) are likely to make the roster since they're close to
being ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the roster may look like and the decisions that face
Belichick:
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACKS (4): Drew Bledsoe, Michael Bishop, John Friesz, and
Tom Brady. The Patriots could take their chances and send Brady
through waivers and, if he clears, place him on the practice squad.
But the Jets used four quarterbacks last season, so it's a viable
option.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACKS (3): Raymont Harris, Kevin Faulk, and J.R.
Redmond. The team has invested a lot of time in all three and all
should stick. Faulk may be the starter, but Harris will get playing
time while Redmond is brought along slowly and used on special
teams. This is an area Belichick is eager to upgrade. Washington
has made Skip Hicks available for a third-round pick or better.
Will the Patriots bite?
</P>
<P>
   FULLBACKS (3): Tony Carter, Chris Floyd, and Harold Shaw. The
one player they may not be able to live without is Shaw, a valuable
special-teamer. Can Shaw do the same things as Carter? Floyd is a
pure fullback with toughness and blocking ability, but could he be
expendable. The Patriots could keep all three or there might be a
salary-cap casualty.
</P>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVERS (6): Terry Glenn, Troy Brown, Tony Simmons, Chris
Calloway, Sean Morey, and Shockmain Davis. Here's the rub: While
it's great that Davis and Dane Looker have looked good late in
games, teams use their top four receivers. The other guys are used
on special teams and are around in case of an emergency, so who's
the best and most-experienced special teams player? Morey. Davis
and Looker could make it or one could wind on the practice squad.
If Looker doesn't make the roster, the Patriots don't have to give
the Rams a sixth-round pick next season.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT ENDS (2): Rod Rutledge and Eric Bjornson. One blocks, the
other catches. You could go with three and include Harvard's Chris
Eitzmann, but he looks more like a developmental player and belongs
on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINEMEN (9): Bruce Armstrong, Max Lane, Derrick
Fletcher, Damien Woody, Jason Andersen, Greg Robinson-Randall,
Lance Scott, Grant Williams, and Adam Davis. With Rucci and Klemm
out, this is what you're left with.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINEMEN (9): Willie McGinest, Brandon Mitchell, Chad
Eaton, Bobby Hamilton, Greg Spires, Thomas, Jeff Marriott, Garrett
Johnson, and Reggie Grimes. Did Spires beat out Grimes Thursday
night? Whither sixth-round pick Dave Nugent? Grimes and Nugent look
like guys who need to develop, especially if Thomas is kept.
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS (7): Tedy Bruschi, Johnson, Andy Katzenmoyer, Rob
Holmberg, Chris Slade, Marc Megna, and Maggy Tuitele. Tuitele and
Megna may still be bubble guys, but Megna is a maniac on special
teams and Tuitele has done a nice job in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS (8): Ty Law, Antonio Langham, Kato Serwanga,
Otis Smith, Lawyer Milloy, Tebucky Jones, Larry Whigham, and Tony
George. It looks like Chris Carter and Antwan Harris are the odd
men out. Belichick played Jones virtually the entire game Thursday
at free safety to see whether he could handle it. He seemed to pass
the test.
</P>
<P>
   KICKERS (2): Lee Johnson and Adam Vinatieri. They win by
default.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE BUBBLE: Chris Carter, Antwan Harris, CB Kelly Malveaux,
RB Patrick Pass, Nugent, Eitzmann, Grimes, Looker, DT Maurice
Anderson, G Josh Rawlings, LB Orlick Johnson, G Rob Gatrell, and LS
Lonnie Paxton.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why Belichick is concerned about depth. The
decisions at the end of the roster come down to rookie free agents.
Some will excel and others will fall by the wayside. Coaches have
reason to worry that when injuries claim their starters, then there
goes the season because inexperienced players have to take their
place.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Smith signing was key. It may cost Antwan Harris
his job, but the Patriots know if Law or Langham go down, they have
an experienced player in the wings.

THE HUMPTY DUMPTY OF SCHOLARSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID OSHINSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The writing of American history underwent a significant change
in the 1960s and '70s, one that remains in place today. Not only
did the Vietnam War trigger a backlash against national
institutions, especially the state, but the growth of
``liberation'' movements also led many women, blacks, gays and
other groups to demand their own distinctive, ``usable past.''
Increasingly, younger historians shifted their emphasis from the
public life of the nation to the private lives of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, an explosion of historical categories _ race,
gender, ethnicity, sexuality _ had supplanted the more traditional
fields of political, diplomatic and intellectual history. Those
formerly on the margins of American society now got the lion's
share of attention.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the new history have worried about the
fragmentation of the past, with each group telling its own story,
on its own terms, in its own ``authentic'' voice. And even
advocates wondered at times about the place of these categories in
the larger scheme of things. How do they fit together? What does
the research tell us about the overall culture or the exercise of
power in public life? Where is the framework that connects the
parts to the whole?
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the prestigious Journal of American History surveyed
its members about the state of the profession. Those who responded
_ mostly academic historians _ agreed that the greatest improvement
in the field was the inclusion of ``more diverse people from the
past.'' Yet when asked to list the greatest weaknesses, the
respondents placed ``narrowness,'' ``political correctness'' and
``divorce from the public'' at the top of the list. Diversity, it
appears, does not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   In a biting critique, the journal's respected editor, David
Thelen, portrayed the new scholarship as ``too obscure to
appreciate and too remote from everyday life.'' The profession had
reached a point, he warned, ``where dazzling people with the
unfamiliar and erudite was more highly prized than telling a good
story or distilling wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years have passed, but the issues linger. Interviewed
recently at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he teaches
American history, Thelen still frets about his profession's divorce
from the larger world. Yet he also claims to have widened his own
focus in teaching and scholarship in terms that reflect the new
social history. ``It's difficult to view the nation-state as an
agent of progressive change anymore,'' he says. ``I'm trying to
stress the more human elements of history. The ways that
individuals experience events, interpret them and then remember
them are essential to understanding our national culture and
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians see a clearer pattern of progress in recent
years. ``Specialization is essential,'' says Linda Kerber, a
history professor at the University of Iowa. ``The grand old
theories we inherited were fragile and poorly researched. They
didn't match up to our present standards of evidence, and we needed
to be specific in order to puncture their claims. Microstudies are
really the building blocks of change.''
</P>
<P>
   And change, Kerber believes, means a more honest, complex and
inclusive vision of the past. With a solid foundation now in place,
she says, historians are beginning to ask the large questions that
make good synthesis inevitable. ``We're on the cusp of something
extraordinary,'' she says, ``an explosion of knowledge that is
revolutionizing the profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Other historians, including Eric Foner of Columbia and David
Levering Lewis of Rutgers, are less confident. Foner, whose books
on race, slavery and freedom reach audiences well beyond the
academic walls, is concerned by what he sees as the continued
reluctance of historians to impart broad meaning in their written
work.
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, he notes, it's just the opposite: ``We all do
synthesis there. Events don't simply happen. We provide an
interpretive framework that ties the new social history to larger
themes of ideology and power. We give students a clear but
contested narrative that makes sense of the major features of
American history while highlighting the diversity of our
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Foner adds, ``we stake out positions on the big
issues and we defend them. When a student asks, `Why did Andrew
Jackson veto the bank bill?' we don't stumble around and give 15
different scenarios. It seems so natural in the classroom, yet so
very hard to do in print.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The failure to write boldly and clearly may help explain why
commercial publishers _ not to mention the reading public _ are
deserting academic history. Indeed, professional historians find
themselves in an odd position today. Their subject is growing in
popularity, yet their once considerable influence is on the wane.
Fewer people are seeking their wisdom about the past.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, the most widely read narratives in
American history are no longer written by academic historians; and
even the freshest theories connecting America's past and present
are appearing in the books of ``outsiders,'' like the journalist
Michael Lind's ``New American Nation,'' published in 1995, and the
economist Robert Fogel's ``Fourth Great Awakening,'' released a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't always the case. Grand narratives and big theories
once dominated the writing of American history. From George
Bancroft and Frederick Jackson Turner in the 19th century through
Charles and Mary Beard, Richard Hofstadter and Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. in later years, the great historians combined elegant prose and
sweeping synthesis in ways that are rarely seen today.
</P>
<P>
   Turner wove the tale of an exceptional nation removed from the
corrupting influences of Europe, a country where the frontier
produced the perfect mix of abundance, individualism and equality.
The Beards viewed American history in equally heroic terms, with
``the people'' battling the ``special interests'' for economic and
political control.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, an influential school of ``consensus'' history
emerged. Postwar historians were haunted by memories of Nazi
genocide, the threat of Soviet expansion and the spread of
McCarthyism. Wary of mass movements on the left or right, they
stressed the beliefs and values that united Americans rather than
the crises and upheavals that divided them.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hofstadter and his enormously popular books ``The
American Political Tradition'' (1948) and ``The Age of
Reform''(1955), the more creative consensus historians worked the
neighboring fields of sociology and political science. New theories
of human behavior emerged linking McCarthyism to past extremist
movements and charting the assimilation of immigrant groups into
the mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   There were dissenters, too. William Appleman Williams turned
American exceptionalism upside down by portraying the nation as a
greedy colossus searching endlessly for raw materials and foreign
markets. Although some historians condemned him as a dangerous
radical, there was, in fact, a large common ground. What united
scholars like Turner and the Beards, Hofstadter and Williams, was
their preoccupation with national history, their interest in how
the United States was created, how it developed and, ultimately,
how it should be judged. By focusing on large themes, they became
valued participants in the public life and civic culture of their
time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the field of American history up into the 1960s was a
simpler, more restrictive place resembling an old boys' club, with
leading scholars training their successors in elite departments
reserved mostly for Protestant white men. The writing naturally
reflected this insulation. There was no violence on Turner's
frontier, no slaves or American Indians to muddle the story. Women
rarely entered these historical narratives. Racial and ethnic
tensions were often minimized or ignored. The new history of recent
decades exploded this complacency.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a way to combine the diversity and specialization of
today's history with the grand narratives of the past? Can
professional historians win back a broad audience?
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. Lewis, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for
his 1993 biography of W.E.B. Du Bois, observes that mastery of the
synthetic narrative is far more difficult than it appears. At its
best, he says, ``the well-told story about the national past should
always be an argument, a thesis, an analysis disguised in the
action and drama of its narrative.'' This is not, he declares, ``a
formula to be commended to all professional historians.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems a formula worth trying. This past year Scott
Sandage, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, taught a
graduate seminar in American history. From the outset he stressed
the importance of good writing, a clear thesis, solid organization,
the telling of anecdotes and a smooth narrative flow. His message
apparently got through. The final papers were quite readable,
Sandage says. And he got an extra bonus as well. When the course
ended, one of his students presented him with a plaque containing
four well-chosen words: ``It's the story, stupid.''

 A NO-PRESSURE ARENA FOR TESTING ALL MAKES OF CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Nick Bobotis came to see the Lexus IS 300, but
while he was at it, he took a test drive in the Acura 3.2TL and the
Infiniti I30, something he could never do at a single dealership;
nearby, keys in the ignition, sat an Audi A4, a BMW 320i, a
Chrysler 300M and a Lincoln LS _ names that constitute much of the
roll call of midsize, upscale sedans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure, and you can compare side by side,'' said
Bobotis, of Alexandria, Va., marveling at this new way to shop for
cars as he completed a turn around a half-mile test track, which
included a straightaway with a digital timer, a slalom and a
simulation of broken pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in a tent big enough for a three-ring circus, in a
different section of this unusual auto marketing effort, another
shopper, Mustafa Ozdemir, watched, fascinated, as a woman he might
have mistaken for a salesperson demonstrated the three-way seat in
the rear of a new minivan. The seat could be positioned for
third-row passengers, or folded flat into a footwell, or flipped
over so that it faced the rear, providing a comfortable seating
area for a tailgate party if you didn't mind your feet hanging out
of the back of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is the Honda, but the Mazda has it, too,'' said the
woman, demonstrating that unlike most sales personnel, she had no
desire to push one model over the other. ``And the 2001 Pontiac
will have it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Bobotis and Ozdemir were among 2,000 licensed drivers who
shopped in the first weekend of August at an event so different
that it doesn't have a generic name yet. What it was, was a
multibrand car show and test-driving venue. And it was sponsored by
a company that does not sell cars.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the second of six being put on around the nation
by Edmunds, a publisher of automotive books that has mostly
transformed itself into an Internet company, Edmunds.com. The
Edmunds Web site provides comparative information on a variety of
cars. The company said the event here, which it called EdmundsLive,
was a real-world version of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But under the tent there was also a circle of 24 computers, with
Edmunds.com as the home page, that visitors could use to look up
information on cars. Among the information on the Web site _ and
posted near the cars in the tent _ was what Edmunds calls true
market value, which is the company's estimate, based on
mathematical models and current supply and demand, of what a
consumer could reasonably expect to pay for any model of car. It
also lists the manufacturers' suggested retail price as well as the
invoice, which is the basis for what dealers pay for the cars on
their lots.
</P>
<P>
   Edmunds says the site _ like the tour events _ lets customers go
to a dealer with choices already narrowed down, possibly to a
single vehicle, and with a price in mind that will reduce haggling
and the feeling that one may have made a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the consumer who they want to go to to buy, if they
go at all,'' said Jeremy P. Anwyl, the chief operating officer.
Most people would end up going to a traditional dealership, company
officials said, but Anwyl said they would ``leave here more
convinced they're going to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors dealers in California have sometimes held similar
events on their own, featuring the company's cars. And GM did
something similar two years ago, in the same parking lot here,
outside the stadium where the Redskins play football. That show
covered a wider band of the market, with cars, pickups and sport
utilities, and likewise had no pressure to buy immediately, but its
object was to sell GM models.
</P>
<P>
   The Edmunds event, part of a six-city tour that began in Atlanta
and will be repeated at Raceway Park in Englishtown, N.J., Thursday
through Sunday, Sept. 3, includes 132 total cars representing more
than 50 models.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $15 for each adult 18 and over, a price that does
not come close to covering costs, company officials say. Whatever
profit Edmunds makes comes from the commissions it is paid by four
sponsors with booths in the tent: CarsDirect.com, which lets
consumers order cars over the Internet; eCoverage, which sells
insurance online; PeopleFirst.com, an online lender; and
1SourceAutoWarranty.com, which sells extended warranties on the
Web. But Edmunds has no financial interest in the preferences of
shoppers, said Avi Steinlauf, the marketing director. ``We're not
in anybody's pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   That was clear in the minivan area, where a shopper climbed into
a Ford Windstar. ``It's a little noisier than the others,'' said
Bob Featherly, who was escorting shoppers to cars and answering
questions. ``But it's got very nice doors,'' he said, pushing a
button that activated one of the motorized sliding doors.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic scene was at the sport utility vehicle test
track. Several truckloads of dirt had been brought in to create the
illusion of an off-road track, including ``blue sky hill,'' a mound
so steep that nothing except the sky was visible through the
windshield of a Ford Expedition as it was driven over the obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine Fallon, an Edmunds spokeswoman, said surveys collected
from visitors as they left the Atlanta stop indicated that
two-thirds planned to buy a car in the near future. The others, she
said, ``saw it as some sort of amusement park, and they were happy
to pay the 15 bucks.'' Steinlauf, the marketing director, said
people were spending four to five hours at the event, even coming
back for a second day; Edmunds had expected shoppers to stay an
average of 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all the visitors to the show here seemed to like the
idea of a no-pressure arena for comparison shopping. ``You can
really look at the cars, without somebody in the background eyeing
you as if you're their next commission,'' said Judy Fiery, who came
with her husband, Sam, from Hagerstown, Md., about an hour and a
half by car, to spend a day of their vacation at the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Fierys' daughter had just graduated from Frostburg State
University, near Hagerstown, and their graduation gift was going to
be a down payment on a Jetta; meanwhile, Fiery was looking over
what might replace their 1989 Mercury Sable, with 115,000 miles, in
a year or two. Now that their daughter had graduated _ and ``the
Bank of Mom and Dad is finally closed,'' as Fiery put it _he had
his eye on the LS or the 300M. But Fiery, who works in a Mack Truck
engine assembly plant, was also just enjoying the show.
</P>
<P>
   Bobotis, the shopper who had come to see the Lexus, was, too.
``What I can't stand at an auto show is that you can't even adjust
the seat and see if you can get comfortable, because the electrical
system has been turned off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bobotis, who drives a 1993 Mustang that ``has another year
in it, maybe,'' also liked the side-by-side comparison. In 1987, he
said, he had worked for six months as a salesman in a Ford
dealership in Waldorf, Md., and one day a customer whom he was
accompanying on a test drive pulled into the lot of a Volkswagen
dealer, to try out a competitor's model. ``I'm thinking, `The nerve
of this guy,''' said Bobotis. ``But he was pretty smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride-and-drives here were not perfect; some shoppers
complained that on the courses, which were up to five-eighths of a
mile long, they could not test the vehicles at highway speed. On
the other hand, few dealers would park a test-drive model at the
head of an obstacle course of traffic cones and invite the shopper
to make the tires squeal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Europe is hardly in the midst of a major
economic boom, but the European Central Bank is increasingly likely
to hit the brakes as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of hawkish warnings, the central bankers have made
it clear that they are alarmed about inflation and the doggedly
depressed value of the euro compared with the U.S. dollar. Most
analysts predict that the central bank's board of governors will
increase interest rates when they meet next Thursday, but many
worry that the move could stunt growth without shoring up the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a self-produced problem,'' said Hans Meltzer, an
economist at Deutsche Bank Research. ``If the ECB were as generous
about inflation as Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, it wouldn't
have a problem.'' When the euro was introduced at the start of
1999, the European Central Bank announced that its goal was to keep
inflation below 2 percent a year, a goal that is considerably
tougher than that of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central
bank, and a governor at the European Central Bank, drove home the
nature of European worries in a toughly worded speech Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ECB cannot be satisfied with the developments of the
external value of the euro,'' Welteke said. Noting that the weak
euro has led to sharply higher import prices, Welteke said the
risks of inflation had increased measurably. ``The longer external
price pressures persist, the higher are upward risks to price
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction, the euro has lost over 20 percent of its
value against the dollar. At its current value of about 91 cents,
it remains near its all-time low of nearly 88 cents, and many
currency analysts have abandoned any hope that it will climb back
to parity with the dollar in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's weakness stems primarily from the drawing power of
the U.S. economy, which continues to attract huge amounts of
foreign investment and thereby generate heavy demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The weak euro has aggravated inflationary dangers because it has
pushed up the cost of imports, most particularly of oil. With
prices still near their highest levels in years for oil, which is
bought exclusively in dollars, European fuel bills have delivered a
double blow and pushed up the prices of other products.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Europe's annualized rate of inflation is now about
2.4 percent, well above the central bank's target, and the trend is
still upward. On Thursday the German government reported that
prices in German factories shot up in July at the fastest rate in
nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists argue that the inflation threat has been
overstated. Meltzer of Deutsche Bank noted that most of the recent
surge in prices stems from soaring oil prices rather than from more
structural causes like rising wages. Stripped of oil and other
volatile items, the core inflation rate is 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are betting that central bankers will raise their
baseline interest rates next week by one-half of a percentage
point, from 4.25 percent to 4.75. That is still substantially lower
than the U.S. federal funds rate of 6.50, but it poses several
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious risk is that it will stop Europe's current
economic upswing, just as unemployment in Germany and France is
beginning to sink below 10 percent for the first time in many
years. If economic growth does slow, the decline could drive the
value of the euro down. Though currencies normally rise when
interest rates are increased, the euro's biggest source of weakness
is Europe's slower economic growth compared with that of the United
States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The currency risk was put into focus this week, when a closely
watched survey of German business sentiment showed an unexpected
and sharp drop in confidence. The news quickly prompted some
forecasters to conclude that German growth had peaked, and
investors reacted by selling euros and briefly pushing their value
below 89 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, many analysts said they believed that the drop in
confidence was misleading and that the German economy, Europe's
biggest, still had room to grow. The German central bank has
predicted that growth will approach 3 percent next year, and the
Deutsche Bank predicts that it will go slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the fragility is clear. Recent data on Europe's trade
balance showed that the weak euro continued to bolster exports by
making them cheaper in world markets. But the data also showed that
European imports were increasing. While part of that reflects the
effect of exchange rates, Tony Norfield of ABN Amro theorized that
it might also indicate a preference of Europeans for buying
imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   Whether European growth is stalled by tougher monetary policy,
analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson predict that the euro will
remain beleaguered and unloved for some time. Even assuming that
European rates are increased in the next few weeks, Dresdner warned
this week that another record low ``appears within reach.''

ECONOMIC VIEW: GLOBAL CALM PREVAILS, BUT IS IT DECEPTIVE?

   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. _ When central bankers and economists from
around the world gathered here two years ago for the annual
conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,
the worldwide economic outlook was bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's finances were melting down. Asia was in a tailspin.
Latin America's stability was at risk. Though no one had yet
noticed, one of the world's biggest hedge funds was imploding. Even
the ever-resilient American economy was under threat.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the atmosphere here over the last several days at
this year's Fed conference on global economic integration could not
have been more different. The global financial crisis of a few
years ago has given way to general stability and renewed growth.
With the partial exception of Japan, the big industrial nations are
prosperous. Most of the developing world is rebounding. Financial
markets, while still bearing the scars of 1998, are healthy if not
robust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was an undercurrent of nervousness in much of the
discussions here, and not because of the forest fires burning just
a few miles away from this scenic resort. It seemed driven by a
sense that while the last crisis had passed without much permanent
harm, another might well be on the way, and that there was still no
clear prescription for dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman of Princeton University presented a paper to the
conference saying that economists were suffering from ``persistent
if low-grade anxiety'' about the world economy, and said that one
of the byproducts of increased economic integration among countries
would be more frequent financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mussa, director of research at the International
Monetary Fund, felt compelled to ask whether the world was about to
lapse back into isolationism and nationalism. And although his
answer was no, the very fact that he raised the question suggested
that policymakers have been shaken by the widespread protests in
the last year over free trade and the threat it poses to labor and
environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, bemoaned the lack of
progress in breaking down the remaining trade barriers among
nations, and warned that support for globalization could erode the
next time the economy hits a rough patch.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly not news to anyone here, including Greenspan,
that globalization carries risks and costs as well as undeniable
advantages. The issue is what we have learned from the experience
of recent years about how to minimize the chances of a problem
erupting or to deal with it effectively once it has.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, who also writes an opinion column for The New York
Times, told the meeting that economists have not even come to any
consensus about what caused the troubles that began in Asia in
1997, much less worked out a new global financial architecture or
crisis-response playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists and policymakers here agree that high levels of
short-term borrowings in foreign currencies by companies
contributed greatly to the travails in Asian nations like Thailand.
When local currencies collapsed, the repayment terms of these loans
rapidly became prohibitive. Companies went bankrupt and economies
spiraled downward in defiance of the beneficial effects a cheaper
currency is usually expected to have on exports. With the economy
deteriorating, capital took flight, particularly as foreign lenders
refused to roll over loans and took their money home.
</P>
<P>
   Why not try to block this kind of death spiral in the future by
restricting capital flight? The policymakers and economists
gathered here, by and large an avidly free-market bunch, could not
quite swallow their distaste for limiting the mobility of money
across borders, although Charles Goodhart of the London School of
Economics suggested that there might be an ideologically acceptable
compromise in using bank regulation, rather than outright capital
controls, as a brake on the rapid withdrawal of funds from an
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the last crisis may not hold any lessons for the
next crisis, whatever it might be.
</P>
<P>
   A paper by Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at
Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard suggested that the next big
international economic problem could arise close to home.
</P>
<P>
   They studied the large and rising current account deficit in the
United States _ 4.3 percent of gross domestic product this year, up
from an average of 1.7 percent between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that a reversal of the current account position,
a development they said was inevitable within the next 5 to 10
years, would entail a dramatic change in the relative value of the
dollar, forcing a depreciation of as much as 45 percent if the
turnabout was abrupt or 12 percent if the turnabout proved to be
more orderly.
</P>
<P>
   But the somewhat disconcerting sense among the economic elite
gathered here was that they are even less able to foresee the
future than to understand and draw lessons from the past. As
Greenspan put it, ``our past endeavors at long-term forecasting
afford us little confidence in being able to anticipate seminal
changes in global economics and finance.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ A few months ago I was on a plane that almost
crashed. For the first three hours it was a routine flight from
Boston to Denver, crowded, with sporadic food and beverage service.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an hour before our scheduled landing, the pilot announced
that one set of the plane's landing wheels would not descend. But,
he assured us, he could land the plane safely on two wheels.
Although fire trucks would meet us on the ground, he said, there
was no need to be concerned. They were simply being cautious. They
liked to use occasions like this for practice. Was there really
nothing to worry about? I wondered. None of the other passengers
seemed particularly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   But about half an hour later the mood in the cabin changed when
the pilot made a second announcement: The situation was
deteriorating badly. None of the landing wheels could descend. We
would need to fly around in circles at a low altitude, the pilot
explained, to burn up most of the fuel so that the plane would not
catch fire when we landed on its metal belly. The crew pointed out
the exits and explained how we should brace ourselves for landing.
They spoke reassuringly but looked tense and worried. They told us
to strap ourselves in tightly and stow our carry-on baggage. The
cabin lights were extinguished. No one said a word. I looked at my
husband; we were both speechless.
</P>
<P>
   As we flew around in silence, I tried to imagine, as calmly as I
could, what would happen. I knew that no one walks away from a
plane crash. Even if our plane did not explode when it hit the
ground, chances were it would be engulfed in flames soon after. The
seats my husband and I sat in were equidistant from two exits but
close to neither. The chances of our escaping were almost nil.
There was nothing, absolutely nothing, I could do. And so we all
sat there in the eerie silence.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, just as we were scheduled to land, the pilot
announced that the landing gear had descended. We would have an
ordinary landing after all. The passengers applauded and began
talking excitedly. The pilot landed the plane expertly and switched
off the engines. I saw that we had come in at a remote part of the
vast Denver airport, surrounded by fire engines and men in
heat-reflecting fire suits. We were towed to the gate and greeted
by television crews. They asked earnestly: What did it feel like?
What did you think about? I told them what happened, but not how I
felt. At the time, I couldn't put it into words.
</P>
<P>
   Why was I so inarticulate? As a professor, I have spent most of
my life explaining all sorts of complicated things to other people.
But facing imminent death turned out different from what I had
thought it would be. I would not have imagined that I could be so
calm and deliberate, that I would not spend what I supposed were my
last few minutes of life thinking about something other than myself
and what I was losing.
</P>
<P>
   My life did not pass before my eyes. Instead, I thought of the
people on airplanes that had crashed. The ``black boxes,'' when
recovered, can reveal what a flight's crew was saying. But there is
no way to know what was going through the passengers' minds when
they realized that their plane was about to fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Are the passengers on the planes that actually crash as
uncannily calm as we all were _ silent, unlamenting, bracing
ourselves in the dark cabin? Do they, before the last moments,
experience, as we did, a terror so anesthetizing that it could pass
for courage?

 By ROBERT H. FRANK    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the money it takes from us, the government hires regulators
who tell us we can't do things we want to do. Little wonder, then,
that government is so often the target of profound hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Adam Smith recognized, the invisible hand theory _ that
society as a whole does best when everyone pursues his or her own
interests in the marketplace _ works only when each person's
choices cause no harm to others. Many of our choices, of course,
cause harm to others.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you buy a car with unsafe tires, you put not
only your own life at risk, but also the lives of others. Yet the
anti-government oratory of recent decades has denied a legitimate
role for government action to promote safety in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration once
maintained an extensive network of automobile repair shops through
which it gathered data that provided early warning of potentially
serious safety defects. This network would have sounded an alarm
about the unusually high failure rates of one model of Firestone
tires _ tires whose defects, we are now told, have resulted in
scores of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency was forced to abandon its early warning network
in the 1980s when the Reagan administration cut its budget by half,
citing excessive regulatory zeal. Now, having stripped the agency
of an important means of gathering safety data, look for
congressmen in the anti-regulation crowd to denounce its
incompetence during hearings on the Firestone scandal next month.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians insist that many safety regulations were
unnecessary in the first place, since no company wants a reputation
for products that kill; businesses simply need is an incentive to
regulate themselves. In Texas, for example, Gov. George W. Bush has
backed legislation that leaves industrial polluters substantially
free to regulate themselves in a state with the most polluted air
and water of any state. But typical of other politicians who oppose
a strong government hand, he has also advocated so-called tort
reform legislation that makes it almost impossible for injured
parties to pursue their claims in court, should the unshackled
businesses fail to police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important item on the agenda of the
anti-government movement has been to shrink the government by
cutting off tax revenue. Bush, for example, promises ``to return
tax dollars to the people who earned them,'' dismissing Al Gore and
other critics as ``people who think the bureaucrats in Washington
know how to spend your money more wisely than you do.''
</P>
<P>
   These words resonate because they summon images of roads to
nowhere in West Virginia and other vivid examples of pork-barrel
waste. These examples have a certain face validity, because
competition is less intense in government than in the private
sector. Yet waste is hardly the exclusive province of the public
sector. In many parts of America, private residences with more than
20,000 square feet of living space are currently under
construction. These houses typically have 10 or more bedrooms, each
with a large bath; at least two kitchens; two living rooms, a
ballroom, a media room, and a six-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   Would Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut, which mainly
benefits wealthiest families, reduce waste in our economy? Although
depriving the government of this revenue would undoubtedly
eliminate at least some wasteful government spending, it would also
stimulate the construction of even bigger mansions.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, it would make it harder for us to obtain public
services we value. The SAT scores of entering public school
teachers have fallen sharply since the 1960s, in part because
teachers' salaries have fallen more than 20 percent relative to the
average college graduate's. Government inspections of
meat-processing plants have declined by almost 75 percent since the
1980s, despite the growing threat posed by e-coli bacteria and
other lethal food contaminants. In other spheres as well, budget
cutbacks of recent decades have created ripe opportunities for
public investment.
</P>
<P>
   Such investments would inevitably entail a measure of waste,
just as the anti-government movement claims. But the additional
private spending stimulated by the Bush tax cuts would also entail
some waste. In the end, we must decide whether we want safer tires
or bigger sports-utility vehicles.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    TIPS HELP LAWNS SURVIVE THE HEAT
 &HT;    BY KATHY HUBER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners continue to write and call with lawn questions. The
following advice was gathered from turf pros, and in large part
from the specialists at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Proper mowing and watering will help pull St. Augustine lawns
through the extreme hot, dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a healthy St. Augustine turf, mow at the proper
height _ 2 1/2 to 3 inches. Mow hybrid Bermuda grass at 1/2 inch to
1 1/2 inches. Mow frequently, removing no more than a third of the
blade height. Frequent mowing encourages thicker turf, which in
turn lowers evaporative water loss. Leave the clippings on the lawn
to break down and replenish nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid excessive thatch, the nondecomposed organic matter between
the soil surface and the base of the blades. Heavy thatch _ caused
by overfertilization, overwatering and improper mowing _ slows
water intake and can become a home for pests.
</P>
<P>
   Aerate. Not enough can be said about this simple practice that
improves air and water movement in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Water properly to promote good lawn health and to conserve
water. Do not apply water faster than the soil can absorb it. Water
early in the day, when the sun is less intense, temperatures are
lower and, in most cases, there's no wind. These conditions
decrease evaporation.
</P>
<P>
   Water deeply and slowly. If you sprinkle water lightly, you'll
only encourage the roots to rise to the moisture, where they will
be subject to higher temperatures and will dry quickly. Encourage
roots to grow downward by applying enough water to wet the soil 6
inches down. This, in turn, will better arm the turf against
drought stress.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M turfgrass extension specialist Gene R. Taylor II says
1/2 inch of water (irrigation or rainfall) every four to five days
should provide adequate moisture for the average Houston lawn. A
half-inch of water, he says, will wet a clay soil down to the
desired 6-inch depth, assuming the lawn has received irrigation or
rain in the past week or so.
</P>
<P>
   If a clay soil is completely dry, however, it will take a little
more than 1 inch of water to wet to a depth of 6 inches. Since
water infiltrates a clay soil at a rate of less than 1/4 inch per
hour, it's best to run sprinklers long enough to apply 1/4 inch,
turn them off and allow the water to soak in. This minimizes
surface runoff. Then turn the sprinklers on again to complete
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to A&AMP;M studies, it takes about 3/4 inch of water to
wet a dry loam 6 inches down, and 1/2 inch to travel 6 inches down
in a sandy soil.
</P>
<P>
   To measure how much your sprinkler waters in a set amount of
time, the A&AMP;M experts suggest placing three to five short-sided,
open-top cans in a line that starts near the sprinkler and
continues to the edge of the sprinkler's coverage. Let the
sprinkler run for 30 minutes, then measure and average the amount
in the cans. Determine the depth of wet soil. If there's 1/2 inch
in the cans and the soil is wet 6 inches down, irrigation is
complete. If the average amount is 1/2 inch of water and the
moisture depth is 3 inches, turn the sprinkler on for another
half-hour to wet soil to the desired 6-inch depth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if hot, dry conditions persist, apply another 1/2 inch of
water in four to five days.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Texas Nursery &AMP; Landscape Association's Web site at
www.txnla.org for more consumer drought information. Also useful is
www.waterwisetexas.org.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to keep nitrogen levels low during drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a high-potassium fertilizer in the fall to encourage good
root development over the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Could you please tell me where to get skyflower vine? &QL; 
_ L.M., Houston, Texas &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Local nurseries carry this vine on occasion. I would just
ask when it will be available. Skyflower (Thunbergia grandiflora):
A deciduous perennial vine, skyflower produces orchidlike
lavender-blue blooms late summer to frost or well into spring after
a mild winter. Plant this rapid grower in sun or filtered sun in a
soil rich in organic matter. It will freeze to the ground during a
cold winter, so mulch to protect roots. It should return from the
roots in spring.

   SURVIVOR-CORPTRAINERS _ Thanks a lot Richard. You've just given
corporate trainers a black eye and your million-dollar
Machiavellian manipulation didn't help their image or cause either.
Can a corporate trainer's Survivor-scheming ways really work in the

future? No way, says one local corporate training guru. ``Companies
want you to figure out how to make the organization work better.
Because that's what's going to pay off in the bottom line. You

INVESTING WITH: DUNCAN W. RICHARDSON AND JACOB REES-MOGG
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Duncan W. Richardson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, co-managers of the
$322 million Eaton Vance Information Age fund, risk is clearly not
a measure of financial virility. Investing in the technology, media
and telecommunications sector ``does not have to be an extreme
sport,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, avoiding unnecessary risk is the pair's guiding
principle. When buying and selling stocks in this fast-paced,
highly volatile sector, the managers adhere to a philosophy of
growth at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the approach is that both Richardson, who oversees
the fund's assets in the United States, the majority of the
portfolio, and Rees-Mogg, who is based in London and selects the
non-American holdings, have largely sidestepped pure Internet plays
like e-tailers or content-oriented Web sites &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rees-Mogg is openly leery of many of the measures &UR; _ &LR;  like
price-to-sales ratios &UR; _ &LR;  that analysts and investors use to value
fledgling technology, media and telecommunications companies that
have yet to earn money. He relies on more traditional yardsticks.
One is the peg ratio, which compares the price-to-earnings multiple
to the long-term earnings growth rate of a company; another is the
ratio of enterprise value (the market value of a company's debt and
equity, less cash) to cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes, however, that this approach can mean lost
opportunities. Two years ago, he said, he passed on a chance to buy
shares in an Australian Internet game maker, Uproar.com, at the
initial public offering &UR; .  &LR; ``The stock did phenomenally well for a
while,'' he said, but added, ``We are comfortable making that kind
of mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempered approach to growth investing has not compromised
returns. For the three years ended Aug. 22, the fund returned 29.16
percent, annualized, compared with 14.73 percent for all world
stock funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 19.12 percent for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Information Age was created in 1995 to capture what
both managers viewed as powerful long-term opportunities resulting
from rapid technological change and industry deregulation in
markets outside the United States. ``We view the three sectors as
an interlocking trinity,'' Rees-Mogg explained, meaning that growth
in one industry necessitates growth in the others.
</P>
<P>
   Both Richardson, 42, and Rees-Mogg, 31, have media-flavored
family backgrounds. Richardson's father worked in advertising and
public relations for Burson Marsteller, now part of Young &AMP;
Rubicam, the big advertising and public relations company that is
to be acquired by WPP. Rees-Mogg's father, Lord Rees-Mogg, was vice
chairman of the Board of Governors of the British Broadcasting Co.
from 1981 to 1986 and was editor of The Times of London from 1967
to 1981; he is still a columnist for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The fund now contains 108 stocks, with the American and foreign
weightings generally conforming to those of the Morgan Stanley
Capital International index; the managers, however, have
considerable latitude to adjust the percentages. Typically, about
60 percent of the fund is invested in American stocks; but at the
end of July, the figure was almost 70 percent, with an additional
14.6 percent in Japan and 15.8 percent in Europe. Eighty-eight
percent of the assets were in stocks, with the balance in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The global fallout from the recent gyrations in the Nasdaq
market has reinforced the managers' aversion to risk. ``This is no
time to be complacent,'' Richardson said. ``Valuation risk is very
high in this market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Azlan Group of Britain has been one of the fund's successful
smaller holdings. The company, with $653.8 million in revenue last
year, makes computer systems and peripherals and provides related
training. Rees-Mogg said the company was well positioned to take
advantage of the growth in the network communications sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its partnerships with some of the leading technology companies
should permit the company to grow organically and through
acquisitions'' that create added value for shareholders, he said.
The share price has more than doubled, to 183.5 pence, or $1.25,
since he bought the shares two years ago at an average price of 67
pence.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is bullish on McGraw-Hill, the publisher that also
owns the S&AMP;P index franchise and debt rating agency. Although the
company has reported double-digit earnings increases for several
years, the stock has not received much attention on Wall Street, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is becoming more of a global operator,''
succeeding in adapting its basic businesses worldwide, he said. He
expects the share price to be driven by strong results in textbook
publishing and financial services _ especially the bond rating
business. Most states are running budget surpluses and making
education a top priority _ trends that should accelerate the drive
to upgrade school textbooks, he added. He said that the company
could beat the Wall Street earnings forecast of $2.35 a share for
this year and that its earnings growth percentage could be in the
mid-teens for the next few years. At $59.94, the stock sells at
25.11 times earnings, versus a P/E of 29.95 for the S&AMP;P 500.
Richardson first bought shares in 1997 at an average price of
$53.14.
</P>
<P>
   Rees-Mogg likes the Nippon Broadcasting System, a radio
broadcasting group and publisher of audiovisual materials; the
company went public in Japan in 1996. In part, the investment,
started in March 1999 was a play on strength in advertising
revenues. He bought the shares at the equivalent of $30.85; they
closed Friday in Tokyo at 6,500 yen, or $60.72.

 &HT;    2001 Kia Rio delivers true value
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although not as intriguing as a visit to the Brazilian
city with which it shares its name, the 2001 Rio from Kia does have
some attention-worthy features. They include:
</P>
<P>
   A base price of $8,668.
</P>
<P>
   Adequate room for four adults.
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures of 25 mpg regular unleaded in the city and 31 on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Those pluses may not send the Korean manufacturer's sedan to the
top of the best-selling cars list, but it's difficult to imagine
that it won't find buyers in a U.S. market where the average
new-car transaction is more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio, to be sure, is not a large car, and it can be daunting
to mix it up with trucks, SUVs and full-size cars on crowded
expressways while driving one. But it's refreshing to find a car at
this price that seems well-made and built of decent materials.
</P>
<P>
   The test Rio, which totaled $11,432 after adding options that
included a four-speed automatic transmission, air conditioning and
stereo, performed as might be expected of a 3,000-pound car with a
108-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish at start-up, the Rio seemed to gravitate toward the
right-side lanes on expressways and cruised comfortably as long as
it wasn't asked to join the flock in abusing the speed limit or to
make frequent speed changes of any significance. Pass with
prudence, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was expectedly noisy with the 1.5-liter four-cylinder
engine hammering away, but the steering was respectably tight, the
brakes had a solid feel and visibility was good.
</P>
<P>
   Controls were well-placed, and the optional tilt steering wheel,
part of a $300 package, seemed a necessity because of the lack of
space. What might surprise some is the fit-and-finish, which
generally appeared precise, and the tasteful quality of the mildly
patterned upholstery, which was also used on the door panels.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking luxury-level quality here _ just no-nonsense
materials that contributed to the sense that whoever designed and
built the Rio wanted to give buyers true value for their money.
</P>
<P>
   What flash the Rio had came from its paint, a ``sunburst gold''
guaranteed to add to the car's visibility quotient in traffic or
parking lots. But the fact it has four doors and a four-figure base
price is what begs to be noticed about the Rio, which should prove
a welcome newcomer to a virtually ignored segment of the automotive
market.

&HT;     NEW TAILHOOK PROBE RECALLS 1991 SCANDAL THAT SHOOK THE NAVY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The disclosure Friday that Navy personnel at last
week's Tailhook Association conference stand accused of
``inappropriate conduct'' toward a civilian woman triggered
immediate comparisons with the notorious 1991 Tailhook convention
that shook the Navy to its roots.
</P>
<P>
   The annual convention of Navy and Marine Corps aviators in
September of that year led to charges that 140 drunken servicemen
allegedly groped 83 females, many of them military officers, in
after-hours parties at the meeting in the Las Vegas Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said Friday it is investigating a complaint by a
civilian couple that at least one service member staying at a
Sparks, Nev., hotel ``inappropriately'' touched the wife as she was
making her way though a hallway and that several servicemen made
``inappropriate comments,'' according to Lt. Com. Cate Mueller, a
Navy spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents are alleged to have taken place during the Aug.
17-20 Tailhook convention at the Sparks hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook Association is a private organization that
represents Navy and Marine Corps aviators. The Navy suspended its
relationship with the group following the 1991 episode and restored
a connection this year for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 incident led to the resignation of Navy Secretary H.
Lawrence Garrett and Adm. Frank Kelso, the chief of naval
operations, and an end to numerous careers of lower level officers
present at the parties. It sparked several investigations,
congressional outrage and set off a flurry of soul-searching about
whether the Navy ever could welcome women as equals.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of Tailhook also loomed over the 1996 suicide of
Kelso's successor, Adm. Jeremy Boorda. Boorda shot himself through
the heart after learning that Newsweek was preparing an article
questioning whether he was allowed to wear combat medals from tours
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy investigation of Boorda's death, the Washingtonian
magazine said Tailhook factored into the suicide. There was a
drumbeat of hostility toward Boorda from members of the Navy's
``old guard,'' the magazine said, who considered Boorda a
``political admiral'' who had appeased politicians in his handling
of the scandal. The criticism weighed heavily on Boorda, according
to the magazine.In the wake of Tailhook, the Senate Armed Services
Committee required that every candidate for promotion in the Navy
have his or her record scoured for attendance at the 1991 Tailhook
event. More than 90 promotions at one point were held up by the
committee and many officers left the Navy because of the delay in
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 scandal also generated questions about the Navy's
ability to investigate itself. The service was criticized for
belatedly beginning an investigation into charges of sexual
harassment and abuse made by several female Navy personnel. The
Navy's probe found little or no culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Pentagon's Inspector General investigated the Navy
probe and found many ``deficiencies'' in the Navy's internal
inquiry. The Pentagon IG concluded that Navy officials simply were
attempting ``to limit the exposure of the Navy and senior Navy
officials to criticism regarding Tailhook '91.''
</P>
<P>
   For some monitors of women in the military, the Tailhook episode
showed that women, even those in the officer ranks, were treated as
second class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Quarterly Report on Women and the Military, a
private journal devoted to women in the armed forces, Tailhook
``heightened social awareness of the disparity between the equality
of opportunity to choose occupation in the civilian sector and the
formal limitations on the roles of women in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs at
the time, said Tailhook forced the military to treat female
servicemembers as equals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, Powell had confidently declared that the armed forces
had learned their lesson from Tailhook ``with respect to
relationships between men and women and what is acceptable behavior
and what is not . We are going through the last few chapters of the
Tailhook story, and then I think we'll be on our way.''

ANALYSIS: FEW OPTIONS ON CHENEY OPTION PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Dick Cheney find a way to have his money and still avoid a
possible conflict of interest resulting from his options to buy
stock in Halliburton Co., which he headed until the Republican
Party chose him as its candidate for vice president?
</P>
<P>
   The answer appears to be not with any certainty. Wall Street has
a lot of products that use complicated derivative securities, and a
cadre of people who design new ones, but tax experts say that none
of them solve the problem of getting Cheney out of having an
economic interest in Halliburton _ at least not when taxes are
considered. Perversely, the available strategies would leave him in
a position to profit most if Halliburton's stock collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that the only sure ways out would be for
Halliburton's board to change the rules or for Congress to change
the tax law,'' said David M. Schizer, an associate professor at
Columbia Law School who specializes in tax law.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion of a tax law change may not be completely
frivolous. A highly technical change that would solve Cheney's
problem has been proposed by the Clinton administration, Schizer
said, but Congress has shown no interest in passing it.
</P>
<P>
   Though this problem affects only Cheney, it may in the future
affect many other executives who leave companies for public
service. Stock options have become common, and rules that delay
exercising them are in place at virtually all the companies that
issue them. Successful corporate executives are likely to have a
significant part of their wealth tied up in options that cannot be
immediately exercised unless their companies waive rules that apply
to other employees with options.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's problem stems from the fact that the Halliburton board,
in allowing him to take early retirement to join the Republican
ticket, did not change when he could exercise the options. As a
result, he must either forfeit them _ thus giving up millions in
potential benefits _ or hold onto them until long after a new
administration takes office.
</P>
<P>
   If he simply held them, every action by a Bush-Cheney
administration would be scrutinized for whether it was helping
Halliburton's stock price. That would be sensitive for any major
company that has government contracts, but it would be particularly
touchy for Halliburton, since the company is in the oil services
industry and its stock price is heavily influenced by the price of
oil, which could be affected by U.S. energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said that if elected, he will sell his stock in
Halliburton before he takes office, but he has not said what he
will do with the options other than assert that he will avoid a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has 400,000 stock options, of which 166,667 can be
exercised this December, after the election but before the next
administration takes office. He can exercise 133,333 options in
December 2001 and 100,000 in December 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of options means that their value can soar or fall
far faster than the price of the underlying stock. For example, at
$53 a share, near Halliburton's recent stock price, the options
expiring in 2001 and 2002 would be worth $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But if the price rose by $10 a share, a change of about 19
percent, the value of the options would leap 73 percent, to $6.1
million. If the price fell by $10, to $43, the value of the options
would fall 66 percent, to $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   If one ignores tax considerations, there are several ways Cheney
could lock in the current price, minus some transaction costs. He
could, for example, do a ``forward sale'' of Halliburton stock,
delivering it only after the options could be exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, noted Robert Willens, a tax expert with Lehman
Brothers, the tax treatment would vary drastically depending on the
market price when the option was exercised.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock rose a lot by the time he exercised the option, the
result would be a lot of ordinary income, because profits from
exercising employee stock options are based on the market price
when the option is exercised. There would be a corresponding
capital loss on the forward sale. But capital losses cannot be
deducted from ordinary income above a $3,000 annual limit. If he
did not have sufficient capital gains to offset those losses, he
would face a large tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   How big could that be? Suppose Halliburton stock price is $50
when he does a forward sale and it rises to $80 by the time he
exercises the 100,000 options that mature in 2002. Not counting
taxes, he would take in $11.50 a share _ the difference between the
$50 price he is getting and the $39.50 a share that he must pay
Halliburton for the stock. His profit, pretax, would be $1.15
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax would be based on the difference between what he
paid _ $39.50 _ and the $80 market value. So at the top federal
rate of 39.6 percent, he would owe $1.16 million in taxes, $450,000
more than his actual profit.
</P>
<P>
   Partly offsetting that would be a large capital loss on the
sale, of $30 a share, or $3 million. But if he had no capital gains
from other investments, he could deduct only $3,000 of that from
his income.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Halliburton's stock fell, he would have
less ordinary income and a capital gain on the forward sale. That
would leave him in a far better tax position than if the stock went
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the derivatives position that leaves him
with a neutral position pretax leaves him with an economic
after-tax interest in the stock going down,'' said Schizer, whose
article on issues regarding executive compensation, ``Executives
and Hedging: The Fragile Legal Foundation of Executive
Compensation,'' appeared in the March issue of the Columbia Law
Review.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Cheney could use other strategies, but each has its own tax
consequences. Some would risk involving the ``constructive sale''
rules and force him to pay immediate taxes even before he realized
any profits. And when the money came in after the options were
exercised, the tax treatment would again vary markedly depending on
whether the stock had risen or fallen in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Tax experts differ on whether the constructive sales rules would
apply in this case. But since there appear to be no precedents, it
would be risky for Cheney to assume they did not.
</P>
<P>
   An executive unconcerned about appearances and merely looking to
lock in some profit from his options would avoid those rules by
leaving himself with some exposure to the stock, for example
protecting him from losses if the shares fell below $50 and
relinquishing gains if they rose above $60. But if Cheney followed
that course, he would still have a stake in Halliburton _ the very
appearance of a conflict of interest that the tactics are intended
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney might also borrow money under a contract that required
him to repay the loan with the stock he would get when he exercised
the options. But that could leave him with a large expense _ deemed
interest expense under the tax law _ that might not be deductible
unless he had a lot of other investment income. In that case, he
would suffer at tax time if the stock had risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   All this could be avoided if Halliburton would let Cheney
exercise the options before he took office. But that might anger
other employees with options who did not have that right.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton conceivably could amend its plan to let Cheney sell
his options to someone else, or to allow him to enter into
contracts that would let him deliver the options, rather than the
shares, when they can be exercised. Then the tax laws would be
simpler and the tax effect much more predictable, Schizer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed a highly technical
change in tax laws dealing with straddles, another strategy that
Cheney might use. The proposal is aimed at what the administration
considers a possible abuse of tax law now being used to shelter
some income in transactions unrelated to Cheney's situation, and
Congress has shown little interest in the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Schizer said the proposed change would effectively allow
Cheney to offset his losses and gains from one strategy, no matter
how large they were, and thus lock in his profits now, both before
and after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possible course that Cheney could take would be to
agree to donate the net profits to a charity after he was able to
exercise the options. But there is a tax trap even in that
strategy: The tax law limits the amount of charitable deductions to
half of a person's income. Cheney might find that he had to pay
taxes on some of the profits even after he had given them away. In
that case, he could take deductions in future years but would have
an immediate cash-flow problem.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often complain that the tax laws are too
complicated. Cheney, in trying to decide what to do about his
options, appears to be learning how accurate that complaint is.

 &HT;    Absence shows faith on Sabbath
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Absence can be a better witness to God than
in-your-face-evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   But it tends to be Jews who use absence to proclaim their faith.
Most Christians don't bother.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish merchants at trade shows leave their stalls barren
on the Sabbath. They sacrifice a day's sales to be obedient to the
law of their God.
</P>
<P>
   Trade shows, where retail merchants buy goods for resale,
generally take place for three or four days over a long weekend.
The markets are in New York and more than a dozen other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, one of the major days of any show, many booths
owned by Orthodox Jews are empty of merchandise and salesmen. At
times, a modest poster stands on their empty showcase that reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exhibit is closed today so that we may observe Sabbath. We
look forward to seeing you tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The gesture has to be expensive. They make no sales. They can do
no work in obedience to their understanding of God. But they make a
solid witness to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   I have attended many such shows and have yet to see a sign on
Sunday declaring that a stall owned by Christians is closed in
honor of the Resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Sunday is not the Sabbath and Christians are under
no obligations to refrain from work. But many Christians insist
that Sunday is their Sabbath and want an indifferent world to honor
it. Few do themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Christians are often driven by the evangelical imperative to
proclaim the Gospel to all people. But few bear witness to their
faith with the same powerful effect that a closed booth at market
does for Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Some do. Years ago, I knew a fine tennis player in the small
Connecticut town where we lived. Fritz was a loyal churchman, but
he never wore his faith on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   One summer, he entered a town-wide tennis tournament and, over
several weeks, overwhelmed everyone he played. He was scheduled to
play for the championship at 10 a.m. on a Sunday morning in late
August amid great crowds at the town park.
</P>
<P>
   He told the officials that he would not be on the courts. He was
due in church at that time to help administer Holy Communion.
Someone else could do that, he admitted, but that was where he
belonged. He would forfeit the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials _ and townspeople _ were astounded,
bewildered and then impressed. The match was changed to Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz won easily. More importantly, he was obedient to his faith
and willing to pay the modest price of being Christian at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jews who abandon their booths on Sabbath, he made a
statement about his values and his faith that no evangelical talk
about Jesus could match.
</P>
<P>
   Absence _ or simply the threat of it _ can be a powerful
witness.

LAST MEAL FOR TEXAS' CONDEMNED NOT EXACTLY HAUTE CUISINE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By JOHN MORITZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Say this about Texas prison inmates: They
ain't eating high off the hog.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 112-unit system raises cattle, pigs, chickens and
vegetable for consumption by its 150,000 inmates, but the prisoners
don't get the prime cuts, by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fort Worth's Richard Wayne Jones' request for two BLTs as
part of his final meal this week was rejected because inmates are
not served bacon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the high cholesterol that worries prison officials.
It's the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials decided it was cheaper and easier to grind up
most parts of the slaughtered hogs into sausage. And that's what
the inmates who ask for bacon get _ last meal or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the amount of people we have to feed and the amount of
pork we process, if we were to take the time to (prepare) bacon, it
works out to be about one slice per inmate per month,'' explained
Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice. ``It's just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, executed Tuesday for killing 27-year-old Tammy Livingston
of suburban Fort Worth in 1986, was not alone in his desire to
depart this world with the taste of bacon on his lips.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 10 of the last 50 inmates to die by injection in
Huntsville had asked for some variety of the sizzling strips.
</P>
<P>
   One, John Albert Burks of Waco, requested a full pound of bacon
before his execution on June 14.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, bacon is not the only popular item condemned
prisoners ask for _ and don't get _ as their last meal. Of the 230
inmates to die since Texas reinstituted capital punishment 18 years
ago, 21 requested T-bone steak.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they got a plate of Salisbury steak, which is grilled
ground beef that resembles hamburger, smothered in gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, prison cooks prepare the Salisbury in the shape of
a T-bone.
</P>
<P>
   Other requests must conform to the prison's basic menu, which
includes such fare as fajitas, fried chicken, scrambled eggs and
cheeseburgers or hamburgers with a side of fries.

CONFINED IN PRISON, LITERATURE BREAKS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  By   RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prison cell turned Patrick C. Murphy into a writer. OK, a bad
writer, but, anyway, a writer. Serving time in the 1920s as Lifer
2338 in the Idaho State penitentiary for a crime so heinous he
never discussed it, Murphy, in 1928, published ``Shadows of the
Gallows,'' a cautionary memoir dedicated ``to every man and woman
who has a sincere desire for more light and understanding.'' The
book's back cover even carried (admittedly suspect) blurbs, like:
```The author and his writings have been known to me for years' _ A
penologist.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost as long as there have been prisons, prisoners have
turned author for diversion, creative expression, solace, penance,
vindication, vengeance and release (physical and metaphysical). But
their works have rarely been examined as a genre, and for what they
reveal about the literary impulse behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with more Americans than ever in prison, an exhibition at
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of
New York is doing just that in a survey of American convicts'
writings titled ``Inside Editions: A Literature of Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work, like Malcolm Braly's 1967 book, ``On the
Yard,'' is uncommonly good. Indeed, the American Center of PEN, the
writers group, is in the 28th year of a program that sends authors
into prisons to lecture and arranges publication of the best of the
1,500 prison manuscripts submitted each year.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Himes, the author of ``Cotton Comes to Harlem,'' wrote
his first short stories while serving time for armed robbery in the
1920s and 30s. Edward Bunker, who at 17 had been the youngest
inmate ever in San Quentin, emerged to write a string of gritty,
well-received novels of prison life, including ``No Beast So
Fierce,'' which was made into the 1978 movie ``Straight Time'' with
Dustin Hoffman, and ``Animal Factory,'' just made into a television
movie starring Willem Dafoe. Bunker was also a co-writer of the
1985 Oscar-nominated movie ``Runaway Train,'' starring Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best, and most famous, prison writers was Eldridge
Cleaver. In a 1963 essay for a prison newsletter, he explained to
his fellow inmates at San Quentin how important reading had become
for him. ``A library is the center of the world,'' he wrote, ``a
point transcending time in which the past, present and future
converge in a flash of light.'' The prisoner may have painted
himself into a corner, or society may have painted him in, but
through reading, Cleaver said, ``we will cease to sell and allow
ourselves to be sold short, having grown so large that a painted
corner, a prison cell, can't contain us.'' Five years later he
published his scathing confessional, ``Soul on Ice.''
</P>
<P>
   But generally, when you talk of American prison writing, you are
not in the league of great literature, certainly of nothing like
the writings of Boethius, John Bunyan, Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn or other prisoners of conscience whose words
have illumined their unjust cells and all mankind. (One exception
is Henry David Thoreau.) Prison writers are linked by an urge to
memorialize a wayward life, a survival strategy or a religious
conversion, and in the process, to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   The works in the John Jay exhibition were collected by the
college's chief librarian, Larry E. Sullivan, a professor of
criminal justice in the City University's Graduate School and a
former librarian at the Maryland State Penitentiary in Baltimore.
They range from earnest tracts to lurid sexploitation paperbacks
portraying lascivious-looking women (``Reform School Girl!'' or
``Passion Behind Bars''). Or, for the gay market, there are hunky
male prisoners in skivvies (``Caves of Iron'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought them for the covers,'' confessed Sullivan, who holds
a doctorate in medieval studies from Johns Hopkins and claims he
has the largest private collection of American convict literature,
some 350 first editions. Sullivan himself is the author of a book
not written in prison: ``The Prison Reform Movement: Forlorn
Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the convict writings suggests that it doesn't take
long for a new inmate to become a penologist. In 1798, Stephen
Burroughs, a thievish New England schoolmaster with a nasty
weakness for seducing his young charges, found himself in prison in
Worcester, Mass. He didn't care for it much, Burroughs wrote in his
``Memoirs,'' the young republic's first known work of prison
literature. In fact, he found prison downright counterproductive,
``the most perfect school of vice that I ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Many if not most prison memoirs qualify as confessionals,
extended mea culpas, often with strong religious overtones and
purplish prose. In ``Shadows of the Gallows,'' Patrick C. Murphy
does not stint in airing his shame and dread. He began, ``You shall
hang by the neck until you are dead, dead, dead are the dying
echoes that hover around me as I stand in the shadow of that grim
instrument of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrition (along with some gloating) also went into the prison
memoir of Emmett Vestal, alias ``Texas Slim.'' Vestal was twice
condemned to death yet lived to recount his misdeeds with the Tom
Slaughter Gang and its fearsome boss (``even his name spelled
death''). His 1934 memoir, ``Ten Years in Hell,'' exemplifies what
Sullivan called ``the `Bible against machine gun and the Bible
always wins' genre.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prison memoirs also serve as survival strategies, with the
authors frequently citing Friedrich Nietzsche's famous aphorism
``That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger.'' Sullivan said
that the subtext often is, ``I'm getting stronger, and I'll get you
when I get out.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, prison writing is flourishing these days. In his
latest book, ``Education of a Felon,'' an autobiography just
published by St. Martin's, Bunker described a scene of frantic
literary activity behind bars:
</P>
<P>
   ``The loudest sound is of scattered typewriters, each with a
different speed and rhythm, from stilted uncertainty to an unbroken
pulse, from petitions for writs of habeas corpus to the Great
American Novel, for I am not the only Folsom convict who dreams of
redemption via the literary life, of making a lotus grow from the
mud.''

 &HT;    HYPOTHETICAL LOOK BEYOND NOVEMBER

<P>
   AUSTIN _ Politicians, especially when they are in the middle of
election campaigns, don't like to answer hypothetical questions.
</P>
<P>
   A question such as, ``How would you cut taxes if the Legislature
faces a budgetary shortfall next year?'' Or, ``What programs would
you cut first if you don't want to raise taxes to meet a revenue
gap?''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians don't like to answer those questions because doing
so would force them to be more specific than they usually want to
be. They could even find themselves taking an unpopular stand on
something. Horror of horrors!
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, though, here is a different type of hypothetical
question, one that George W. Bush certainly doesn't want to answer:
</P>
<P>
   What if Bush loses his presidential race and is still governor
of Texas during next year's legislative session?
</P>
<P>
   I am not predicting a Bush loss, but at the risk of offending
the governor's legions of supporters, it COULD happen.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the legislative session that convenes in January could
end up being five tumultuous months in Austin. The session
certainly would be very partisan, perhaps the most partisan that
Texas &QL; 
legislative watchers have ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that it would approach the absurdity of the
partisanship that has plagued Washington in recent years, but it
could quickly make everyone forget the bipartisanship that
prevailed during Bush's first three legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   That bipartisanship was what enabled Bush to meet most of his
legislative goals _ and brag throughout the country about his
leadership abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is touting the Texas Legislature's bipartisan
tradition as an example of how he, as president, would work to
improve government in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush is promoted to the White House, next year's
legislative session will have a mean partisan streak anyway because
it will be a redistricting session.
</P>
<P>
   Redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries
after each federal census is, quite naturally, the most partisan of
legislative activities. The partisanship will be even more intense
next year because of the near-parity between Democrats and
Republicans in the Legislature _ and the Texas Democratic Party's
struggle to stay afloat in a flood of recent Republican gains.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that mix a lame-duck governor who would rather be
president and a lieutenant governor who would rather be governor _
remember, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry also has a lot at stake in the
presidential race _ and you may have a powder keg looking for a
match.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush worked well with most Democrats during previous
legislative sessions and a few Democratic lawmakers are openly
backing him for president, a number of Democrats have been blasting
his record as governor and campaigning for Democratic nominee Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush claims leadership on education, children's health
care and other important issues, his Democratic critics would have
the country believe that Bush couldn't find his own office in the
state Capitol without their guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, as usual, is somewhere in the middle, but hard
feelings could linger if the debate were to help derail Bush's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush were able to forgive and forget, the stage,
nevertheless, would be set for some even deeper partisan divisions
over, say, hate crimes, the most partisan and most emotionally
divisive issue to confront the governor and legislators in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats will try to pass a hate-crimes bill again next
year, and if Bush is still governor he will likely continue to
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   There also may be more fights over the size of the new
children's health insurance program, education reforms or civil
justice changes, and differences may be sharpened not only by
redistricting but also by memories from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush admirer and longtime legislative observer said one of
the biggest changes that Bush may notice, if he is still governor
next year, is a change in Democratic legislators who have quietly
supported most of his programs over the years.
</P>
<P>
   With their own party's future at stake, he said, they may decide
that it's time to become more partisan.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, another legislative session with Bush in the
governor's office may not be very productive. It could be
entertaining, though.

A SPEEDY INTERNET PATH IS SLOW AS AN INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By MICHELLE LEDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people who connect to the Internet via a digital subscriber
line, or DSL, rave about its speed and the fact they can use their
phone while online.
</P>
<P>
   But similar enthusiasm for the handful of publicly traded
companies that provide DSL service to both residential and
small-business users has cooled substantially of late.
</P>
<P>
   The market leader, Covad Communications, which serves 96 markets
and plans expand to 70 more by year-end, is trading near its
52-week low, closing Friday at $15.06 for a negative year-to-date
return of 59.6. Also near 52-week lows are Rhythms NetConnections
and Network Access Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the NorthPoint Communications Group, in which Verizon
Communications, the phone giant, is acquiring a controlling
interest, has had a negative year-to-date return of 51.6 closing on
Friday at $11.63 and offering further evidence that investors
remain sour on these stocks. Verizon, which was formed by the
merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, has agreed to combine its DSL unit
into Northpoint and inject $800 million in cash. The two are
forming a joint venture that is to be publicly traded, although
Verizon will own 55 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts and money managers who follow the sector say
that it will be difficult for other DSL companies to remain
independent and that premiums are unlikely for having the largest
network, as Covad does, or the most profitable customers, as
DSL.net does. That is because pricing pressure continues to mount,
while the cost of building the networks remains high. And analysts
say there have been nightmare stories about delays in installing
digital subscriber lines. The lines use extra bandwidth in copper
phone lines but still require special modems and special
installation service involving a local telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of focus on the dream'' of high-speed
Internet access, ``but when the reality hits and you start hearing
about execution problems, investors start to run,'' said Ann
Miletti, associate portfolio manager for the Strong Common Stock
fund, which owns about 1.18 million shares of Covad.
</P>
<P>
   About 750,000 users connect to the Internet with digital
subscriber lines, the bulk of them consumers who spend about $40 to
$45 a month for the service. That is about twice as much as for
dial-up service, although the added cost of a second phone line
narrows the difference considerably. The number of users is up
sharply from a year ago and is likely to keep climbing this year,
though some analysts say prospects for longer-term growth are
sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want to pay dial-up prices for DSL, and no one's
there yet,'' said Mark Zohar, an analyst who covers the sector at
Forrester Research. ``Faster is better, but is there something you
can't do with dial-up that you want to do? For most people, the
answer is still no.'' Also, better technology may be only three to
five years away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say the stock-price declines have been
unjustifiably steep. Indeed, there have been a few signs of life.
Shares of DSL.net, which has focused on providing the high-speed
service to businesses in small and midsize markets, doubled on
Wednesday, after it announced a partnership with International
Business Machines. And the Verizon-Northpoint deal is expected to
make others pay attention to the sagging sector.
</P>
<P>
   Most bets, however, are on Covad, because it is the largest.
Indeed, the company has been the subject of takeover rumors for
months. Speculation has focused on Quest Communications and
WorldCom, although most analysts say others may be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at the beginning of their life cycle, and they're
looking at a continued, expensive build-out,'' said Ken Hoexter, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``But for another carrier to pick up on
it, it could be another engine for growth, even if it means
dilution in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoexter has a near-term accumulate and a long-term buy rating on
the stock and a 52-week target price of $30. Miletti of Strong
Funds figures that Covad stock is worth in the mid-to-high $20s.
</P>
<P>
   Zohar, the Forrester analyst, said: ``The Northpoint-Verizon
deal really was the beginning of the end for these independent
companies. Their business models are precarious, and their time to
market has been precarious, and this would marry the best of both
worlds.''

 &HT;    HOPING POLITICAL WISH-LIST COMES TRUE LABOR DAY
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JANE ELY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In years past, it has seemed silly to contend Labor Day marked
the proverbial kick-off day for presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Recent tradition has had the Democratic and Republican
candidates engaged in structured and calculated campaigning so hard
for so long that Labor Day was, at most, a blip in the chronicling
of that year's presidential wars.
</P>
<P>
   But, when you read stories in the next week about Labor Day
being the true beginning of it all this year, you may be assured
there's a fair amount of hope in the hearts of all political
writers that, for once, those stories are correct.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's a palpable yearning in the ranks of the press _
and the political junkies _ that the 2000 presidential campaigns
will get well organized and under way a week from Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush have
been trudging around out there for political eons _ in fact,
literally years.
</P>
<P>
   And _ except for that long time there when Gore's political
flavor of the month(s) was to be harsh and negative _ they've
really been quite subdued, rarely even openly and truthfully
conflicting on issues on which, without question, they are
diametrically opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. This is not a call for full-scale negative
campaigning or even an occasional super attack that slings real
old-time political mud.
</P>
<P>
   It's a plea for campaigns that contrast, for campaigns that tell
the voters what each candidate wants government to do _ or not do _
on all the many levels of government and society.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's a plea for campaigns that tell how each candidate
proposes to effect his plan without ignoring _ no matter how much
he might wish _ the Congress of the United States and its vital
role in passing programs.
</P>
<P>
   As an aside of sorts, let's also consider this an urgent plea
for the attention of the electorate _ and, not incidentally, all
those constantly griping yahoos who like to justify their not
voting because, oooooh, they claim to be put off by any genuine
laying out of political differences, which they contend amounts to
mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   Bosh and nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   It is not mudslinging to disagree with a political opponent. In
fact, we all should hope and pray for candidates who can _ and will
openly _ disagree on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Along these lines, the press, of course, must do its part. For
the easiest and most obvious example of all: If Gore stays
absolutely enamored of his people-vs.-the-powerful line, someone,
by golly, is going to have to investigate and demonstrate how his
opponent really is as stupid as Gore portrays him. Or, how stupid
Gore must think the electorate is.
</P>
<P>
   For example, were Bush really interested only in helping the
rich and powerful, as Gore contends, Bush most certainly is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bush is not stupid. Neither is Gore. And, Gore, especially
right now, must recognize the electorate's not stupid either.
</P>
<P>
   The Dem vice president and the GOP governor of Texas differ on a
huge number and variety of issues. The majority of the issues are
obvious _ even if the candidates' presentations of their views on
them vs. their opponents' are obfuscated, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of being painfully realistic, there's yet another
point that should be added to the wish-list for Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we all should hope the campaigns will get under way in
great earnestness by then. And, yes, we should hope we are offered,
and we appreciate and understand, a great deal of substance in this
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But we also need to acknowledge that, while Gore was right when
he maintained ``the presidency is more than a popularity contest,''
an election is a whole lot about personality and popularity. And it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to like their president. The president should be
popular. Bush has been considered likable, personable and popular
for a long political time now.
</P>
<P>
   The night Gore accepted the Democratic presidential nomination,
he became likable for a lot more Americans. He also started
climbing up in the polls that night. You think he still wants the
presidency decided exclusively on substance?
</P>
<P>
   The real question is, of course, can we expect any true
substance _ not just promises and vague beliefs _ from either of
them along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they're going to do and however they're going to do it,
it sure would be nice if these two guys get really going on it by
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's a cliche all America oughta like. &QL;

FOR FIREFIGHTERS, IT'S BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHALLIS, Idaho _ They head out before dawn and trudge home after
dark, weary and covered in soot, still clutching the shovels and
axes that are their weapons. They sleep as many as 21 to a tent, in
makeshift camps pitched beneath smoky, lung-choking skies.
</P>
<P>
   That is how thousands of firefighters across the West have spent
summer 2000, a season so devastating that commanders say they
cannot help but view it as a war.
</P>
<P>
   Others are beginning to view it that way, too. In fact, the
United Service Organization, best known for organizing shows to
entertain U.S. troops overseas, has now come to this remote corner
of Idaho. With three former beauty queens dressed in red, white and
blue micro-mini-dresses cooing and flirting from a flatbed truck in
a roadside meadow, the scene along the Salmon River on Thursday was
perhaps only the most surreal in a summer in which fire has drawn
people from around the country to the most isolated of places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely something new,'' said Sgt. Craig Smith, 29,
of Birmingham, Ala., a Marine whose unit was dispatched to eastern
Idaho on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is among some 1,700 men and a handful of women in eastern
Idaho battling the largest of dozens of major fires burning across
the western United States. His coworkers include paramedics from
Tennessee, high-school dropouts from California, and federal
land-managers from all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After working 16-hour days on end, this group found itself
gawking on Wednesday and Thursday nights at the performers from the
USO, an organization whose past tours have almost always been
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our missions are primarily to remote and isolated places, and
there aren't too many places in the United States that qualify,''
said James Pearcy, the USO's director of entertainment. ``But I
guess sleeping on the ground for 30 days in a fire zone in the
middle of nowhere would have to count.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Victoria Reed, a former Miss Maine, the New York-based
troupe performed a medley of staples that included everything from
``America the Beautiful'' to ``All My Lovin','' while planting as
many lipstick-red kisses as possible among a whooping audience that
found it hard to believe what had come to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a year!'' John Wallace, 23, a contract worker from Tule
Lake, Calif., said in disbelief, commenting not only on the
performance but also on the record paychecks that have resulted
from the record fire damage. ``I'm planning on living through the
winter off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, well over 25,000 men and women are involved in the
firefighting, including what will soon number more than 4,000
military personnel from the Army, Marines and the National Guard,
in an operation whose cost is estimated at $15 million a day. But
with 1.4 million acres still burning in the West, the current force
is not nearly sufficient, federal officials say, and a shortage of
trained supervisors means that it cannot prudently be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   So federal officials have said there is little they can do to
fight many of the blazes. From fire camps like this one, the main
effort has been focused far from the flames, in efforts to
safeguard houses from danger and to make sure that the danger has
passed in areas where fires have already burned through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources have just run dry all over the country, and so
we've had to back off to wider lines,'' said Bill Cyr, 48, an
engineer with the Los Angeles Country Fire Department who since
Aug. 5 has bunked down under a yellow-tarp every night with a
20-man Marine unit, for which he is serving as a temporary adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, nearly 6 million acres of land have
now burned this year, and with hot, dry weather conditions in the
West showing no sign of abating, the devastation is likely to
become the worst in at least half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst fires are in western Montana's Bitterroot
Valley, where a wind-driven flare-up in the last two days has added
to a blanket of smoke so thick that on Thursday midday felt like
deepest dusk. But the Clear Creek fire, burning northwest of here
in the Salmon-Challis National Forest, remains the largest single
blaze in the country, spanning some 165,000 acres, with only about
one-third contained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,755 people, 16 helicopters, 66 fire engines
and 14 bulldozers have been assigned to fight the fire. But the
area is so vast and so isolated that commanders say that much of
their time and energy is devoted to logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest substantial airport, in Idaho Falls, is three hours
away from this camp, which is set on a highway so that it can be
resupplied. Reaching the fire lines takes the crews an hour each
way by bus, traveling on narrow Forest Service roads.
</P>
<P>
   And though the food served at the camp is far better than
standard military fare, it does not come cheap, said Dale B.
Thompson, a Park Service ranger based in Arizona who is managing
the food operation here. A Thursday dinner that included halibut
and au gratin potatoes dished up by the Big Sky Catering Co. of
Missoula, Mont., which specializes in providing for fire crews,
cost taxpayers $16 a meal, for a total tab of $12,000, Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The USO troupe flew in and out of Boise, Idaho, seven hours
away, and was returning to New York for regular weekend
performances on the USS Intrepid, the warship-turned-museum now
docked in New York. The Marines, who arrived here Aug. 5, have had
only one day off since, and receive no extra pay for their fire
service, said Lt. Alison Ake, a spokeswoman. The unit is scheduled
to return to California on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the civilian firefighters contracted by the Forest
Service and other federal agencies receive more generous treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They are required to take one day off for every 14 days of work,
or two days every 21, and most of them get time-and-a-half for
overtime, which adds up quickly over the long days. Wallace, the
23-year-old Californian, figures he will earn $3,000 a month this
summer as a member of what is known as a Type II, or second-tier,
fire crew. That is more than triple his regular wintertime wage.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks in the smoke, firefighters say, simple pleasures
feel like enormous rewards. Brian Crawley, a 33-year-old paramedic
from southeast Tennessee, was looking forward to a brief respite
from what would be two back-to-back 21-day fire tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm headed to the big metropolis of Challis,'' Crawley said,
``for two things I can't get here: a bed and a bath.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ As the primeval drama of Richard Strauss'
Elektra flooded from the stage and orchestra pit at the glorious
high-desert opera here last week, a basic truth of the current
presidential campaign came to mind again: revenge.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has repeatedly denied that settling old scores is
a motive force in his race against Al Gore, but almost no one
believes him. Bush is, simply, too ornery a son to sell that line.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Bush was far too involved in his father's
humiliating 1992 banishment from the presidency by the Clinton-Gore
ticket _ and witness to the ex-president's slow recovery of his
genial equilibrium _ for us to accept that getting even is not at
least a subtext for the younger Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last month, the Texas governor told London's
Daily Telegraph: ``You can't win if your reason for running is
revenge. Revenge is such a negative.'' Left unsaid, however, was
the fact that revenge is also a bright-burning fuel. And in the
same set of remarks, Bush conceded: ``I'm a loyalist. I'm a warrior
for George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for many of the GOP candidate's fellow
Republicans. There's good reason that Newsweek's cover of Bush and
his vice-presidential contender, Dick Cheney, who was the elder
Bush's defense secretary, bore a simple caption: ``The Avengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenge is certainly not the Bush campaign's be-all and end-all.
There is an increasingly distinct set of distinguishing issues for
the electorate to base its votes on. But revenge is enough of a
palpable factor that Bush and his campaign _ and his family and its
friends _ must work to keep their exacting memories and injured
feelings in check.
</P>
<P>
   As the post-convention polls and Bush's less-than-steady
campaigning of late show, there's no room in the race for
peevishness.
</P>
<P>
   As warm as the public remembering of President Bush may have
become, we are too egalitarian a nation to put much faith in
political royal houses. Kennedy kin may flourish as vote-getters in
warmly Democratic constituencies, but for all the People magazine
cover-power of the clan, only one has made it to the White House
(so far).
</P>
<P>
   The operatic themes of vendetta and dynasty are more often than
not a passing point of interest in the campaign, an excuse for an
arresting phrase (``restoration convention'' in Britain's Guardian,
``redemption convention'' to USA Today) or, ahem, a column.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of revenge and lineage are not even unknown to Gore.
His political career in Tennessee was in many ways a bid to redeem
his father's defeat in 1970, after a long run as a Southern
populist in the House and Senate, by a rich conservative
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   That was 30 years ago, and the Bush wounds are far fresher, with
President Clinton vividly still on the scene and anxious to parlay
his legacy with the election of Gore. It may not be easy for the
Bushes to resist rising to what looks like it will be plentiful
baiting by Clinton-Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As shrewd a politician as Clinton didn't just happen to observe
in the days immediately before the Republican convention that a
basic rationale of the current Bush campaign was that ``my daddy
was president.'' Former President Bush snapped, threatening to tell
what he really thinks of Clinton ``as a human being.'' Is there
really any doubt what that view is? And would it advantage his
candidate-son if the former president let loose? The answer was so
clearly no that the elder Bush waved from the VIP section in
Philadelphia and quickly returned to an extended vacation in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A close reading of Gore's performance last week in and around
the Veterans of Foreign War convention in Milwaukee pointed to more
bearding. In an interview with Cox newspapers after his speech,
Gore gave a left-handed defense of the elder Bush's endgame in the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always defended former President Bush's decision to
pull back when he had the knife at Saddam's throat,'' Gore said,
quickly adding: ``I think it was a mistake'' but ``an
understandable mistake. ... I think we ought to cut him some slack
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That will have the Bushes, father and son, doing a slow burn.
But a quiet one, if they know what's politically smart.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Elektra, but it's not bad political theater.

DISSIDENT POET FREED BY CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an international protest from prominent
writers, Chinese authorities Friday freed a Boston-based poet and
editor from detention and were set Saturday to put him on a San
Francisco-bound airplane.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official confirmed the release of Bei Ling,
who was jailed Aug. 11 for distributing copies of Tendency
Quarterly, a journal edited in Cambridge, Mass. that regularly
includes articles and essays extolling the virtue of freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   While the official had no information on Bei Ling's brother,
Huang Feng, who was also being held, a Boston associate of Bei Ling
said the two brothers were let go together.
</P>
<P>
   It happened after the US government asked for the release of the
brothers and after several well-known writers protested the
detention. Among those speaking out for Bei Ling and his brother
were Arthur Miller and Susan Sontag as well as Irish Poet Laureate
Seamus Heaney and Mexican poet Homero Aridjis. Sontag wrote an
op-ed piece in The New York Times, calling on the US government to
protest forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   As external pressures grow for more openness in China, the
country's Communist Party leadership has stepped up a crackdown on
dissent over the last year, banning the Falun Gong spiritual
movement, detaining human rights workers and handing down harsh
prison sentences to democratic activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised the case of Bei Ling through diplomatic channels
with the Chinese in Washington and Beijing, noting that we were
unaware of any criminal wrongdoing on the part of Bei Ling or his
brother and urging their immediate release,'' said the State
Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We
welcome their decision'' to release the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese scholars believe that the rush of publicity about Bei
Ling's detention, coming less than two weeks before top Chinese
leaders attend the United Nations Millennium Summit in New York,
helped win his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response from the outside world was very strong,'' said
Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Even more importantly, she said, was that Chinese leaders wanted
to avoid ``any large-scale protests when they come to New York.
There will still be protests but nothing like there would have
been. It does show they care about their image in the outside
world. They don't want to be classified as a renegate nation,
grouped with nations like Iraq and Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Meng Lang, an associate of Bei Ling, said Friday in Boston that
Bei Ling's brother told him over the telephone that the brothers
were fined the equivalent of $22,000 and remain under probation for
the next year. Bei Ling, he said, was to remain under police
supervision until he left the country, allowed only to talk with
his family. Meng Lang said that under pressure from authorities,
Bei Ling paid $2,200 of the fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad that the Chinese government released Bei Ling and
his brother, but they are released only under (probation) and
what's more, they were fined,'' Meng Lang said Friday through a
translator. ``The fine was for the supposed illegal publication of
Tendency, but Tendency is registered in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and it should be protected by American government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei Ling _ who was born Huang Beiling, but began using the name
Bei Ling 12 years ago after arriving in the United States _ founded
the journal in 1993 with several other Chinese exile writers.
</P>
<P>
   They have produced 13 copies, printing between 2,000 and 3,000
editions each time, sending them out by subscription to Sinologists
and Chinese writers as well as taking up to 1,000 copies to China
and giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, the journal was tolerated by
authorities. It published interviews with Heaney, Sontag, Nadine
Gordimer, Czeslaw Milosz and Octavio Paz; ran essays about religion
and Chinese poetry; and generally advocated freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, two uniformed officers and one plainclothes
officer seized several hundred copies of the journal from a bar
near Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   While Bei Ling should arrive in San Francisco this weekend and
later travel to Boston, Meng Lang said that Bei Ling's brother, a
Chinese citizen, will remain in China. ``But he has expressed his
concern over the phone that he is not having full freedoms yet,''
Meng Lang said.

   AMWEST (Phoenix) - The FAA ordered America West on Friday to
prove within a week that it has competed with required maintenance
directives on a quarter of its aircraft fleet. The airline safety
regulatory agency also has given the Tempe-based carrier 30 days to
prepare an action plan for improving its maintenance practices,
oversight and record-keeping. America West would have to ground the
planes if it doesn't satisfy FAA regulators. The action comes as
the result of safety audits the FAA is conducting of all major
carriers in the wake of the Alaska Airlines crash. The action
against America West is the first taken by the FAA relating to
those audits.
</P>
<P>
   The problems the FAA has turned up are similar to concerns the
agency had in July 1998 when it fined the company $2.5 million. By

EX-SUB COMMANDER SAYS NEW TORPEDO MAY HAVE SUNK KURSK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Alexander Nikitin, a former Russian submarine
captain who has been jailed for exposing the dangers of radiation
leaks from that nation's aging fleet, said Friday he believes the
Kursk was sunk by explosions of a new type of torpedo the submarine
was testing.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin, who was cleared earlier this year by the Russian
supreme court of espionage charges in connection with his
revelations of potential radiation dangers, dismissed other
theories about the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As far as suggestions by Russian military leaders that the Kursk
had collided with another submarine or ship, he said in a talk at
Harvard University, ``I think that's just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said some radiation can be expected to begin leaking
from the wreck of the Kursk within a few months, but that is not
the biggest radiation danger in the region; other Russian
submarines, mothballed but still loaded with nuclear fuel, are
sitting at docks and poorly maintained, and they could begin
leaking radiactivity at any time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, he said of the Kursk that, ``I
know that kind of submarine really well, I've been on them many
times. Such submarines don't just go down all of a sudden. Some
serious event took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``my personal version'' of what must have happened,
he said, ``I'm almost positive that two torpedos exploded in the
forward section.'' He added that he was ``pretty sure'' of this
because he had seen information to that effect on the Web site of a
Russian military newspaper, Krasnaia Zvezda (Red Star), but the
information was removed an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information concerned possible testing of two new torpedos
on the submarine at that time,'' Nikitin said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested the exploding torpedo theory. Earlier this
week, a report in the newspaper Izvestia said, ``The typical
training torpedo does not contain explosive materials. But an
experimental torpedo containing a liquid-fuel rocket could have
exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin, who has been working for more than five years to draw
attention to the problems of the ailing Russian nuclear program and
its potential for environmental devastation, was trained as a
nuclear engineer before becoming a submarine captain. He has
undergone 12 trials and spent more than 10 months in jail so far,
and faces another attempt by prosecutors to revive the case against
him this fall. He is being supported by the human rights
organization Amnesty International, which sees him as a classic
case of an environmental whistleblower facing harsh government
reprisals for his revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is heroic,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate
director of Harvard's Davis Center for Russian Studies, who invited
Nikitin to talk there Friday. ``How many of us are willing to go to
jail for our principles?''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin said the new torpedos are being developed as a
cost-cutting measure. Conventional solid-fueled torpedos use silver
in critical components, but the liquid-fueled versions do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new torpedos probably exploded, and the first section''
_ the forward part of the sub where the torpedo tubes are located _
``was severely damaged. They didn't have time to blow their tanks
in order to surface. The bulkheads between sections one, two, and
three were probably destroyed as well, which affected the hermetic
seal of the entire submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that even if the first section of the submarine and
its ballast tanks were completely flooded, the sub would still have
been able to surface. Only if two or more sections and their tanks
were flooded would it be unable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He said specialists had reported that the sub first sank to
about 200 feet, then to 330 feet. At 360 feet, he said _ about the
depth where the sub ended up _ the water pressure would have been
sufficient to destroy any remaining bulkheads.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he said, there was nothing that any survivors on
board could possibly have done to surface. There were probably one
or more air pockets within the sub, he said, and ``as the time went
on, the air pocket probably migrated from one section to another''
as the sub settled, and ``the crew probably migrated with it. But
eventually, the ship was completely flooded and the crew
perished.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea, still being pushed by Russian authorities, that
there had been a collision, Nikitin said the Kursk has a
displacement of 23,000 tons _ an exceptionally large submarine.
``If a collision had occurred, it would have required a submarine
of similar size'' to cause the Kursk serious damage, he said.
``There was nothing like this around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin said that leakage of some radioactive cooling water from
the Kursk's two nuclear reactors could begin within a few months.
But, he added, this is not the greatest radiation danger in the
region, just the tip of a much larger iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kursk added to the existing situation, but there is a more
dangerous situation'' already in the area, Nikitin said in an
earlier interview. ``There are more than 110 submarines that are
laid up but not disposed of'' at docks around the Murmansk region.
These subs, many of which contain more than one nuclear reactor,
add up to a total of about 250 reactors in the area.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it, Nikitin said, ``the largest concentration of such
reactors in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these submarines, he said, ``some have been laid up for ten
to fifteen years and still have their reactors on board. It's a
very serious situation, they could sink at any time. The longer
they are docked, the harder it will be to dispose of the nuclear
reactors later on.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation, he said, is ``very dangerous not only for the
environment, but for the people who work there.'' And, he said,
``the Russian government doesn't have the means to solve these
problems at the moment.''

FIDDLE PLAYER CLIFF BRUNER DIES OF CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
Houston fiddle player Cliff Bruner, a pioneer in Western swing and
one of the most influential musicians in the history of Texas
country music, died Friday of cancer at his home. He was 85.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruner played fiddle for more than 70 years. He was fiddler for
Milton Brown's Musical Brownies, the first true Western swing band,
which predated even Bob Wills' Texas Playboys.
</P>
<P>
   Local steel guitar and fiddle player Bill Dessens described
Bruner as ``legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was about 12 years old, he decided he didn't want to
pick cotton anymore. So he bought himself a fiddle,'' Dessens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Johnny Gimble's biggest influence. He was such an
influence on every fiddle player in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliff is the guy who pioneered Texas swing fiddle,'' Gimble
said. ``He gave me goose bumps.'' Gimble has played fiddle for
Willie Nelson and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner liked to say he didn't learn his style from anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to improvise,'' he said, ``take a tune and put a
little something extra in it instead of playing it note for note.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Texas City, Bruner grew up in the woods near Tomball. As
a teen-ager he traveled around the country trying to start a band.
He was asked to join the Musical Brownies in 1935, at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in Houston, Bruner formed the Texas Wanderers.
</P>
<P>
   The group also featured steel guitarist Bob Dunn, mandolin
player Leo Raley, guitarist and singer Dickie McBride, pianist and
singer Moon Mullican and bass player Hezzy Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Wanderers became a top-performing attraction here. They
later shifted to Beaumont, playing live three times daily on radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Wanderers scored a national hit with Floyd Tillman's ``It
Makes No Difference Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago their material from 1937 to 1950 was collected
for a five-CD set, ``Cliff Bruner and His Texas Wanderers,'' which
is still available.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner could not pursue stardom due to the illness of his first
wife, Ruth. He went into the insurance business, and the two were
in Amarillo when she died at 34.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Houston and got married again, to a woman also
named Ruth, working in business while playing music on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be 10 a.m. Monday at Canon Funeral Home in
Waller. Burial will be at Decker Prairie Cemetery. Visitation will
be 6-9 p.m. Sunday at the funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner is survived by his wife, Ruth; six daughters, Norma Sue
Wiley, Carol Lynn Woods, Madelyn Gresham, Peggy Gordan Rutledge,
Arlene Brewer and Paula Boney Morris; 17 grandchildren; 16 great
grandchildren; and five great-great-grandchildren.

BUSH, IN MIAMI, COURTS LATIN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Saying that Latin America ``often remains an
afterthought in American foreign policy,'' George W. Bush Friday
pledged to build strong ties to the region, but pleased his South
Florida audience by promising to retain a tough stance against
Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In a major foreign policy address, the Republican presidential
contender said that if elected, he would push for a ``special
relationship'' with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to promote business development with $100
million of no-collateral ``microloans,'' forgive $100 million in
debt in exchange for conservation of tropical forests, and
encourage American churches and businesses to adopt Latin
counterparts and support US charitable ventures in Central and
South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek not just neighbors but strong partners. We seek not
just progress but shared prosperity. With persistence and courage,
we shaped the last century into an American century. With
leadership and commitment, this can be the century of the
Americas,'' Bush told an audience of 500 assembled at Florida
International University.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor followed his speech with a meeting in Texas
with Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, met Thursday with President
Clinton and Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
With all three, Fox pushed the concept of an ``open border'' along
the 2,000-mile front between the neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from his hour-long session with Fox in Dallas, Bush
said: ``Mexico is crucial to having good relations in Latin
America. Relations between Mexico and the United States are really
important, so I'm honored that the president-elect took time to
visit with me in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush presented Fox with a white Stetson cowboy hat, and the
Mexican leader responded by giving Bush brown cowboy boots. ``The
21st century should be the century of Mexico, Latin America,'' Fox
said, ``and certainly we can say that it's the century of Nafta,''
referring to the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement that
liberalized trade among Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Florida, Bush said that should he win, he wants to
have a summit meeting in November with Fox, even though neither
would have been sworn into office at that time.
</P>
<P>
   While foreign affairs is considered a Bush weakness, the
campaign welcomed the change of subject after what it considered a
strong issue, a proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut, came under fire
this week. The governor admitted Tuesday he had not done a good
enough job selling the plan, prompting a fresh wave of criticism
from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who ignore Latin America do not fully understand America
itself,'' Bush told the university audience. ``This country was
right to be concerned about a country like Kosovo, for example, but
there are more refugees in the conflict in Colombia. This country
was right to be concerned about a country like Kuwait, but more of
our oil comes from Venezuela. America is right to welcome trade
with China, but we export nearly as much to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his speech accepting the Republican nomination in
Philadelphia, Bush said the president and vice president had
``squandered'' opportunities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has no strategy. We have seen
summits without substance, and reaction instead of action,'' the
governor said. ``We were promised fast-track trade authority, as
every American president has had it for 25 years, and yet this
administration failed to get it. We were promised a Free Trade Area
of the Americas, yet it never happened. Chile was promised
partnership in Nafta, and it was `delayed.' ... Should I become the
president, I will look south, not as an afterthought, but as a
fundamental commitment to my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign rejected the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one breath of difference between what he's
proposing and the priorities of this administration, either things
we have approached Congress with or have suggested ourselves,''
said campaign spokeswoman Kym Spell. ``Time and time again, the
Republican Congress threw up roadblocks or thwarted our efforts to
get these things.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush delivered his first major foreign policy address last
fall in California, the Gore campaign complained he focused on Cold
War opponents such as Russia and China without mentioning Africa or
the Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bush said that while he realized communist powers
``cannot be bullied into progress,'' he would not yield when it
came to Cuba and its leader, Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge the Castro regime to surprise the world and adopt
the ways of democracy. Until it frees political prisoners and holds
free elections and allows free speech, I will keep the current
sanctions in place,'' he said, as about a third of the audience
gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging support for Radio and TV Marti, which beam
pro-democratic messages to Cuba, Bush said: ``My word to you, Mr.
Castro: Let your people live in freedom.'' Again he received
applause from his audience in Dade County, a heavily Cuban-American
area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the governor's public appearances Friday, the
Bush campaign released its third TV ad of the general-election
campaign. Called ``No Changes, No Reductions,'' it shows Bush
pledging during his acceptance speech to reform Medicare and Social
Security without reducing benefits for ``the greatest generation''
of current recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The ad will run in several of the 21 states where Bush's first
two ads were shown.

 &HT;    Bush appeals to Latinos and the elderly in Florida campaign
stomp
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Appealing to Hispanic voters in Florida and other key
states with large Latino populations, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
promised Friday to expand free-trade with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for another targeted audience, Bush also released a new
campaign ad Thursday vowing that there will be ``no changes, no
reductions,'' in Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who arrived in Florida Thursday night to attend a private
event raising more than $1.5 million for GOP campaigns, spoke to a
mostly Hispanic audience at Florida International University Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Bush pledged to work toward giving Mexico the
same partner status that Canada and Great Britain share with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I become president, I will look South, not as an
afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment of my presidency,''
Bush said of Latin America. ``Just as we ended the great divide
between East and West, so today we can overcome the North-South
divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks just hours before flying to Texas for a
meeting with Mexico's President-elect Vicente Fox. Bush said that
if he is elected president, he will ask Fox to meet with him before
the inauguration, ``to keep Mexican-American relations moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Bush already have one disagreement. Fox wants an
increase in open borders so that Mexican workers can come into the
United States more easily. Bush and the Clinton administration have
expressed reservations about Fox's proposal. Bush said he wants to
hire more border patrol officers so that, ``we can make our borders
more than just lines on a map.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised to work closely with Colombia and other
countries in their ``battle against Narco-terrorists.'' Bush said
the United States should increase efforts to help countries replace
drug crops with other legitimate income producing crops.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush wants to open free-trade with most of Latin America
he said he is not prepared to do the same thing with Cuba saying
President Fidel Castro, ``has not even begun the journey,'' toward
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I challenge the Castro regime to surprise the world and
adopt the ways of democracy. Until it frees political prisoners,
and holds free elections and allows free speech, I will keep the
sanctions in place,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee said Congress should give
the president ``fast track'' authority allowing the president to
negotiate trade agreements without fear of Congress attempting to
amend the agreement. Congress would only be able to accept or
reject the entire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Because the president does not have fast-track authority,
``other nations are unwilling to negotiate with us seriously,''
Bush said. President Clinton asked for fast-track authority but the
Republican-controlled Congress refused to give it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign also unveiled a new advertisement Friday that is
being shown in key battleground states, including Florida. Aimed at
seniors, the 30 second commercial promises ``no changes, no
reductions'' in Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad Bush also promises to, ``make prescription drugs
available and affordable for every senior who needs them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad concludes with these lines: ``you earned your benefits.
You made your plans. And President George W. Bush will keep the
promise of Social Security. No changes. No reductions. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris LeHane, campaign spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic nominee, called Bush's prescription ad claim ``100
percent false.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They only way Bush could accomplish that goal would be by
voting for Al Gore. Bush literally spends more money on his
misleading ad then he does on his prescription drug plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore will be campaigning in Tallahassee on Monday with his wife,
Tipper. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, is expected to be in
Florida on Thursday.

SOME SEE PAIR IN FATAL WAREHOUSE FIRE AS SCAPEGOATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nov. 28, 1942. Fire breaks out in Boston's Cocoanut Grove
nightclub, flames creeping along the fabric-covered walls, then
racing across the dance floor. Patrons and employees try to escape,
but owner Barnett Welansky has barricaded most of the exit doors. A
revolving door, one of the few routes out, quickly gets jammed; 492
people perish inside. Welansky is convicted of involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 3, 1999. Fire breaks out in the Worcester Cold Storage and
Warehouse Co. building, when two homeless people, squatting inside,
knock over a candle during an argument. They leave the building
without telling anyone. Hours later, six Worcestver, Mass.
firefighters die in the blaze. The homeless pair, Julie Barnes and
Thomas Levesque, are charged with involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The two tragedies, separated by more than 50 years, are
connected by the threads of Massachusetts' legal system: the
prosecution's case against Barnes and Levesque rests largely on
precedents set in the case of the Cocoanut Grove. Upholding
Welansky's conviction in 1944, the Supreme Judicial Court
established the definition of involuntary manslaughter _ ``an
unlawful homicide unintentionally caused by wanton or reckless
conduct'' _ that state courts are bound by today.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Superior Court Judge Timothy Hillman, and
possibly a jury, to determine if Barnes's and Levesque's conduct
rose to the standard of ``wanton and reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Hillman considers a motion to dismiss the case, it will
also be in his power to determine whether Barnes and Levesque
should have been charged with manslaughter at all. And if the
Cocoanut Grove case sets the standard, some criminal defense
attorneys say, the Worcester case doesn't come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in the most extraordinary kinds of cases that these
kinds of charges are brought,'' Boston defense attorney Jamie
Sultan said. The Cocoanut Grove case, he said, involved ``much more
than ordinary negligence. Certainly, not reporting a fire _ I can't
think of any circumstance where that would be deemed a criminal
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some criminal defense lawyers say the magnitude of the
Worcester tragedy, and the community's outpouring of grief and
anger, has led to an overzealous prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horrific situations sometimes lead publicly elected officials,
such as a district attorney, to act when he normally would have
handled the situation differently,'' said J. W. Carney Jr., a
criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor. ``There was such
an outpouring of sorrow and outrage in Worcester that it's easy to
find a scapegoat. Sometimes, tragedies just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Worcester prosecutors say Barnes and Levesque could have
prevented the tragedy, had they behaved differently. At a hearing
earlier this month, assistant District Attorney Larry Murphy told
Hillman that the pair were behaving recklessly before the fire
spread: They were trespassing in a building and scuffling on a bed,
and they failed to notice the flames right away.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze would not have been as massive, or the results as
tragic, if Barnes and Levesque had reported it right away, Murphy
said. They clearly knew the fire was dangerous, he said, because
they left the building without gathering their belongings. But
because they didn't call the fire department, he said, the fire
gathered strength for at least an hour before it was detected.
</P>
<P>
   The pair had ``absolutely no concern for the other man,'' he
said. ``Absolutely no concern for the firemen. We say that's
reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levesque's attorney, Ed Ryan, told the court there was a
clear difference between the Welansky case and the Worcester fire.
Welansky's decision to barricade nightclub doors was ``intentional,
affirmative conduct,'' Ryan said. Barnes and Levesque made an error
of omission _ failing to report the fire. And while that might
constitute negligence, Ryan said, it shouldn't be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could leave this building today and see some poor soul under
attack in the street,'' Ryan said. ``If I turn around and go the
other way, having had the opportunity and the knowledge to look the
other way . . . can I be charged with involuntary manslaughter if
that person dies?''
</P>
<P>
   That argument is a foundation of the criminal justice system,
defense lawyers say. Neglecting a duty to the community might be a
moral failure, they say, but it's rarely prosecuted as a criminal
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not required, upon pain of criminal penalties, to
be responsible citizens,'' Sultan said. ``People are free to be
responsible . . . or irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Worcester case isn't quite so clear-cut, Boston defense
attorney Harvey Silverglate says, because Barnes and Levesque
didn't just see the fire _ they caused it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a fire that you started, do you have an obligation
to report it, since a fire is an inherently dangerous thing?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Hillman acknowledged the complexities of the case during the
hearing earlier this month. He asked prosecutors whether ``we are
about to set a standard'' by trying Barnes and Levesque. And he
asked defense attorneys whether, in some cases, there is a legal
obligation to report a fire: ``If a candle were tipped over in a
multifamily dwelling . . . would there be a duty to the other
tenants?''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense dictates that there would, Ryan replied. ``If you
have an inhabited building and you know it and you start a fire,
you can't walk away from it,'' he said. ``That doesn't amount to a
recognition that not calling someone would result in the deaths of
six firefighters.''

 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday.
 &HT;    Tales from the front lines
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If any places were ripe for fires of epic proportions
this summer, they were the vast forests, brushlands and grasslands
of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   For years, massive amounts of combustible dead limbs, toppled
trees and logging debris _ what foresters call fuel _ had been
accumulating on the forest floors and had reached dangerous levels
in huge stretches of woodlands. In many forests, the deadwood stood
higher than six feet, a sure sign of unhealthy woods, forestry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the fuel-choked forests was that until the 1970s,
the U.S. Forest Service's policy was to extinguish all fires. A
public education campaign featuring Smokey the Bear in a park
ranger hat drummed into Americans a revulsion to wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists later realized that fire actually is a friend of
the forest. Occasional low-intensity fires that sweep through
woodlands remove deadwood and underbrush and return vital nutrients
to the soil without harming mature trees and other vegetation and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   When fires are suppressed and deadwood builds up to massive
levels, forest fires can become towering infernos, able to leap
from tree crown to tree crown with explosive speed, turning huge
swaths of forests into charcoal and threatening houses and entire
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, Forest Service scientists and other land
management agencies have tried to offset the deadly buildup of dead
trees and brush with deliberate ``prescribed'' burnings. They also
have altered their once strict fire-suppression policies to let
fires burn themselves out in wilderness areas if human habitation
is not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   But forestry experts say the effort has been too little and too
late. Just this month, critics were laying part of the blame for
the western fires on the Clinton Administration, saying the White
House had not acted quickly enough after being warned over the
years that there was a small window of opportunity _ perhaps a
decade _ before the forests became so inundated with fuel that
every fire could have catastrophic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 40 million to 60 million acres of federal forest _ nearly
all of it in the West _ are in dire need of thinning, forestry
officials say. And the drought is complicating matters.
</P>
<P>
   Three good years of rainfall that spurred the growth of plants
were followed by a searing drought. This year's dry spring was
lethal. It dried out vegetation more quickly than usual, extending
the growing season, and also melted snow more rapidly, so that more
water than usual ran away in streams instead of soaking gradually
into the ground to keep vegetation green longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fuel here has only about 4 to 7 percent moisture; that's
about as dry as lumber dried in a kiln,'' said Keith Wooster, a
biologist with the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia who was
dispatched to the Ryan Gulch area 30 miles east of Missoula, Mont.,
to fight a major wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a smoky ridge overlooking a steep slope where the
Ryan Gulch fire roared nearby, Wooster pointed to a layer of dead
limbs, each about the diameter of a baseball bat. ``They are so dry
you could light them with a match,'' he said _ and then he had to
walk briskly to get away from the intense smoke and heat welling up
from the wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet away, his colleague, George Custer, a fire
protection expert with the Ocala National Forest in Florida, used a
drip torch to set a ``backfire.'' It would remove fuel from the
advancing wildfire; with nothing to burn, the wildfire would go
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least that's what we hope,'' Custer said. ``We're literally
fighting fire with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big wildfires were sparked by dry thunderstorms that
have produced much lightning and little rain. A few wild blazes
have been human-caused. No matter what triggers them, when the
cataclysmic fires get going, their ashes can be borne aloft and set
new fires as far as a half mile away.
</P>
<P>
   What complicates the firefighters' jobs is that the West is
adding population rapidly, creating what's called an
``urban/wildfire interface'' of houses, farms and ranchettes tucked
high among the trees. In such a setting, the highest priority for
firefighters is to protect the homes and other structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going into situations that, absent homes and property,
we wouldn't be putting firefighters into,'' said Steve Frye,
incident commander for the firefighting efforts in Montana's
Bitterroot Valley. He called the intense fires raging in the valley
``unprecedented,'' with veteran firefighters saying they have never
witnessed such ferocious fires, with flames shooting up 150 feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   Given the flames' unpredictability, protecting people and their
homes and barns and other structures may, even under good
conditions, require high-risk tactics. Critics say that if people
insist on living at the very edge of forests or in the woods
themselves, then they should not expect firefighters to endanger
themselves to protect dwellings so vulnerable to wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   One of the critics is Forest Hayes, the mayor of Darby and a
retired Forest Service district ranger. The Bitterroot Valley, he
says, has become a focal point in the national firefight because of
the sheer number of homes pressed up inside remote canyons and
under the canopy of the lodgepole pine forests that throughout
history have been the scene of dramatic forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire trucks have a hard time getting up to those houses,'' he
said as he stood in a park in Darby last week, updating residents
on the fires and offering words of comfort and advice to frightened
homeowners. ``And when they build, they leave debris and brush
right up to the very edge of their homes; that's inviting the fire
to come get you.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 285,000 acres have burned in the Bitterroot area
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 1.5 million acres in 11 western states have
succumbed to wildfire so far this summer, the most destruction from
wildfires in at least 50 years. Before the flames are finally
snuffed out, they will be the worst in more than a century, veteran
firefighters say.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30,000 firefighters are battling the blazes across the
region, with reinforcements from Canada, Australia and New Zealand,
as well as from the Army and Marines, who together have dispatched
three battalions. The government is spending at least $15 million a
day to stop the fires. Southwestern Montana is ground zero.

3,000 RAYTHEON WORKERS SET TO STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 Raytheon Co. manufacturing workers in Massachusetts
may strike this weekend in a contract dispute that has exacerbated
frayed relations between the defense firm and much of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were still under way Friday night at between Raytheon and
the union that represents its local blue-collar employees.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are ``seriously divided'' on issues such as health
and pension benefits, union leaders said earlier this week.
``Things aren't going well,'' said a person familiar with the talks
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The union's contract expires at midnight Saturday; a meeting is
scheduled Sunday morning at which members will vote to strike or to
continue to negotiate with the Lexington, Mass. defense company.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiators also want job-security guarantees following
thousands of layoffs by Raytheon in recent years. The company has
shifted missile programs to plants in Arizona, where it pays
workers less; the Pentagon says the transfers have saved Raytheon
as much as 35 percent on some programs.
</P>
<P>
   Saving cash is a priority for Raytheon, whose stock trades at
around a third of the high it reached last year because of earnings
disappointments. It expects to have some leverage over the union,
which after layoffs represents just a fraction of the Raytheon's
14,000 Bay State employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the union, Local 1505 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, is also digging in.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders feel betrayed for helping the company win a
controversial state tax break in 1995 on the understanding the deal
would preserve jobs. And even though the US Labor Department has
sued to require a new election of Local 1505's top officers, the
union member whose complaints led to the suit said he supports the
current leaders in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they recommend a strike, I'll be the first one out on the
picket line,'' said the dissident, George Noel, a circuit-card test
operator and an unsuccessful candidate to become the union's
business manager last year. As described to him by other union
members, Noel said, the company's recent offers have been
``atrocious.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's current contract was ratified two years ago and
provided wage increases of 5 percent in its first year and 4
percent in its second year. Now union negotiators seem to be
seeking increases of at least 5 percent a year to keep pace with
rising cost of living in the Northeast. But one example for
Raytheon is an agreement it struck last fall with workers at its
Arizona missile plants, who received a four-year contract providing
annual raises of 3 percent to 4 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   Another stumbling block is paid time off. Protected from layoffs
by their seniority, most of Local 1505's workers are 40 and older,
and receive five weeks of vacation a year, plus nine sick days.
Raytheon is seeking to give each employee 25 days off a year,
effectively eliminating the sick leave many enjoy, according to
sources on both sides of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman David Polk declined to specify the company's
exact positions, but said ``we have hope that we can reach a
successful agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk said negotiators are seeking a contract ``that is fair and
equitable to our employees and that still enables the company to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Local 1505's president, Stanley Lichwala, nor its
business manager, Michael Zagami, returned phone calls. Lichwala
has hinted of a pending strike in the past and, in an interview two
weeks ago, said that ``the union is united to fight the company to
get a fair contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Local 1505 filed its answer to the Labor
Department's lawsuit in US District Court in Boston this week,
denying the government's contention that its election last year
violated federal election rules.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the government's charges are based on complaints by
Noel. He alleged ballots weren't counted secretly in last year's
election because the polling-booth partitions were too low, and
that fliers supporting Zagami's candidacy were mailed at union
expense. The government says the union agreed in March to re-run
the election, but then reversed itself.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 23 response Local 1505 called the Labor Department
``incapable'' of supervising a new election. When government
officials tried to do so, according to the filing, they ``directed
and/or permitted Raytheon Company to interfere with, restrain,
and/or coerce employees and/or union representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department spokesman declined to comment. Said
Raytheon's Polk, ``Raytheon maintained complete neutrality
throughout'' the election process.

<P>
   The writing of American history underwent a significant change
in the 1960s and '70s, one that remains in place today. Not only
did the Vietnam War set off a reaction against national
institutions, especially the state, but the growth of
``liberation'' movements also led many women, blacks, gays and
other groups to demand their own distinctive, ``usable past.''
Increasingly, younger historians shifted their emphasis from the
public life of the nation to the private lives of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, an explosion of historical categories _ race,
gender, ethnicity, sexuality _ had supplanted the more traditional
fields of political, diplomatic and intellectual history. Those
formerly on the margins of American society now got the lion's
share of attention.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the new history have worried about the
fragmentation of the past, with each group telling its own story,
on its own terms, in its own ``authentic'' voice. And even
advocates wondered at times about the place of these categories in
the larger scheme of things. How do they fit together? What does
the research tell us about the overall culture or the exercise of
power in public life? Where is the framework that connects the
parts to the whole?
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the prestigious Journal of American History surveyed
its members about the state of the profession. Those who responded
_ mostly academic historians _ agreed that the greatest improvement
in the field was the inclusion of ``more diverse people from the
past.'' Yet when asked to list the greatest weaknesses, the
respondents placed ``narrowness,'' ``political correctness'' and
``divorce from the public'' at the top of the list. Diversity, it
appears, does not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   In a biting critique, the journal's respected editor, David
Thelen, portrayed the new scholarship as ``too obscure to
appreciate and too remote from everyday life.'' The profession had
reached a point, he warned, ``where dazzling people with the
unfamiliar and erudite was more highly prized than telling a good
story or distilling wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years have passed, but the issues linger. Interviewed
recently at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he teaches
American history, Thelen still frets about his profession's divorce
from the larger world. Yet he also claims to have widened his own
focus in teaching and scholarship in terms that reflect the new
social history. ``It's difficult to view the nation-state as an
agent of progressive change anymore,'' he says. ``I'm trying to
stress the more human elements of history. The ways that
individuals experience events, interpret them and then remember
them are essential to understanding our national culture and
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians see a clearer pattern of progress in recent
years. ``Specialization is essential,'' says Linda Kerber, a
history professor at the University of Iowa. ``The grand old
theories we inherited were fragile and poorly researched. They
didn't match up to our present standards of evidence, and we needed
to be specific in order to puncture their claims. Microstudies are
really the building blocks of change.''
</P>
<P>
   And change, Kerber believes, means a more honest, complex and
inclusive vision of the past. With a solid foundation now in place,
she says, historians are beginning to ask the large questions that
make good synthesis inevitable. ``We're on the cusp of something
extraordinary,'' she says, ``an explosion of knowledge that is
revolutionizing the profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Other historians, including Eric Foner of Columbia and David
Levering Lewis of Rutgers, are less confident. Foner, whose books
on race, slavery and freedom reach audiences well beyond the
academic walls, is concerned by what he sees as the continued
reluctance of historians to impart broad meaning in their written
work.
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, he notes, it's just the opposite: ``We all do
synthesis there. Events don't simply happen. We provide an
interpretive framework that ties the new social history to larger
themes of ideology and power. We give students a clear but
contested narrative that makes sense of the major features of
American history while highlighting the diversity of our
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Foner adds, ``we stake out positions on the big
issues and we defend them. When a student asks, `Why did Andrew
Jackson veto the bank bill?' we don't stumble around and give 15
different scenarios. It seems so natural in the classroom, yet so
very hard to do in print.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The failure to write boldly and clearly may help explain why
commercial publishers _ not to mention the reading public _ are
deserting academic history. Indeed, professional historians find
themselves in an odd position today. Their subject is growing in
popularity, yet their once considerable influence is on the wane.
Fewer people are seeking their wisdom about the past.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, the most widely read narratives in
American history are no longer written by academic historians; and
even the freshest theories connecting America's past and present
are appearing in the books of ``outsiders,'' like the journalist
Michael Lind's ``New American Nation,'' published in 1995, and the
economist Robert Fogel's ``Fourth Great Awakening,'' released a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't always the case. Grand narratives and big theories
once dominated the writing of American history. From George
Bancroft and Frederick Jackson Turner in the 19th century through
Charles and Mary Beard, Richard Hofstadter and Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. in later years, the great historians combined elegant prose and
sweeping synthesis in ways that are rarely seen today.
</P>
<P>
   Turner wove the tale of an exceptional nation removed from the
corrupting influences of Europe, a country where the frontier
produced the perfect mix of abundance, individualism and equality.
The Beards viewed American history in equally heroic terms, with
``the people'' battling the ``special interests'' for economic and
political control.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, an influential school of ``consensus'' history
emerged. Postwar historians were haunted by memories of Nazi
genocide, the threat of Soviet expansion and the spread of
McCarthyism. Wary of mass movements on the left or right, they
stressed the beliefs and values that united Americans rather than
the crises and upheavals that divided them.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hofstadter and his enormously popular books ``The
American Political Tradition'' (1948) and ``The Age of
Reform''(1955), the more creative consensus historians worked the
neighboring fields of sociology and political science. New theories
of human behavior emerged linking McCarthyism to past extremist
movements and charting the assimilation of immigrant groups into
the mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   There were dissenters, too. William Appleman Williams turned
American exceptionalism upside down by portraying the nation as a
greedy colossus searching endlessly for raw materials and foreign
markets. Although some historians condemned him as a dangerous
radical, there was, in fact, a large common ground. What united
scholars like Turner and the Beards, Hofstadter and Williams, was
their preoccupation with national history, their interest in how
the United States was created, how it developed and, ultimately,
how it should be judged. By focusing on large themes, they became
valued participants in the public life and civic culture of their
time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the field of American history up into the 1960s was a
simpler, more restrictive place resembling an old boys' club, with
leading scholars training their successors in elite departments
reserved mostly for Protestant white men. The writing naturally
reflected this insulation. There was no violence on Turner's
frontier, no slaves or American Indians to muddle the story. Women
rarely entered these historical narratives. Racial and ethnic
tensions were often minimized or ignored. The new history of recent
decades exploded this complacency.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a way to combine the diversity and specialization of
today's history with the grand narratives of the past? Can
professional historians win back a broad audience?
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. Lewis, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for
his 1993 biography of W.E.B. Du Bois, observes that mastery of the
synthetic narrative is far more difficult than it appears. At its
best, he says, ``the well-told story about the national past should
always be an argument, a thesis, an analysis disguised in the
action and drama of its narrative.'' This is not, he declares, ``a
formula to be commended to all professional historians.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems a formula worth trying. This past year Scott
Sandage, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, taught a
graduate seminar in American history. From the outset he stressed
the importance of good writing, a clear thesis, solid organization,
the telling of anecdotes and a smooth narrative flow. His message
apparently got through. The final papers were quite readable,
Sandage says. And he got an extra bonus as well. When the course
ended, one of his students presented him with a plaque containing
four well-chosen words: ``It's the story, stupid.''

&HT;     THIS YEAR'S TRAVERS LACKS A JIM DANDY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT GRAVES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ If you're a history buff, the Travers
has some interesting nuances to consider.
</P>
<P>
   An important factor to include when drawing up your Travers
ticket is that since 1986, a horse who raced in the Haskell has
come from New Jersey to win the Midsummer Derby six times. That's
nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while many trainers believe a race over the Saratoga Race
Course track is a major plus entering the 1 1/4-mile Travers, the
fact is that only six Jim Dandy participants have won it since
1970.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have the Jim Dandy winner (Graeme Hall) in this field,
but there are four Dandy also-rans in this field of nine _ Albert
the Great, Unshaded, Postponed and Curule. Does that mean you can
throw out all of them? No, but keep it in mind.
</P>
<P>
   We have four horses coming from the Haskell _ Dixie Union,
Commendable, Impeachment and Milwaukee Brew. Only two of them ran
very well, winner Dixie Union and Milwaukee Brew, who finished
third.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Mandella never has run a horse in the Travers, but he's
certainly won plenty of other big races, most of them on the left
coast. So you have to take notice that he's trying Dixie Union in
the 131st running of the Midsummer Derby. I know I am.
</P>
<P>
   In Dixie Union, Mandella has a 3-year-old that is fulfilling the
promise he showed before a knee chip sidelined him after last
year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile, where he was one of the favorites at
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   His win in the Haskell on Aug. 6 over the likes of Captain
Steve, Milwaukee Brew and More Than Ready signals he's good enough
to beat this suspect Travers field, which was weakened by the
defections of Red Bullet and Graeme Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And Mandella said something this week that made me believe he
thinks he has the best horse in the field. Mandella said he
probably would have sent Dixie Union against older horses in this
weekend's Pacific Classic at Del Mar if he hadn't already been in
the East. Taking on General Challenge and River Keen is certainly a
stiffer task than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd have run him in the Swaps Stakes, I sure would have
thought about it,'' Mandella said. He'd have thought about it, but
would he have done it?
</P>
<P>
   This Travers field lacks real star quality, with Commendable
being the only Triple Crown race winner in it. No Fusaichi Pegasus,
no Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union beat Milwaukee Brew and Impeachment in the Haskell.
Albert the Great would need a major recovery from his seventh-place
performance _ dead last _ in the Jim Dandy to win the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Curule is a possible threat, as are Unshaded and Postponed, but
none of them has ever won a Grade I stake. Country Coast ran third
in the Illinois Derby against a weak field. Why is he here?
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark about Dixie Union is whether he can get 1
1/4 miles. But considering that his sire is Dixieland Band and his
dam is by Capote, it appears that 10 furlongs may be a bit beyond
his scope. Dixieland Band has sired more sprinters than routers.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brew may sound like the name of a horse who should be
running at Finger Lakes, but I liked the way this son of Breeders'
Cup Classic winner Wild Again closed against the grain of
notoriously speed-favoring Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union also closed well, but his normal style is to be on
or near the lead.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken back because of early traffic problems in the
Haskell, but likely will be up near the pack in the Travers.
Milwaukee Brew lost by only a length under jockey Mike McCarthy. In
the Travers, he gets Jerry Bailey. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a horse owned by Frank Stronach (who also owns Red
Bullet) and trained by Tino Attard, a Malta immigrant who was one
of 26 children. What a millennium Travers story this would be.
</P>
<P>
   The picks: Milwaukee Brew, Unshaded, Dixie Union, Albert the
Great.

AMERICAN CATHOLIC PRIEST IN KENYA FOUND SHOT TO DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ An American priest who made many enemies among
the powerful and corrupt in Kenya was found shot to death Thursday
on a rural roadside a few yards from his pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. John Anthony Kaiser, 67, a
native of Minnesota who had lived in Kenya for most of the last 36
years, died from a shotgun blast to his head. Near his body was a
shotgun and in his shirt pocket a live round of its ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said they suspect it was murder, not suicide,
and the American ambassador here has urged the Kenyan police to
accept help from the FBI in the investigation. No spent shell was
found on the scene. A local reporter who saw the body said Kaiser
was shot from the back with such force that he was nearly
decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with periodic _ and unsolved _ politically
motivated murders, human rights groups were quick to suspect
someone in government whom Kaiser had angered with his frequent,
and public, denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in Kenya is desperate to kill Father Kaiser and why now?''
asked Willy Mutunga, head of the Kenya Human Rights Commission, at
a news conference of human rights groups, lawyers and women's
groups Friday in downtown Nairobi. ``They could only be powerful
people who saw him as a moral thorn in their evil flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser most recently ran afoul of a Kenyan minister of state,
Julius Ole Sunkuli, over allegations that the official had sexually
violated a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the girl reportedly sought counsel from Kaiser, who
advised her to speak to lawyers who later pursued a case against
Sunkuli. The minister was charged with statutory rape in June and
is expected to appear in court again later this month. He has
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   After the allegations became public, Kaiser, a member of the
Society of St. Joseph, was refused renewal of his work permit. The
permit was granted late last year only after strong protest from
the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's difficulties with government officials stretch back at
least to the mid-1980s, when he became active defending victims of
land disputes. He also spoke out against politically motivated
tribal clashes in the early 1990s, and criticizing two top Kenyan
government ministers for involvement in the eviction of farmers
from their land in the Rift Valley. He was held under house arrest
briefly in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   An official close to the investigation of Kaiser's death said,
however, that the evidence did not immediately point to any
particular suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have pronounced it a murder and we assume that is
the case,'' said an official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Beyond that _ and beyond the general fact that he had
a number of enemies _ there is no specific theory about who did
this or why they did it. It could be anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kaiser's body was found _ near the town of Naivasha, about
50 miles northwest of Nairobi _ some of Kaiser's friends have told
reporters that he seemed unusually agitated in the past several
days. In recent weeks he reportedly told several people he feared
for his life.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Kaiser reportedly had dinner with the bishop
of Ngong, about 25 miles west of Nairobi, and left about 7 p.m. to
drive to his parish, about 150 miles west.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's body was found by a passing motorist about 6 a.m.
Thursday near his Toyota truck at the roadside, said police
investigator Mary Ruara. She said the scene had been arranged to
suggest a suicide, with sheets and blankets laid out near the
pickup.

EXAMINING BUSH'S TAX CUT PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-TAX-EXPERTS) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the shorthand of presidential politics, Gov.
George W. Bush's tax-cut proposal is either an overdue effort to
return to citizens what is rightfully theirs, or, as Vice President
Al Gore puts it, a risky scheme to reward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying that political debate are a welter of complex and
ideologically charged economic policy issues that have a strong
bearing on the government's fiscal health and the nation's chances
of extending its long run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush's tax cut fit within the projected federal budget
surpluses, or would it endanger the government's chance to pay off
the national debt? Would the Bush plan extend the long business
expansion or lead the red-hot economy to blow a gasket? Would it
apportion the federal budget surplus fairly to everyone? Are tax
cuts _ especially those, like Bush's, that would reduce income tax
rates _ a more productive economic use of the surplus than
increased government spending?
</P>
<P>
   Objective answers are hard to come by, as they always are with
tax policy, but the parameters of the debate are well defined.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus is on the scale of Bush's plan, which would
reduce all income tax rates, double the child credit, provide a
break for married couples, repeal the federal estate tax and expand
the deductibility of charitable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax cut would reduce federal revenues by $1.3 trillion in
the nine years starting in 2002, and it would use up $1.6 trillion
of the surplus over that period. That figure includes the increased
interest costs the government would have to pay if any of the
surplus were spent or used for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But that would make Bush's plan considerably smaller than the
tax cut championed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. If it had
not been partially offset by subsequent tax increases before it
became fully effective, the Reagan plan as passed would ultimately
have amounted to an annual tax cut equal to 4 percent of the gross
domestic product, according to a calculation by Robert S. McIntyre,
the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group.
</P>
<P>
   If fully enacted, the Bush plan would eventually reduce taxes by
about 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product, McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   More important than its absolute size is whether the tax cut is
affordable, given the size of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first nine years of the Bush tax cut, starting in 2002,
the total surplus is projected by the Congressional Budget Office
to be $4.3 trillion, assuming that government spending rises at the
rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $2.1 trillion would be the non-Social Security surplus,
which is the portion up for grabs for tax cuts and spending. (The
two parties have agreed that the portion of the surplus generated
by Social Security should go only to reducing the national debt or
shoring up the retirement system.)
</P>
<P>
   So on the face of it, Bush's tax cut during that nine-year
period _ $1.3 trillion plus $300 billion in interest costs _ would
still leave $500 billion for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are already a host of calls on that $500 billion.
There is considerable bipartisan support for taking off the table,
for tax cuts or spending, the portion of the surplus being
generated by Medicare _ more than $300 billion over the nine-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are heading toward adding a prescription drug
benefit to Medicare. There is backing in both parties for tax cuts
not included in Bush's proposal. And Bush has made expensive
commitments of his own, from expanding access to health care to
building a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no assurance that the surplus will
materialize as projected. Even if it does, history suggests that
more of it might go to spending programs than is assumed in the
surplus projections, given the well-established propensity of both
parties to spend more than they say they will.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's team said there was plenty of money available for the
tax cut and for other needs. Bush has said he can save $200 billion
over the next decade by improving the way government operates, and
he has vowed to crack down on government spending. His plan makes
no provision for taking the Medicare surplus off the table. Even
after adding $256 billion in spending increases over 10 years for
the military, education, agriculture and other programs, his
advisers say there would still be a substantial buffer left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush asked us to identify the biggest problems in the
tax code and come up with a way of fixing them,'' said Lawrence B.
Lindsey, the head of Bush's economic team. ``The reforms he's
suggesting do just that while preserving a balanced budget and
allowing a paydown of the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the tax cut is affordable, there is a debate over
whether this is the right time to enact it.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, the economy has been running at or
above what most economists consider to be its capacity for
noninflationary growth, and by putting more money into the hands of
consumers, a tax cut could be expected to further stimulate growth.
That in turn could increase inflation pressures, leading the
Federal Reserve to try slowing the economy down again by pushing
interest rates to a higher level than they would be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's team said that the fiscal stimulus would be very modest,
and in any case would be far less than the stimulus created by the
government spending increases backed by Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lindsey said, Bush's tax cut would be phased in
gradually over the decade, and ``no one knows what the economic
circumstances will be in 2004 or 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has increasingly stressed a populist message, Gore has
tried to focus attention on who would benefit most from Bush's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice found that 59.4 percent
of the total tax cut would go to households with incomes in the top
10 percent, $92,500 or more, with that group getting an average tax
cut of $6,410. The bottom 60 percent of households, those with
incomes less than $39,300, would get 12.6 percent of the total tax
cut, an average of $227.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's team looks at the question from a different angle,
suggesting that lower-income people would benefit proportionately
more than upper-income people, at least relative to the size of
their existing tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign produced figures showing that a family of four
with two incomes totaling $47,500 _ the national median _ would see
its federal income taxes decline by 56 percent under the Bush plan,
to $1,493 from $3,393 under current law. By contrast, a family of
four with one worker making $250,000 would see its tax bill fall by
13 percent, to $59,187 from $68,031.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-income people would pay a bigger proportion of the tax
bill after the Bush tax cuts than before them,'' Lindsey said.

NEW MEXICO BLAST CAUSES CONCERN ABOUT TEXAS PIPELINE 
 
  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Land Commissioner David Dewhurst said
Friday that he was ``scared'' by similarities between a natural gas
pipeline that exploded in New Mexico last weekend and an old
pipeline that may be reopened to transport gasoline from Houston to
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similarities between the ... pipeline that blew out ... and
the Longhorn pipeline, quite frankly, scare me,'' Dewhurst said,
even though the two pipelines are designed for different
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Dewhurst visited the site near Carlsbad, N.M.,
where 11 people were killed and another person critically injured
Aug. 19 when the pipeline operated by El Paso Natural Gas Co.
exploded near their campsite.
</P>
<P>
   Both pipelines, he said, are about 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the pipeline business, that's not a good thing,'' he added.
``There have been six major pipeline blowouts (in the United
States) since 1985. Like Longhorn, all six of these blowouts have
involved pipelines that were installed in the 1950s and the 1960s _
old pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Texas pipeline, owned by Dallas-based Longhorn
Partners Pipeline, was built in 1950 to carry crude oil from West
Texas to refineries in Baytown near Houston. It has been inactive
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst also said that both the El Paso pipeline that blew up
and the Longhorn pipeline run through areas of high salinity, which
contributes to corrosion, the second leading cause of pipeline
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a draft environmental assessment of the Longhorn
pipeline found that the pipeline's corrosion-control practices were
``questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary investigation found corrosion in one section of
the blown-out pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst toured the site of the New Mexico blast with National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a pretty scene,'' Dewhurst said. ``Apparently the
fireball was 1,200 degrees. It reached 350 feet in height. Sand
turned to glass. Concrete turned to powder. ... It's a scene I'll
never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   On its 700-mile proposed route across Texas, the Longhorn
pipeline would pass through or near residential neighborhoods in
Houston, Austin and several other communities and would cross the
environmentally sensitive Edwards Aquifer, from which drinking
water is drawn, in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst said that 42,000 people in the Houston area's Harris
County alone live within 1,250 feet _ less than one-quarter of a
mile _ from the Longhorn route. Two elementary schools in Harris
County, he said, are located within 200 feet of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn proposal has drawn heavy opposition from
landowners, environmentalists and public agencies. Dewhurst said he
will continue to work to block the Texas pipeline until he is
convinced it can be operated safely.
</P>
<P>
   Longhorn said in a written statement that a federal regulatory
review of its pipeline proposal, which is now under way, will
produce ``one of the most extraordinarily safe and environmentally
sensitive pipelines in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time that the land commissioner had publicly
raised questions about the Longhorn pipeline. In March, he
announced that he would not sign easement documents necessary for
the pipeline to operate across six Texas rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst said Friday that he hoped the Longhorn pipeline could
eventually be put into operation, and he said he was willing to
work with the company to make sure all his concerns about safety
were adequately addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the pipeline should and can be safe,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst said he will discuss with federal officials how much of
the Longhorn pipeline should be replaced and whether part of the
line should be rerouted to bypass heavily populated and
environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   Among other points that still had to be worked out, he said,
were assurances that pipe bends, which are often difficult to
inspect, had been adequately inspected for corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Longhorn said that it was confident a safety
and environmental study now being conducted by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of
Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety ``will incorporate the
newest and most stringent standards for pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Dewhurst) is going to be greatly relieved when the
final (federal) approval with its mitigations (improvements) is
issued because just about every concern he's expressed will be
addressed in that document,'' added Longhorn spokesman Al Erwin.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin also said that part of the pipeline may be replaced, but
he didn't know how much.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the Longhorn pipeline would eventually compete with
entrenched West Texas gasoline suppliers, including New
Mexico-based Navajo Refining Co. Navajo is fighting the project and
has helped to fund some of the citizen opposition to the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mexico explosion and the Longhorn controversy come at a
time when federal regulators have been slapping pipeline operators
with fewer fines.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office report issued in May raised
questions about decisions by the Office of Pipeline Safety to
reduce the use of fines against operators and lessen its dependence
on state inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst said the federal agency employs only 55 inspectors to
cover 2 million miles of pipeline in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1998, 226 people were killed and another 1,030
were injured in accidents along the nation's natural gas and
liquids pipelines, according to a GAO analysis of the Office of
Pipeline Safety's data.

   Imagine a meeting that puts Israel's chief rabbi, an emissary of
Iran's top ayatollah, the head of the World Council of Churches and
a granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi together in the same room. An
unexpected grouping, to be sure. But it would have only a few of
the spiritual figures due to begin meeting at the United Nations on
Monday, when 2,000 people from 90 nations and a wide spectrum of
faiths are to begin spending four days on issues related to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a unique opportunity for religious leaders to have an
impact on the political process,'' said Bawa Jain, a veteran of
interfaith activities who is general secretary of the event, the
Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Jain, 44, a native of India and citizen of the United States who
lives in New Jersey, has traveled widely, asking prominent people
in the worlds of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism
and other faiths to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, backed by a large advisory board filled with
religious figures, scholars and diplomats, has been organized in
cooperation with the office of the U.N. secretary-general. But it
is not an official U.N. event, and its financing has come largely
from foundations.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of its breadth, the event is not unique. At meetings in
South Africa last year and in Chicago in 1993, the Parliament of
the World's Religions drew wide interfaith participation.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be, as Jain said, the biggest in terms of the high
level of leadership involved. Among its goals is the creation of an
advisory council of religious leaders to work with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to have helped in attracting participants are the
event's location, at the United Nations; its timing, in the year
2000; and its focus on peace. Five hundred delegates are coming,
many with associates as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the religious figures mentioned above _ Rabbi
Meir Lau, from Israel; Ayatollah Abdollah Vaeze Javadi, from Iran;
the Rev. Konrad Raiser of the World Council of Churches; and Ela
Gandhi _ those attending are to include Cardinal Francis Arinze, a
Vatican official representing Pope John Paul II; Kuni Kuniaki, high
priest of Shintoism's Grand Shrine at Ise, Japan; and Bishop Vashti
McKenzie, first female bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   (One major figure not attending is the Dalai Lama, spiritual
leader of Tibet, whose presence at the United Nations was blocked
by objections from China, casting a shadow over the proceedings.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jain belongs to the Jain faith (it is not at all unusual, he
said, for believers to carry its name as their own). It originated
in India and espouses ahimsa, or nonviolence toward all living
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   He is vice president of the Interfaith Center in New York, an
organization headed by the Rev. James Parks Morton, retired dean of
the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Morton spoke of Sushil Kumar, Jain's spiritual
mentor, who was long active in promoting dialogue among religious
groups. ``All of the big, international interfaith conferences I
attended, he was there,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said Kumar had a religious vision at age 7, was ordained a
Jain monk at 15, and was deeply affected by the violence between
Hindus and Muslims that marred the independence of India and
Pakistan half a century ago. Kumar, he said, pursued interfaith
activities as a way of improving relations between adherents of
different religions.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar came to the United States in 1975 and, six years later,
found a site for the area's first Jain temple, on property occupied
by a Jewish summer camp in Blairstown, N.J. Jain, then running a
construction company in India, supplied craftsmen for the project.
Before Kumar died in 1994, he asked Jain to take a lead in
interfaith efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said the process culminating in the event next week had
originated in a conversation between Ted Turner and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Turner suggested that religious
leaders ought to come together to promote world peace, Jain said.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said a U.N. official had asked him to get involved, after
which he sought assistance from David Finn, founder and chairman of
Ruder-Finn, a public relations company in New York. Finn's daughter
Dena Merriam, a Ruder-Finn partner and vice chairman who works with
religious and cultural organizations, joined in, lining up
foundation support.
</P>
<P>
   The event's advisory board has more than 40 people, including
the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Kueng. Its chairman is Maurice
Strong, an adviser to Annan who organized the Earth Summit in
Brazil in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said he found inspiration for the event in the memory of
Kumar. ``It's his blessing,'' Jain said.

 &HT;    Ready to knock the stuffing out of you
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Safeties typically are a motley bunch. They have
to be fast enough to run with the wide receivers, cocky enough to
intimidate those same wideouts, hit hard enough to knock a running
back out of his shoes and salty enough to change defensive calls
just by reading the quarterback's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   These same safeties _ free and strong _ usually walk with a
swagger and chatter to anyone who'll listen.
</P>
<P>
   They have a roguish attitude, a devious glint in their eyes, a
devil-may-care approach to the game and life.
</P>
<P>
   Then you have the University of Texas' starting safeties _
senior Greg Brown and junior Lee Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Both are self-confessed mama's boys with hearts as soft and
mushy as a too-ripe banana.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson got so homesick two years ago that he boxed all his
stuffed animals and called his mother to pick him up and take him
back to Longview. These days, his teammates call him ``Tigger''
because his dorm room is decorated in the overwhelming orange and
black motif of that famous cartoon character from ``Winnie the
Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a big kid,'' said Ahmad Brooks, Jackson's suite
mate, rolling his eyes as he described his buddy's dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the team's fashion plate, found himself spending his
monthly meal money check and maxing out two credit cards to buy
designer duds when he got to Texas in 1997. He's since curbed his
spending and switched preferences from cotton knit to silk. His
mall time now is spent in the classroom, and with his B average in
pharmacy, he has the best chance of any UT defensive player to be
named academic All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, these guys are anything but the stereotypical
safety. But they leave those soft hearts on the sideline, with
their on-field play indicating they might be the best safety combo
in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good tandem because physically, they're so much
alike,'' said UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese. ``They both have
a lot of tools, and they both bring a lot to the table
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Added secondary coach Everett Withers: ``Safeties come in all
shapes and sizes . . . I've never been associated with safeties
with this size and athleticism. But that's the trend these days to
find those big rangy guys who can run.
</P>
<P>
   It took several strokes of fate to even have them playing beside
each other. Jackson battled an intense case of homesickness before
earning a starting job as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, I didn't want to be here,'' Jackson
said of his first semester at UT in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only injuries forced the coaches to take a long look
at Brown. He was third string last season in the opener against
North Carolina State. By the fourth quarter against the Wolfpack,
after season-ending injuries to Quentin Jammer and Chris Butcher,
Brown was the starter by default.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew in my heart I was a pretty good player,'' said
Brown, a teammate of quarterback Major Applewhite at Catholic High
School in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I needed a little boost. God gave me the chance. He was on
time, although I had always wanted the playing time a little
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 6 feet 3 inches and 210 pounds, is blessed with an NFL
physique. He has grown two inches and gained 20 pounds since his
senior season at Longview High when he was one of the most coveted
defensive back prospects in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Longhorns voted Jammer, the safety-turned
cornerback, as the team's hardest hitter, Jackson was named on
several ballots.
</P>
<P>
   He notched 86 tackles last season, second best on the team to
the 101 by defensive tackle Casey Hampton. In only the first week
of preseason drills, Jackson already has stuck a teammate so hard
that he almost gave himself a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a freak accident,'' Jackson said earlier this week, a
day after he suffered pain and nausea from his big hit. ``I'm not
going to hold back. I'm still going to go out there and hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Brown: ``Yeah, Lee's stacked. He looks like an NFL
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is only a shade smaller at 6-2, 210. And he, too, can
deliver a blow. He started the final 13 games of 1999 and by
season's end was an honorable-mention pick on the coaches'
all-conference team. His 82 tackles were third best on the team
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his high grades and excellent leadership ability, he
also was named UT's representative to the NCAA Foundation
Leadership Conference last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Brown plans on becoming a pharmacist after football, but he
would like to give the NFL a chance next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a real good shot of getting drafted in one
of the late rounds if I can drop my 40 time a tenth or two,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But first, I want to win me a national championship.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, Kashmir _ Asiyah Andrabi, conservative Muslim and
radical feminist, believes that women should be heard and not seen,
so she makes her demands for equal rights from behind the black
cloth curtain of an all-enveloping burqa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veil is for security as Allah wishes it,'' she said,
pausing to refresh her hidden mouth with sips of Coca-Cola. ``If
gold is left uncovered along a roadside, anyone will grab it,
because it is a precious thing. It is the same with an uncovered
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons for Andrabi to conceal her face. She is
a militant who opposes Indian rule here. For most of the last
decade she has been living either in jail or on the lam,
alternating her efforts between the liberation of women and that of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Indian intelligence agents say they suspect that she is a
conduit for money to guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   But her notoriety is owed to flamboyant rather than clandestine
activities. As head of Dukhtaran-e-Millat, or Daughters of the
Community, she has led hundreds of women in street protests. At
times they have carried brushes and paint cans beneath their
burqas, blackening any advertisements that show scantily clad
models.
</P>
<P>
   With the same sense of righteousness, Andrabi has also tossed
colored dye into the faces of Muslim women who shun the veil.
Western dress is popular here in Srinagar, the summer capital of
the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Often Andrabi is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such upstarts are like a plague for us,'' said one older
Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
   With so well-known a reputation and so little-known a face,
Andrabi, 37, carries about her short frame a sense of mystery. But
she is hardly press-shy, alerting favorite reporters whenever she
calls a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with her are rare, though. She phones the reporters,
not the other way around. Rendezvous are set, broken, reset.
Finally, she kept a date, arriving late with her eight-month-old
son asleep on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``To people from the West I may seem a contradiction,'' she said
in excellent English, her diction a tip-off to an upbringing in a
wealthy family and a college education. ``But I have never felt
that this veil _ this purdah _ has been a hardship to my work.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to serve up a suitably vexing contradiction to her
self-declared feminism, she said that lately she had been nagging
her husband to marry a few extra wives.
</P>
<P>
   She explained: ``Allah says a man can marry one, two, three or
four wives, but he must have the means to do justice to them all.
The jihad against India has left so many widows and orphans. A man
has a responsibility to look after them.''
</P>
<P>
   She told her life story.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a doctor, was a devout Muslim. But while he urged
her to get a secular education, he encouraged only his sons to
study the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   She studied biochemistry at college in Srinagar. But when she
wanted to get an advanced degree, she said, her family refused to
let her leave home. While in a prolonged sulk, she happened on a
book about women who had converted to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me that I was so unfamiliar with my own religion,''
she said. ``It is a tragedy that only men go to the mosque, and
women are told their only duty is to look after the children. In
truth, Islam grants individuality to men and women. In heaven,
before Allah, a woman, too, will be asked about her worldly
deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   She studied the Koran _ and encouraged other women to do the
same. ``Our society cruelly restricts women, from the words of the
Prophet, from school, from jobs,'' she said, her voice taking on an
angry edge. ``But in today's world women can even be astronauts. So
they must be educated. You know, an ignorant woman cannot answer
even the simplest question from her child, and a mother must be the
first school for her children.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 a revolt erupted in the predominantly Muslim Kashmir
Valley, an insurgency that still goes on. Andrabi believes now, as
she believed then, that Kashmir ought to sever itself from India
and become part of Pakistan, an Islamic state that in her view
needs to do better by its own women and be truer to its faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the whole universe should be governed by the laws of
Islam, and Allah says all Muslims should be united as one,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute involves dozens of political parties and
soldierly factions, some foreign, some domestic, some Islamic, some
secular.
</P>
<P>
   There is usually little role for women in such a male-dominated
occupation as holy war. ``The social milieu does not allow it,''
said Abdul Ghani Bhat, the leader of an umbrella group of Kashmiri
organizations. ``It's hard for a woman to go into the market to
make a speech or go into the forest to shoot a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrabi, then, is quite the exception. Her husband, Muhammad
Qasim, who belongs to the militant group Jamiat-ul-Mujahadeen, is
her life partner in jihad. In 1990, at age 27, she told her father
that she would accept an arranged betrothal so long as the groom
was active in the insurgency. She met Qasim on the day of their
wedding, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each has been arrested several times. Indian jails are brutal
places, Andrabi complained. In 1993, when their first son was a
baby, she was jailed for 13 months. The infant was allowed to stay
with her. ``But all he had was my breast milk,'' she said. ``They
gave him not even a biscuit.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants her sons to grow up with gun in hand. ``I want them to
be mujahids,'' she said. ``I never pray or dream that they be
doctors or prime ministers. I want them to be mujahids who fight
for the cause of holy Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   If she ever has a daughter, she said, maybe she will be a prime
minister.

   ``There's a unique opportunity for religious leaders to have an
impact on the political process,'' said Bawa Jain, a veteran of
interfaith activities who is general secretary of the event, the
Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Jain, 44, a native of India and citizen of the United States who
lives in New Jersey, has traveled widely, asking prominent people
in the worlds of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism
and other faiths to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, backed by a large advisory board filled with
religious figures, scholars and diplomats, has been organized in
cooperation with the office of the U.N. secretary-general. But it
is not an official U.N. event, and its financing has come largely
from foundations.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of its breadth, the event is not unique. At meetings in
South Africa last year and in Chicago in 1993, the Parliament of
the World's Religions drew wide interfaith participation.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be, as Jain said, the biggest in terms of the high
level of leadership involved. Among its goals is the creation of an
advisory council of religious leaders to work with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to have helped in attracting participants are the
event's location, at the United Nations; its timing, in the year
2000; and its focus on peace. Five hundred delegates are coming,
many with associates as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the religious figures mentioned above _ Rabbi
Meir Lau, from Israel; Ayatollah Abdollah Vaeze Javadi, from Iran;
the Rev. Konrad Raiser of the World Council of Churches; and Ela
Gandhi _ those attending are to include Cardinal Francis Arinze, a
Vatican official representing Pope John Paul II; Kuni Kuniaki, high
priest of Shintoism's Grand Shrine at Ise, Japan; and Bishop Vashti
McKenzie, first female bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   (One major figure not attending is the Dalai Lama, spiritual
leader of Tibet, whose presence at the United Nations was blocked
by objections from China, casting a shadow over the proceedings.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jain belongs to the Jain faith (it is not at all unusual, he
said, for believers to carry its name as their own). It originated
in India and espouses ahimsa, or nonviolence toward all living
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   He is vice president of the Interfaith Center in New York, an
organization headed by the Rev. James Parks Morton, retired dean of
the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Morton spoke of Sushil Kumar, Jain's spiritual
mentor, who was long active in promoting dialogue among religious
groups. ``All of the big, international interfaith conferences I
attended, he was there,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said Kumar had a religious vision at age 7, was ordained a
Jain monk at 15, and was deeply affected by the violence between
Hindus and Muslims that marred the independence of India and
Pakistan half a century ago. Kumar, he said, pursued interfaith
activities as a way of improving relations between adherents of
different religions.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar came to the United States in 1975 and, six years later,
found a site for the area's first Jain temple, on property occupied
by a Jewish summer camp in Blairstown, N.J. Jain, then running a
construction company in India, supplied craftsmen for the project.
Before Kumar died in 1994, he asked Jain to take a lead in
interfaith efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said the process culminating in the event next week had
originated in a conversation between Ted Turner and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Turner suggested that religious
leaders ought to come together to promote world peace, Jain said.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said a U.N. official had asked him to get involved, after
which he sought assistance from David Finn, founder and chairman of
Ruder-Finn, a public relations company in New York. Finn's daughter
Dena Merriam, a Ruder-Finn partner and vice chairman who works with
religious and cultural organizations, joined in, lining up
foundation support.
</P>
<P>
   The event's advisory board has more than 40 people, including
the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Kueng. Its chairman is Maurice
Strong, an adviser to Annan who organized the Earth Summit in
Brazil in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said he found inspiration for the event in the memory of
Kumar. ``It's his blessing,'' Jain said.

LYNCHING 85 YEARS AGO STILL HAUNTS GEORGIA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ The oak grove where Leo M. Frank was lynched
here 85 years ago, in one of the most infamous cases of
anti-Semitism in American history, long ago gave way to suburban
strip malls. An inconspicuous commemorative plaque marks the spot,
just south of the Big Chicken, a looming metal rooster outside a
fast-food restaurant that is the most distinctive landmark in Cobb
County.
</P>
<P>
   But if the plaque is inconspicuous, the Frank case is not,
especially this summer, when reminders abound.
</P>
<P>
   They include a play about the lynching of Frank, a Jewish
factory superintendent convicted amid anti-Semitic frenzy of
murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan; a Web site listing the names of
prominent Mariettans said to have organized his lynching, and a
debate about a statue of a civic leader who fanned the mob.
</P>
<P>
   For some Old Mariettans, or OMs as they are known, this
confluence of events is seen as a welcome opportunity for
catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tragedy that's unique here,'' said Chuck Clay, a
local lawyer and head of the state Republican Party, who
acknowledges that his great uncle was involved in the lynching.
``Should we draw our own unique lessons? I hope so. This story
always bears repeating. We should never let our guard down and
think we've vanquished prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, wish the Frank case would just go away. When
The Marietta Daily Journal published a letter urging a community
apology, the response from other letter writers was uniformly
hostile. It is Leo Frank's relatives who should apologize and not
the good citizens of Marietta, one letter writer replied. Why stir
up old wounds, another asked? Some things are best left for
Judgment Day, wrote a third.
</P>
<P>
   The Theater in the Square, a former cotton warehouse 300 yards
from Mary Phagan's grave, chose the play ``The Lynching of Leo
Frank,'' by Robert Myers, to open its 19th season, in keeping with
a philosophy to showcase local themes. It is a stark drama that
chronicles the murder, trial, conviction, death sentence,
gubernatorial commutation and subsequent lynching of Frank.
</P>
<P>
   The play does not address the question of Frank's guilt or
innocence. But the identities of many of those who orchestrated his
lynching, which was viewed by a festive crowd of 6,000 and praised
in the local newspaper of the day, have been an open secret here
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Several people _ including Bill Kinney, 75, a columnist at the
Marietta Daily Journal, and Dan Cox, 61, founder of the local
Museum of History _ have long had lists of the prominent men who
organized the lynching and whose descendants are among the elite of
Cobb County today. These lists, not identical but with considerable
overlap, were assembled from deathbed confessions, notes on the fly
leaves of family Bibles and the like. But they were closely guarded
until a few months ago, when Stephen J. Goldfarb, a research
librarian, posted one version, with 23 names, on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The posting caused a flurry of interest in the case, here and
across the country. So did an op-ed article this month in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution by a law professor at George
Washington University, calling for the removal from the state
Capitol grounds of a statue of Tom Watson, a newspaper publisher
and later a U.S. senator, whose calls for vigilante justice after
Gov. John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence helped fuel the
lynching.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's great grandson, Tom Watson Brown, a lawyer and part
owner of the Atlanta Falcons football team, insists that Frank was
lynched _ and justifiably so, he said in an interview _ not because
he was a Jew but because the governor freed him because he was a
law partner of Frank's lawyer. Brown has been quoted in recent days
making remarks so offensive to Jews that a prominent local rabbi,
Steven J. Lebow of Temple Kol Emeth, said he was considering
lodging a complaint with the state bar association and the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta and Cobb County have long had reputations as places
where intolerance has a comfortable home. But in recent years they
have become far more diverse and less conservative, resembling the
average Southern suburb. In the last 10 years, Lebow said, his
congregation has grown to 900 from 50, and most members ``do not
feel the presence of anti-Semitism on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are echoes of the past. When Philip M. Goldstein, a
major property owner in town and longtime city council member,
proposed selling a parcel of land on the town's antebellum square
for a 12-story mixed-use building, reaction was hostile. Residents
at a public hearing responded not just with shouts and
foot-stomping, but with anti-Semitic slurs. One elderly man
approached Goldstein's sister and spat out, ``Remember what
happened to Leo Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, whose grandfather testified as a character witness at
the Frank trial and was whisked out of town for safety the night of
the lynching, persuaded all but one local reporter not to publish
the ugly remark. He also refused to discuss a swastika that was
painted on a retaining wall at the disputed property, and painted
over by Cox, a descendant of both slave owners and Klansmen, who
said he has unlearned most of what his family taught him. Cox also
said that Goldstein routinely receives hate mail, that his car was
once torched and that ``if his name was Jones he wouldn't have
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein demurred when asked about bigotry here. ``Questions of
anti-Semitism, I generally don't talk about them,'' he said. ``I
don't care to do damage to a city my family has lived in for three
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebow is saddened by Goldstein's studied silence. He said Jews
in the South, even these days, have a ``natural propensity to adopt
a protective coloration to blend in'' and are ``unwilling to stand
up and say anything'' when faced with the occasional act of
anti-Semitism. He blames this fearful silence on the Frank case,
which he calls ``the original sin of Cobb County.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the rabbi said, he has received many phone calls
from Jews begging him to keep silent about the issues of the play,
the Watson statue and the list of names. ``This is self-defeating
behavior,'' he lamented, ``because silence always encourages
ignorance and bigotry.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The management of the Port Authority Bus Terminal
near Times Square believes a half-ton statue of the actor Jackie
Gleason will make commuting more enjoyable for the 185,000
passengers who catch a bus there daily. And the promoters of the
cable television channel TV Land, which has relaunched the 1950s
series ``The Honeymooners,'' couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters can draw their own conclusions on Monday morning, when
an eight-foot bronze statue of Gleason as Ralph Kramden _ the
Brooklyn bus driver he portrayed in ``The Honeymooners'' _ will be
mounted outside the Eighth Avenue entrance to the world's busiest
bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry if the sidewalk gets a bit squeezed with the
bigger-than-life Gleason, the management says. ``The congestion
that you envision happens during the rush periods,'' said Cedrick
T. Fulton, general manager of the bus terminal. ``The majority of
the hours of the day, that situation doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton sees the statue as part of the terminal's effort to make
the commuting experience a memorable one and envisions passengers
stopping to have their pictures taken with the statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to delight my customers, to tell the world this is
a great place,'' he said. ``There is nothing to worry about, come
and visit sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   TV Land, which has paid for the statue, says it is ``honoring a
public icon.'' The channel is not being charged a promotional or
advertising fee by the Port Authority. Rob Pellizzi, vice president
for marketing, says the statue belongs to a publicity campaign that
``has been concentrated on the biggest bang.'' Pellizzi said the
channel was thinking of promoting its other shows with ``similar
partnerships'' across the country.

 &HT;    Huddle up: Big 12, name your starters
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Greg Cicero's tunnel vision isn't so extreme
that he fails to notice what's going on beyond the Waco city
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime Texas Longhorn is focused on establishing himself as
the starting quarterback at Baylor this fall as the Bears try to
begin the uphill climb from a 1-10 pratfall in Kevin Steele's
head-coaching debut. Cicero readily acknowledges he occupies an
unsettled position for Baylor but is quick to note that that hardly
makes him unique this year in the Big 12 Conference, especially
among the Lone Star State branch of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look around.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas, the Longhorns are encouraged by Major Applewhite's
rehabilitation from knee surgery and are wondering about the
ramifications of a subsequent battle with Chris Simms for the
starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas A&AMP;M, Coach R.C. Slocum has picked Mark Farris over
Vance Smith and redshirt freshman Colby Freeman. Farris will get
his first career start in the opener at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech fans fervently hope that sophomore Kliff Kingsbury
lives up to the tantalizing promise shown in his limited
appearances last season as he directs first-year coach Mike Leach's
air-it-out offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun part of this season will be that in addition to it
being my starting time, it'll be theirs, too,'' Cicero said of the
other mostly unproven quarterbacks. ``When we play each other,
it'll be mano-a-mano: me against them to draw some comparisons, and
that's the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be fun. You should want to do your best against the
best, and there are a lot of good quarterbacks in this league even
though most of them are pretty inexperienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the respective fates of the Big 12's Texas contingent _
and to a lesser extent some of their brethren to the north as well
_ rest in large part this season on their ability to stabilize
potentially ticklish quarterbacking situations. That's nothing new,
of course, for the most important position on the field, but it's
more pronounced this year because of the rash of quarterback
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think there are (QB) issues all across the country,
not just here, because it's such a critical position,'' Texas Coach
Mack Brown said. ``It's obviously the most difficult position to
play on the team, and if you don't have one, you get beat. Period.
It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications could be especially significant at Texas and
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   If the Longhorns are to justify TV analyst Beano Cook's
prediction that they'll be in the Orange Bowl's national
championship game, then Brown must resolve the Applewhite/Simms
situation as delicately as possible to avoid distractions and
possible divisiveness. At A&AMP;M, coming off an 8-4 season in which
the Aggies were shut out twice and lost three games by a 112-6
margin, Slocum knows he needs Farris, or someone, to step up in
order to avoid another disappointing season that would make his hot
seat even hotter.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes aren't as high at Tech and Baylor. The Raiders are in
their first year in Leach's system, which produced Tim Couch at
Kentucky and record-setting passing numbers last season at
Oklahoma. The Bears hope Cicero's headiness and accuracy can help
them begin the climb back to respectability after last-place
divisional finishes in each of the Big 12's first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback questions aren't limited to the Texas schools.
Oklahoma State hopes Tony Lindsay, out most of last season with a
knee injury, regains the form that made him the Big 12 freshman of
the year in 1997. National championship hopeful Nebraska arguably
has the league's best in Eric Crouch, but a redshirt freshman,
Jammal Lord, backs him up.
</P>
<P>
   The other top teams in the North _ Kansas State and Colorado _
also have their questions. K-State returns starter Jonathan Beasley
and experienced backup Jeremy Milne. But redshirt freshman Ell
Roberson III, a highly touted runner and thrower from Baytown Lee,
is expected to have a major impact _ if the hand injury he had in
two-a-day workouts isn't serious. Roberson has been compared to a
young Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that you go into the spring the way you
finish the fall,'' Snyder said recently. ``Jonathan came out of
(last) fall as our No. 1. The situation was competitive in the
spring, and I will say the gap was closed, but Jonathan remained
the No. 1 quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado lost starter Mike Moschetti and backup Adam Bledsoe. So
the job will be in the hands of sophomore Zac Colvin or
junior-college transfer Bobby Pesavento, and only Colvin has
started a Division I-A game (one, at that).
</P>
<P>
   But that is there and this is here. Closer to home (south of the
Red River, in other words), this is how the quarterback pictures at
the four Texas schools are coming into focus.
</P>
<P>
   BAYLOR
</P>
<P>
   After last season, when the Bears ranked last in the Big 12 in
passing, total offense and scoring offense, Steele's immediate
recruiting priority was a junior-college quarterback who could step
in immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We targeted six guys,'' Steele said. ``And we felt Greg was
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than the 2,800 yards and 33 touchdowns Cicero threw
for last season in leading Palomar College of San Marcos, Calif.,
to an 8-3 mark. It was also for the two years he spent at Texas,
even though he never got on the field in a real game.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero redshirted as a freshman in 1997. In August before the
1998 season, a severe knee injury sidelined him for the year.
Believing he was losing a numbers game with Applewhite's emergence,
he decided to transfer to a junior college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't your traditional transfer,'' Steele said. ``He'd
spent two years in the Big 12 and had been exposed to big-time
football. He had an understanding of what this is about. He doesn't
ask, `What do I do?' He asks, `Why do we do this, and what do we do
if they do that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   With good size (6 feet 4 inches, 210 pounds), exceptional
intelligence and a good arm, Cicero quickly asserted himself with
the Bears. Steele has been reluctant to formally name him as the
starter, preferring to encourage competition with junior Mike Odum
and redshirt freshman Guy Tomcheck. But it's all but a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero picked Baylor over Hawaii, San Diego State, New Mexico
State and Temple (Temple? ``They throw the heck out of the ball,''
he explained).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of returning to Central Texas, where he said he left on
good terms with the Longhorns, enticed the native of Anaheim,
Calif., although Cicero admits he never expected to return to the
state after he left _ ``Maybe to change planes on a flight or
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty funny how it's worked out,'' he added. ``But I was
used to the weather, the people, the league. It felt right.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The expected spring duel between Applewhite and Simms didn't
happen because Applewhite was recuperating from surgery after
tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the 1999 Big 12 Conference co-offensive player of
the year (Applewhite shared it with Crouch) hasn't lessened the
intrigue and speculation about what Brown will decide this fall.
The coach is low-keying it, and earlier this week was exceedingly
annoyed with a local TV station that posted a who-should-start poll
on its Web page. He has not missed any opportunity to encourage
fans and media to appreciate having two top quarterbacks instead of
obsessing over who will start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to evaluate because it's all about the getting the
ball in the end zone, and those intangibles are sometimes hard to
measure,'' Brown said. ``And the other thing is it's the most
widely discussed topic by the media and the fans because everyone
certainly has an opinion about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Letting Applewhite and Simms duke it out isn't exactly the worst
problem Brown could have. Applewhite embodies those intangibles.
Simms is the bigger, stronger athlete who demonstrated poise and
savvy in the appearances he did make last season, particularly his
surprising start at A&AMP;M when Applewhite was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he isn't concerned about hurt feelings when he names
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any position, if two guys think they should start, the one
who doesn't will get his feelings hurt,'' he said. ``I'll have 115
mamas mad at me in the starting game because they think their son
should be starting, and we only start 11. It's been that way for 17
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the 1-2 spots work themselves out, Brown is more
concerned with who will be No. 3. The only other scholarship
quarterback is freshman Chance Mock, who has said he wants to
redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said possibilities include sophomore strong safety Beau
Trahan and freshman Tony Jeffery. Both played quarterback in high
school. Jeffery has said he wants to play wide receiver. Trahan
appears to be the emergency choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find a third guy who could take some snaps,'' Brown
said. ``If it got to a point where we needed Chance (in order) to
win this year, we'd play him because the team takes precedent over
the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS A&AMP;M
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have built their football reputation not on
quarterbacks but the defensive players who harass them. Witness the
fact that their last all-conference QB was Bucky Richardson in
1991. But this year it was even more unsettled than usual.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of quantity. But quality? Even with the
announcement that Farris will start, that's still to be determined
since only he and Smith have any college experience, limited though
it is.
</P>
<P>
   In five mop-up appearances last year, Farris completed six of 16
passes for 53 yards. The husky Smith (6-4, 226) also appeared in
five games, completing five of 14 passes for 86 yards, including a
TD and interception.
</P>
<P>
   Many perceive Farris to be the safe choice because the
25-year-old has unusual maturity after spending five years playing
minor-league baseball. But Slocum, for understandable reasons,
won't endorse that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked Mark because of overall performance in the spring
and summer,'' Slocum said Monday when announcing his decision.
``With all the things we like to do with our offense, he gives us
the best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum emphasized that the race was ``very close, very close.''
He added that Smith and Freeman will compete for the No. 2 spot and
that both will get their chances to play.
</P>
<P>
   Farris said his outlook and approach haven't changed since
Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't let it change me, and I don't think it changes the way
Vance and Colby look at things, either,'' he said. ``I think they
understand. I would. Someone has to go out on the field first and
it just happens to be me.''

</P>
<P>
   It's unrealistic to expect Kingsbury to consistently duplicate
the same kind of numbers he posted in Texas Tech's spring game.
After all, 24 of 26 for 321 yards and three touchdowns, multiplied
by 12, is slightly mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leach isn't expecting it. But the Raiders' first-year coach
does believe the raw-boned sophomore is the prototypical
quarterback for his pass-happy offense, which did wonders for Tim
Crouch at Kentucky and, last year, Josh Heupel at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a tall guy who's mobile, and Kliff is,'' Leach said.
``Arm strength is the least important issue, but he's certainly got
that. What you really need to make this offense work is accuracy
and the ability to make good decisions, and he's got those things,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kingsbury is Tech's man, period, although Leach proclaims
faith in redshirt freshman backup B.J. Symons. The Raiders expect
excellent results from Kingsbury despite limited experience _ six
appearances last year, including a start in the season finale
against Oklahoma when Rob Peters was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Kingsbury completed nine of 17 passes for 259
yards and three TDs as the Raiders said farewell to Spike Dykes
with a 38-28 victory.
</P>
<P>
   His collegiate stats aren't huge _ 25 of 57 for 492 yards and
four TDs _ but Kingsbury believes his playing time last year,
albeit limited, has dramatic carryover advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't be where I am now if I hadn't played some
already,'' he said. ``Being in the heat of the battle is a big part
of it, because a little experience goes a long way. The game's
slowed down a lot. With every repetition, it slows down a little
bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury is experienced throwing the ball. At New Braunfels
High School, where his father Tim is head coach, he threw for 3,009
yards (216 of 341) and 34 TDs as a senior for a 13-2 Class 5A state
semifinalist team.

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ If you're a history buff, the Travers
has some interesting nuances to consider.
</P>
<P>
   An important factor to include when drawing up your Travers
ticket is that since 1986, a horse who raced in the Haskell has
come from New Jersey to win the Midsummer Derby six times. That's
nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while many trainers believe a race over the Saratoga Race
Course track is a major plus entering the 1 1/4-mile Travers, the
fact is that only six Jim Dandy participants have won it since
1970.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have the Jim Dandy winner (Graeme Hall) in this field,
but there are four Dandy also-rans in this field of nine _ Albert
the Great, Unshaded, Postponed and Curule. Does that mean you can
throw out all of them? No, but keep it in mind.
</P>
<P>
   We have four horses coming from the Haskell _ Dixie Union,
Commendable, Impeachment and Milwaukee Brew. Only two of them ran
very well, winner Dixie Union and Milwaukee Brew, who finished
third.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Mandella never has run a horse in the Travers, but he's
certainly won plenty of other big races, most of them on the left
coast. So you have to take notice that he's trying Dixie Union in
the 131st running of the Midsummer Derby. I know I am.
</P>
<P>
   In Dixie Union, Mandella has a 3-year-old that is fulfilling the
promise he showed before a knee chip sidelined him after last
year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile, where he was one of the favorites at
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   His win in the Haskell on Aug. 6 over the likes of Captain
Steve, Milwaukee Brew and More Than Ready signals he's good enough
to beat this suspect Travers field, which was weakened by the
defections of Red Bullet and Graeme Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And Mandella said something this week that made me believe he
thinks he has the best horse in the field. Mandella said he
probably would have sent Dixie Union against older horses in this
weekend's Pacific Classic at Del Mar if he hadn't already been in
the East. Taking on General Challenge and River Keen is certainly a
stiffer task than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd have run him in the Swaps Stakes, I sure would have
thought about it,'' Mandella said. He'd have thought about it, but
would he have done it?
</P>
<P>
   This Travers field lacks real star quality, with Commendable
being the only Triple Crown race winner in it. No Fusaichi Pegasus,
no Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union beat Milwaukee Brew and Impeachment in the Haskell.
Albert the Great would need a major recovery from his seventh-place
performance _ dead last _ in the Jim Dandy to win the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Curule is a possible threat, as are Unshaded and Postponed, but
none of them has ever won a Grade I stake. Country Coast ran third
in the Illinois Derby against a weak field. Why is he here?
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark about Dixie Union is whether he can get 1
1/4 miles. But considering that his sire is Dixieland Band and his
dam is by Capote, it appears that 10 furlongs may be a bit beyond
his scope. Dixieland Band has sired more sprinters than routers.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brew may sound like the name of a horse who should be
running at Finger Lakes, but I liked the way this son of Breeders'
Cup Classic winner Wild Again closed against the grain of
notoriously speed-favoring Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union also closed well, but his normal style is to be on
or near the lead.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken back because of early traffic problems in the
Haskell, but likely will be up near the pack in the Travers.
Milwaukee Brew lost by only a length under jockey Mike McCarthy. In
the Travers, he gets Jerry Bailey. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a horse owned by Frank Stronach (who also owns Red
Bullet) and trained by Tino Attard, a Malta immigrant who was one
of 26 children. What a millennium Travers story this would be.
</P>
<P>
   The picks: Milwaukee Brew, Unshaded, Dixie Union, Albert the
Great.

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM DETROIT, DECISIVENESS AND PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  When Joe Dumars III was 15, his father of the same name sat him
down one night inside the little brick house on Martin Luther King
Street in Natchitoches, La., and said, ``I'm going to bring you out
and let you see what the real world is like.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was family tradition, a rite of passing, father and son
heading out at dawn in the 18-wheeler, making the cross-country run
from one Kroger supermarket to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 15, you want to impress your father with how
strong you are,'' Dumars once said. ``I'm grabbing the bags, just
slinging them the first two, three stops. He never said a word.
Just looked at me and smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work with a hearty attitude would become the trademark of
the teen-ager's 14-year pro basketball career. When late-night
celebrity was suddenly as available to the All-Star-caliber player
as 100 cable channels, Dumars would click right past Arsenio and
rest on Charlie Rose. He and his backcourt opposite, Isiah Thomas,
were the pillars of two championship seasons in Detroit, but
Dumars, the quiet and dignified star for whom they have named the
league's sportsmanship trophy, has fittingly remained at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the first place the Pistons will go now is
into free fall, after Grant Hill packed his coatless bag for Doc
Rivers' magic kingdom in Orlando, just as Dumars took front-office
control. In an era of the one-size-fits-all superstar contract,
when the highest bid has been displaced by the most verdant view of
the 18th green, Dumars can only offer a Palace in a parking lot, a
half-hour from chilly, gritty Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the real sports world is like and, upon reflection,
the trade that would have sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle earlier
this week represented much of what ails it. David Falk and company
pulled off a deal that had an odious and collusive quality, until
one blue-collar Joe responded to a fan outcry and wisely pulled the
plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other three teams in that deal were making out pretty
good,'' Dumars said.
</P>
<P>
   The needy SuperSonics would have received the gimpy but still
capable Ewing, along with a token of the agent Falk's appreciation
in the person of the free agent Maurice Taylor. For sending another
Falk client, Glen Rice, to New York with a hefty new contract he
would not get elsewhere, the Lakers would have landed the Pistons'
power forward Christian Laettner, as well as the backup center
Chris Dudley, to mimic Shaq in the middle and on the free-throw
line. The Knicks would have reeled in Rice and the enigmatic Vin
Baker, providing depth to facilitate a trade for another big man,
perhaps the Falk client Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   From both coasts, from the entertainment centers and ranking
television markets, this made perfect sense. It sounded right.
Except Dumars was about to receive an assembly line of bricklayers
and bunglers, and he realized he couldn't sell future cap room to
restless patrons. When he reportedly asked the Knicks to send him
even one useful player, Marcus Camby, the deal was suddenly off,
Ewing didn't have a way out, Rice didn't have a deal and Falk, for
once, didn't have his way.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner and baseball's other heavy wallets never
worry about such elaborate schemes. With no salary cap, they just
sign away the game's financial stability and competitive balance.
The result is that even a team such as Arizona, boasting a fairly
crowded new ballpark and a division title after two major league
seasons, has to borrow money to keep competitive pace.
</P>
<P>
   Their annual playoff runs say the Knicks did not hang on to
Ewing too long, but they took on a paralyzing debt in the quest to
salvage one title with him. And just as they realized they had lost
ground again in the Eastern Conference, here came Falk to bail them
out of a bind, in the process of securing Ewing's next financial
score. Then Dumars ruined everything.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, of course, would never think of threatening a general
manager who won't play ball with a future ban on his client.
Attracting star free agents, even a homegrown one such as Chris
Webber, will nonetheless be a trickier task for Dumars than
slinging a produce bag.
</P>
<P>
   With patience, with the right trade and draft moves, he could
yet succeed in remaking the Pistons, the way Donnie Walsh has done
it in Indiana, the way Don Nelson is doing it in Dallas. The system
rewards patience and prudence. It'll be hard work, a long haul. Joe
Dumars did not have to prove he was the right man for the job this
week, but he did, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last thought on the trade: Good for him.

   EMULEX-PLUNGE (New York) _ At 10:13 a.m. Friday, investors in
Emulex, a company that makes fiber-optic communications equipment,
got some terrible news. Bloomberg News reported that Emulex planned
to restate its earnings for the last two years. Emulex investors
rushed to shed their shares, and the company's stock went into
freefall, plunging from $103 to $45 in 15 minutes. The drop
stripped more than $2 billion from the company's market valuation
before the Nasdaq stock market halted trading at 10:33. Other
financial news outlets soon joined Bloomberg in reporting Emulex's
woes. There was only one problem with the story. It was not true,

   Pediatricians open their mailboxes to find medical journals
wrapped in paper covered with Max's stripes. Zithromax sales
representatives hand out stuffed zebras to doctors to help console
their young patients. And Pfizer has donated a real zebra to the
San Francisco Zoo and invited scores of children to a celebration
at which the zebra was named Max.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after federal health officials said that other
antibiotics were not only cheaper, but worked better for children's
ear infections, Pfizer sponsored a season of ``Sesame Street,''
enlisting Elmo, the Muppet, to help in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The sales effort is classic Pfizer. It is also an example of
what makes Pfizer both the company that rivals try to emulate and a
target of critics who worry that the use of many prescription drugs
now has more to do with marketing than with the effectiveness or
actual need for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, based in New York, spends more than any other drug
company to advertise to consumers, and its marketing efforts have
garnered warnings from federal regulators and criticism from
doctors. In recent months, the complaints have grown, as state and
federal officials have blamed aggressive consumer advertising by
drug companies in general for the skyrocketing cost of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, the largest drug maker in America, was probably the
first in the industry to transform itself so clearly from a
research-driven company to one that operates more like Procter &AMP;
Gamble, the maker of Tide.
</P>
<P>
   At Pfizer and a growing number of other drug companies,
marketing executives, not scientists, are in charge. William C.
Steere Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, began his
career there as a sales representative, marketing the antibiotic
Terramycin. Henry McKinnell, who will take over when Steere retires
next year, also came from Pfizer's business side.
</P>
<P>
   In Pfizer's laboratories, marketers work side by side with
scientists, even during a drug's early development. Using financial
forecasts, the sales executives help to ensure that any drug the
scientists are developing has a ready market. Other drug companies
use this system, too, but Pfizer says it was one of the first to
emphasize it.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer says its worldwide army of 20,000 sales representatives
is the industry's largest. And while the company has the biggest
research budget in the industry, it spends more than twice as much
on marketing and administrative expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company spent 39 percent of its $16 billion in
revenue on those expenses _ a rate that was about one-fifth higher
than the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer brushes aside the concern. In an interview, Steere said
the company's ads were helping to improve the public's health, not
only by supplying effective drugs to ailing patients, but also by
prompting people long reluctant to go to the doctor to set up
appointments. And those appointments, he said, may also lead to
detection of other problems: some men who have gone to the doctor
to get a prescription for Viagra, Pfizer's popular anti-impotence
drug, have found out they had other medical problems, like
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct-to-consumer advertising is a good thing,'' he said.
``We get more complaints about our ads from politicians than
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's strategy has been so successful that the company
expects to set an industry milestone this year _ eight drugs that
bring in sales of more than $1 billion each. Six of those
blockbuster drugs were discovered in Pfizer's labs or in those of
Warner-Lambert, a competitor that it acquired early this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is so respected as a marketer that more and more of its
sales come from drugs discovered by other companies that have hired
Pfizer to help sell their drugs. SG Cowen Securities estimates that
Pfizer's revenue from marketing just two drugs discovered by other
companies _ Celebrex, a pain reliever from Pharmacia, and Aricept,
a treatment for Alzheimer's, from Eisai _ will increase to $2.4
billion by 2004 from $680 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's need to market so aggressively is, in part, a product
of its success. Its strong performance over the last decade has
raised investors' expectations, and its acquisition of
Warner-Lambert brought together America's two fastest-growing drug
companies, only adding to the Wall Street pressure for sales
growth. Steere said this year that Pfizer planned to increase sales
by 13 percent a year through 2002. That means more than $3.5
billion in new revenue this year, the equivalent of three new
blockbuster drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get everything out of a product in a short amount
of time,'' Steere said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Pfizer's drugs have helped millions of
ailing patients. The company is giving away millions of doses of
Zithromax, for example, to developing countries to help stop an eye
infection that can lead to blindness.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism of the company's marketing tactics is growing.
Last year, the Food and Drug Administration requested a meeting
with Steere, wanting to discuss the repeated warning letters it had
sent to Pfizer. The letters contended that the company failed to
follow federal drug-marketing regulations by making claims about
certain drugs that could not be supported.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has received 11 warning letters since the end of 1996,
including one ordering it to stop using brochures that the agency
says improperly implied that Zithromax was more effective than
Augmentin, an antibiotic made by SmithKline Beecham. Other drug
companies have received more warning letters from the FDA, but an
agency spokeswoman said it was ``rare'' for a chief executive to be
called in for a visit with Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the
FDA's center that approves drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Pfizer's most vocal critics, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a
pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, and Dr. Sidney Wolfe of
Public Citizen, the consumer group, have complained about Pfizer's
Zithromax campaign to Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services. The two doctors had obtained an internal Pfizer
document that listed a toll-free phone number for pediatricians to
call if they wondered whether to prescribe Zithromax to children.
When they called, they heard recorded advice from Dr. Russell
Steele, vice chairman of pediatrics at Louisiana State University's
school of medicine. He said, among other things, that most
children's ear infections would be cured with a drug like
Zithromax.
</P>
<P>
   The Pfizer internal document said the purpose of the recorded
advice was to ``counter'' recommendations of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention that were published in early 1999.
Those guidelines said other antibiotics were more effective than
Zithromax at curing children's ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   In their complaint, Sharfstein and Wolfe argued that part of the
advice from Steele, whose university had received a payment from an
advertising company hired by Pfizer, was not based on prevailing
scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is even more evidence now that Zithromax does not work
for many kids,'' Sharfstein said. ``It just prolongs pain and
suffering for many kids and is much more expensive than the other
medications.'' He said, however, that he believed Zithromax was
effective in treating pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said that he disagreed with the CDC recommendations, and
that he stood by what he said on the recording.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer says any problems that regulators found with its
marketing were isolated incidences that were corrected immediately.
Patrick Kelly, the vice president for worldwide marketing, said the
company had investigated the two doctors' complaint but did not
find that it had done anything wrong. Kelly said that Pfizer
regularly gives grants to outside experts to talk about its drugs
as part of educational programs for doctors, but that the experts
give their own opinions. ``We don't control the personal opinion of
doctors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Dunne, director of clinical research for Pfizer's
anti-infective drugs, said the company had conducted studies
comparing Zithromax to all drugs recommended by the CDC panel and
found that Zithromax was just as effective.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive marketing of any antibiotic, whether made by Pfizer
or its competitors, is increasingly controversial. CDC officials
say they fear that overuse of antibiotics is threatening the
public's health as more bacteria become resistant to the drugs. But
to drug companies, limiting the sale of an antibiotic would be
altruism that would not be good for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conflict between the public health interest and the
industry's interest,'' said Dr. Scott Dowell, the CDC's acting
associate director for global health, speaking about all drug
companies. ``The industry is concerned about resistance, but they
need to sell their drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Pfizer was monitoring which bacteria have become
resistant to Zithromax. So far, he said, Zithromax is holding up
better than many other drugs. It is now the nation's top-selling
branded antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   In its marketing efforts, Pfizer has addressed the government's
concerns about antibiotic resistance, Kelly said. Company
advertising, for example, has urged parents not to demand a
prescription for an antibiotic from the doctor if a child's ear
infection is caused by a virus _ a practice that is contributing to
antibiotic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has acknowledged a downside to advertising. While Steere
contends that advertising has benefited consumers, he said it had
also helped make the industry a new corporate demon in some
people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be invisible,'' he said, ``but now we're very
visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1849 by Charles Pfizer and his cousin,
Charles Erhart, in Brooklyn, Pfizer has had a knack for getting
people to take more medicine. They had their first breakthrough
when they took a bitter treatment for parasitic worms, blended it
with almond-toffee flavoring and shaped it into a candy cone.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's presence in antibiotics dates to just before World War
II, when the company found how to produce penicillin in mass
quantities. And in the late1940s, Pfizer's scientists discovered
Terramycin, which went on to become a top seller. When the drug was
approved by the FDA in 1950, eight Pfizer sales representatives
were waiting for word at pay phones across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been building its sales force ever since. Even
during the early 1990s, amid the uncertainty over managed care and
President Clinton's plan for a national health care system, Steere
took a gamble by hiring people when other drug companies were
firing them.
</P>
<P>
   With the Warner-Lambert merger, Pfizer now has 8,000 sales
representatives in the United States alone, the most in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer plans to spend about $4.7 billion this year on research _
an amount that is more than the budget of the National Science
Foundation in Washington. The company's 12,000 scientists are
focused both on finding drugs and, with the help of sales experts,
creating an ever greater market for them.
</P>
<P>
   At the main laboratory in Groton, Conn., the scientists call
that teamwork ``Cram,'' for ``Central Research Assists Marketing.''
About 25 percent of Pfizer's research money finances clinical
studies of drugs that Pfizer is already selling. These studies,
known as Phase 4, are common in the industry and are conducted
after the FDA approves a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at increasing the sales of existing drugs, Phase 4 studies
try to show that the company's drugs can be used by patients
suffering from other illnesses or that they work better than
competitors' drugs. In effect, they try to expand the claims that
Pfizer's sales representatives can make about the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't promote a feature of a drug unless you've proven
it,'' said Dr. John Niblack, Pfizer's top scientist and vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the lab, Pfizer is also working hard to supplement its
products. It has aggressively wooed other companies that are
developing new drugs, asking to let Pfizer help sell them. In fact,
of the four drugs in Pfizer's pipeline that the company estimates
could become billion-dollar-a-year sellers, two were discovered by
other companies. In a recent report, McKinsey &AMP; Co., the
consultants, called Pfizer ``superior'' at getting these contracts.
Indeed, the antibiotic that became Zithromax was discovered by
Pliva, a company in Zagreb, Croatia. Pfizer's scientists came
across Pliva's patent in 1981 in a search of records at the U.S.
Patent Office. The companies soon signed a licensing agreement.

FOREIGN PRESS CONTRIBUTES TO THE CAUSE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which takes in an
estimated $2 million a year from its Golden Globe Awards
ceremonies, gave $369,000 back to the filmmaking community for
preservation, film schools, mentoring organizations and industry
charities.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients included the Film Foundation, which received
$100,000 for its film preservation mission.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-producer Michael Douglas and ``L.A. Confidential''
director Curtis Hanson accepted that contribution at a luncheon
Thursday in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a new father, it'll be nice to know that Dylan will be
able to see his grandfather's 85-plus films,'' Douglas said before
the luncheon, referring to his 2-week-old son (by actress Catherine
Zeta-Jones) and his father, Kirk Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson told the HFPA members, ``I want to thank you for audience
members and filmmakers all over the world, into the distant
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations also were given to Robert Redford's Sundance Institute
($50,000), Independent Feature Project/West ($50,000), California
Institute of the Arts School of Film/Video ($40,000), the American
Film Institute and the AFI Film Festival ($45,000), USC School of
Cinema-Television ($20,000) and the Radio-TV-Film department of
California State University, Northridge ($20,000).
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose members are Los
Angeles-based entertainment reporters for newspapers, magazines and
broadcast outlets all over the world, gave a standing ovation for
the organization's oldest active member, 92-year-old Argentina
Brunetti, a veteran character actress who writes for the Italian
newspaper Chi and an Italian-language magazine distributed in
Canada. &QL;

 UNDATED: licensing agreement.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drug fascinated Pfizer's scientists because, in experiments,
it stayed in the body tissue of animals longer than other
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's marketers quickly realized that the science behind
Zithromax would make great ad copy. Gene Michael Bright and Arthur
E. Girard, two Pfizer scientists involved with early work on the
drug, recalled how the marketing executives decided to send them to
international conferences to talk about it years before it was
approved.
</P>
<P>
   At the suggestion of Pfizer's marketers, the scientists
repeatedly used snappy phrases like ``the tissue is the issue,''
Bright said, to deliver the message that Zithromax would be a
powerful new drug.
</P>
<P>
   When Zithromax was approved in 1992, Pfizer's marketing message
changed to focus on consumers. Because the drug stays in the body
so long, patients need fewer doses than they would of other
antibiotics. Pfizer's marketers knew that this would be a great
selling point to parents struggling to get sick children to take
medicine. The marketing message became ``just five doses and you're
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zithromax is approved for use in adults with pneumonia
and other illnesses, Pfizer's marketers have focused much of their
effort on millions of children who get ear infections. Federal
statistics show that almost two-thirds of children under 5 get an
acute ear infection every year.
</P>
<P>
   When the pediatric formulation of Zithromax was approved in
1995, Dr. Candice Johnson was a pediatrician at a clinic at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland. She said her clinic ``was
wallpapered with Zithromax zebras'' supplied by Pfizer sales
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, now a pediatrics professor pediatrics at Children's
Hospital in Denver, recalled how Pfizer representatives had
distributed rubber ink stamps to doctors so that writing a
prescription required only a quick stamp and signature. She became
upset, she said, when she found that emergency-room doctors were
prescribing Zithromax for illnesses like strep throat, which could
be treated with less powerful medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, she said, she asked to give a talk to the
emergency-room personnel on the proper use of antibiotics. But
before she spoke, a Zithromax sales representative was allowed to
hand out pens and calendars, make a five-minute presentation and
pay for the breakfast buffet. ``It really disturbed me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer says its use of a zebra to promote Zithromax is typical
of the industry's approach to marketing pediatric drugs. SmithKline
Beecham, for example, uses ``Auggie the Froggie'' to market
Augmentin, and Abbott Laboratories uses a bulldog called Bix to
sell Biaxin. Both drugs compete with Zithromax.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned early last year about the growing resistance of
bacteria to drugs, a CDC panel of doctors recommended which
antibiotics should be used to treat children's ear infections. The
panel recommended that a pediatrician's first choice should be
amoxicillin, which has been used for years. As a second choice, the
panel recommended several drugs made by Pfizer's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dowell, the CDC official, said the panel did not recommend
Zithromax because most studies had shown that it was not as
effective as the recommended drugs against the bacteria that is the
leading cause of children's ear infections, if that bacteria had
become resistant. A growing number of ear infections are caused by
resistant bacteria, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still stand by the recommendations,'' he said. ``The
studies that have come out since have supported them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pfizer responded quickly to the recommendations. Soon after
they were published, Pfizer paid the Children's Television Workshop
to sponsor a season of ``Sesame Street,'' running 15-second Pfizer
announcements at the beginning and end of each show.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an unusual partnership, Pfizer and the Children's
Television Workshop produced a video featuring Elmo going to a
doctor with an ear infection. Zithromax was not mentioned in the
video, which was distributed to doctors and child care centers, but
the drug was advertised on a Pfizer Web site, KidsEars.com where
the video was also given away in a drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used something kids love,'' Kelly said, ``to get them past
something they don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer also paid for a children's health magazine that was
produced by the Children's Television Workshop and included
Zithromax ads.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is open to interpretation. The latest sales
statistics suggest that the CDC's recommendations could be changing
pediatricians' minds. In the first half of this year, Zithromax
sales fell 10 percent, compared with the corresponding period last
year. And prescription statistics show that amoxicillin
prescriptions began to climb in 1999 after declining for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly of Pfizer said Zithromax prescriptions fell because
the flu season was shorter this year than last, and total sales of
all antibiotics declined. Zithromax continues to gain market share,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure it does, Pfizer is working on two new formulations
for children, including one that would require only one dose to
treat an ear infection instead of five.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also working on a clinical study that could
create a huge new market for the drug. The study, nicknamed the
Wizard trial, is looking at whether the antibiotic could become
part of the treatment for heart disease, the leading cause of death
among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Steere said the study was an expensive, high-risk gamble. ``But
if we win,'' he said, ``we win big.''

FLOCKHART UNABASHED ON SHOWTIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Mon., Aug. 28) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, oh, boy, did Neil LaBute not take the correct messages from
his religious training. LaBute, the screenwriter-director of the
misanthropic romps ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and
Neighbors'' _ his next, ``Nurse Betty,'' is lighter, but then, it'd
just about have to be _ revels in exploring the psyches of
characters damaged beyond common sense, reason and decency; people
for whom traditional morality simply is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   We watch, fascinated or repelled, unable to turn away from these
characters, maybe because we fear they'll plunge a knife into our
backs if we do. And in ``bash: latter day plays,'' LaBute gives us
a trio of Mormons who are unable to escape neither the yoke of
their religious upbringings nor their own darker impulses _ with
the implication that one fuels the other.
</P>
<P>
   In this triptych of monologues _ shot last December at Beverly
Hills' Canon Theatre _ LaBute essentially tells us the same story
three times: An insipid character blathers on randomly at first
before getting to the point, and the point is a ghastly act.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Paul Rudd and Calista Flockhart play a happily
lobotomized couple relating to offstage friends their own takes on
the same incident, a lavish party they attended in New York. Rudd's
character wanders from the event to commit a spontaneous, vile act
of homophobia, while Flockhart's character chatters away, oblivious
to her boyfriend's hate crime; yet, it's suggested, is mildly
complicit.
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart takes center stage in the second piece, about a young
single mother molested by a teacher and her startling revenge. Ron
Eldard portrays a pathetic, glad-handing traveling businessman in
the third monologue, relating to a captive, unseen audience _ she's
a drunk and he's buying the drinks _ the extents he has gone to to
hold down his job.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are highly stylized, which take a couple of minutes
to adjust to, but they're uniformly nervy and intense. Rudd
expertly turns his vaguely likable yokel into a demon on a dime,
while Flockhart transcends her Ally McBeal persona to maintain a
level of impassioned scatteredness throughout her tragic piece.
Eldard's bravura work in the final tableau masks the more cliched
aspects of his character, emerging as something more real and
scary.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``bash'' could use some tonal variation
beyond the savage desperation exuded by each character. It's grim
and often compelling stuff, but it seems to be chasing its own
tail. There's no larger point beyond ``people are evil,'' and you
don't need a highfalutin' play to tell you that _ heck,
``Survivor'' did that without nearly as much pretention. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The show: ``bash: latter day plays.'' &QL; 
What: Trilogy of monologues. &QL; 
The stars: Calista Flockhart, Ron Eldard, Paul Rudd. &QL; 
Where: Showtime. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL;

THE `DUCK MAN,' WHO DREW DONALD AND CREATED SCROOGE, DIES AT 99
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Fla., Ill., Ore., N.Y.)  By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Barks, the once anonymous ``duck man'' for Walt Disney
whose draftsmanship and writing gained him a cultlike following
among artists and fans of Donald Duck comic books and of his very
own creation, Scrooge McDuck, died Friday at his home in Grants
Pass, Ore. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Barks' detailed and witty adventure stories attracted a large
following from 1942 to 1966, the years he drew comic books under
license to Disney. Because Disney artists did not sign their work,
most readers learned his name only after he retired and received
attention from comic-book collectors.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent years, his oil paintings and lithographs of the
extended Donald Duck family sold for hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   John Canemaker, director of the animation program at the New
York University Tisch School of the Arts, said Friday that a
20-by-25-inch Barks oil painting sold in 1996 for $230,000. Another
oil sold two years later for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as a comic book writer and illustrator with a
distinctive style that millions of fans and aficionados came to
know Barks' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the fantasy real,'' said Canemaker, whose book ``Paper
Dreams'' (Hyperion, 1999) examines the art of Disney storyboard
artists. ``There is a great amount of detail in his comic books,
and enormous subtlety in the way he would draw the characters in
terms of their personalities and inner thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist and illustrator Art Spiegelman called Barks' stories
more sophisticated than those of other comic books and said that
his Donald was easier to understand than ``that short-tempered
little thing in the animated cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His were among the first comic books that made me want to be a
cartoonist,'' Spiegelman said. A few years ago, in an introduction
to a book of Barks' gag cartoons, Spiegelman wrote: ``I've loved
Carl Barks' work since those days of long-lost innocence when I
assumed that the duck stories were all written and drawn by Walt
Disney himself. As far as I was concerned, they were Walt's best
work, done on lunch breaks, when he wasn't making animated cartoons
or hosting his weekly TV show. Before that, I just believed the
ducks were somehow real, and now, as an adult, I've reverted to my
first opinion: the ducks ARE real.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Barks began reproducing his Walt Disney characters in
oil paintings, some of which he sold for as little as $200.
Initially, the Disney Studios turned a blind eye to Barks' work,
but when someone not associated with Barks started mass-producing
posters of a painting, Disney sued.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, an agreement was reached under which both Disney and
Barks received royalties from his work.
</P>
<P>
   Barks' most famous creation, the fabulously wealthy Scrooge
McDuck, is a native Scot who lives in a three-cubic-acre money bin
and wears a red broadcloth coat that he bought in a rummage sale in
1924. Scrooge, a forerunner, however unintended, of today's
mergers-and-acquisitions executives, first appeared in 1947, in a
story called ``Christmas on Bear Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other characters created by Barks are the Beagle Boys, masked
burglars scheming after Scrooge's loot; Gladstone Gander, Donald's
lucky cousin; the inventor Gyro Gearloose; and Gyro's helper, a
walking light bulb. Barks depicted Himalayan panoramas, downtown
Atlantis or a Klondike saloon brawl in the confines of single
cartoon panels.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Summers, a writer and film producer who is author of
``Uncle Scrooge McDuck, His Life and Times'' (Celestial Arts,
1980), said Barks had a wandering and inventive imagination that
inspired others, including George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rolling rock sequence at the beginning of `Raiders of the
Lost Ark' was consciously borrowed from one of the Uncle Scrooge
stories, `The Seven Cities of Cibola,''' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   In another comic book in the late 1940s, Barks ``invented a way
to raise sunken ships,'' Summer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald wants to raise the ship to get treasure rights, but
there's no way to do that without breaking up the old boards,'' he
said. ``So he shoves a long pipe down to the ship and pumps in
Ping-Pong balls. The ship pops to the surface with a huge octopus
hanging onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he said, a salvage company used the method
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Barks was born on March 27, 1901, to a homesteading family in
Oregon. He left school at 15 and worked as a rancher, logger,
railroad repairman and printer before his freelance cartooning led
to a job with a humor magazine. He joined the Walt Disney Studio in
1935, the year after Donald's first screen appearance, and worked
on 36 Donald Duck movie cartoons, often as the sole writer and
story artist.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not create Donald Duck, he was largely responsible
for Donald's modern look, which first appeared in an animated
cartoon he drew, ``Modern Inventions.'' He also worked on story
development for ``Snow White,'' ``Bambi'' and ``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 40 years, Margaret Barks, died in 1993. He is
survived by a daughter, Dorothy Gibson of Bremerton, Wash.; two
grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and three
great-great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1994, Barks began creating new Scrooge and Donald
Duck comic-book stories, this time with help from artists and
writers who closely followed his style.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, his comics, both new and reprints, sell more copies
than in the United States and his fan clubs, especially in
Scandinavia, fill the Internet with treatises on Scrooge history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Barks toured 11 European countries on a
Disney-sponsored trip occasioned by Donald's 60th birthday, and in
April 1997, he was honored at Walt Disney World on his 96th
birthday and Scrooge's 50th.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernard Schwartz has spent much of his life as one of
the nation's most revered chief executives. He devoted year after
consistent year to delivering record returns while building the
Loral Corp. into a top military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   At 74, Schwartz could well afford to bask in retirement.
Instead, he has taken on one of the biggest gambles of his career,
starting Globalstar, an international wireless telephone service
that is covering the globe with 48 satellites.
</P>
<P>
   That gamble, shadowed by the failure last year of the Iridium
satellite telephone system, now looks like another long shot: Wall
Street is up in arms, a bank loan is in default and his junk bonds
recently traded at less than 30 cents on the dollar. His woes are,
in turn, casting doubt on the prospects for Teledesic, the
satellite telecommunications venture backed by Craig McCaw, the
cellular telephone entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the capital markets have been burned, you are really
up against a wall of skepticism,'' said Les Levi, an analyst at
Chase Securities. ``This is a pretty nasty sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, however, says he is close to success and far from
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satellite communications,'' he said, ``is one of the growth
industries that not only will show huge business success but be
part of the forces shaping the way humans beings live in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Globalstar went into service in March.
Loral, having sold off its military businesses and renamed itself
Loral Space and Communications, owns 42 percent of it. Schwartz
remains chairman of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar, based in San Jose, Calif., is much like Iridium,
Motorola's global satellite telephone system that filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection last August. Globalstar, with simpler
technology and more durable satellites, is less expensive to users,
although far more expensive than standard cellular service.
</P>
<P>
   But things have not gone as planned. Customers, put off by
handsets costing $700 to $1,200 and charges of $1 to $1.70 a minute
_ often more abroad _ are staying away. The service is also just
becoming available in countries like Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Schwartz told financial analysts that Globalstar
would have 500,000 subscribers and $500 million in revenue this
year. So far, though, it has 13,000 subscribers and, for the first
half of the year, only $2 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much,'' Schwartz said in an interview from his office in
Manhattan. It is just that his plan is taking longer to execute, he
said. ``The biggest impact was the Iridium bankruptcy, which put
off the buying public and gave us the need to overcome the Iridium
syndrome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports predicting Globalstar's bankruptcy have also hurt,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said he momentarily considered bankruptcy, but only
because an executive has to look at all options.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the numbers he gave out? He said they were not
meant as projections and, besides, Globalstar's sales will reach an
annual rate of $400 million to $500 million by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say, therefore, that we may be a year out of
position against that original business model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, however, confirmed that without additional financing
or a sudden jump in sales, Globalstar will run out of cash in
March. Its condition would be worse but for a strategic move that
Schwartz made in late June. He drew a $250 million line of credit,
then defaulted, relying on a legal agreement that forced the
investors who had guaranteed the loan to repay it. Some of the
largest ones, like Lockheed Martin, Qualcomm and Loral, have done
so, but not happily.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, which is negotiating with Loral for repayment,
refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar has already given Lockheed generous compensation, in
rights to buy stock, for the loan guarantee, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, to be candid with you, it's newsworthy that
Lockheed Martin is upset,'' he said. ``The people in hell want ice
water. It's not something people take notice of.''
</P>
<P>
   Many shareholders have suffered as well. In late January,
Globalstar, which was already publicly traded, sold an additional
$268 million in stock at $35 a share. On Feb. 23, Schwartz told
analysts and investors that handset deliveries were running late,
and on May 8, the company disclosed that sales were well behind
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar shares closed Friday at $10.50, up $1.38 on news of
expanded coverage in Latin America. Schwartz said that when the
offering was made, he had no idea that sales were slow.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Globalstar has gone based on Schwartz's reputation,
the measures he has taken to keep it solvent could hurt his ability
to raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time you burn someone, it makes it that much harder the
next time,'' said Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America
Securities, referring to the loan default. ``It was not illegal,
but was an act of desperation, and is viewed as somewhat of a dirty
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz started building his new empire in about 1990, when
Loral bought the satellite manufacturing operations of Ford
Aerospace. Loral and several partners formed Globalstar in 1991 and
sold its stock to the public in 1995. With the Cold War over,
Schwartz sold off Loral's military businesses to Lockheed Martin
the next year. In 1997, Loral added a fleet of telecommunications
satellites from AT&AMP;T. While Globalstar operates the mobile
telephone service, Loral makes several types of satellites and
operates those handling telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz dismissed worries that Globalstar will run out of cash,
saying that he can go back to his partners for more capital next
year, if necessary. ``We believe Globalstar is in a very
attractive, viable market, in which we have the only solution,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a major partner, Qualcomm, which also supplies equipment,
has had to pay $22 million of the bank loan and is owed a total of
about $608 million. Qualcomm is making no promises about putting up
more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we will be approached,'' said Julie Cunningham,
Qualcomm's senior vice president for investor relations. ``We would
need to look at the specific business plan and see what other
partners are putting in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Investors are watching to see how Schwartz handles Globalstar's
next challenge, in the form of a $500 million loan from Banc of
America. The bank can demand immediate repayment and assume
ownership of two satellites if Globalstar does not have $100
million in revenue for the year ending March 31, a goal that
Schwartz says is unlikely to be met.
</P>
<P>
   Bond holders, meanwhile, owed $1.4 billion, anticipate losing
much of their money, said Levi, the Chase Securities analyst.
Judging from Globalstar's outlook, he said, ``It is very likely
they will default on their public high-yield notes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonds have been trading at 25 cents to 29 cents on the
dollar. Schwartz said the bond payments would be met, and the bank
loan dealt with before it comes due.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwartz is optimistic that once Globalstar attracts more
customers during the next six months, financial support for
satellite telephone service will flourish.
</P>
<P>
   But investors might have a longer memory than he supposes, said
Roger Rusch, who heads TelAstra, a consulting firm in Palos Verdes,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite industry has gotten a black eye,'' Rusch said.
``People are going to be reluctant to get involved in these things,
because they think they've been led down a path where success is
implied and not delivered.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ In December, Nelson Mandela took on one of
Africa's most frightening problems: the tiny and beautiful country
of Burundi, where Hutu and Tutsi have taken turns massacring each
other by the thousands for the last 40 years. Rumor was that he
accepted the task reluctantly, but he has worked hard and pushed
enemies near to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   They are not there yet, and that will present a dilemma when
President Clinton arrives in Tanzania on Monday to meet with
Mandela and Burundi's leaders. By Mandela's rigid timetable, the
Burundians were to seal their intention to end seven years of civil
war in an accord signed there, in front of Clinton and several
dozen other heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Clinton, eager for some success in Africa, could have stood
as midwife of sorts over the birth of one small bit of hope in the
ceaseless turmoil of central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But a consensus is growing that it would be unwise _ even
dangerous _ to push Burundi too far before the meeting. The fear is
that an incomplete document, signed in a hurry to please important
foreign guests, could push Tutsi hard-liners opposed to the accord
into more violence. The threat of further killing in Burundi is all
too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want all those heads of state to be aware that they are
going to be manipulated if they think they are going to assist in a
peace accord that all parties agree with,'' said Louis-Marie
Nindorera, of the Burundian human rights group Iteka. ``They have
to know that most of the people who are there are still deeply
divided.''
</P>
<P>
   A historical precedent haunts the proceedings in the resort town
of Arusha, in Tanzania. It was there in August 1993 that the
warring parties in Rwanda _ Burundi's northern neighbor _ also
signed a peace deal. It was not accepted by many of the Hutu
majority in Rwanda. The authority of the Hutu president, Juvenal
Habyarimana, dwindled; Hutu militias formed. By April 1994, a
genocide against the Tutsi minority exploded, killing in the end at
least 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Burundi is not directly parallel: It is Tutsi
who rule there, in a precarious position because they represent
only about 15 percent of the population. But there are
similarities. As the signing has grown near, violence has flared.
Hutu rebels fighting the Tutsi-controlled government launched
several attacks on the capital, Bujumbura, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hard-line Tutsi groups _ reluctant to give up
their long-held power over the majority Hutu _ have been protesting
the peace accord on the streets of Bujumbura. Several experts say
they are also forming armed militias, with no clear accountability.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tension is so high that Pierre Buyoya, the nation's
president and a Tutsi, felt he had to warn Tutsi hard-liners
against staging a coup this weekend when he goes to Tanzania to
meet Mandela and Clinton. It was an unusual admission of his
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who want to overthrow the government so that the
president will not be there to sign the peace agreement should know
that their actions will come to no good,'' Buyoya told civil
servants and government administrators on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shoring up his position at home, Buyoya canceled a trip this
week to South Africa to meet with Mandela for final talks before
the planned signing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not impossible that most of the 19 Burundian
representatives at the negotiating table will end up signing a
complete peace accord on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fears of violence _ and the differences that remain
over the accord itself _ it is also possible that nothing will be
signed. But officials say that what is most likely is that some of
the delegates will sign off only on the points of agreement. They
would also, officials say, affirm their commitment to continue
talking.
</P>
<P>
   That would fall short of Mandela's expectations, and may in fact
try his reportedly waning patience. Clinton would also be forced to
preside over a ceremony with less certain importance than he might
prefer. But U.S. officials say they are aware of the risks of
pushing too hard and are not eager _ with few recent
accomplishments toward making peace in Africa _ to stoke the coals
of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will travel to Tanzania, at a minimum, to put his stamp
of approval on the progress Mandela has made thus far, the
officials say. ``There is no desire to force anybody into
anything,'' said one administration official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``It is our great desire to consolidate the
progress that has been made so far and continue to do what we can
do to support Mandela's efforts to narrow the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say Clinton's blessing of a realistic document
could be useful in the next phase of talks, though many officials
fear a loss of momentum after Clinton leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there is such an international interest and
support for Mandela's efforts and the efforts of Burundians makes
people feel they should behave responsibly,'' said Jan van Eck, a
facilitator with the Center for Conflict Resolution in South
Africa, who has worked with Burundi's factions since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There have been outbreaks of ethnic violence since Burundi, like
Rwanda, gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, particularly
against the Hutu in 1965 and 1972. The Tutsi have dominated
politics, the army and business. This most recent civil war broke
out in 1993, when power shifted for a brief time to the Hutu
majority. In July 1993, the first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye,
took office. But three months later, Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated him, setting off widespread killings of Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 200,000 Burundians are estimated to have died.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord that Mandela has been shaping essentially
envisions an eventual return of power to the Hutu majority _ who
make up nearly 85 percent of the population _ but with rights and
protections for the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the accord calls for a second legislative body,
a senate, with broad veto powers that would be split evenly by
ethnicity. The army would also be divided evenly for at least 10
years, despite the Tutsi's far fewer numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But many Tutsi say these measures do not give them enough of a
say or protection. Moreover, the Hutu and Tutsi disagree over the
terms for a tribunal on genocide and a peace and reconciliation
commission. This has caused particular tension among the Tutsi, who
want the killings in 1993 recognized as genocide.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The accord envisions a three-year transitional government before
general elections, but the sides cannot agree on a leader. They
also disagree on whether a cease-fire should be signed before or
after the signing of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   What complicates the issue further is that the two main Hutu
rebel groups actually engaged in fighting are not involved directly
in the peace talks. So even if a fairly complete document is signed
on Monday, it will be, as Mandela has frequently pointed out, only
the beginning of the push toward a final peace.

CONGO PRESIDENT KEEPS PEACEKEEPERS GUESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A week of conflicting signals from President
Laurent Kabila of Congo has left the Security Council no closer to
knowing when, if ever, a peacekeeping mission can be sent to the
country. The council this week decided that U.N. officials who have
been in Congo preparing for the peacekeepers could stay until Oct.
15, giving Secretary General Kofi Annan and the council time to
reconsider the operation.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing on Thursday that the peacekeepers and support
forces, totaling about 5,500 people under current plans, could have
free access in Congo, Kabila's government appeared Friday to be
backtracking, officials said here.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly a year of trying to prepare for a peacekeeping
operation in a country with inadequate roads, electrical supplies
or other basic services in many areas, the U.N. advance team has
met repeated obstacles. Because Congo officials always try to
control flights and other activities, the Security Council has
demanded freedom of movement without the need for permits or
advance notice as the United Nations establishes centers of
operation.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, U.N. officials have faced not only operational hurdles
but also orchestrated hostility against international workers,
including attacks on U.N. offices in Kinshasa, the capital.
Officials said they feared more violence if the government did not
stop encouraging or condoning the anti-U.N. feelings.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Annan sent a Nigerian general and former military
ruler, Abdulsalami Abubakar, to Congo to tell Kabila that he had to
cooperate with the United Nations if the peacekeeping mission was
to go ahead. Abubakar will report to Annan next week.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture for a peacekeeping mission, Kabila said
this week that he was freezing a peace accord signed last year in
Lusaka, Zambia. That agreement set up a series of steps toward
reconciliation in Congo, which has been caught in a prolonged war
of shifting alliances for more than five years. The war has
unsettled much of south-central Africa, diplomats from the region
say.
</P>
<P>
   An African diplomat said this week that some regional leaders
had concluded that if Kabila could not defeat several rebel groups
operating in the country, most of them with outside support, he
would retreat to his home territory around Lumbambashi and leave
the rest of Congo to the competing groups.
</P>
<P>
   In one positive move, Kabila, who refuses to meet with political
opponents, has established a human rights panel in Congo and
allowed a U.N. monitor to visit the country in recent weeks. The
monitor, Roberto Garreton, a human rights lawyer from Chile, had
been barred from Congo for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Garreton's final report has not been published, he said
this week when he left Congo that there was little good news in
either government-controlled or rebel-controlled areas or in border
regions where Rwanda and Uganda still had troops.

   CHALLIS, Idaho _ They head out before dawn and trudge home after
dark, weary and covered in soot, still clutching the shovels and
axes that are their weapons. They sleep as many as 21 to a tent, in
makeshift camps pitched beneath smoky, lung-choking skies.
</P>
<P>
   That is how thousands of firefighters across the West have spent
summer 2000, a season so devastating that commanders say they
cannot help but view it as a war.
</P>
<P>
   Others are beginning to view it that way, too. In fact, the
United Services Organization, best known for organizing shows to
entertain U.S. troops overseas, has now come to this remote corner
of Idaho. With three former beauty queens dressed in red, white and
blue micro-mini-dresses and 4-inch heals cooing and flirting from a
flatbed truck, the scene along the Salmon River Thursday night
brought a taste of the 1950s to an audience that anywhere else
would call itself part of the Internet generation. It may have been
the most surreal moment in a summer in which fire has drawn people
of all stripes from all around the country to the most isolated of
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural disaster in the United States,'' said
Victoria Reed, a former Miss Maine and leader of the USO troupe,
``and it's important that the USO is here, because that's been our
mission since 1941 _ to entertain the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Craig Smith, 29, a marine from Birmingham, Ala., last saw a
USO show on a tour that took him to Japan, and he was among those
bug-eyed at what fortune had brought to the fire camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely something new,'' said Smith, , who had
never before set foot near Idaho. Even now, he said, ``I've been to
more countries than states.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is among some 1,700 men and a handful of women in eastern
Idaho battling the largest of dozens of major fires burning across
the western United States. His coworkers include paramedics from
Tennessee, high-school dropouts from California, and federal
land-managers from all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After working 16-hour days on end, this group found itself
gawking on Wednesday and Thursday nights at the performers from the
USO, an organization whose past tours have almost always been
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our missions are primarily to remote and isolated places, and
there aren't too many places in the United States that qualify,''
said James Pearcy, the USO's director of entertainment. ``But I
guess sleeping on the ground for 30 days in a fire zone in the
middle of nowhere would have to count.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Reed, , and including Erin Wheatley, Miss Arkansas of
1998, and Stacy Turner of Texas, the New York-based troupe
performed a medley of oldies that included everything from
``America the Beautiful'' to ``All My Loving'' and was punctuated,
in strutting, pinup-girl style, with the planting of many
lipstick-red kisses on the blushing but willing cheeks of young
marines and firefighters.. Those singled out for attention were
taunted by their buddies who found themselves singled out in turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a year!'' John Wallace, 23, a contract worker from Tule
Lake, Calif., said in disbelief, commenting not only on the
performance but also on the record paychecks that have resulted
from the record fire damage. ``I'm planning on living through the
winter off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, well over 25,000 men and women are involved in the
firefighting, including what will soon number more than 4,000
military personnel from the Army, Marines and the National Guard,
in an operation whose cost is estimated at $15 million a day. But
with 1.4 million acres still burning in the West, the current force
is not nearly sufficient, federal officials say, and a shortage of
trained supervisors means that it cannot prudently be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   So federal officials have said there is little they can do to
fight many of the blazes. From fire camps like this one, the main
effort has been focused far from the flames, in efforts to
safeguard houses from danger and to make sure that the danger has
passed in areas where fires have already burned through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources have just run dry all over the country, and so
we've had to back off to wider lines,'' said Bill Cyr, 48, an
engineer with the Los Angeles Country Fire Department who since
Aug. 5 has bunked down under a yellow-tarp every night with a
20-man Marine unit, for which he is serving as a temporary adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, nearly 6 million acres of land have
now burned this year, and with hot, dry weather conditions in the
West showing no sign of abating, the devastation is likely to
become the worst in at least half a century. Fourteen firefighters
have been killed during this season, including two prison inmates
struck by lightning in Utah on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst fires are in western Montana's Bitterroot
Valley, where a wind-driven flare-up in the last two days has added
to a blanket of smoke so thick that on Thursday midday felt like
deepest dusk. But the Clear Creek fire, burning northwest of here
in the Salmon-Challis National Forest, remains the largest single
blaze in the country, spanning some 165,000 acres, with only about
one-third contained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,755 people, 16 helicopters, 66 fire engines
and 14 bulldozers have been assigned to fight the fire. But the
area is so vast and so isolated that commanders say that much of
their time and energy is devoted to logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest substantial airport, in Idaho Falls, is three hours
away from this camp, which is set on a highway so that it can be
resupplied. Reaching the fire lines takes the crews an hour each
way by bus, traveling on narrow Forest Service roads.
</P>
<P>
   And though the food served at the camp is far better than
standard military fare, it does not come cheap, said Dale B.
Thompson, a Park Service ranger based in Arizona who is managing
the food operation here. A Thursday dinner that included halibut
and au gratin potatoes dished up by the Big Sky Catering Co. of
Missoula, Mont., which specializes in providing for fire crews,
cost taxpayers $16 a meal, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The USO troupe flew in and out of Boise, Idaho, seven hours
away, and was returning to New York for regular weekend
performances on the USS Intrepid, the warship-turned-museum now
docked in New York. The Marines, who arrived here Aug. 5, have had
only one day off since, and receive no extra pay for their fire
service, said Lt. Alison Ake, a spokeswoman. The unit is scheduled
to return to California on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the civilian firefighters contracted by the Forest
Service and other federal agencies receive more generous treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They are required to take one day off for every 14 days of work,
or two days every 21, and most of them get time-and-a-half for
overtime, which adds up quickly over the long days. Wallace, the
23-year-old Californian, figures he will earn $3,000 a month this
summer as a member of what is known as a Type II, or second-tier,
fire crew. That is more than triple his regular wintertime wage.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks in the smoke, firefighters say, simple pleasures
feel like enormous rewards. Brian Crawley, a 33-year-old paramedic
from southeast Tennessee, was looking forward to a brief respite
from what would be two back-to-back 21-day fire tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm headed to the big metropolis of Challis,'' Crawley said,
``for two things I can't get here: a bed and a bath.''

`THE LAST OF THE BLOND BOMBSHELLS': NAME THAT TUNE, THEN BELT IT

(EDS: spelling Su, in production notes, is cq) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman is having lunch with her grown children at an outdoor
cafe when she is transfixed by the familiar tune a street-corner
guitarist is playing. The children, who are pretty sure that Mom's
going dotty, can't understand why she's suddenly enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your pulse doesn't quicken when you hear Hoagy Carmichael's
`Star Dust,' then I've failed as a mother,'' the woman says with
ironclad certainty.
</P>
<P>
   So where do you stand on the ``Star Dust'' question? Does the
melody haunt your reverie? Would you like to hear it, and a pride
of other pop standards, played in bracing swing-band arrangements?
Do you have a tolerance, even a secret fondness, for nostalgic,
life-affirming movies that bypass the head and go straight to the
heart? If so, be sure to catch ``The Last of the Blond Bombshells''
Saturday night on HBO. Your pulse will not only quicken, it'll do
the jitterbug.
</P>
<P>
   The woman whose children don't get it is Elizabeth, played with
infectious relish by Dame Judi Dench. When first encountered, she
is at a memorial service for her husband. At the sound of one of
the dear departed's favorite musical selections, Gilbert and
Sullivan's ``Pirate King,'' Elizabeth's mind supplies another song,
``(I'll Be Glad When You're Dead) You Rascal You,'' performed by a
World War II vintage all-girl band, the Blond Bombshells.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Elizabeth was the band's tenor saxophonist, the
prettiest and most talented of the young women who nightly donned
platinum wigs to become the Blond Bombshells at a London ballroom.
Well, almost all were young women. The drummer was a young man
named Patrick who preferred drag to draft, hiding from military
service in wig and gown and enjoying the embrace of all his band
mates but Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new widow worries her embarrassed children by embracing
life, hauling out her sax to join that outdoor guitarist for
regular jam sessions. Who should happen by and catch a performance
but Patrick (Ian Holm)? The young rake is now a bit bent and faded,
but Holm makes sure that he still has the glint in his eye and the
spring, however rusty, in his step.
</P>
<P>
   The two gray Bombshells hit upon a plan to try to find other
surviving band members to play a reunion gig. Elizabeth's wide-eyed
granddaughter Joanna (Millie Findlay) offers them a job at her
school dance.
</P>
<P>
   This warm bath of a film, directed by Gillies MacKinnon from a
script by Alan Plater, glides gracefully in and out of flashbacks
in which the band performs tunes like ``Opus One'' and ``A
Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.'' (The sight of young Patrick
in his dress will kindle a momentary memory of ``Some Like It
Hot,'' but this movie dances on different turf.)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and Patrick warm to their task and each other, finding
the band's singer, Gwen (Cleo Laine), performing with a jazz combo.
(Laine's rendition of ``Taking a Chance on Love'' is just one of
the film's musical rewards.)
</P>
<P>
   They find Dinah, the trumpet player (Olympia Dukakis, spewing
vaudeville Brooklynese that seems to come not only from another
continent but also from another movie) living in a Scottish castle
with dogs named Patty, Laverne and Maxene. They find the
Bombshells' leader, Betty (Joan Sims), playing piano at a seaside
dive; Annie, the trombonist (June Whitfield), in a Salvation Army
band; Evelyn, the alto sax player (Billie Whitelaw), in jail. They
lure Madeleine, the bass player (Leslie Caron, who still has Gigi's
sparkle), from her native France. Each of these performers makes
maturity look like great fun.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstituted band sounds ragged at first. But there's
really no suspense about whether the Bombshells will find their
chops and show the young listeners a trick or two. This is a fable,
after all, and if the soundtrack makes the little geriatric
ensemble sound better, and bigger, than the Basie band in its
prime, so what?
</P>
<P>
   When Laine belts out ``It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got
That Swing,'' there's no doubt that she has got that swing. So does
this film. And that's the name of that tune. &QL;

GREENSPAN SAYS PRAGMATISM DRIVES ECONOMIC POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. _ The protesters who gave voice to the risks
and costs of globalization outside meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization over the last year
did not make an appearance at the annual conclave of central
bankers and economists from around the world that opened here
Friday, but their influence was felt nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told
the conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas
City, that pragmatism rather than ideology was driving the adoption
in country after country of policies intended to help meet ``the
rigors of international competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged what he called ``deep-seated antipathy
toward free-market competition'' in some quarters, and warned that
there could be a backlash should the stellar economic conditions of
the last several years give way to tougher times.
</P>
<P>
   The policy-makers and analysts gathered here _ dubbed the
``pro-globalization elite'' by one of the participants, Alice
Rivlin, the former vice chairman of the Fed _ showed no inclination
to back off from their general position that increased trade and a
general reduction of the economic barriers between nations are good
things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were clearly concerned that the issues behind the
protests surrounding globalization and trade _ lost jobs and wages,
threats to labor and environmental standards, accusations that
economic policy is being conducted for the haves rather than the
have-nots _ could undermine support for the steady spread of free
markets and democratic capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``While recognizing the efficacy of capitalism to produce
wealth,'' Greenspan said in opening remarks to the conference,
``there remains considerable unease among some segments about the
way markets distribute that wealth and about the effects of raw
competition on society. Thus, should recent positive trends in
economic growth falter, it is quite imaginable that support for
market-oriented resource allocation will wane and the latent forces
of protectionism and state intervention will begin to reassert
themselves in many countries, including the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not suggest that the economy is about to slow, and
he gave no hints about whether the Fed is likely to raise interest
rates again this year after deciding twice in the last two months
to keep monetary policy on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed again the key role that productivity-enhancing
technological advances have played in the economy's strong
performance, and said it was ``still difficult to find credible
evidence in the United States that the rate of structural
productivity growth has stopped increasing,'' a signal that he has
considerable faith in the economy's ability to sustain high rates
of noninflationary growth.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed frustration that even in the middle of the
nation's longest business expansion, the momentum behind global
economic integration seems to be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite extraordinary prosperity, the ability to move forward
on various trade initiatives has clearly come to a remarkable
stall,'' he said in an apparent reference to the World Trade
Organization's difficulties in starting a new round of trade
liberalization, and the reluctance of the United States to extend
NAFTA to other Latin American countries like Chile. ``I don't see
the momentum picking up readily.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael Moore, the director-general of the World Trade
Organization, told the gathering that it would be a mistake to
ignore the sentiments of the protesters, and said part of the
solution would have to be renewed political determination in the
big industrial nations to press the case for free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who oppose us are not all fools and frauds,'' Moore
said. ``We need to assert our leadership on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin said policy-makers had a responsibility to address the
reality that ``the bottom of the income distribution has not
benefited from much of anything'' when it comes to the globalized,
technology-driven economy, and that income disparities were a
potentially destructive economic force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have better answers to those questions, even for
the kids gathered in the streets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College, told the group
that negative feelings about trade were closely linked to low job
skills and educational levels, and that producing a better-trained,
better-educated work force would help increase support for
increased global economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that policy-makers had to recognize that there have
been losers from increased trade, and that at least some of the
protesters were acting consistently with their own economic
interests in trying to slow globalization. As a result, he said,
simply preaching the benefits of trade would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's futile to instruct the unskilled in what their interests
should be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said any attempts to restrain market-driven capitalism
carried a cost. For example, he said, laws in Europe that make it
more difficult than in the United States for employers to lay off
workers had contributed to the fact that Europe has lower levels of
high-tech capital investment than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since European employers will have difficulty reaping the full
cost savings from productivity-enhancing investments, they choose
to invest less, and less capital flows into Europe in search of
high returns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Greenspan said, Europeans have increasingly been
investing their capital in the United States, where employers have
an easier time cutting costs and where there are many opportunities
to earn high returns. As a result, he said, European governments
are adopting more market-oriented economic policies, such as
Germany's recent adoption of a business-friendly tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is clearly pragmatism, not ideology, that is the main
driving force in these evolving views,'' Greenspan said. ``The
structural policy adjustments in Western Europe and Japan, not to
mention the efforts in China and Russia to move toward market
capitalism, are being motivated for the most part by the evident
ability of market competition to elevate living standards.''

   COXNET FOCUS 0826: MADAM PRESIDENT -- What's next, ``Vice
President Ken''? The joking perhaps was inevitable when the
nonprofit group the White House Project teamed up recently with
Mattel and Girls' Inc. to launch a President Barbie doll. With a
politically correct helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand
nuclear war and an unintentionally funny advisory on the back of
her box _ ``Podium not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this
Leader of the Free (Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous
light. But many people aren't laughing these days when the subject
turns to a woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican and
Democratic conventions, and both George W. Bush and Al Gore
reportedly included a woman on their ``short list'' of potential
running mates (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes

   MEXICO-CENTAM _ TAPACHULA, MEXICO _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene
Lopez, 15, said she was willing to do anything if she could just
get to the United States. ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take
care of babies,'' the Salvadoran teenager said earnestly, her eyes
as wide as saucers. But Lopez never made to Houston or El Paso, her
dream cities. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all teen-age
girls _ ended up in a jail cell here for undocumented migrants
crossing into Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state. While U.S.
officials conduct their own battle to stem illegal crossings,
Mexican officials here say they've seen a 30 percent increase over
last year in the number of undocumented immigrants they're

they've taken South Americans into custody, too, the vast majority
detained are Central Americans bound for the United States. An

   VAUGHAN-REMEMBERED _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin remembers the day
Stevie Ray Vaughan died on its 10th anniversary. For many, the
moment they found out about the helicopter crash is unforgettable,
a la the JFK shooting. So are the candle-light vigil held that
night in Zilker and the Antone's blues jams over the next five
nights. However, it wasn't, as some have said, ``The day the music
died in Austin.'' In fact, the music thrived, as the upsurge of
Stevie's profile posthumously has also raised the profile for the
live music capital. We'll talk to local music figures, including
his ex-bandmates, about that day and how it still affects us today.

   EDs: Here are a package of stories from a special fall fashion
section from the Dayton Daily News:FALLSTYLE-INTRO _ DAYTON, Ohio _
Whatever happened to good manners? It's a question that's been
asked often in recent years. About the time we all fell in love
with blue jeans and sweats, it seems we stopped minding our P's and
Q's and began tossing our etiquette books out the window. If you're
one of those who mourns the loss, take heart. If this year's fall
fashions are any indication, significant changes are in store.
(Dayton Daily News) MOVED Thursday.FALLSTYLE -MAKEUP _ In an
ever-changing digital age, connoisseurs of style seem to be

 &HT;    Bush not swayed by Fox's vision
 &HT;    By Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox spent the day in
Texas Friday, preaching to his neighbors to the north about closing
the wage gap and opening the border between Mexico and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texan whose opinion may matter most _ Gov. George W.
Bush _ appeared unconverted to Fox's vision.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour-long meeting at the University of Texas at Dallas,
Bush praised Fox's leadership and agreed the two nations should
strive to raise wages in Mexico. But he stopped well short of
embracing some of Fox's other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it very clear to Vicente Fox that we will enforce the
borders so long as I am the governor and if I am the president,''
said Bush, who plans to meet again with Fox soon after the November
election if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vision _ I don't know if it will work or not _ but what I
appreciate is it's an optimistic vision, a vision that says ...
when the wage differential narrows, then perhaps it's a strategy we
can explore jointly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met earlier this week with Canadian officials as well as
President Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop in Florida on Friday, Bush did promise,
however, to expand free-trade with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for another targeted audience, Bush also released a new
campaign ad Thursday vowing that there will be ``no changes, no
reductions,'' in Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who arrived in Florida Thursday night to attend a private
event raising more than $1.5 million for GOP campaigns, spoke to a
mostly Hispanic audience at Florida International University Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Bush pledged to work toward giving Mexico the
same partner status that Canada and Great Britain share with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I become president, I will look South, not as an
afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment of my presidency,''
Bush said of Latin America. ``Just as we ended the great divide
between East and West, so today we can overcome the North-South
divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's first visit to Texas since his July 2 victory allowed him
to meet with Mexican-American leaders who had supported him during
his campaign and Texas businessman he now hopes will support his
country, too.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he laid out his goals for the coming term, which
start with making the North American Free Trade Agreement an
equitable trade partnership among Canada, Mexico and the United
States and creating more jobs in his country.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, Fox supports allowing more Mexican workers in
the United States and giving amnesty to undocumented Mexicans
already here, which Bush has opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-term, he wants the United States and Mexico to
create a joint vision of North America for the first decades of the
21st Century, develop an integrated policy to regulate immigration
and control drug trafficking and then open the borders to allow
more free trade and access to jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, when we have narrowed the differences in development,
narrowed the differences in income, narrowed the differences in
per-capita gross product, then we can think of opening the borders
to the free flow of people,'' Fox, who will take office Dec. 1,
said at a joint news conference with Bush. ``We need to comply with
many objectives from here to there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mexican-Americans who met with _ or tried to catch a
glimpse of _ Fox on Friday welcomed his long-term vision but also
said it may be too soon to talk about some of those ideas,
especially given the resistance among American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a long, long-term thing to do. I don't think
people are willing to do that just yet,'' said Antonio Camacho, 38,
of Dallas, a computer consultant who showed up at the Dallas Art
Museum, where Fox met with community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho and other Mexican-Americans hailed Fox as a voice of
change for a country many say has long had too much corruption,
crime and poverty. They praised his recent electoral victory over
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which had held power
in Mexico for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the first leader not from the PRI is remarkable. It's
history,'' said Ruben Cardenas, 48, who moved from Monterey, Mexico
to Dallas 27 years ago and also showed up at the art museum Friday
to catch a glimpse of Fox. ``Right now, it's good history.
Hopefully, it will remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting with Mexican-Americans at the museum,
supporters gave the president-elect a rousing ovation, sprinkled
with chants of ``Viva Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   They were especially enthusiastic about his promise to be
president of all Mexicans around the world. He said he would
establish an office to serve as a liaison between his government
and the 18 million Mexicans living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he will be the president of 118 million Mexicans,''
said Dallas Deputy mayor Steve Salazar. ``There's only 100 million
people in Mexico, meaning he will look beyond the borders to make
sure Mexicans in America are represented.''

 &HT;    Coke names exec to head North America unit
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeffrey Dunn, who last month was elevated to
Coca-Cola's No. 2 executive in North America, has been named
president of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In October, he takes over as head of the beverage company's
largest business group, replacing President Ralph Cooper, who
retires at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The North America group has the highest per-capita consumption
of Coke products but in recent years has seen sluggish sales
growth, with case volume increasing just 1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock took a hit Friday after analyst Jennifer
Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney said slow growth will continue in
North America because of pricing pressures. She also suggested that
more competition in Japan, where Coke derives 20 percent of its
revenues, may hurt business there.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Coke's stock traded as low as $55 before closing
at $56, down $1.94.
</P>
<P>
   ING Barings analyst Manny Goldman said the selection of Dunn to
head the North America unit, which includes the United States and
Canada, is a smart move because of his extensive background in the
company's U.S. fountain business.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, 44, first joined the fountain business in 1985 and over
the years held several key posts, including vice president of
marketing and eventually general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said Dunn's challenge will be to expand the company's
carbonated soft drink business, which includes Coca-Cola Classic
and Diet Coke, and take advantage of consumers' growing appetite
for waters, teas and other noncarbonated products. He expects the
North America business to experience a turnaround in earnest next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stahl, who headed the North America group before being
named president and chief operating officer of Coca-Cola Co.
earlier this year, said Dunn's ``strategic approach to business,
consumer marketing skills and leadership acumen'' made him suited
for the new post. Before being named deputy group president in
July, Dunn oversaw marketing for the operation. The University of
Georgia graduate joined Coke in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who had been head of North America for only a few months
after Stahl was elevated, has been with the company for 35 years.
He was head of Minute Maid, another Coke business, and held several
other senior posts in Europe and North America.

   U.S.-AFRICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ This weekend, on a return
engagement in Africa, President Clinton is singing the praises of
President Olusegan Obasanjo of Nigeria. The Clinton administration
has seized on Obasanjo, whose victory last year ended years of
military dictatorship, as an anchor of democratic stability in
restive West Africa. But there are risks. Obasanjo presides over a
country that is fractured by Islamic extremism. Nigeria is the
second-most corrupt nation on earth, according to Transparency
International, a nonprofit group based in Germany. And Obasanjo's
record on human rights has already been stained, and his top aides
have been selling their influence. By Blaine Harden.

   VOTER-TURNOUT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What if they gave an election
and everyone came? Turnout in the last three U.S. presidential
elections has hovered at around half of the nation's voting-age
population, which has prompted a good deal of national
hand-wringing. If everyone eligible voted this November, the number
of ballots cast would roughly double. But would all those millions
of additional votes change the outcome for the main contenders? By

   ESTROGEN-HEART-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed so clear a decade
ago: Of course hormone replacement therapy would protect women's
hearts after menopause. After all, women's heart disease risk
starts to rise in middle age, around the time that their ovaries
stop making estrogen. But now, new data are turning the estrogen
hypothesis on its head and showing that even the best-intentioned
analysis can go astray if it relies on indirect evidence. By Gina

   U.S.-MEXICO-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As Vicente Fox paid his first
visit to Washington as Mexico's president-elect and informally
presented his ideas for a more liberal northward flow of Mexican
workers, his proposals stirred a flurry of mixed emotions at home.
Among the poor, Fox's proposals have sparked hopes that they might
soon be able to cross the border with more protections and dignity.
For Mexico's middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a
necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's
ambiguous, love-hate relationship with the United States. Because
it is a gateway to the most powerful country in the world, the
border is a kind of mythical place, but also a place where Mexico's
disadvantages are magnified. By Ginger Thompson.

   GERMANY-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Berlin) _ As the 10th anniversary of
German unification approaches on Oct. 3, it seems clear that the
conjunction of recovered German nationhood with a diminished
nation-state has had some disturbing effects. The giant of Europe
is edging toward its anniversary in a mood of some agitation,
wondering aloud what to do about rightist extremism, pondering
where the roots of xenophobia lie, lamenting the misunderstanding
between Wessis and Ossis (Westerners and Easterners), and groping
for a shared sense of German identity that is nonthreatening. By

   RAUSCHENBERG-ART (Captiva, Fla.) _ For his high school
graduation present, Robert Rauschenberg wanted a ready-made shirt,
his first. A decade or so later he made history with assemblages of
junk; sculptures and music boxes made of packing crates, rocks and
rope, and red paintings like ``Yoicks'' sewn from fabric strips.

   BRAZIL-TELENOVELLAS (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ When a television
serial about an 18th-century courtesan went off the air here two
years ago, few at the struggling network that had produced the
drama, called ``Xica da Silva,'' expected it to have much of an
afterlife. But then 150 episodes were dubbed into Spanish and sold
to a dozen other countries in Latin America, where the series
quickly went on to become a ratings phenomenon. Now the United
States, or at least the growing portion of it that watches
Spanish-language television, has succumbed to the same spell. By
Larry Rohter.

   NIJINSKY-DANCE (Undated) _ Just over 50 years after his death in
London on April 8, 1950, events on three continents reaffirm the
apparently boundless fascination with the legendary Polish-Russian
dancer-choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, whose brief career
(1907-1917) ended at 29 with mental illness that gripped him the
rest of his 61 years. The most comprehensive Nijinsky exhibition
ever assembled began touring European museums in March;
Nijinsky-themed stage plays ran this year in Tokyo, London and
Scottsdale, Ariz.; and in May, for the first time, the Royal Ballet
performed ``L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' his 1912 debut work, and a
controversial re-creation of his 1913 ``Jeux.'' The never-ending
Nijinsky season continued on July 2 when the Hamburg Ballet gave
the premiere of John Neumeier's homage, ``Nijinsky.'' By Daniel

<P>
   TAVERNIER-FILM (Paris) _ Bertrand Tavernier's latest film did
not begin with the ``big idea'' of denouncing poverty and
unemployment hidden behind France's stolidly bourgeois facade.
Rather, its genesis was an anecdote heard one evening over dinner
with his 33-year-old daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, a poet who
had taught in public schools in run-down communities. From that
conversation was born ``Ca Commence Aujourd'hui,'' or ``It All
Starts Today,'' Tavernier's 19th feature film. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   BOULEZ-SALZBURG-MUSIC (Salzburg, Austria) _ Pierre Boulez's
``Structures,'' Book 2, for two pianos is music of uncompromising
complexity. At the time of its premiere, in 1961, the work
galvanized composers in the avant-garde and in academic circles. No
one, including Boulez, could have thought it would reach outside to
mainstream audiences. So it must have been deeply satisfying for
Boulez when, at the conclusion of the third of four recent concerts
at the Salzburg Festival in honor of his 75th birthday, an audience
that nearly filled the 1,500-seat Felsenreitschule burst into
cheers after hearing a brilliant performance of ``Structures.'' By
Anthony Tommasini.

   WEBERN-MUSIC (Undated) _ The complete recording of Anton
Webern's output just released by Deutsche Grammophon does much more
than refute old and sterile arguments against serialism. But that
it does, and overwhelmingly. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   ACCIDENTAL-ART (New York) _ When Jackson Pollock first lifted
his brush from the canvas and allowed paint to drip in tangled
skeins across the surface, or Jean Arp and Marcel Duchamp began to
experiment with chance procedures, they sought in the accidental
and unpredictable the means to shatter the stale conventions of art
making. What these artists _ all currently featured at the Museum
of Modern Art as part of the show ``Making Choices'' _ hoped to
attain was freedom from the past and from academic formulas, and
the random act was their declaration of independence. By Miles
Unger.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDISH-HOUSES-ARCHITECTURE (Stockholm, Sweden) _ Some people
collect Hula Hoops, cookie jars, Japanese screens or racing cars;
Lars Sjoberg collects houses. What began as a childhood fancy

compulsion when he saw old houses about to be torn down. By Rita

TAILHOOK CONVENTION AGAIN MARRED BY MISCONDUCT ACCUSATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite with new reporting. Expands by 600 words.)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy is facing a new accusation of misconduct
at the annual convention of the Tailhook Association, officials
said Friday, nine years after drunken debauchery and sexual
assaults at another convention led to resignations, fines and
changes in the military's treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   A man and a woman staying at a hotel in Sparks, Nev., where the
association held its convention last weekend, reported being
verbally and physically assaulted in a hallway on Aug. 19 by a
group of men attending the convention, Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy did not identify the couple, but said the man reported
the accusation to Navy officials on Tuesday, two days after the
convention ended, using a telephone hot line set up to handle
sexual harassment complaints after the association's raucous
convention in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The misconduct reported did not appear to be of the same
magnitude as the events in 1991, when 83 women, some in the Navy,
reported being assaulted or harassed in a hotel in Las Vegas.
Nonetheless, the accusations included disturbing echoes of the
previous scandal, which roiled the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that as few as 10 and as many as several dozen
Navy and Marine aviators may have been in the hallway of the Nugget
Hotel at the time the man and woman say they were assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's inspector general and its criminal service have begun
an investigation into the accusation, and investigators have
already conducted interviews with some of those involved, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The case could prove particularly embarrassing for the Navy
because it only restored its official recognition of the
association eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the secretary of the Navy, Richard Danzig, said
that the association had given its assurances that there would be
no repeat of the kinds of incidents that made Tailhook synonymous
with the mistreatment of women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday that Danzig would not comment on the
incident until the investigation was completed. They said it was
premature to say whether the association could once again lose its
official status with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accusation of misconduct was swiftly denounced on
Capitol Hill. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., said it was a
disappointment that the convention had produced new allegations
only months after the Navy reinstated its official ties to
Tailhook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another sad day for women in the military,'' she said in
a statement. ``When a woman can't walk through a hallway without
being groped, there is a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the Pentagon said the man and woman, who
are married, were staying at the hotel, but not as part of the
convention. As they returned to their room, they tried to pass
through what the man described as a crowded hallway, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The man reported that the crowd in the hallway, all or most of
them men, made abusive comments when he asked them to make room for
them to pass.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple fought their way through, at least one man in the
hallway made ``inappropriate physical contact'' with the woman, a
senior Navy officer said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook Association, named for the steel hooks on jets that
enable them to land on aircraft carriers, is a private group based
in San Diego that acts as a sort of booster club for naval aviation
and has long been associated with the Navy and the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lack of official recognition never prohibited
officers from attending, last weekend's convention was the first
since the Navy restored its ties. Attendance swelled to 2,000, with
1,200 to 1,300 active-duty officers in attendance, the
association's president said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said that several Navy admirals and Marine
generals attended the convention, but they declined to identify
them, and it was not clear whether any were aware of the events in
the Nugget's hallway.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that a senior Navy officer contacted the man
afterwards and apologized, indicating he was at least aware of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The official said it was not clear whether the officer had
reported any misconduct to his superiors, as required by Navy
policy. The senior officer's role during or after the event will
also be a subject of the investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy spokesman, Cmdr. Gregory J. Smith, declined to discuss
the senior officer's conduct, citing the investigation, but said
that the man indicated in his report that he was not satisfied with
the apology offered.
</P>
<P>
   Tailhook's president, Lonny K. McClung, a retired Navy captain
and pilot, expressed concern about the accusations, but said he
knew little about what was alleged to have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, which began on Aug. 17 and lasted until last
Sunday, included a series of cocktail parties, dinners, seminars
focused on the future of naval aviation and even a fly-over of
naval jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you it was a very successful convention,'' McClung
said in a telephone interview. ``There were only two noise
complaints from the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We left feeling pretty good about the convention,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Ken Lightfoot, a detective with the police department in
Sparks, a suburb of Reno, said that the police had not received any
criminal complaints related to the Tailhook convention, though
police did respond to two medical emergencies at the hotel,
including a man with a head injury at 3 a.m. last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook scandal in 1991 had a profound impact on the Navy
and the Marine Corps. More than 100 officers were eventually
implicated in the assaults or other riotous behavior at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the assaults came when a group of drunken pilots
formed a gauntlet in a hotel corridor and molested women as they
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the assaults led to the resignation of the
secretary of the Navy, Lawrence H. Garrett III, and the early
retirement of the chief of naval operations, Adm. Frank B. Kelso
II, both of whom attended the convention, though they denied
witnessing the worst of the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday that neither Danzig nor the current chief
of naval operations, Adm. Vern Clark, attended this year's
convention.

AMERICAN EVANGELISTS ARRESTED IN CHINA RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS grafs 1 and 3 to clarify) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beijing _ Three American evangelists who were detained in
central China on Wednesday along with a large group of Chinese
Christians were released Friday afternoon, Chinese officials told
the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Henan province, where the arrests were made, told a
U.S. diplomat that the three U.S. citizens had been detained for
``activities incompatible with the tourist status under which they
entered China,'' the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   All three Americans were born in Taiwan and belong to a
Protestant church in California that sends members on brief
missions into China to lend moral and financial support to the
so-called house churches. These are fervent Christian groups that
refuse to accept the leadership of the government-sponsored church,
and their members often suffer police harassment and detention.
</P>
<P>
   The three were detained along with nearly 130 Chinese followers
of the China Fangcheng Church, a large Protestant group whose
leaders were sent to labor camps last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night the whereabouts of the released missionaries was
unclear, but in similar cases in the past, people declared in
violation of their visas have been required to leave the country
quickly. Chinese officials have not discussed whether any of the
detained Chinese believers would face criminal charges or
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans belong to the Chinese Vineyard Church
Fellowship in Los Altos, Calif., and were identified by the group
as Henry Chu, 36; his wife, Sandy Lin, 28; and Patricia Lan, 25.
They had traveled to China on Aug. 13 for a two-week mission.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign missionary work is illegal in China, though informal
outside aid to churches is sometimes tolerated.

 &HT;    `Survivor' voted out by corporate trainers
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks a lot, Richard.
</P>
<P>
   You've just given corporate trainers a bad name. You spent your
summer scheming on a sun-soaked island, but now it's back to the
real world. It's lucky you won that million, because finding
another job as a corporate trainer could be hard.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, Richard, you're not a team player.
</P>
<P>
   While you were methodically voting others off ``Survivor''
island, you may have done yourself and fellow corporate trainers a
disservice. Your Mack-the-Knife tendencies haven't done much to
advance the trainer credo of togetherness, teamwork and tolerance.
In fact many of your corporate training peers are wondering: With
corporate trainers like you, who needs enemies?
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was on that show he was really working for himself,''
said Pat Galagan, a spokeswoman for the American Society for
Training &AMP; Development in Alexandria, Va., the country's largest
training organization. ``A corporate trainer is always working for
some kind of client either inside the company or outside and a
really good trainer can help a group of people work together to
achieve a specific goal and that's not at all what was happening on
`Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of nonethical Machiavellian behavior isn't the sum
total of corporate training,'' said Alan Axelrod, an Atlantan who
has written books about the leadership styles of Gen. George Patton
and Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Patton would have drummed a guy like Richard Hatch out
of the Army, Axelrod said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hurt the image of corporate trainers who are there to
support people and build their skills,'' agreed John Challenger, a
Chicago area outplacement specialist who has done some corporate
counseling and training.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Richard, so you don't score many points with your peers, but
a few of them think you might do well in your recently announced
new venture as an overseer of a boot camp for troubled teens.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work out and a book or movie deal doesn't come
through, you might try your hand at whipping mercenaries into shape
or working as a corporate efficiency expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see this fellow's experiences as being valuable for
training hard-nosed negotiators,'' Axelrod said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, being a game-playing snake may get you $1
million or the corner office, but every corporate crocodile
eventually gets his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world ...there's a kind of corporate karma that is

said Axelrod. ``The trouble with being a Machiavellian is if you
don't attain the top position, sooner or later somebody else will
take you out. It works well when the rules are clearly defined the

were trying to help the individual reach his own goal. Companies

Carolyn Turknett, executive vice president of Turknett Leadership

   RAUSCHENBERG-ART (Captiva, Fla.) _ For his high school
graduation present, Robert Rauschenberg wanted a ready-made shirt,
his first. A decade or so later he made history with assemblages of
junk; sculptures and music boxes made of packing crates, rocks and
rope, and red paintings like ``Yoicks'' sewn from fabric strips.
Art sometimes has its roots in odd places, no? At 74, he is also an
American institution, the paradoxical fact of an anti-orthodox
career. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-TELENOVELLAS (Rio de Janeiro) _ When a television serial
about an 18th-century courtesan went off the air here two years
ago, few at the struggling network that had produced the drama,
called ``Xica da Silva,'' expected it to have much of an afterlife.
But then 150 episodes were dubbed into Spanish and sold to a dozen
other countries in Latin America, where the series quickly went on
to become a ratings phenomenon everywhere it was broadcast. Now the
United States, or at least the growing portion of it that watches
Spanish-language television, has succumbed to the same spell. By
Larry Rohter.

   MUSICALS-THEATER (Undated) _ If the 2000-01 Broadway season has
any unifying theme right now, it might be the youthful tilt in the
range of ages among the composers and lyricists whose work will
soon be on view. A look at the resurgence of youth in American
musical theater. By Barry Singer.

<P>
   NIJINSKY-DANCE (Undated) _ Just over 50 years after his death in
London on April 8, 1950, events on three continents reaffirm the
apparently boundless fascination with the legendary Polish-Russian
dancer-choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, whose brief career
(1907-1917) ended at 29 with mental illness that gripped him the
rest of his 61 years. The most comprehensive Nijinsky exhibition
ever assembled began touring European museums in March,
Nijinsky-themed stage plays ran this winter and spring in Tokyo,
London and Scottsdale, Ariz., and in May, for the first time, the
Royal Ballet performed ``L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' his 1912 debut
work, and a controversial re-creation of his 1913 ``Jeux.'' The
never-ending Nijinsky season continued on July 2 when the Hamburg
Ballet gave the premiere of John Neumeier's homage, ``Nijinsky.''
By Daniel Gesmer.

   BALLET-DANCE (Undated) _ Today's ballet world has two poles, and
both are in danger of freezing over. Plotless, or abstract, ballets
are at one pole; narrative ballets are at the other. By Jack
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DVD-MOVIES (Los Angeles) _ Occupying two sides of a
high-capacity disc called an 18 (for 18 gigabytes), ``Superman''
joins a fast-growing breed of fully loaded special editions that
stand stacked up like jumbo jets on fall and winter release
schedules. As demand increases, studios are taking more care to
rummage their archives and, as is the case with ``Superman,''
putting a level of effort into producing their major DVD's that in
some ways emulates the kind of attention directors themselves give
to their films. What viewers get out of this depends on their
degree of interest, of course, but even as amusements the
supplements reveal much about filmmaking. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   TAVERNIER-FILM (Paris) _ Bertrand Tavernier's latest film did
not begin with the ``big idea'' of denouncing poverty and
unemployment hidden behind France's stolidly bourgeois facade.
Rather, its genesis was an anecdote heard one evening over dinner
with his 33-year-old daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, a poet who
had taught in public schools in run-down communities. ``Dominique
told the story of a woman who couldn't afford the monthly
contribution to her children's school because she needed the 30
francs'' _ $4.50 _ ``for food,'' Tavernier, 59, recalled. ``From
this conversation, then, was born ``Ca Commence Aujourd'hui,'' or
``It All Starts Today,'' Tavernier's 19th feature film which opens
Sept. 8. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   DARK-DAYS-FILM (Undated) _ In 1994, a scruffy pod of homeless
people were sitting around a fire in the dank, dark Amtrak tunnel
they lived in underneath Manhattan when a thin, animated man named
Ralph had an idea. ``Someone should be making a film about this
stuff,'' he said. Marc Singer still finds it hard to believe that
an idle remark inspired such an odyssey that led a 20-year-old who
had never picked up a camera to live underground himself, enlist
his fellow outcasts as his crew and put together ``Dark Days,'' a
documentary that won three awards at this year's Sundance Film
Festival. By Peter Applebome.

<P>
   BOULEZ-SALZBURG-MUSIC (Salzburg, Austria) - Pierre Boulez's
``Structures,'' Book 2, for two pianos is music of uncompromising
complexity. At the time of its premiere, in 1961, the work
galvanized composers in the avant-garde and in academic circles. No
one, including Boulez, could have thought it would reach outside to
mainstream audiences. So it must have been deeply satisfying for
Boulez when, at the conclusion of the third of four recent concerts
at the Salzburg Festival in honor of his 75th birthday, an audience
that nearly filled the 1,500-seat Felsenreitschule burst into
cheers after hearing a brilliant performance of that very work, the
gnarly ``Structures,'' Book 2. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   BAYREUTH-MUSIC (Bayreuth, Germany) _ On the morning of
`Goetterdaemmerung,'' Wolfgang Wagner, 80 years old and a grandson
of the man who composed it, was fighting off a twilight of his own.
Wagner is no god. Small, combative, prolix and not without humor,
he sparred with a press corps eager to know more about the star
defections and family squabbles that have encroached on his 25-year
regime here. Founded 124 years ago by Richard Wagner, the Bayreuth
Festival is under siege from several directions. By Bernard
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   WEBERN-MUSIC (Undated) _ The complete recording of Anton
Webern's output just released by Deutsche Grammophon does very much
more than refute old and sterile arguments against serialism. But
that it does, and overwhelmingly. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ACCIDENTAL-ART (New York) _ When Jackson Pollock first lifted
his brush from the canvas and allowed paint to drip in tangled
skeins across the surface, or Jean Arp and Marcel Duchamp began to
experiment with chance procedures, they sought in the accidental
and unpredictable the means to shatter the stale conventions of art
making. So, too, surrealists like Andre Masson and Juan Miro, who
allowed their pens to wander over the page in the belief that they
would discover in those doodles the ghosts of their own repressed
imaginations. What these artists _ all currently featured at the
Museum of Modern Art as part of the show ``Making Choices'' _ hoped
to attain was freedom, from the past, from academic formulas and
the random act was their declaration of independence. By Miles
Unger.

   &UR; PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;

<P>
   MAINE-PHOTOGRAPHY (Undated) _ Since the 19th century, Maine has
represented an accessible wilderness: America's idea of itself.
Photographers played an important part in inventing this idea of
Maine, though their role is less well-known than that of writers
and painters. With an ambitious, two-part survey, ``Photographing
Maine: 1840-2000,'' the Maine Coast Artists/Center for Contemporary
Maine Art documents the themes and variations of photographers'
rich and complex reactions to this landscape and its inhabitants.

   PUBLIC-SPACES-ARCHITECTURE (Undated)) _ Horror vacuui _ fear of
emptiness _ is the driving force in contemporary American taste.
Along with the commercial interests that exploit this fear, it is
the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban
centers and even suburban sprawl. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDISH-HOUSES-ARCHITECTURE (Stockholm) _ Some people collect
Hula Hoops, cookie jars, Japanese screens or even racing cars; Lars
Sjoberg collects houses. What began as a childhood fancy, became a
reality when he needed places to live and evolved into a compulsion
when he saw old houses about to be torn down. By Rita Reif.

both countries hope that American travelers will finally start to
make their way to Vietnam in large numbers. By Philip Shenon.

   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Lead item: The opening of the American
Discovery Trail, the first coast-to-coast, nonmotorized trail, will
be celebrated on September 2 in San Francisco, at Crissy Field in
the Presidio. The 6,356-mile trail runs from Cape Henlopen State
Park in Delaware to Limantour Beach in Point Reyes National
Seashore, about 45 miles north of San Francisco. In the Midwest, it
splits into two branches _ a northern route through Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, and a southern route through Indiana,
Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. All told, it traverses 15 states and
the District of Columbia. Along its route, the trail passes through
hundreds of small towns and urban centers like Kansas City, Denver
and Cincinnati, and it leads to 14 national parks, 16 national
forests and 10,000 sites of historic, cultural and natural
significance.

   PFIZER-MARKETING (Undated) _ Replicas of Max, a small plastic
zebra, hang from the stethoscopes of so many pediatricians at the
Children's Hospital in Boston that at least one family has asked
whether he was the hospital's mascot. But no, Max is a creation of
Pfizer Inc., intended to sell an antibiotic called Zithromax. And
with Max's help, Zithromax has become a billion-dollar drug in just
a few years. The marketing effort is classic Pfizer. It is also an
example of what makes Pfizer both the company that its rivals try
most to emulate. By Melody Peterson.

is also the co-author, with C.K. Prahalad, of a business classic,
``Competing for the Future.'' By Fred Andrews.

   DSL-INTERNET (Undated) _Most people who connect to the internet
via a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) rave about the speed and the
lack of a need for a second phone line _ a necessity for anyone who

substantially for the handful of publicly traded companies that

   FIVE-QUESTIONS-TIRES (Undated) _ Bob Tasca Sr. has kicked plenty
of tires in his 72 years. He estimates that he, his sons and his
grandson, who own a Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Massachusetts and
a Ford dealership in Rhode Island, have sold 330,000 cars and
trucks, in 1986 selling more Lincoln-Mercury vehicles than any
dealer in the world. Tasca once told Henry Ford 2nd that he made
`lousy cars,' and since then he has made more than 600 voluntary
assembly-line inspections, telling Ford Motor Co. executives how to
fix flaws. He chronicles his exploits in accountability in his
book, `You Will Be Satisfied'. But how do you satisfy customers who

purchasers of multimillion-dollar apartments in the Loft SoHo
building opening here in the fall, expect ylang-ylang and rose oil.
The idea was subtly to affect the mood of Lenny Kravitz and the

   JOURNALISM-CHIC (Undated) _ Is the Fifth Estate experiencing a

Cameron Crowe, in his movie ``Almost Famous,'' opening Sept. 15,
recounts his days as a 15-year-old Rolling Stone writer during an
era when rock journalists could still pretend to be almost as cool
as their subjects. And in the pipeline, there's ``Serendipity,''
which began filming in New York last week, and may be the first
movie in which the dramatis personae include an obituary writer for
The New York Times. Not since Hoffman and Redford played a

with small bell-shaped blossoms in colors from pure white to
purple-scarlet. The flowers, bobbing atop stems so slender they are
almost invisible, look as if they are floating above the plant, not
tethered to it at all. What's more, coral bells have an
extraordinarily long season of bloom for perennials. By Cass

   U.S.-AFRICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ This weekend, on a return
engagement in Africa, President Clinton is singing the praises of
President Olusegan Obasanjo of Nigeria, a former general who was
elected last year in Africa's most populous country. The Clinton
administration has seized on Obasanjo, whose victory ended years of

   VOTER-TURNOUT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What if they gave an election

hand-wringing. It's obvious that if everyone eligible voted this
November, the number of ballots cast would roughly double. But
would all those millions of additional votes change the outcome for
the main contenders, George W. Bush and Al Gore? By Michael R.

   TIRE-DISPOSAL-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The deaths and injuries

6.5 million tires poses another problem: What to do with them once
they are taken off Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and other
light trucks? If someone figured out a way to stack the tires in a
column at a landfill, they would form a pile 949 miles high. By
Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ Long before anyone ever heard of
reality television, or its most recent efflorescence, ``Survivor,''
a group of scientists began putting ordinary people into unusual
situations and observing how they behaved. In perhaps the most
famous experiment, Dr. Stanley Milgram's study of obedience to
authority, the subjects meekly delivered what they believed were
potentially fatal electric shocks to another person when ordered to
do so by an experimenter in a white coat. Such research stimulated
heated ethical debate. Now, in a twist that oddly merges the
science of the past and the entertainment of the present, a
production company is planning to re-enact the Milgram study and
other social-psychology classics. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   ESTROGEN-HEART-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed so clear a decade
ago: Of course hormone replacement therapy would protect women's
hearts after menopause. After all, women's heart disease risk
starts to rise in middle age, around the time that their ovaries
stop making estrogen. And there was indirect evidence that the drug
was working. But now, new data are turning the estrogen hypothesis
on its head and showing that even the best-intentioned analysis can
go astray if it relies on indirect evidence. By Gina Kolata.

   CANDIDATES-SURVIVOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The two candidates
surveyed their voters and saw a group evenly divided _ loyal
stalwarts on each side, swing voters in the middle. Pundits and
fans who had followed the race closely had no idea who would win.
The venue was the nerve-racking finale of the CBS hit show
``Survivor.'' Richard, who won, excelled at defining his candidacy.
This year's presidential candidates tried to make similarly

<P>
   SINGLE-VOTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week, riding a wave of
strong polls following his family-focused speech at the Democratic
National Convention, Al Gore reiterated his intention to make
families, particularly ``working families,'' the focus of his
campaign. Gore took great pains to project an image of himself as a
devoted husband and father who understands that all families want
the same opportunities for their children. But where does his
parent-focused campaign leave unmarried voters, a group that has
supported the Democratic party by a strong majority in recent
years? By K.A. Dilday.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Given that both sides are bracing
for a down-to-the-wire presidential race, the nationally televised
debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
could be especially crucial this year. The common wisdom is that
Gore _ the oratorical slayer of Ross Perot, Jack Kemp and Bill
Bradley _ is such a vaunted debater, and Bush such a novice, that
it would be like watching a karaoke competition between Barbra
Streisand and Britney Spears. The truth is that Gore and Bush are
more evenly matched than people think. Bush, in fact, could even
come out ahead. By Richard L. Berke.

   U.S.-MEXICO-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As Vicente Fox paid his first
visit to Washington as Mexico's president-elect and informally
presented his ideas for a more liberal northward flow of Mexican
workers, his proposals stirred a flurry of mixed emotions at home.
Among the poor, Fox's proposals have sparked hopes that they might
soon be able to cross the border with more protections and dignity.
For Mexico's middle classes, an opening of the border seems more a
necessary evil. To them, the border is the epicenter of Mexico's
ambiguous, love-hate relationship with the United States. Because
it is a gateway to the most powerful country in the world, the
border is at once a kind of mythical place, but also a place where
Mexico's disadvantages are magnified. By Ginger Thompson.

   GERMANY-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Berlin) _ As the 10th anniversary of
German unification approaches on Oct. 3, it seems clear that the
conjunction of recovered German nationhood with a diminished nation
state has had some disturbing effects. The giant of Europe is
edging toward its anniversary in a mood of some agitation,
wondering aloud what to do about rightist extremism, pondering
where the roots of xenophobia lie, lamenting the misunderstanding
between Wessis and Ossis (Westerners and Easterners), and groping
for a shared sense of German identity that is nonthreatening. By

SOUTH AFRICA'S OPPENHEIMER REMEMBERED AS A MAN WHO TOUCHED MANY
LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In this society riven by race, the
color line has long been crossed only by the most determined of
souls.
</P>
<P>
   So when Harry F. Oppenheimer was remembered Friday, here in the
small Anglican church where he worshiped for decades, no one had to
ask why so many people from such different walks of life had come
to pay tribute to a titan of business and industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Oppenheimers earned much of their fortune in gold, diamonds,
minerals and other holdings during the country's darkest days. But
more than many of his fellow magnates, Oppenheimer, who died last
Aug. 19 at age 91, was a champion of change. The longtime chairman
of the world's biggest mining companies, Anglo American and De
Beers, and one of the world's richest men, Oppenheimer opposed
apartheid and pushed for an end to the oppression of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, cabinet ministers and corporate chiefs, black
and white, made their way to St. George's Church in the city's
Parktown neighborhood, filing in alongside ordinary employees and
parishioners who also felt themselves touched at one time or
another by the man affectionately known as Harry O.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer was far from a revolutionary, and he often found
himself at odds with those who were _ namely, the outlawed African
National Congress. But in the end many in the country, including
leaders of the liberation struggle, judged him to have been a
friend of their fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played an important role, from a different type of
trench,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, who was secretary-general of the
African National Congress during the early 1990s. ``His trench was
not the struggle, the armed struggle. It was in the boardroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramaphosa said that the business success that Oppenheimer
achieved should not discount the enormous contribution he made to
the country's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be questions of whether, in the process of
making his money, whether it was advanced through the help of
apartheid,'' Ramaphosa said. ``My answer to that is he operated in
the time and he did well in advancing the causes of many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Godsell, one of the Anglo American Corp.'s top executives,
said the collective complexion of the people who had shown up
signified the place Oppenheimer held in South African life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about him and it says a lot about where the
society we live in has come from,'' Godsell said.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer championed the creation of black trade unions and
was influential in ending an employment system that set aside
certain jobs for whites only. He also developed programs to bring
blacks into positions of responsibility in his companies.
</P>
<P>
   One person who came to know Oppenheimer's good works was Isabel
Louw, a 60-year-old black woman who was a parishioner at St.
George's in the 1960s and 1970s. She was one of those people who
benefited from his generosity and so she, too, came Friday to pay
her respects.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer, she recalled, had helped her son with a scholarship
to college in Cape Town, and later the Oppenheimer family helped
him obtain a job at the company in spite of his student activism,
which made him a target of state security agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very nice and he always was helping,'' she said. ``He
was rich man, but he wasn't a boaster.''

CHINA TO RELEASE AND DEPORT ARRESTED BOSTON-BASED POET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-RELIGION) 
(SUBS last graf before 2nd optional trim to add detail on
intellectuals in China) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Boston-based Chinese poet who was arrested two weeks
ago in connection with a literary journal he edits will be released
and deported to the United States on Saturday, a U.S. Embassy
official in Beijing said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 11 arrest of Huang Beiling, who is a Chinese citizen
with permanent-residence status in the United States, drew protests
from literary figures worldwide as well as from the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing. The police also confiscated hundreds of copies of his
journal, Tendency, which is published in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The police never said why they had detained Huang, also known by
his literary name, Bei Ling. He has lived in the United States for
more than a decade and had visited China in June. But a spokesman
for China's State Council Information Office said on Thursday that
he had been ``detained for further review by the Public Security
organization'' because of ``illegal business activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police can keep suspects in criminal detention for up to
30 days without filing formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's release defuses a situation that threatened to become a
major political embarrassment for China, at a time when its
government is preparing to open a $7 million celebration of Chinese
culture this week in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Western writers and scholars had said they would
probably boycott the event _ which includes performances, lectures
and exhibits in nine U.S. cities _ if Huang were still in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, PEN American Center, the writers group, sent a letter
of protest to President Jiang Zemin signed by well-known literary
figures including Susan Sontag, Arthur Miller and Seamus Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bei's arrest represents an especially alarming escalation
of the repressive and inhuman treatment of dissident writers and
intellectuals in China during recent months,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although China's publishing industry and intellectual life
generally have become more lively and open in the last few years,
the Chinese government has recently attempted to rein in the trend.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Distributing foreign magazines like Tendency is illegal in
China, where the state still officially owns and controls all
publications. Although visitors may generally bring in reading
matter for personal use without interference, the import of foreign
publications for distribution requires permits. Still, many such
publications are available in intellectual circles and even more
widely available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites of foreign publications are sometimes blocked by
the government, but many educated Chinese know how to circumvent
the restrictions, and individual articles are often posted in
Chinese chat rooms, which are more difficult for the government to
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Chinese government clearly regards the burgeoning of
information and intellectual discussion as a threat to its control.
And it has tried hard to discourage it in a serious, if
scattershot, way.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight months, the government has closed down or
warned several publishers whose books were deemed unacceptable. A
few private Web sites posting politically sensitive material have
been shut and their owners detained. And several prominent
academics have been publicly criticized by top government officials
and some have lost their teaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   But since the government has turned a blind eye to similar
activities by many other Chinese intellectuals, Huang, who had
visited China numerous times in the past decade without incident,
may not have expected any trouble.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Huang had come to China to conduct a forum on the latest issue
of Tendency, which focuses on Heaney, the Irish poet and Nobel
laureate. The Chinese-language journal offers a mix of translations
and original works by Chinese writers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it occasionally publishes work by and about dissident
Chinese authors _ and runs a list of underground Chinese literary
publications _ Tendency has little overt political content.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Huang is to leave on Saturday for San Francisco. His younger
brother, Huang Feng, who lives in Beijing and is also a writer, was
detained last week, and it was unclear whether he would also be
released.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the executive director of the PEN American
Center, Michael Roberts, said his group was ``thrilled'' with Huang
Beiling's release, but added: ``The international marketplace in
which China seeks full and normal status also includes a
marketplace of ideas, and it cannot expect to be welcomed into the
one while rejecting the other.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ A new day may be dawning for the millions of latin
Americans living without electricity, many of whom reside so far
from national grids that connecting these households is
prohibitively expensive for even the region's wealthiest countries.
 &HT;    Solar power, specifically photovoltaic (PV) electricity, has
been growing exponentially over the past decade, with global sales
now surpassing US$1 billion annually and Fortune 500 companies
pouring billions into research and development. Where are the sales
going? The biggest consumers in the developing world are Brazil and
Mexico.
 &HT;    Sunlight, or solar radiation, is transformed into power through
a semiconductor unit, or PV cell. The electricity output using this
method is expected to reach 1,900 megawatts by 2010, with the
United States, the largest producer of solar panels, accounting for
more than 30 percent of the global market. It exports some 70
percent of its production, worth an estimated $250 million in 1999
and an estimated $300 million in 2000. Mexico and Brazil each
individually buy solar panels worth roughly $10 million annually.
 &HT;    There's a good reason that Mexico and Brazil are such big buyers
of solar power. In Mexico, some 5 million people, or about 5
percent of the population, live in villages considered too remote
for grid extension; in Brazil some 20 million live off the grid.
 &HT;    That demand for alternative forms of energy is why solar
purveyors are beginning to focus their attention southward. Leading
solar technology manufacturer United Solar, for example, recently
announced plans to dramatically expand its Tijuana-based PV plant
to a 25-megawatt annual capacity with an eye on the Mexican market.
Belgium industrial powerhouse Bekaert is also getting in on the
action, spending $84 million to buy 60 percent of the plant.
 &HT;    ``To us, the production base is not a means to just having a
Mexican plant, we are very interested in being an important factor
in alternative energy in Mexico,'' says United Solar President and
Chief Executive Stanford Ovshinsky, who recently graced the pages
of Time magazine as one of its ``Heroes for the Planet.'' ``We
didn't go down there to be another border plant, but as a way to
take the first steps into Mexico as well as Central and South
America.''
 &HT;    But providing photovoltaic electricity in less-developed
countries is no easy task, and Mexico is no exception. Even small
systems are expensive to buy and install. And while the real price
is averaged over a 20-year expected lifespan, for most rural
dwellers a lack of upfront capital to meet high start-up costs and
a scarcity of credit represent tough market barriers.
 &HT;    General Motor's Ovonics unit donated 28 solar modules this past
May to the tiny hamlets of El Sabino, El Naranjo and Sicuandi,
which are tucked away in the Sierra Sur mountains in the southern
state of Oaxaca, but the local government still had to spend
$300,000 on installation and related expenses. It will eventually
pay more than $1 million to equip the communities with an
additional 85 modules.
 &HT;    Despite the costs, the Mexican government regards the
photovoltaic method as the best for providing power to remote
dwellers and has undertaken an aggressive rural solar program.
While about 50,000 small home systems have been installed _ 40,000
by the government _ another 250,000 are still needed by rural
dwellers, says Carlos Gonzalez Navarro, head of the department of
rural electrification for the government-run Federal Electricity
Commission.
 &HT;    That's just the beginning. Large systems are expected to meet
widespread use in the eco-tourism industry to power hotels and
other facilities in remote leisure and archeological sites. A
number of hotels and eco-destinations are already using solar power
along the Caribbean coast, including tourist resort Las Ranitas and
condo community Paraiso Tucan, both located on the Riviera Maya
south of Cancun.
 &HT;    While photovoltaic usage is growing in rural areas, it's still
too pricey to gain wide acceptance in town, according to Jorge M.
Huacuz, a solar market expert and researcher at Mexico's Institute
for Electricity Research. ``Most urban applications for solar are
still too expensive to compete with conventional sources,'' Huacuz
says.
 &HT;    That may change someday. Cost reduction has been dramatic in the
past two decades: a 10-fold drop since 1980 to current levels of
around $4 per watt for the panels. The U.S. National Renewable
Energy Laboratory predicts another 50 percent reduction in the
coming decade. In many remote areas, the solar equipment is already
competitively priced: a typical monthly loan repayment or lease for
a small system is currently comparable to average monthly outlays
made by developing-world families for other sources of power,
according to the World Bank, and solar power is safer, cleaner and
more reliable.
 &HT;    Remote water-pumping applications also represent an important
niche for PV solar systems. ``In Mexico, between 10,000 and 15,000
small family farms and ranches could be best served by PV-powered
water pumps,'' Huacuz says.
 &HT;    There are telecommunications applications as well. The Mexican
government, in partnership with Telefonos de Mexico, has installed
more than 12,000 solar-powered phone-repeating stations and
hundreds of emergency roadside call boxes. The government has plans
to deploy another 4,000 to 5,000 solar-powered emergency rural
phones, according to Jorge Silberstein, Mexico's deputy
communications minister. Remote wireless telecom relay stations
could also become significant users of solar systems: Cellular use
in Mexico jumped 128 percent to 7.6 million users last year and is
seen to be continuing its upward trajectory.
 &HT;    According to Huacuz, annual photovoltaic power growth in Mexico
should average 10 percent to 15 percent over the next three to five
years. To date, Mexico has about 11 megawatts of installed solar
capacity, a tiny fraction of the country's 35,000 megawatts of
total energy-generating capacity.
 &HT;    But the sun provides clean, renewable and decentralized power,
an attractive option for rural folk who have waited for years for
electricity to come to their areas. Technological advances, cost
reductions and growing environmental concerns are also beginning to
make it more attractive vis-a-vis other energy options overall.
With its large number of potential consumers, Mexico and the rest
of Latin America represent a bright growth area for solar
marketers.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ Es posible que este a punto de hacerse la luz
para millones de latinoamericanos sin electricidad, muchos de ellos
en zonas tan remotas que resulta prohibitivamente costoso
conectarlos a las redes nacionales, abastecerlos, incluso para los
paises mas desarrollados de la region.
 &HT;    La energia solar, en especifico la electricidad fotovoltaica, ha
crecido exponencialmente durante los ultimos anos, con ventas
mundiales superiores a los US$1.000 millones anuales, lo que ha
llevado a grandes empresas a invertir fuerte en investigacion y
desarrollo. Los mayores consumidores del mundo en desarrollo son
Brasil y Mexico.
 &HT;    La luz solar se transforma en electricidad a traves de una
celula fotovoltaica. Se calcula que la electricidad generada por
este metodo alcance 1.900 megavatios para el 2010, y Estados
Unidos, el mayor productor de paneles solares, liderara el mercado
con mas del 30 por ciento del total mundial. Estados Unidos exporta
casi el 70 por ciento de su produccion, valorada en US$250 millones
en 1999, y US$300 millones este ano. Mexico y Brasil compran cada
uno aproximadamente US$10 millones en paneles solares al ano.
 &HT;    Y hay una buena razon para ello: cinco millones de mexicanos,
casi el 5 por ciento de la poblacion, vive en poblados demasiado
lejanos para conectarse al sistema nacional electrico; en Brasil
unos 20 millones de personas viven en esta situacion.
 &HT;    La necesidad de fuentes alternas de energia es la razon por la
que las empresas productoras de paneles solares han comenzado a
mirar hacia Latinoamerica. Por ejemplo, el principal productor del
ramo, United Solar, recientemente anuncio planes para ampliar su
planta en Tijuana con vistas a un aumento de la demanda en Mexico.
Por su parte, Bekaert, el coloso industrial belga, invertira US$84
millones en esa misma planta.
 &HT;    ``Para nosotros, la base de produccion no significa solo tener
una planta en Mexico; tambien estamos muy interesados en ser un
factor importante en materia de energia alterna en Mexico,'' afirma
Stanford Ovshinsky, presidente de United Solar, quien recientemente
aparecio en la portada de la revista Time como uno de sus ``Heroes
del Planeta.'' ``No nos establecimos alli [en Tijuana para ser una
planta fronteriza mas, sino como forma de dar los primeros pasos en
Mexico, asi como en Centro y Sudamerica,'' agrego.
 &HT;    Pero generar electricidad fotovoltaica en los paises en
desarrollo no es tarea facil, y Mexico no es la excepcion. Incluso
los sistemas pequenos son costosos. Y aunque el precio real se
promedia a 20 anos, para la mayoria de los habitantes de las areas
rurales la falta de capital inicial para arrancar el proyecto y la
escasez de credito son grandes obstaculos para el mercado.
 &HT;    Ovonics, filial de General Motors, dono 28 modulos solares en
mayo a los pequenos poblados mexicanos de El Sabino, El Naranjo y
Sicuandi, en las montanas de la Sierra Sur, en el sureno estado de
Oaxaca, pero las autoridades locales tuvieron que cubrir US$300.000
por concepto de instalacion y otros gastos, y a final de cuentas
tendran que pagar mas de US$1 millon para equipar las comunidades
con 85 modulos adicionales.
 &HT;    A pesar de los costos, el gobierno mexicano considera el sistema
el mas viable para las zonas remotas y ha iniciado un energico
programa de electrificacion rural. Aunque ya se han instalado
50.000 sistemas para viviendas (40.000 por parte del gobierno)
todavia hacen falta unos 250.000, explica Carlos Gonzalez Navarro,
director del Departamento de Electrificacion Rural de la Comision
Federal de Electricidad.
 &HT;    Y ese es solo el comienzo. Se espera que sistemas de mas
capacidad se apliquen en el sector del ecoturismo para abastecer a
hoteles y otras instalaciones en zonas turisticas remotas y sitios
arqueologicos. Varios hoteles e instalaciones y zonas ecologicas ya
usan energia solar a lo largo de la costa del Caribe, incluidos el
centro turistico Las Ranitas y la comunidad Paraiso Tucan, ambas en
la Riviera Maya, al sur de Cancun.
 &HT;    Aunque el uso de paneles solares crece en las zonas rurales, es
una tecnologia demasiado costosa, segun Jorge M. Huacuz, experto en
el mercado de energia solar e investigador del Instituto de
Investigaciones de Electricidad de Mexico. ``La mayoria de las
aplicaciones de la energia solar en ambientes urbanos todavia son
muy costosas para competir con las fuentes convenciones de
electricidad,'' afirma Huacuz.
 &HT;    Pero eso debe cambiar. La reduccion del costo de la energia
solar ha sido significativa en las ultimas dos decadas: diez veces
desde 1980, al nivel actual de unos US$4 por vatio en el caso de
los paneles. El Laboratorio Nacional de Energia Renovable de
Estados Unidos pronostica una reduccion adicional del 50 por ciento
en los proximos diez anos. En muchas areas remotas, los paneles
solares ya compiten bien: el pago tipico mensual de un prestamo o
el arrendamiento de un sistema pequeno es comparable al promedio
que paga una familia en paises subdesarrollados por otras fuentes
de energia, segun el Banco Mundial, y la energia solar es mas
segura, limpia y confiable.
 &HT;    Un nicho especial de esta tecnologia es la irrigacion en zonas
remotas. ``En Mexico, entre 10.000 y 15.000 pequenos ranchos y
haciendas podrian sacar un gran provecho a las bombas de agua que
funcionan con electricidad solar,'' afirma Huacuz.
 &HT;    La tecnologia tambien se usa en aplicaciones de
telecomunicaciones. El gobierno de Mexico, en colaboracion con la
empresa telefonica Telmex, ha instalado mas de 12.000 repetidoras
telefonicas y telefonos de emergencia junto las carreteras, todos
abastecidos por energia solar. El gobierno tambien planea instalar
entre 4.000 y 5.000 telefonos solares de emergencia en areas
rurales. El uso de los telefonos celulares aumento el ano pasado un
128 por ciento en Mexico, a 7,6 millones de usuarios, y se proyecta
que seguira aumentando.
 &HT;    Segun Huacuz, el crecimiento de la generacion de electricidad
fotovoltaica en Mexico debe llegar a un promedio del 10 por ciento
al 15 por ciento durante los proximos tres a cinco anos. Mexico
tiene una capacidad instalada de unos once megavatios de
electricidad solar, una pequena fraccion de los 35.000 megavatios
de capacidad total generadora del pais.
 &HT;    Pero el sol ofrece una fuente de energia, renovable y
descentralizada, una opcion atractiva para los habitantes de areas
rurales que desde hace tanto tiempo esperan que la electricidad
llegue a sus hogares. Los avances tecnologicos, la reduccion de
costos y una mayor preocupacion por el medio ambiente tambien
comienzan a hacer la energia solar mas atractiva. Con su enorme
cantidad de consumidores en potencia, Mexico, y el resto de
Latinoamerica, representan una brillante area de crecimiento para
la tecnologia solar.

 &HT;    BellSouth promotion signals Latin America strategy
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The point man for BellSouth's spectacular success in
Brazil has been given a high-profile promotion.
</P>
<P>
   While Roberto Peon remains president of company operations in
that country, a job he has held since 1997, he will also head
BellSouth's Internet and publishing efforts throughout Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Miller III, president of BellSouth International,
said Peon will be responsible for wireless Internet service as well
as the electronic Yellow Pages. ``These are two of our biggest
opportunities in the region, and that is exactly where we need
Roberto the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is a reward for Peon, but it also validates the
past decade's decisions while signaling future company direction.
</P>
<P>
   Peon led the campaign to take advantage of the fastest-growing
telecommunications service in the largest market in Latin America,
one of the world's most promising regions.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Mexico, Peon is fluent in English and Spanish, as
well as Portuguese _ the language of Brazil. He led the team that
studied the market for a decade and then bid more than $3 billion
for two wireless licenses in Brazil, a price thought exorbitant by
some analysts. Additionally, BellSouth and its Brazilian partners
spent roughly $900 million to build wireless networks. In May,
BellSouth paid $240 million for a minority stake in a third
wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil's hunger for wireless has proved fierce. BellSouth
launched wireless service in Sao Paulo and the northeast of the
country in May and June 1998. By year's end, the two units had more
than 1 million customers. BellSouth now has more than 3 million
customers among the three wireless units.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Latin America remains a largely untapped telecom market
and BellSouth _ along with Telefonica of Spain _ ranks as a leading
investor.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of this year, BellSouth revenues for the
region were $695 million, according to documents filed by the
company with federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Telefonica, BellSouth has specialized in wireless
communications and has more than 8 million wireless customers in 10
countries. BellSouth has just begun offering Internet access via
phone lines in five markets where, thus far, it has only 169,000
customers. The company has also started offering wireless Internet
access in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the region are high enough that BellSouth is planning
to issue a ``tracking'' stock for its Latin American unit later
this year. Like other trackers, the Latin American offering will
not give shareholders ownership. However, it is meant to give
investors a way to profit from the growth in the region and to
``unlock'' some of the value that is not otherwise reflected in
BellSouth stock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BellSouth continues to invest in Europe as well. Last
week, the company and its partners bid $7.6 billion in an auction
for German wireless licenses, Europe's largest and most lucrative
telecommunications market. BellSouth's portion of the bid was about
$880 million.

 &HT;    Southern Co. unit fights for control of German firms
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh from victory in a takeover battle for a Welsh utility,
Southern Co. is embroiled in a high-profile struggle over control
of two German power companies.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy Inc., Southern's international subsidiary, wants
to expand its holdings in Berlin's electric utility, which serves
metropolitan Berlin, and then acquire the company that generates
electricity for almost all of the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   SEI was surprised two weeks ago when E.ON, a conglomerate that
is Germany's largest energy company, decided instead to sell its 49
percent stake in Berliner Kraft und Licht, the Berlin utility known
as Bewag, to Hamburgische Electricitaets-Werke, the utility known
as HEW that serves Hamburg. HEW is majority-owned by Sweden's
state-owned utility.
</P>
<P>
   SEI prevailed this week in the German courts by winning an
injunction blocking the sale until 2017 on grounds that it has veto
power over any such transaction. SEI purchased 26 percent of Bewag
in 1997 for $830 million, the largest U.S. investment to date in
continental Europe's rapidly consolidating utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Harland, SEI's director for German operations, said Friday
that the fight is shaping up as a major test of U.S. investment in
Europe's energy sector and whether ``it's possible (for a U.S.
company) to take a meaningful role in the European club.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Amsterdam, Netherlands, Harland
noted that E.ON has investments in the U.S. chemical sector and
that it would not be in its interest to act in a ``capricious
manner'' in this case.
</P>
<P>
   SEI wants use an expanded investment in Bewag as a springboard
to acquire Vereinigte Energiewerke, the eastern Germany power
generator known as VEAG, and integrate the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two investments would amount to ``hundreds of millions of
dollars'' and give SEI a major foothold for further expansion in
Europe's utility sector, Harland said.
</P>
<P>
   HEW is also bidding for VEAG. German Economics Minister Werner
Mueller, who is viewed as antagonistic to SEI, declared this week
that HEW offers ``the clearer solution'' for the east German
company. It was only last week that a joint venture of SEI and
Pennsylvania-based PP&AMP;L was declared the winner over Japan's Nomura
Securities in a takeover fight for Welsh utility Hyder PLC. The
partnership will pay $3.7 billion in cash and assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   SEI is due next year to be spun off by the parent Southern Co.
into a separate publicly traded company to handle riskier U.S. and
international investments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, E.ON is being forced by European antitrust
regulators to divest its holdings in both Bewag and VEAG as a
condition for a $14 billion merger earlier this year that created
the company from two German energy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Harland said SEI wants to sit down with all the parties and
negotiate a settlement, and could envision shared ownership of the
East German utility. But SEI will insist on maintaining its stake
in Bewag, which includes effective management control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fight the battle and win in court, but that wouldn't be
a win for anyone,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: BOND RULING PUTS ACCUSED SCIENTIST IN DIFFERENT LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Calif.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Decisions on bail rarely have much influence over
the outcome of criminal trials, because they focus on the narrow
questions of the risk that the defendant might flee or endanger the
community, not guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But when Judge James Parker of U.S. District Court in
Albuquerque, N.M., decided Thursday to release the former nuclear
scientist Wen Ho Lee on bail, the order cast this important
national security trial in a very different light and created
potentially difficult problems for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the decision, which may take a week or more to
be carried out, is that it follows an extraordinary three-day
hearing at which the government laid out a significant portion of
its evidence against Lee. That meant that the defense lawyers were
able to attack not just the notion that Dr. Lee might present a
threat if released, but the credibility of assertions at the heart
of the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the government claimed that Lee acted deceptively
when he improperly downloaded a vast library of nuclear weapons
secrets. That has now been called into question because of a series
of misstatements by an FBI agent testifying for the government.
</P>
<P>
   And the government's more important claims that any leak of the
data Lee is accused of improperly downloading could alter the
global balance of power _ one expert called any release of Lee on
bail a ``you-bet-your-country'' decision _ now appears exaggerated,
particularly after the defense presented respected experts who
insisted that most of the information was already in the public
domain and would be of little use to any other country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in presenting their case for releasing Lee after more
than eight months in jail, the defense introduced no new evidence
at all about Lee's actions, like alibis or information that he had
not actually engaged in the specific actions cited in his
indictment. Instead, the defense used facts unearthed in discovery
to hammer relentlessly on the credibility of the government's
descriptions of Lee's supposed deceit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision, which reversed a December order, suggests
that at least some of that was persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case ``no longer has the requisite clarity and
persuasive character,'' needed to hold him, Parker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, judges don't look kindly on FBI agents who mislead
them and they are upset if they are told something that's not
true,'' said George Cardona, a law professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles and until recently the head of the
criminal division at the U.S. attorney's office here. ``That can
affect how the judge views the credibility of the case. That's not
a position anyone wants to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker has yet to issue a new written order, so his reasoning is
not clear. But he did suggest that he still saw Lee as potentially
being something of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed that Lee be held under strict home detention, with
severe limits on whom he can see, where he can go and even on what
he can say; the government, in the judge's proposal, would have the
right to monitor all his telephone calls and to cut them off if
sensitive issues were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolism of the judge's decision was plain, and
triggered some quiet finger-pointing among government officials
apparently concerned about a collapse of the case and who might
catch the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Some people hinted that John Kelly, the former U.S. attorney who
oversaw the indictment of Lee and is now a candidate for Congress
from New Mexico, may have rushed to get the charges filed before he
left office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly personally argued the case against granting Lee bail in
December and forcefully insisted the threat was too great. He
released a written statement Friday in which he did not directly
address any of the questions of a rushed indictment. He said, ``I
respect Judge Parker's decision on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other officials expressed anger at scientists at Los
Alamos, who had reportedly told prosecutors that there was no
question over the significance of the data Lee downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either more questions should have been asked before there was
an indictment, or there needs to be some explanation of why the
government was told it could rely on claims that now appear pretty
unreliable,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's decision may have also affected the case in
another way that could be subtle but decisive. A critical defense
claim is that it needs to introduce all the information Lee
downloaded, a total of 806 megabytes, at his trial to back up its
assertion that nearly all of the nuclear weapons design and test
data is already public.
</P>
<P>
   The government has fought this effort, insisting that the
information is classified and so sensitive that it would compromise
national security. Parker has already ruled that the information is
relevant to the trial, but he has said the prosecutors can try
offering unclassified summaries of at least some of the data, and
some of those substitutions are due next week.
</P>
<P>
   After the bail hearings, the defense appears to have made at
least some headway in proving the centrality of this data to the
credibility of the charges against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense lawyers can now persuade the judge that terse
summaries will not go far enough in allowing them to demonstrate
that the information was already public _ a big if, but not as much
of a long shot now _ then the government will be faced with a stark
choice: it would have to permit what it has said are the ``crown
jewels'' of the nuclear weapons program in open court, or it would
have to drop the charges.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a new defense tactic. That is how Oliver North
succeeded in getting government charges dropped in his celebrated
Iran-Case case several years ago, when one of his lawyers was John
Cline. Cline has since moved from Washington to Albuquerque, where
is now a lawyer for Lee.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Gov. George W. Bush charged Friday that the Clinton
administration had neglected Latin America, pledged to put those
countries at the center of his foreign policy priorities and
outlined a way of thinking about the region that placed it on a par
with U.S. interests in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks at Florida International University in
Miami, a venue chosen by his campaign for its cultural, ethnic and
immigrant links to Latin America, as part of an indictment of the
administration, which he said had pursued an aimless strategy in
Latin America of ``summits without substance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speech also dwelt on Bush's sense of the importance of
the region to the United States in an unusually lengthy and
vigorous way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin
America,'' Bush said. ``Should I become the president, I will look
south not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who ignore Latin America do not fully understand America
itself,'' he said. ``And those who ignore our hemisphere do not
fully understand American interests. This country was right to be
concerned about a country like Kosovo, for example, but there are
more refugees of conflict in Colombia. America is right to be
concerned about Kuwait, but more of our oil comes from Venezuela.
America is right to welcome trade with China, but we export nearly
as much to Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that President Clinton had ``dropped the ball''
on trade, failing to build on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which Clinton inherited from President Bush and then
pushed through Congress, with a broader free-trade zone throughout
the hemisphere. And he complained that Clinton had not obtained
so-called fast-track negotiating authority from Congress to
conclude further trade pacts with individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, proposed a few new
programs to help countries in Latin America and protect the
interests of the United States, but they involved relatively small
amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   He called for an extra $100 million a year in small-business
loans to Latin American entrepreneurs; an additional $100 million a
year in debt forgiveness for countries that took steps to protect
tropical forests; an American Fellows program that would encourage
people from Latin America to work in U.S. government agencies, and
the designation of a counselor at each U.S. Embassy in Latin
America who would encourage charitable activities by U.S.
organizations and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about helping to train law enforcement officials
and judges in Latin America, and providing countries there with
more help in fighting the production and export of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed most interested in simply making clear his
philosophy and priorities. After the speech, Bush traveled to
Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, for a private meeting with Vicente
Fox , the president-elect of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Both the speech and the subsequent meeting with Fox allowed the
Texas governor, whose lack of expertise on foreign policy has been
highlighted by several verbal gaffes and challenged by Vice
President Al Gore, to cast himself as a statesman engaged in the
affairs of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He and Fox followed their meeting with a news conference at
which they exchanged gifts _Fox got a Stetson-style hat that he
called a sombrero while Bush received cowboy boots _ and Bush
reiterated a pledge from his speech that if he is elected
president, he will arrange a summit meeting with Fox in November,
before either man is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said at the news conference that this would signal his
belief that the relationship between the United States and Mexico
was one ``of the most importance.'' Bush had said earlier, in his
speech, that he wanted Mexico to have as close and special a
relationship with the United States as Canada and Britain do.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks and events Friday also carried a potential
political advantage. The Republican nominee has been trying hard to
woo the votes of Hispanics, and their support for him could
determine whether he wins some of the states with the most
electoral votes, like Florida, where Gore has recently mounted an
aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appealed directly to Cuban-Americans in southern Florida
with a strongly worded vow in his address, titled ``Century of the
Americas.'' He promised not to ease current economic sanctions
against Cuba unless its leader, Fidel Castro, instituted democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My word to you, Mr. Castro: Let your people live in freedom,''
Bush said, drawing perhaps his loudest ovation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The speech and the conversation with Fox, who met the day before
with Clinton and, separately, Gore, came at the end of one of the
rockiest weeks in Bush's campaign since the Republican primaries.
And there was something undeniably unusual about the governor
turning to the arena of international affairs as he sought to
regain his balance.
</P>
<P>
   But his advisers said that the speech was scheduled weeks ago,
and they noted that unlike several of Bush's previous addresses on
international affairs, this one allowed Bush to claim some
firsthand knowledge of the subject, given that Texas and Mexico
share a border. Bush, for example, had met Fox at least two times
before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said
that Bush was clearly not prepared to represent the United States
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this week,'' Hattaway said, ``he criticized our own
military readiness, and his record as governor consists mostly of
ribbon cuttings for new bridges to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aides to Gore said that Bush's remarks ignored many of the
administration's successful efforts in Latin America. They noted
that NAFTA, which opened trade between the United States, Mexico
and Canada, was signed into law by President Clinton in 1994. They
also drew attention to the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which
promoted trade among those islands, and what they described as
successful efforts to curb or end violence in Ecuador, Peru and
Guatemala and to provide financial aid to Mexico and Brazil at
crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, Clinton's absence of fast-track authority
to negotiate trade agreements without amendments by federal
legislators was the result a Republican-controlled Congress that
would not give it to him. At the time, in addition to Republican
opposition, some congressional Democrats also opposed the
legislation for fear of alienating labor constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Condoleezza Rice, Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, said
that Clinton nonetheless warranted blame, because it was his
responsibility ``to state an agenda and persuade and cajole people
to follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't seem halfhearted about it,'' Rice added, implying
that Clinton had.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Bush's comparison of Kosovo and Colombia was not
an argument against military intervention in the former place or
for such intervention in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she said, it was an expression of Bush's philosophy that
``you start with strong neighborhoods and reach out from there.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Bush both said that the Clinton administration's recent
approval of extra aid to Colombia for a fight against drugs and
political corruption was the right course of action.
</P>
<P>
   In previous foreign-policy speeches and remarks on the campaign
trail, Bush has identified many areas of the world as especially
important to the United States, including the Far East, the Middle
East and Russia. And nothing in his remarks Friday suggested he was
lifting Latin America high above those.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few densely populated continents that Bush has not
flagged as a priority is Africa, which has been discussed much more
extensively by his rival, Gore. Like Clinton, however, neither Bush
nor Gore has suggested that they would change the U.S. position
that there is no strategic interest in Africa that would warrant
either military intervention or major economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rice, in interviews with reporters, and Bush, in the
address itself, said that what the Clinton administration _ Bush
called it the Clinton-Gore administration _ had essentially failed
to do was perpetuate and extend the strides in peace, democracy and
trade that were well under way in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to be when Bush's father, in the last full year of
his presidency, lost his re-election bid to Clinton. Rice worked as
a Russia expert on the National Security Council under President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that while Clinton signed NAFTA, ``I think the Bush
administration laid the groundwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the situation when his father, whom he did not
actually name, left office, Bush said, ``The promise of that moment
has been squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the drug traffic in Latin America was too
heavy, the disparities in wealth were too severe and there were too
many ``vast, urban slums where children scramble for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said both his speech and at the news conference with Fox
that he believed the border between the United States and Mexico
needed to be vigorously enforced, but that it must be done ``in a
human fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has called for a more open border, and Bush said the men had
discussed that issue, but the Texas governor dwelled on their
common belief that Mexico was a country and economy on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``His victory sends a strong signal of reform and modernization
in Mexico,'' Bush said of Fox's election.

COMMENTARY: SURVIVAL OF THE FAKEST

<TEXT>
<P>
   An American political campaign just doesn't get any better than
it has in this convention summer of 2000. We've seen strange
ideological bedfellows perpetrate Machiavellian intrigues. The
sudden emergence of dark-horse candidates and collapse of
front-runners. No-holds-barred debates.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the nation has been riveted. But now we must awaken to
the grim reality: This season's run of ``Survivor'' is over.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves us with the strange residue of ``official''
politics offered by the twin conventions _ neither of which, even
on their best nights, drew close to half the audience of
Wednesday's ``Survivor'' finale. Through a weird cultural reversal,
America is now a place where there's more spontaneity and
``reality'' in a prime-time network entertainment series than there
is in the TV spectacles staged by our political parties over
supposedly momentous issues of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The audience that cast its vote by Nielsen isn't stupid. It does
prize authenticity over canned showmanship. And with John McCain
long out of the race, authenticity isn't on the ballot. As that
minority of Americans paying attention knows, the choice this year
is between two distinctive brands of inauthenticity: the faux
rainbow coalition that George W. Bush showcased under the brand
Compassionate Conservatism in Philadelphia vs. the populism lite
that Al Gore marketed as Fighting for Working Families last week in
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to give the Democrats credit. Gore has pulled ahead,
at least for now, because he did a much cleverer job than his rival
of giving his inauthenticity the gloss of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The media that repetitively noted the ``scripted'' quality of
the GOP convention, and the gap between the dense minority
population on stage and the restricted-country-club demographics in
the hall, didn't harp as relentlessly on the discrepancy between
Gore's message (``They're for the powerful _ we're for the
people'') and the reality at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, as always, is a fatal distraction for the Washington press
pack, and so the Al-Tipper kiss (``disgusting,'' according to
Robert Novak) and the tiff over the Playboy mansion (arguably one
of the week's classier venues) easily upstaged the more telling
story.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention was showered by an avalanche of big
money, much of it coughed up by the same powerful interests (big
oil, Hollywood, polluters, even tobacco) that were attacked by the
nominees from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The parties at Spago and Armani in Beverly Hills, like Tom
DeLay's fat-cat golf outings in Philadelphia, were usually kept out
of camera view. So was the celebration in the sky box of Terry
McAuliffe, the Clinton-era Democratic money siphon who has been
praised by Gore as ``the greatest fund-raiser in the history of the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   As reported by Holly Bailey of the Center for Responsive
Politics, McAuliffe and movie-industry potentates ``dined on cake
iced with an illustration of President Clinton's face.'' Here is a
power-to-the-people movement that even Marie Antoinette could love.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of these Gilded Age images we got a very shrewdly
packaged portrait of fightin' Al and Joe. In his acceptance speech,
the vice president talked about growing up in Tennessee but not of
his childhood residence at the Fairfax Hotel in Washington; he
mentioned his brief stint studying religion at Vanderbilt but not
his four years at Harvard; he recounted in detail his parents'
working-class backgrounds as a rhetorical bait-and-switch to
camouflage his St. Albans pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly brilliant touch was the just-folks video about
Gore made by Spike Jonze, the gifted director of ``Being John
Malkovich.'' This filmmaker was the perfect choice for the
assignment of transforming an American prince into an Everyman,
since he has already performed the same identity transplant on
himself; the spiky Jonze was born Adam Spiegel, heir to the
clothing-catalog fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between Joseph Lieberman's L.A. persona and his offstage
reality was also deftly abridged. Check out the nonpartisan
statistics at opensecrets.org: This newly passionate champion of
the oppressed health-care consumer has received more campaign cash
from insurance companies (many based in his home state,
Connecticut) than any other senator and is third in contributions
from pharmaceutical giants.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he immune to paydays from the entertainment companies he
browbeats for profiteering from cultural sewage. In his last
financial statement, Lieberman's biggest source of outside income
was a book advance from Simon &AMP; Schuster, whose parent company
makes zillions from a particular Lieberman-William Bennett bete
noire, ``The Howard Stern Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Lieberman's abrupt recantations of previous positions
on affirmative action and Social Security, and it's easy to see why
last week he could be found spinning faster than a dreidel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is no less inauthentic than his Democratic opponents, of
course. In his acceptance speech, he paid tribute to his hometown
of Midland, Texas, and its motto of ``The sky's the limit.''
Somehow he failed to mention the decade he spent at Andover, Yale
and Harvard, where the mottos ranged from ``Finis origine pendet''
and ``Lux et veritas'' to the charmingly soigne ``Veritas.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he has enjoyed far more inherited wealth and privilege
than Gore has; he leads a party that opposes affirmative action
even as he benefited from the affirmative action given to
``legacies'' (the children of alumni) at Ivy League schools.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a measure of how much Gore has outwitted Bush that the
vice president was able to tar the Texas governor as a lightweight
frat boy with the line ``The presidency is more than a popularity
contest,'' while simultaneously stopping at nothing to best him in
that popularity contest. Gore's wife, daughters and least
Harvard-esque college roommate, Tommy Lee Jones, were all milked to
imbue Gore with the popular traits (warmth and testosterone) he was
thought to lack.
</P>
<P>
   Let Bush brag incessantly about his ``heart'' _ Gore one-upped
him by clasping his own heart Sammy Sosa-style. Even Bill Clinton
hadn't thought of that one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The measure of the Democrats' success last week can be seen in
Bush's angry cries that Gore is stirring up ``class warfare.''
Again, the vice president has faked him out. Gore is not an
authentic populist preaching class warfare _ he's an inauthentic
populist supported by corporate interests who hijacks populist
sloganeering to vilify a few focus-group-chosen industries that
most middle-class Americans understandably regard as ripoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows that Bush can't fight back on that turf. While
Democrats are indeed awash in insurance company money, drug company
money and even oil money (the Gore family portfolio holds a fat
chunk of Occidental Petroleum), the Bush-Cheney ticket and GOP
congressional leadership have taken in far more loot still from all
these sources, with worse prescription-drug plans, patients' bills
of rights and environmental records to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats are inauthentic fighters for the little man,
they are at least less inauthentic than the Republicans. This year
that's what makes a horse race, unless you're besotted by the idea
of casting a protest vote for Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, it must be noted that the two major tickets have
yielded one completely authentic candidate between them this year _
Dick Cheney. As a young future defense secretary who didn't oppose
the Vietnam War, Cheney nonetheless repeatedly sought deferments
from military service because, as he honestly has put it, ``I had
other priorities in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   And much as he preferred feathering his own nest to the
inconvenience of public service then, so he does three decades
later _ refusing so far to give up future oil-company stock options
worth at least $6 million at today's prices even though they pose a
conflict of interest with the vice presidency (and even though he
walks away with a consolation prize valued at an additional $30
million).
</P>
<P>
   In a political year in which everyone is suddenly on the side of
the people, the unabashed and unapologetic consistency of Cheney's
devotion to his own self-interest is downright refreshing. He's as
close as the casting agents at either party have come to producing
a rival to the cool corporate operator Richard Hatch, the
``Survivor'' anti-hero Americans love to hate.

WORLD RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO MEET AT THE UN TO PROMOTE PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For as long as human beings have organized themselves into
religious groups, those groups have found reasons to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have been fought in the name of many major faiths, and
there was even a series of wars in 16th-century France that are
known as the Wars of Religion.
</P>
<P>
   Over just the past 50 years, 27 million people have been killed
in armed conflicts of one form or another.
</P>
<P>
   And today, many conflicts throughout the world have religious
roots, including in the Balkans, Chechnya, the Middle East, and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But now an affiliate of the United Nations is trying to harness
the avowed commitment of religious leaders to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday at the United Nations, more than 1,000 religious
and spiritual leaders from about 100 countries will gather for four
days of meetings about combating war, poverty and environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope that the result will be a permanent relationship
between religious leaders and the United Nations so that religious
leaders can become a force for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this meeting of religious leaders distinctive is
it's an effort to also collaborate with the United Nations to see
how religious leaders can bring the power of their own spiritual
traditions to work with UN forces in the field to help reduce
conflict,'' said Anne F. Glauber, communications director for the
event, which organizers are calling the Millennium World Peace
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The event has thus far been overshadowed by criticism of
organizers' decision not to invite the Dalai Lama, the Nobel
Peace-prize winning Tibetan Buddhist, to the portion of the event
that takes place at the United Nations, for fear of offending the
Chinese delegation. The Dalai Lama instead is sending a delegation
of six high-ranking Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any effort of this kind you try to make progress, take
progress as you get it, and not hold out for the absolute best,''
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said this week. ``And I personally
believe that having a thousand religious leaders here next week
talking about peace, talking about our world, and praying for all
of us, and praying for peace is progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference has also been criticized by the Family Research
Council, a conservative Christian organization, for allegedly
excluding conservative voices from the United States, but
organizers reject that criticism, saying a broad swath of
Protestantism will be present.
</P>
<P>
   The summit will bring together parties with vastly different
interests, such as a chief rabbi from Israel and grand mufti from
Syria, and religious leaders from warring Eritrea and Ethiopia.
Attendees are also coming from the Balkans, Sierra Leone,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Rwanda and the Sudan, all current areas
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The religious leaders will not be negotiating political
disputes, but organizers hope they will form personal ties that can
help lead to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for religious and spiritual leaders because it
adds a note of realism to their endeavors,'' said David Little, a
professor at Harvard Divinity School who is advising the summit.
``Religious leaders often talk in the air about peace, but they
don't address with much concreteness the realities of how some of
their traditions have evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are circulating a proposed Declaration for World
Peace for religious leaders to sign that would state that the
leaders condemn the use of violence in the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
   And they are hoping that the summit will create a permanent
International Advisory Council of Religious and Spiritual Leaders
to advise the United Nations on regional crises.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more prominent attendees are Cardinal Francis Arinze
of Nigeria, a possible papal candidate, the secretary general of
the Baha'i community, the patriarch of Tendai Buddhism, the
faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation, the grand mufti of Bosnia, the
archbishop of Capetown and the patriarch of the Armenian Orthodox
Church. Among the Americans attending are the Rev. Jesse Jackson
and Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is funded by Ted Turner's UN Foundation and others.
It is a prelude to the UN Millennium Summit, expected to draw about
150 world leaders to UN headquarters from Sept. 6-8.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY.
 &HT;    Montana on fire
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ In rolling valleys surrounded by raw, angular
mountains, the last hay bales of summer are being hauled to barns.
Cornfields are ready for harvesting. Pine siskins and goldfinches
feast on ripened sunflowers. Sumacs are taking on the reds and
yellows of autumn.
</P>
<P>
   It is picturesque, a tourist's delight _ if you can see it.
</P>
<P>
   In almost any direction from Missoula in western Montana, grand
vistas of peaceful valleys and rugged mountains are dimmed, as they
have been for most of August, by thick, acrid smoke billowing from
more than 25 major wildfires. In their wake, the blazes have left
widespread forest destruction and human misery.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the relentless flames have charred nearly 650,000 acres
of Montana's forests and grasslands and destroyed more than 250
homes and barns. With the massive fires continuing to rage, state
and federal authorities in Montana have declared 19.6 million acres
_ an area roughly the size of Maine _ off limits for recreation.
</P>
<P>
   The end is not in sight, and that has dashed the once rosy
outlooks of entire communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town depends on tourists stopping here, but with so many
areas shut down to recreation, businesses here may not survive,''
said Forest Hayes, the mayor of Darby (pop. 940), 60 miles south of
Missoula. ``It's going to take a long time for this place to return
to normal; you get the feeling that the worst is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Darby is connected to several other small rural communities in
the scenic Bitterroot Valley by U.S. 93 out of Missoula. Along the
way _ in restaurants, stores, churches and, of course, along the
front lines _ folks talk of little else but fire.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is war.
</P>
<P>
   FIRE IS A FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   If any places were ripe for fires of epic proportions this
summer, they were the vast forests, brushlands and grasslands of
the American West.
</P>
<P>
   For years, massive amounts of combustible dead limbs, toppled
trees and logging debris _ what foresters call fuel _ had been
accumulating on the forest floors and had reached dangerous levels
in huge stretches of woodlands. In many forests, the deadwood stood
higher than six feet, a sure sign of unhealthy woods, forestry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the fuel-choked forests was that until the 1970s,
the U.S. Forest Service's policy was to extinguish all fires. A
public education campaign featuring Smokey the Bear in a park
ranger hat drummed into Americans a revulsion to wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists later realized that fire actually is a friend of
the forest. Occasional low-intensity fires that sweep through
woodlands remove deadwood and underbrush and return vital nutrients
to the soil without harming mature trees and other vegetation and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   When fires are suppressed and deadwood builds up to massive
levels, forest fires can become towering infernos, able to leap
from tree crown to tree crown with explosive speed, turning huge
swaths of forests into charcoal and threatening houses and entire
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, Forest Service scientists and other land
management agencies have tried to offset the deadly buildup of dead
trees and brush with deliberate ``prescribed'' burnings. They also
have altered their once strict fire-suppression policies to let
fires burn themselves out in wilderness areas if human habitation
is not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   But forestry experts say the effort has been too little and too
late. Just this month, critics were laying part of the blame for
the western fires on the Clinton Administration, saying the White
House had not acted quickly enough after being warned over the
years that there was a small window of opportunity _ perhaps a
decade _ before the forests became so inundated with fuel that
every fire could have catastrophic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 40 million to 60 million acres of federal forest _ nearly
all of it in the West _ are in dire need of thinning, forestry
officials say. And the drought has made the dead wood as dry and
dangerous as an open matchbook.
</P>
<P>
   Three good years of rainfall that spurred the growth of plants
were followed by a searing drought. This year's dry spring was
lethal. It dried out vegetation more quickly than usual, extending
the growing season, and also melted snow more rapidly, so that more
water than usual ran away in streams instead of soaking gradually
into the ground to keep vegetation green longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fuel here has only about 4 to 7 percent moisture; that's
about as dry as lumber dried in a kiln,'' said Keith Wooster, a
biologist with the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia who was
dispatched to the Ryan Gulch area 30 miles east of Missoula, Mont.,
to fight a major wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a smoky ridge overlooking a steep slope where the
Ryan Gulch fire roared nearby, Wooster pointed to a layer of dead
limbs, each about the diameter of a baseball bat. ``They are so dry
you could light them with a match,'' he said _ and then he had to
walk briskly to get away from the intense smoke and heat welling up
from the wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet away, his colleague, George Custer, a fire
protection expert with the Ocala National Forest in Florida, used a
drip torch to set a ``backfire.'' It would remove fuel from the
advancing wildfire; with nothing to burn, the wildfire would go
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least that's what we hope,'' Custer said. ``We're literally
fighting fire with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big wildfires were sparked by dry thunderstorms that
have produced much lightning and little rain. A few wild blazes
have been human-caused. No matter what triggers them, when the
cataclysmic fires get going, their ashes can be borne aloft and set
new fires as far as a half mile away.
</P>
<P>
   What complicates the firefighters' jobs is that the West is
adding population rapidly, creating what's called an
``urban/wildfire interface'' of houses, farms and ranchettes tucked
high among the trees. In such a setting, the highest priority for
firefighters is to protect the homes and other structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going into situations that, absent homes and property,
we wouldn't be putting firefigters into,'' said Steve Frye,
incident commander for the firefighting efforts in Montana's
Bitterroot Valley. He called the intense fires raging in the valley
``unprecedented,'' with veteran firefighters saying they have never
witnessed such ferocious fires, with flames shooting up 150 feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   Given the flames' unpredictability, protecting people and their
homes and barns and other structures may, even under good
conditions, require high-risk tactics. Critics say that if people
insist on living at the very edge of forests or in the woods
themselves, then they should not expect firefighters to endanger
themselves to protect dwellings so vulnerable to wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   One of the critics is Forest Hayes, the mayor of Darby and a
retired Forest Service district ranger. The Bitterroot Valley, he
says, has become a focal point in the national firefight because of
the sheer number of homes pressed up inside remote canyons and
under the canopy of the lodgepole pine forests that throughout
history have been the scene of dramatic forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire trucks have a hard time getting up to those houses,'' he
said as he stood in a park in Darby last week, updating residents
on the fires and offering words of comfort and advice to frightened
homeowners. ``And when they build, they leave debris and brush
right up to the very edge of their homes; that's inviting the fire
to come get you.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 285,000 acres have burned in the Bitterroot area
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 1.5 million acres in 11 western states have
succumbed to wildfire so far this summer, the most destruction from
wildfires in at least 50 years. Before the flames are finally
snuffed out, they will be the worst in more than a century, veteran
firefighers say.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30,000 firefighters are battling the blazes across the
region, with reinforcements from Canada, Australia and New Zealand,
as well as from the Army and Marines, who together have dispatched
three battalions. The government is spending at least $15 million a
day to stop the fires. Southwestern Montana is ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKED OUT OF HOMES
</P>
<P>
   ``Look into my eyes,'' Sally Johnson said as she pointed to her
reddened orbs this past week. ``They look as if I've been carousing
all night, but it's from all the smoke. Everyone around here has
bloodshot eyes, and we're also told that breathing the smoke is
equivalent to smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a retiree, lives with her daughter on about 20 acres
near Hamilton, 48 miles south of Missoula. The wildfires that are
ravaging western Montana forced them to evacuate their home this
month, but the Ravalli County Sherriff's Department allowed them to
return after they signed a liability waiver stating name, age and
next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fires are getting near again, and we may have to leave
once more,'' said Johnson, who had stopped at a U.S. Forest Service
information booth along Highway 93 to check on the status of the
blazes. ``It's tough staying in the house anyway; it's full of
smoke and ash from the fires, and you can't air it out because the
smoke never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Joan Giles, who own a small ranch near Hamilton, no
longer have a home. ``But I still have her,'' Carter Giles said as
he waved his arm towards Joan. ``That's what matters most.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing they saved after a wildfire destroyed their
home, barn, fences and outbuildings was a prized bull, a cow, a
calf and a few other animals.
</P>
<P>
   The animals are being housed in an emergency shelter at the
Ravalli County Fairgrounds in Hamilton. The Giles' temporary home
is a camper at the Anglers Roost RV Park on the Bitterroot River.
The park's owners, Ron and Joan Englund, are letting the Gileses
and others who have been burned out of their homes stay for free
the first week. The second week, the guests have to pay only for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once thought a lot of people around here were cheap; they
never wanted to spend a dime,'' said Gary Wiley, manager of the
fairgrounds. ``But after seeing so many of them helping out their
neighbors, I now regard them as frugal, not cheap. They are
generous when it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   MANAGEMENT TEAMS TO THE RESCUE
</P>
<P>
   When major fires, floods, hurricanes or other disasters occur,
the federal government sends in ``incident management teams'' to
protect people and property. Although the teams are composed of
civilian workers, they are organized along military lines, with a
commander and various officers under him in charge of logistics,
information, supplies, field work and other support.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 such teams are battling the Montana fires. Each
team has its own base camp _ ``tent cities'' of hundreds of workers
that spring up overnight, complete with sleeping areas, latrines,
shower facilities, kitchens, mess halls, weather stations, supply
depots, information centers and other facilities to support
firefighter crews trying to contain towering flames on the front
line.
</P>
<P>
   The team commander requests the number of crews needed to fight
the fires. The leader also can request helicopters to dump water on
the flames, bulldozers to cut fire lines and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you don't always get what you need,'' said Mike
Melton of Jackson, Miss., the Ryan Gulch team commander.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt gave firefighters a
blank check to draw on the national treasury for supplies, the
vastness of the fires has stretched available manpower and
firefighting equipment very thin across the West. ``Money can't buy
any more experienced fire crew bosses,'' said Melton, who at one
point was in charge of about 625 people battling the Ryan Gulch
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, however, that fire was more than 90 percent
contained, and Melton was releasing several crews to fight other
raging fires in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave here having done a job everyone can be proud of,''
Melton told his team members. ``Don't give up this thing. There's a
lot of work to do cleaning the land.''
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL EVENT BECOMES SOCIAL SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton in the Bitterroot Valley, the Renalli County Fair,
which is the main social event of the year, has been cancelled.
``The fair is supposed to be a time to celebrate, but right now a
lot of folks around here can't celebrate,'' said fairgrounds
manager Gary Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   The fairgrounds have been turned into a shelter for animals
belonging to residents who had to evacuate or lost their homes.
Last week, volunteers, including Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and 4-H
members, were caring for more than 600 horses, cows, llamas, sheep,
goats, chickens, dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   When Wiley sent out a request for food for the animals, people
responded in droves. Now the barns and storerooms at the
fairgrounds are groaning with animal feed. ``One rancher brought in
a bale of hay, all he had left,'' Wiley said. ``He said his cattle
had gotten badly burned from the fires, and he had to shoot every
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said there will be some kind of celebration later on,
``when we are finally through this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, people are struggling to get through. Air
levels in the usually clear Bitterroot Valley have reached
hazardous levels, prompting health officials to urge county school
leaders to consider school closings if polluted air persists.
American Red Cross nurses also are urging residents to wear face
masks to prevent breathing in the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But one small group was celebrating last week. Three regulars at
the Rocky Knob Lodge and Bar on U.S. 93 near Conner said their
homes were among eight on nearby Laird Creek Road that escaped the
fire. ``A helicopter with a big bucket hanging from it came and
dumped water on my house just when the fire was starting to get to
it,'' said Al Colyer, nursing a Budweiser at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road, crude, homemade signs thank firefighers for
saving their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But seven other houses along the road were destroyed. ``This
place here was at first reported as burned down,'' said Becky
Burkett, Rocky Knob's bartender. ``But here we are, wide open for
business and taking care of everybody.''

BOSTON COLLEGE BOOT CAMP BENEFITS ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's regularly described as academic boot camp _ boot camp with
a heart, boot camp leavened with tough love.
</P>
<P>
   It's boot camp for minority students, members of the incoming
Boston College Class of '04.
</P>
<P>
   The 47 ambitious, enthusiastic students who make up this group
are the latest incarnation of a program that has literally
transformed The Heights. In the 21 years since the inception of the
Options Through Education program, BC has gone from a virtually
lily-white university with a minority population of less than 1
percent to a vibrantly diverse institution that's 24 percent
students of color.
</P>
<P>
   Under the free OTE summer program, students with strong grades
but subpar standardized test scores spend six weeks on campus in an
intensive academic program to prepare them for the rigors of
freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   If summer school evokes images of sleeping late and sitting
through a couple of notably undemanding classes, think again. This
was 7 in the morning until 11 at night, intense coursework with
study halls and field trips. Bed check was at 2 a.m., and many
students studied right up to that moment. This was not for the
faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are typically kids with good grades and tough test
scores,'' said BC spokesman Jack Dunn. ``Some are kids who went to
schools that were not the best inner-city schools. But people saw
something in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The program costs the school $2.7 million a year, which Dunn
describes as ``the best investment we've made.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical day began with two hours of English, followed by an
hour of math, followed by more English, followed by contemporary
social issues. Mandatory study hall began at 6:30. Free time
finally began at 9:30 p.m. Most nights that meant they were free to
keep studying.
</P>
<P>
   For Drudys Nicolas, a Boston Latin graduate, and Juan De Jesus,
entering BC from Boston College High School, the program, which
concluded two weeks ago, furnished a perfect introduction to campus
life _ and they are products of good schools.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the academic discipline, OTE gives its participants a
ready-made peer group when classes start later this month, a
valuable aid in the transition to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge academically, but you know the
friendships you make during those six weeks are going to be
lifelong friendships,'' Nicolas said.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school called for group projects that demanded working
together and tested the limits of their new friendships. Under the
watchful eye of program coordinator Joanna Maynard _ ``our mom for
six weeks,'' as Nicolas put it _ no one dropped out, no one failed,
and the group emerged ready to start college.
</P>
<P>
   OTE's success comes at a time of considerable anxiety about
minority enrollment. While rollbacks of affirmative-action programs
have had little demonstrable effect on enrollment, keeping minority
students in school remains a challenge for colleges across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston College, OTE is prelude to a four-year program for
Asian, African-American, and Latino students intended to assist
them throughout their college careers. It has paid off with a
graduation rate of over 90 percent in the past eight years, nearly
double the national average of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes a house on campus where students can get
tutorial and other assistance, and a network of graduates who keep
tabs on how minority students are faring at BC. This fall, for the
first time, both the president and vice president of the student
body are African-American, which may say something about the
program's success in helping worthy students thrive on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are students who didn't meet the requirements on
paper,'' says Sheilah Shaw Horton, a BC administrator. ``If you
examine a transcript and look beyond what's on paper, and if you
give them the proper support they need _ support they didn't know
existed, because it didn't exist at their high schools _ you can
see them through to graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas is planning to study nursing, while De Jesus has his eye
on management school. Both believe this summer has laid the
foundation to go on, and to prove test scores are no measure of
being ready to succeed, or to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We formed a bond academically,'' De Jesus said. ``We feel like
we're ready to take on any challenge.''

   HONG KONG GREW 10.8 PERCENT IN QUARTER

<P>
   Hong Kong has extended its recovery, reporting that its economic
output grew 10.8 percent in the second quarter. The increase is
smaller than the 14.3 percent recorded in the first quarter, but
the government raised its forecast for full-year growth to 8.5
percent, from 6 percent. Some economists worry that Hong Kong
continues to be dogged by price deflation. And while the
territory's exports surged 17.7 percent _ fueled by the strong U.S.
economy _ domestic consumer spending rose by 5.2 percent.

Amoco to retain its 10 percent stake. Last year, Tyumen pushed
Sidanko's subsidiary into bankruptcy and bought it at a bargain

BABY SITTER SUES DOCTOR ACCUSED IN WIFE'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying she suffers from nightmares, the baby sitter who
was just a foot away from Dr. Richard Sharpe's estranged wife when
he allegedly gunned her down last month has filed a $5 million
lawsuit against the wealthy dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit describes how the terrified 19-year-old herded
Sharpe's two young children into a bathroom after the shooting and
placed them in the bathtub as she frantically dialed 911. While she
waited for police, she huddled by the bathroom door, listening for
Sharpe's footsteps, expecting she would be next.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Dormitzer's attorney, John J. Weltman of Boston, said
she has been ``a mess'' since the night of July 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has devastated her,'' he said. ``She's been really just
totally unable to function. She can't sleep, she can't work, she
can't even drive. Her mother has to take her everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's civil attorney, Julianne Balliro, did not return a call
Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In one of her nightmares, Dormitzer says she's following Sharpe
as he stalks a woman, powerless to help. In another, she's the
woman being hunted, desperately trying to put distance between
herself and Sharpe, a terrifying echo of the night Karen Sharpe was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Dormitzer, a college freshman from Newton, was so traumatized by
the shooting that she was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital
to be treated for shock, her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit is the second one filed against Sharpe in connection
with his wife's death. Two days after the shooting, attorney Jacob
M. Atwood filed a $100 million wrongful death suit on behalf of the
couple's children.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, police, and court records, Dormitzer
was baby sitting for the couple's son, Michael, 7, and daughter,
Alex, 5, on the night of July 14 when Karen Sharpe arrived home
just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Her estranged husband, who had allegedly abused her in the past,
then suddenly appeared at the door of the house in Gloucester, in
violation of a restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   She only had time to ask, ``What are you doing here? I think you
should leave,'' before Sharpe allegedly leveled a high-powered
rifle at her chest and fired.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Dormitzer reacted as ``every parent's dream
baby sitter,'' said Weltman.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing Sharpe would shoot her next because she witnessed the
crime, Dormitzer ran into an adjoining room, but not before
grabbing Michael and pulling him behind a couch to hide, according
to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, Michael jumped up and she grabbed him and pulled
him down,'' Weltman said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while dialing 911 on her cellular phone, Dormitzer took
the boy and his sister into a bathroom. She locked the door, put
the children in the bathtub, where they would be safer from flying
bullets, and then crawled over next to the door to listen in case
Sharpe was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``(She) remained there in fear for her life and the lives of the
children until the police arrived,'' the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, Dormitzer has suffered from nightmares,
headaches, stomach pain, and nausea, and is receiving both
psychiatric counseling and medication to help her deal with the
trauma, the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt that this heinous crime was a
significantly traumatic incident for Kristen Dormitzer that will
haunt her for the rest of her life,'' said one motion filed with
the suit. ``Ms. Dormitzer was close enough to this event that she
at times still smells the gun powder and burning flesh from the
high-powered round tearing through Karen Sharpe's body. Kristen
Dormitzer lived a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Raymond J.
Brassard approved Dormitzer's bid to attach $850,000 worth of
Richard Sharpe's real estate and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe ran a lucrative plastic surgery practice and holds
medical patents that may be valuable, according to sources close to
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dormitzer's suit and the earlier one filed on behalf of
Sharpe's children seek to attach his personal assets, two houses, a
Merrill Lynch investment account that reportedly contains more than
$1 million, and his stock in two companies, Clickmed Corp., an
Internet medical business, and LaseHair Inc., a cosmetic surgery
company.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, 45, fled briefly to New Hampshire after the shooting but
was arrested the next day. He is being held without bail on
first-degree murder charges.

EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON BUSH TAX CUT PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUSH-TAX)  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Ronald Reagan in 1980 has a Republican nominee's
promise of a sweeping tax cut played so dominant a role in the
presidential race. The New York Times asked a number of business
executives, scholars and politicians to assess Gov. George W.
Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   HENRY KAUFMAN, President of Henry Kaufman &AMP; Co., financial
management and consulting.
</P>
<P>
   I really believe that at this stage of our economic expansion,
where the economy continues to be very strong and has a high
utilization of labor resources as well as factory resources, he
should pursue a very conservative fiscal policy. And therefore
significant tax cuts should be postponed until the American economy
slows down significantly or falls into a business recession. Small
tax cuts here and there are all right, but significant tax cuts are
inappropriate for the current setting.
</P>
<P>
   I also believe that continued large reductions of the
government's debt would be most helpful in sustaining the very
favorable current climate in both the bond and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   You have to put this into two stages: the immediate impact on
the financial markets and the economy and the longer-term impact.
Major tax cuts over the very near term will be adverse to the
current favorable economic and market climate. Cuts over the longer
term can be phased in, but should only begin when the economy slows
down very sharply.
</P>
<P>
   RONALD BULLOCK, president of Bison Gear and Engineering Co., a
maker of electric gear motors.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is good to be giving money back to the people who
have paid for getting us to the balanced budget. From my vantage
point as a small-business owner, the last tax increase, in 1993,
the big increase that funded the budget surplus, has cut into the
amount that we have left to reinvest into the company. And
reinvestment creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not complaining that we have come as far as we have in
reducing the budget deficit and creating a surplus. I am not
begrudging the taxes that I have paid. But now maybe it is time to
free up some capital for additional investment. With interest rates
as high as they are, it would be good to offset this through a tax
reduction that allows us to retain more for investment.
</P>
<P>
   DEAN BAKER, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy
Research.
</P>
<P>
   It really makes no economic or social sense. From an economic
standpoint, it is not clear that we would want to stimulate the
economy at this point. But if we did, cutting taxes for wealthy
people, which is what Bush mainly proposes, would not be the way to
do it. There is very little argument for his tax cut in terms of
economic incentives, since much of it goes to reducing the marriage
tax and the inheritance tax, which barely change incentives at all.
</P>
<P>
   From a social standpoint, the vast majority of these cuts are
going to the wealthiest people, who have already prospered
tremendously in the last decade. If we want to be giving money to
anyone, we should be looking to give it to the working poor and to
middle-class workers, the vast majority of whom get very little
under this plan.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD SYLLA, professor of financial history at the Stern
School of Business, New York University.
</P>
<P>
   The projected budget surpluses are very large, so there is room
to have tax cuts of the magnitude he is proposing, as well as some
increases in public spending. Every penny does not have to go into
debt retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes a good point: People are saying, ``This is really
our money, not the government's money.'' That really resonates.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore will say the Bush cuts favor the rich, but to my mind it
is well known that the people at the upper income levels pay most
of the taxes, so any tax cut is going to seem to favor the rich. If
when the government needs more money you put it mainly on the rich,
eventually you find that the rich are paying most of the taxes. So
any cut will favor them.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD NELSEN, economics professor at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   I want to comment not so much on the details of the Bush tax
reduction plan as on aspects of the economic philosophy behind its
size. The sometimes implicit but often explicit theory is that
private spending at the margin is much more socially valuable than
public spending. Hence, the relaxation of the fiscal constraint
should be largely done through tax cuts and increased private
spending rather than by putting more funds into certain public
programs, although Bush has made defense an exception.
</P>
<P>
   But presently this society is not spending enough on schools to
prevent many of them from physically crumbling. Our airport space
and traffic control systems are greatly overstretched, causing
misery for American passengers. Many of our public parks are a
disgrace in terms of their maintenance. All of this is lost from
view and implicitly denied in a tax cut proposal that only sees
benefits from increased private spending, as the Bush proposal
does.
</P>
<P>
   SEN. PAUL WELLSTONE, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the old Yiddish proverb that you can't dance at two
weddings at the same time. When you look at the arithmetic, you
can't have these massive tax cuts and at the same time leave no
child behind. You can't do that and be a compassionate
conservative. If you're going to make an investment in the health,
skills, intellect and character of children in America, you can't
do it on a tin-cup budget. With the kind of tax cuts Bush wants,
there's nothing left. You can't have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   That was the great ideological victory of President Reagan. You
can argue that his tax cuts were regressive, but the real point was
that they so eroded the revenue base that they made any kind of
investment look fiscally irresponsible, which was probably what he
wanted and believed in. But that approach doesn't work for Governor
Bush, who wants to be seen as a compassionate conservative. He
can't live up to his own rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   SEN. CONNIE MACK, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan is a broad tax cut that gives tax reductions to
every income group in America. It does so through the reduction of
marginal tax rates, which we believe encourages savings and
investment. That's an economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, has specific, targeted tax cuts, which
basically say to people, ``If you act the way government wants you
to act, you will get to keep some of your money.'' I don't think
that's economic policy; it's a social engineering concept.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan has a very positive effect on job creation. Today
most small businesses pay taxes through individual income tax
rates. By reducing marginal individual rates, it reduces the burden
on small businesses. It would also increase savings for education
and increase investment in scientific research and the development
of new technology. It's new technology that will allow America to
remain the most competitive economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ALAN J. AUERBACH, economics professor at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, the Bush tax cut is not good economic policy,
because it's too massive. The revenue losses are quite substantial
and would grow over time. The current budget situation, although
certainly more favorable than it appeared a few years ago, is still
such that the short-run surpluses overstate the long-run fiscal
stance of the government. And we are overstating the short-run
surpluses to the extent they incorporate funds that shouldn't be
considered available or depend on questionable assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   While the on-budget surplus doesn't include the Social Security
surplus, it does include the Medicare and government retirement
programs, which, by the logic that leaves the Social Security
surplus off budget, also shouldn't be available for tax cuts or
spending. And among the surplus base lines made available by the
Congressional Budget Office, there isn't one that would keep
spending in line with the growth of the overall economy. All the
base lines assume a continuing decline in the share of GDP devoted
to domestic discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD F. SYRON, chairman and chief executive of Thermo
Electron Corp., instrument manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Gore or Bush proposal has laudable objectives. But
the first question you have to ask yourself is, ``What is broken in
the economy?'' If it is not broken, what are you doing? I would be
quite careful about fiscal stimulus from either the tax side or the
spending side. Most of our attention should be focused on paying
down the national debt, because we have far too low a personal
savings rate.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of my view will be that it's traditional
economics. My answer is that long-term productivity gains and
long-term growth come from investment. Investment has to be
financed from savings. Therefore, keeping personal savings as high
as possible is desirable.
</P>
<P>
   LAWRENCE KUDLOW, chief U.S. investment strategist at ING
Barings.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's tax-cutting plan will nurture Internet prosperity
by reducing personal tax rates, eliminating the estate tax,
ameliorating the marriage penalty and easing penalties on
successful low-end wage earners. It will also prevent Washington
from gobbling up the barrel of overflowing surpluses. The plan uses
only a quarter of the $4.6 trillion budget surpluses expected over
the next 10 years. It does not touch Social Security surpluses, and
leaves $700 billion for debt reduction and other priorities.
Positive economic incentive effects from reduced marginal tax rates
will push out the aggregate supply curve to more than absorb demand
increases without raising prices. No need for Fed tightening.
</P>
<P>
   EDWARD YARDENI, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   As a taxpayer, I love the concept. As an economist, I would
rather let the surpluses accumulate until we have paid off all of
the outstanding $3 trillion in publicly held U.S. federal debt.
Then we can revisit proposals for cutting taxes. Paying off the
debt will give many Americans an effective tax cut by lowering
mortgage-financing costs. I estimate the 10-year government bond
yield could fall to 4 percent by the middle of the decade if the
surpluses continue to accumulate as projected by the CBO. In this
scenario, fixed-rate 30-year mortgage yields could fall to 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As an economist, I also know that forecasting is hazardous work.
Legislating a huge multiyear tax cut now, based on projections of
the federal surplus, is questionable.

 &HT;    Mansion buying spree loses some momentum
 &HT;    By Sheryll Poe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The market for mansions may be softening, real
estate agents say.
</P>
<P>
   In June, 15 existing homes sold for more than $1 million, up
from 10 in June of last year, according to the latest numbers from
the Austin Board of Realtors and the Real Estate Center at Texas
A&AMP;M University. But in July, only seven sold.
</P>
<P>
   And there were more of them on the market than ever. In July
1999, there were 72 active listings of $1 million or more. That
number more than doubled this year to 156.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend _ if it is one _ is very recent. Through July, the
total of number of $1 million-plus properties sold was 73. For the
first six months of 1999, 23 mansions were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The recent fluctuations in the stock market and layoffs in tech
companies have contributed to the slide. According to local
economist and principal of Angelou Economic Advisors Inc., Angelos
Angelou, the growth of the dot com companies and the venture
capital that funded them have fueled the real estate market,
particularly in the million and above range. ``The recent problems
in the dot com world are going to inevitably cause a slowdown of
homes in those price ranges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, sellers anxious to cash in on the real estate
euphoria have simply priced themselves out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are putting million-dollar homes on the market
just based on hearing that people can get whatever they ask for,''
said real estate agen-- Bill Stanberry of Stanberry and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   There were 144 homes going for more than $1 million in June, up
from 74 last June. It takes more than a year to sell most of these
homes, which account for less than 1 percent of the local market.
</P>
<P>
   The softening is far from a slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a little enamored by that frenzy, especially in
that high-end market,'' said Kathleen Bucher, an agent with Re/Max
Heart of Texas Realtors. ``I don't think prices are reducing; it's
just affecting the multiple offers on million-dollar houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucher has five luxury homes on the market, including two
lake-front properties and a ranch in Giddings. The ranch, which is
50 miles east of Austin, includes an air strip, stables and 600
acres. It went on the market for $2.5 million more than six months
ago and is now offered at $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have sold 10 times over if it wasn't in Giddings,''
Bucher said. ``Most people don't need an air strip and 600 acres.''
</P>
<P>
   And with so many properties topping $1 million, buyers are
becoming more discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are questioning the value, whether it even is a real
value,'' Stanberry said. ``They're just not willing to write a
check for whatever it takes. They want to make sure it's worth what
they're paying for it.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ At 39, Veronica Gutierrez dreamed of
returning to school to study creative writing. But with two
children, a demanding boss and a daily 80-minute commute to the
closest public university, her options were limited. That is, until
she learned about a writing class offered by a local university
over the Internet. ``During the week, I connect after midnight to
do my homework,'' she says.
 &HT;    Thanks to the World Wide Web, Gutierrez can now enroll in a
spate of online classes. She's not the only one. With an estimated
130 million Latin American students between the ages of 6 and 24, a
host of e-schools, such as Edunexo.com, Contenidos.com and
Elsabio.com in Argentina and Universitario.net in Brazil, are now
targeting Latin America with their technology-based education
products and services.
 &HT;    Most of the Internet companies are financed by powerful U.S. and
Latin American investment funds that share the companies' optimism
for this niche market, which generates an estimated US$100 billion
a year in Latin America, according to a recent market study by
Contenido.com, the region's first education Web site.
 &HT;    Edunexo, for example, secured a $1 million round of financing
from a group of investors that included the Bank of America, a fund
managed by the founders of online brokers Patagon.com and the
auction site DeRemate.com. An initial public offering is planned
for sometime in 2001, according to Edunexo CEO Gabriel Sanchez
Zinny.
 &HT;    In its most recent venture, Edunexo.com signed an agreement with
Nebraska-based Class.com, a privately held company that provides
educational courses over the Internet for high-school students
throughout the world. The alliance allows English-speaking Latin
Americans to obtain a diploma from an accredited U.S. high school
for the first time without leaving the comfort of their homes.
 &HT;    ``The privilege of studying at a U.S. institution is no longer
limited to Latin America's elite,'' says Sanchez Zinny, a graduate
of Georgetown University. Instead of administrating classes,
Edunexo and most of the other educational Web sites serve as
brokers of the online classes that established foreign and local
educational institutions offer as an extension of their independent
study programs.
 &HT;    Edunexo seems to be the most aggressive of the region's
education sites. Since it was launched last February in Argentina,
it has opened offices in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the United States
and Spain. And through its pioneering alliance with Class.com,
which is associated with a University of Nebraska-run experimental
high school, Edunexo receives a near 50 percent cut from the
revenue generated by students who enroll via its site. Gutierrez,
for example, pays $70 a month to take her creative writing class.
 &HT;    Edunexo also serves as a clearinghouse for information about
scholarships, schedules for English-language proficiency tests, or
Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) exams, and courses
offered by various institutions. Also in the works is an e-commerce
site where educators and students can purchase a gamut of school
supplies ranging from textbooks to photocopiers.
 &HT;    Yet, unlike other fields being exploited for the first time by
the Internet, success in education requires much more than just an
aggressive business plan and sexy marketing. ``You need a track
record in the real world of education to open up doors,'' says
Diego Castrillo, general director of the 2-year-old Contenidos.com.
 &HT;    Many Web sites publicly profess their commitment to education,
but few offer 5,000 pages of free educational material as
Contenidos does. Its parent company, Programas Santa Clara, is a
pioneer of classroom audio-visual media in Argentina. Since 1994,
Santa Clara has provided four hours a day of free educational
programming to more than 12,000 private and public schools in
Argentina through a venture called Educable. Since the program is
subsidized by the country's cable industry, Educable accepts no
advertising. ``Contenidos was a natural outgrowth of the experience
we gained from Educable,'' says Castrillo.
 &HT;    Although Contenidos has been slower to expand into other markets
than its better-financed competitors, Castrillo is confident that
his firm will survive. He believes pan-regional sites won't be able
to offer the local flavor that users want. ``Local content
providers always have the upper hand. That's why a company as well
financed as StarMedia still can't generate more traffic in
Argentina than [Internet service provider and local Web portal
Ciudad Internet,'' he says. Instead of going it alone in the
region, Castrillo says Contenidos will create alliances with other
sites that share its educational philosophy.
 &HT;    Private-sector sites are not the only ones attacking the
educational niche. Educ.ar is the Argentine government's education
portal. It is being financed by an $11.2 million donation from
Internet entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, who was a high-school
student when his family fled Argentina's brutal military
dictatorship of the 1970s. In 1998, he founded Jazztel, a Spanish
telecommunications company that, even after the Nasdaq's April free
fall, still had a market capitalization of $2 billion.
 &HT;    Although Educ.ar won't be launched until Sept. 11 _ Teacher's
Day here _ its status as the government's official education site
entitles it to a number of competitive advantages. For example,
Educ.ar's home page will appear on personal computers financed
through a loan program sponsored by the state-run Banco Nacion.
 &HT;    Advertising on the site will help finance Educ.ar's other
objective _ connecting every primary and secondary school classroom
to the Internet by 2004. ``The aim is to add enough value for the
government so that Educ.ar can be privatized within two years and
the proceeds used to improve the educational system,'' says
Varsavsky.
 &HT;    In a world where achieving economic security is increasingly
dependent on a quality education, that goal is more important than
commercial success, says the 39-year-old philanthropist. ``Learning
to use the Internet will never replace learning how to read or
write,'' says Varsavsky, ``but it is becoming more and more a basic
tool needed to succeed in the global economy.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: BARAK WARNS OF `TRAGEDY' IF PEACE PACT NOT REACHED
</HEADLINE>
 By   JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak has warned of ``a
tragedy'' ahead for Israel and the Palestinians if they fail to
reach a peace agreement, and has hinted that he fears a return to
the Islamic terrorist attacks that killed scores of Israelis in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in Friday's editions of Yediot
Ahronot, Israel's most widely circulated newspaper, Barak said he
could not predict whether a peace pact could be reached with Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader. But he said whatever chance there
was of an agreement on Jerusalem and other contentious issues was
now up to Arafat showing ``flexibility and openness,'' which was
not forthcoming at the Camp David talks that foundered last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there will be an agreement, but I am sure
there should be one,'' Barak said. ``I am sure the alternative is
tragedy. It would not be appropriate to go into detail as to what
could happen later on.'' At another point, he noted that within the
past 18 months _ roughly the period since he campaigned for and won
Israel's May 1999 election on a pledge to push assertively for
peace with the Palestinians _ there had been no major terrorist
attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to mounting pressure from opposition parties for a new
election later this year or early next year, Barak said that, if
forced to go to the polls again, he would campaign on the peace
offer he made to Arafat at Camp David. That offer included
concessions on Jerusalem and other issues. A new opinion poll
published on Friday in Yediot Ahronot showed a continuing erosion
of public confidence in Barak, with only 33 percent rating his
performance as prime minister as ``good'' and 64 percent as ``not
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak predicted he would win an election, because most
Israelis know the potential consequences of abandoning the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israeli Parliament calls for new elections, as many
politicians expect, when it returns from its summer recess on Oct.
29, Barak said: ``I will go to the people to ask their trust in
continuing to steer the helm of the peace process, and I tell you
that this trust will be given, because we are now faced with
dramatic decisions. With a year and a half having passed without a
terror attack, whoever closes the road to an accord is taking a
heavy responsibility on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After Barak returned empty-handed from Camp David on July 25,
his government was in serious disarray. His ruling coalition had
already lost its parliamentary majority before he left for
Washington when two ultra-Orthodox parties quit the government in
disagreement over the peace process. His political position was
further weakened after his return, when Parliament rejected the
government's candidate for the Israeli presidency, the former prime
minister Shimon Peres, in favor of a little-known candidate, Moshe
Katsav, of the main opposition Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in the past week, Barak has gone on the political
offensive. First, he stunned his own Labor Party by announcing that
he planned a ``secular revolution'' that would strip the Jewish
religious establishment of legal powers and privileges accumulated
over Israel's 52-year history. On Wednesday, he challenged Likud to
join the ``march'' to a more secular state by forming a new
Labor-Likud government of national unity, similar to one that ruled
in the 1980s. He suggested that such a government could be formed
within ``a few weeks'' if the peace process, vigorously opposed by
Likud, falters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Barak appears to have found renewed confidence in his peace
proposals, even as the impasse with the Palestinians shows no sign
of easing. When he landed back in Tel Aviv from Camp David, he
described the concessions he had tentatively accepted in
Washington, including a limited Palestinian foothold in East
Jerusalem, as ``null and void'' because Arafat had rejected them
and demanded full Palestinian sovereignty over all of East
Jerusalem. But if this suggested that Barak was preparing to draw
back from the Camp David proposals, the interview with Yediot
Ahronot on Friday suggested the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami, the acting foreign minister, who was a key aide
to Barak at Camp David, told reporters on Friday in Jerusalem that
far from rejecting the proposals put forward by President Clinton
at Camp David, and tentatively accepted by Barak, Israel now wanted
the proposals codified in a ``collective paper.'' Such a document
would have to be agreed on by Israel and the Palestinians and set
out exactly what was proposed and what was rejected at Camp David.
``We must work on the basis of what was created at Camp David, and
not return to square one,'' Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The change did not appear to reflect any new confidence by Barak
that Arafat will accept the Camp David proposals, or any
modification that might be acceptable to Barak. After Camp David,
Arafat used a 20-nation tour of Europe, the Middle East and Asia to
round up support in the Arab and Muslim worlds for his refusal to
accept anything less than the return of all of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Although he failed to get backing for his plan to make a
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 _ even
from the Palestinians' closest allies like Egypt and Russia _
Arafat lined up fairly solid support for his position on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in the Palestinian press, Arafat, in his
diplomatic encounters since Camp David, has used strong invective
against the Israelis, and Barak in particular, accusing them of
``lies'' in depicting Arafat as the spoiler at Camp David _ a view
seemingly shared by Clinton, who said at the time that he had found
Barak more ``creative'' in seeking solutions. In the interview on
Friday, Barak hit back, saying that there was ``a great deal of
misunderstanding and lack of knowledge'' among Arabs, and in
particular Palestinians, over the most sensitive of all issues in
the conflicting claims for East Jerusalem _ Haram al Sharif, called
the Temple Mount by Jews.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the Temple Mount is the most sacred of all places, the
site, according to Jewish beliefs, of the first and second temples
destroyed by the Babylonians and Romans. Among Muslims, the site,
and its two Muslim shrines, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa
Mosque, are among the holiest of all Islamic sites. At Camp David,
Barak tentatively agreed to proposals that would have granted
religious sovereignty over the Mount to the Palestinians, but
retained Israeli political sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Barak complained that Arafat was distorting the issue
by suggesting that the Israeli position masked a desire to dig up
the foundations of the old temples, and to use the findings as a
grounds for usurping the Muslim claim. ``Arafat has created the
impression in the Arab world as if we were demanding sovereignty
over the Temple Mount in order to dig up the temple,'' Barak said.
``But we know the reverse: Our faith prevents us from digging
there. We want to ensure an arrangement where no one digs for the
temple, not even the Muslims.''

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ A los 39, Veronica Gutierrez sonaba
con volver a la escuela para estudiar redaccion. Pero con dos
hijos, un jefe exigente y un viaje diario de 80 minutos a la
universidad publica mas cercana, no tenia muchas opciones hasta que
se entero de una clase de redaccion ofrecida por una universidad
local en la Internet. ``Durante la semana, me conecto despues de la
medianoche para hacer la tarea,'' explica.
 &HT;    Gracias a la World Wide Web, Gutierrez ahora puede matricularse
en una gran variedad de clases en linea. No es la unica. Hay unos
130 millones de estudiantes latinoamericanos entre los 6 y los 24
anos, y una legion de escuelas electronicas, como Edunexo.com,
Contenidos.com y elsabio.com de Argentina, y Universitario.net de
Brasil, apuntan a Latinoamerica con productos y servicios de
educacion basados en la Web.
 &HT;    La mayor parte de las companias de Internet estan costeadas por
fondos de inversion de Estados Unidos y America Latina que
comparten el optimismo de las empresas por este mercado, que genera
unos US$100.000 millones al ano en America Latina, segun un
reciente estudio de mercadeo de Contenido.com, el primer website de
educacion de la region.
 &HT;    Edunexo, por ejemplo, consiguio US$1 millon en una ronda de
financiamiento de un grupo de inversionistas, entre ellos Bank of
America, un fondo administrado por los fundadores de los corredores
en linea Patagon.com y el website de subastas DeRemate.com. Se
planea salir a bolsa en el 2001, segun Gabriel Sanchez Zinny,
presidente ejecutivo de Edunexo.
 &HT;    En su proyecto mas reciente, Edunexo.com firmo un convenio con
Class.com, de Nebraska, una compania no cotizada en bolsa que
ofrece cursos en la Internet para estudiantes de secundaria en
distintas partes del mundo. La alianza permite a los
latinoamericanos que hablan ingles recibir un diploma de una
escuela secundaria norteamericana acreditada sin tener que salir de
casa.
 &HT;    ``El privilegio de estudiar en una institucion norteamericana ya
no esta limitado a la elite de America Latina,'' dice Sanchez
Zinny, graduado de Georgetown. En vez de administrar clases,
Edunexo y la mayoria de los websites de educacion son
intermediarios de las clases en linea que ofrecen escuelas locales
y extranjeras como extension de sus programas de estudio
independientes.
 &HT;    Edunexo parece ser el mas emprendedor de los websites de
educacion de la region. Desde que se lanzo en Argentina en febrero
de 1999, ha abierto oficinas en Brasil, Chile, Mexico, Estados
Unidos y Espana. Y a traves de su alianza con Class.com, asociada
con una secundaria experimental dirigida por la Universidad de
Nebraska, Edunexo recibe casi el 50 por ciento de los ingresos
generados por estudiantes que se matriculan a traves de su website.
Gutierrez paga US$70 al mes por sus clases de redaccion.
 &HT;    Edunexo tambien es un centro de informacion sobre becas,
cronogramas de pruebas de dominio del ingles, y cursos ofrecidos
por diversas instituciones. Tambien se prepara un website de
comercio electronico.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, a diferencia de otros campos explotados por primera
vez en la Internet, el exito en la educacion requiere mucho mas que
un ambicioso plan de negocios y un mercadeo atractivo. ``Se
necesita un historial en el mundo real de la educacion para abrir
puertas,'' dice Diego Castrillo, director general de
Contenidos.com, fundada hace dos anos.
 &HT;    Muchos websites declaran publicamente su compromiso con la
educacion, pero pocos ofrecen 5.000 paginas de materiales
educativos gratis como hace Contenidos. Su compania matriz,
Programas Santa Clara, es un pionero de los medios audiovisuales
para el aula en Argentina. Desde 1994, Santa Clara ha ofrecido
cuatro horas al dia de programas educativos gratis a mas de 12.000
escuelas privadas y publicas en Argentina a traves de una empresa
llamada Educable. Como el programa esta subsidiado por el sector
del cable del pais, Educable no acepta anuncios publicitarios.
``Contenidos fue un resultado natural de la experiencia que ganamos
con Educable,'' dice Castrillo.
 &HT;    Aunque Contenidos ha tardado mas en extenderse a otros mercados
que sus competidores, mejor financiados, Castrillo confia en que su
empresa sobrevivira. Piensa que los websites regionales no podran
ofrecer el sabor local que quieren los usuarios. ``Los proveedores
de contenido local siempre tienen la ventaja. Por eso es que una
compania tan bien financiada como StarMedia todavia puede generar
mas trafico en Argentina que [el proveedor de servicio de Internet
y portal de la Web local Ciudad Internet,'' senala. En vez de
trabajar sola en la region, Castrillo dice que Contenidos forjara
alianzas con otros websites que comparten su postura ante la
educacion.
 &HT;    Los websites del sector privado no son los unicos que saltan a
este nicho. Educ.ar es el portal de educacion del gobierno
argentino. Se costea con una donacion de US$11,2 millones del
empresario de la Internet Martin Varsavsky.
 &HT;    Aunque Educ.ar no se lanzara hasta el 11 de septiembre _ el Dia
del Maestro en Argentina _ su condicion de website oficial de
educacion del gobierno le otorga varias ventajas competitivas. Por
ejemplo, la pagina de bienvenida de Educ.ar aparecera en
computadoras personales financiadas a traves de un programa de
prestamos patrocinado por el estatal Banco Nacion.
 &HT;    Los anuncios publicitarios en el website costearan el otro
objetivo de Educ.ar: que toda clase desde el preescolar hasta el
grado 12 este conectada a la Internet en el 2004. ``El objetivo
consiste en generar suficientes ingresos a traves de la publicidad
para el gobierno con el fin de que Educ.ar se pueda privatizar en
dos anos. Las ganancias de la privatizacion se usarian para mejorar
el sistema de educacion,'' dice Varsavsky.
 &HT;    En un mundo donde la seguridad economica depende cada vez mas de
una educacion de calidad, esa meta es mas importante que el triunfo
comercial, dice el filantropo de 39 anos. ``Aprender a usar la
Internet nunca sustituira a aprender a leer y escribir,'' senala
Varsavsky, ``pero es cada vez mas una herramienta basica para
triunfar en la economia mundial.''

FORD AND ITS DEALERS LAUNCH CAR-BUYING WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Responding to a proliferation of Internet-based
businesses selling cars, the Ford Motor Co. and a council of its
4,200 Ford brand dealers announced Friday that they would set up
their own online retailer, FordDirect.com, to help customers find
Ford vehicles at fixed prices at dealerships nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise will start business next month in California,
where customers have shown the greatest interest in online
shopping, and then gradually expand to cover the entire country by
sometime next year, Ford said. Dealers selling other Ford brands _
Lincoln, Mercury, Volvo, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin
_ will be invited to join the business, but Ford brand dealers will
have 80 percent voting control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   By including every Ford dealer in the country, the new
enterprise will increase pressure on dealers to adopt fixed prices
or a narrow band of prices for all of their sales, instead of
subjecting customers to hours of negotiation. The prices posted on
FordDirect.com will be set by region based on demand, instead of
being the manufacturer's suggested retail price. The site will also
give dealers' invoice prices, except to customers whose zip codes
correspond to states that have banned the distribution of invoice
information after lobbying by dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dealers will be authorized to offer less than the fixed
price posted on FordDirect.com to buyers who contact them through
the service, so customers will still have an incentive to do some
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   FordDirect.com is a less ambitious business model than that of
some businesses not affiliated with automakers, like the car-buying
site installed at the top of Amazon.com's home page on Thursday by
Amazon and by Greenlight.com, a privately held company partly owned
by several car dealership chains. Unlike Amazon.com, for example,
the Ford site will not provide online appraisals of automobiles
that customers want to trade in.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors proposed last week to its dealers the creation of
an online retailing site that would allow buyers to compare the
specifications of GM cars to models from other manufacturers, and
even put buyers in touch with dealerships selling non-GM brands.
But FordDirect will do neither.
</P>
<P>
   Ford criticized Amazon and Greenlight on Wednesday, suggesting
that they were essentially operating as brokers and might violate
laws in some states that bar anyone except dealers from selling
cars. But FordDirect, like the Amazon and Greenlight venture, will
allow customers to choose options, receive a price quote and
arrange financing for a specific vehicle, while requiring customers
to complete the transaction either at a dealership or with
dealership employees who would bring the vehicle to their home.
Like Amazon and Greenlight, FordDirect will also allow customers to
put down a deposit on a vehicle, using their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Connor, Ford's vice president for the Ford brand division,
said that FordDirect.com was not involved in brokering cars because
it was an extension of the existing franchise relationship between
the automaker and its dealers. A broker is an intermediary between
a dealer and the final user of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Ortiz, Ford's executive director of consumer e-business,
said that the automaker and its dealers had studied regulations in
every state. FordDirect should meet every state's laws, he said,
but he acknowledged that a few state regulators might not agree.
``There may be a state or two that for some reason may not allow
FordDirect to operate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FordDirect will charge dealers a fee of $200 for each completed
sale, making it a direct competitor to companies like Amazon.com,
Greenlight.com and Autobytel.com, which also rely on payments from
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has a less elaborate Internet site designed to
steer customers to the Web sites of dealers with good records for
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   FordDirect will be unusual among online auto retailing sites in
that it will set prices regionally, rather than nationally. Ford
and its dealers will use daily computer data on all sales
nationwide, a resource not available to companies outside the auto
industry, to calculate the regional prices.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in Texas are not as willing as customers in snowy
Detroit to pay for four-wheel drive, and the regional pricing model
will reflect this with lower prices for four-wheel drive in places
like Texas, said Jerry Reynolds, a Ford dealer in Garland, Texas.
</P>

LIEBERMAN, GOING SOLO, ATTACKS BUSH'S TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-TAX, BUSH-TAX-EXPERTS) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAYMONT, Del. _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman accused Gov. George W.
Bush on Friday of distorting the Democrats' tax cut proposal,
saying it was time for ``an honest debate'' on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first solo campaign foray as Al Gore's running mate,
Lieberman sought to take advantage of the trouble Bush has had in
selling his tax cut plan, a central plank in his platform. He has
proposed an across-the-board tax cut totaling about $1.3 trillion
over the next decade, while the vice president has called for a
targeted $500 billion tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that Americans are not clamoring for tax
relief in a time of prosperity, Bush said this week that he had
done a poor job of explaining his plan. To that end, he appeared
Thursday in New Orleans with the Bechac family, an in-the-flesh
example who he said would save money under his plan, but not under
Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the couple could potentially save more money under
Gore's plan, though most of those savings would materialize only if
they took advantage of college and retirement savings programs Gore
has proposed. Appearing before 300 cheering supporters at a
community center here, Lieberman cited an article in Friday's Wall
Street Journal that contradicted Bush's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponents' problem is they can't explain away the facts,''
he said. ``I think it's good to have a debate on taxes, but it has
to be an honest debate that accurately tells the American people
what we would do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush said that he had to do a better job of explaining
his plan,'' Lieberman added. ``With all due respect, the problem
isn't explaining the plan. The problem is the plan itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, argued that the
two proposals were not comparable, because the Gore plan would
require families to set aside money in approved savings accounts
for retirement and college to reap most of the tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a significant step before you're even
eligible for Al Gore's tax relief,'' Bartlett said. ``The clear
difference here is under Gov. Bush's plan it's plain and simple.
You get a tax cut automatically and immediately. The Gore plan
requires lifestyle changes by the Bechac family.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's plan, he said, would benefit mainly
accountants and lawyers who he said would be needed to guide people
through its provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's remarks on Friday were the sharpest he has yet aimed
at the Republican ticket, as he feels his way into the vice
presidential nominee's traditional role as his party's attacker. He
has shown _ especially in his successful 1988 campaign to unseat
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Connecticut _ that he can be
relentless and effective on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats clearly see the tax issue as working to their
advantage, and not just because of Bush's sometimes garbled defense
of his plan. Cutting against the Republican orthodoxy that deep tax
cuts are both good policy and good politics, Gore and Lieberman
have repeatedly assailed the Bush plan as a threat to the nation's
economic health that would benefit mainly the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bechac makes about $40,000 a year as a teacher, and his
wife, Margaret, stays home in Mandeville, La., with their two
girls. Under Bush's proposals to award a $500-per-child tax credit
and cut the lowest bracket from 15 percent to 10 percent, their
federal income tax bill would drop to less than $500, a savings of
about $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   The Bechacs said they were saving for both college and
retirement. Under Gore's plan, they could put up to $2,000 a year
into approved savings accounts for those purposes _ which they have
likened to 401(k) or Roth individual retirement account plans _ and
save up to $2,300 on their tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying his new celebrity, Lieberman rode an Amtrak
train on Friday from Washington to Wilmington, near this former
steel mill town. He strode up and down the train's aisles, greeted
by smiles of recognition from riders who acknowledged that they
would not have known him a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, Lynn Imperiale of Nutley, N.J., explained that
she was talking on her cellular phone with her mother, Marie
Stefanelli, who is being treated for breast cancer. Lieberman took
the phone and told Stefanelli, ``I'm praying for you.''

GERMAN OFFICIAL PESSIMISTIC ABOUT FAR-RIGHT VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is pessimistic about
the eradication of rightist extremism in the east of Germany. It
will take a ``generation and a half,'' he said, to overcome the
wounds of an area that reminds him of his youth ``in the twilight
zone'' between democracy and authoritarian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Fischer said the anti-immigrant violence that
has become the chief focus of German political debate in the last
month is not confined to eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the postwar decades saw ``no development of
civil society'' in the east when it was under communist rule left
that area more vulnerable to neo-Nazism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember growing up in the 1950s and we were in this
twilight zone between democracy and the Nazi heritage,'' said the
foreign minister, who is from western Germany. ``And now I go to to
the east and I feel I am back in my youth. Not only the landscapes,
but also the minds. And so there is a potential for neo-Nazi ideas
among a small minority, but a very violent one.''
</P>
<P>
   A bomb in the western city of Duesseldorf that injured nine
immigrants, six of them Jews, and a spate of anti-immigrant slurs
or attacks in the east led Fischer to a much-noticed statement this
month in which he deplored German ``passivity'' in the face of
xenophobia. ``We need a reaction,'' he reiterated in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he saw a danger of rightist terrorist groups emerging,
a sort of ``Brown Army Faction'' that would parallel the Red Army
Faction of the 1970s, Fischer said such a possibility was being
watched ``very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, a leader of the Green Party and a man who
has made a long personal journey from anti-American protester in
the 1970s to staunch defender of Atlanticism today, said he was
divided about the idea of banning the rightist National Democratic
Party, which has been identified with violent extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am split,'' the minister said. ``I am a radical supporter of
free speech. But freedom of speech is one thing in America, and
another here in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that in the light of Germany's Nazi past, neo-Nazi
movements could not be viewed as they might be in another Western
country. Extra severity is needed, he said, as demonstrated by the
fact the selling of Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' is illegal here but not
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about whether banning the National Democratic Party was
appropriate, Fischer said there was evidence that the youth
organization of the party provided ``the organizational cells for
many of these violent acts.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Yes, I am split, but if the facts are
sufficient, then the ban must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government can recommend a ban, any decision would
ultimately be made by the Constitutional Court. Many analysts say
barring the party would merely force its supporters into other
rightist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Claus Leggewie, a political scientist close to the Greens, said:
``A ban is not good policy. It is ridiculous and would be
counterproductive. What is needed are vigils, demonstrations, by
hundreds of thousands of people, like those we had when the first
anti-immigrant attacks occurred in the early 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Germany seems to have grown used to the
occasional racist violence that unification has brought. Overcoming
the problem will take time, Fischer said. ``How long did it take to
close the wounds of the Civil War in America?'' he asked. ``Here we
certainly need one and a half generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister said he was appalled that some of the people
calling themselves German nationalists could identify with the Nazi
movement. ``Every German patriot must hate Hitler,'' he said. ``He
destroyed our country, destroyed our culture. Here in Berlin you
feel it. He destroyed the Jewish culture that had been very
important for our identity and history. He destroyed the German
minorities in Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's own family was among those German minorities _ the
millions of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe driven from their
homes after World War II. His family fled in 1946 from near
Budapest, where they had lived for two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Fischer suggested, Europe's wounds would be healed
by the unification of the continent. Comparing Europe's integration
with that of the United States, he said, ``We are passing the phase
of the Confederation and entering the period of the constitutional
process and federalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Either Europe will have a weak central body and a
confederation of independent states, and that will not work. Or we
will move ahead to a real European constitution and a new European
central body.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would be governed by the individual nations of the
European Union and what by the central body _ in effect, a European
government _ Fischer declined to give details, but said, ``Very
important parts of sovereign decisions should be transferred to the
central body.''

CLINTON TO VISIT MUBARAK IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   White House officials said Friday that President Clinton would
add a brief stop in Cairo, Egypt, to his Africa trip to discuss the
Middle East peace talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders will discuss the latest developments and ways to
encourage the negotiations, said the White House spokesman, Jake
Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrives in Abuja, Nigeria, on Saturday for a two-day
visit aimed at buttressing the country's fragile democracy. On
Monday, he flies to Tanzania to meet participants in the Burundi
peace negotiations being held in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
   The president had been scheduled to return briefly to Abuja on
Tuesday to refuel his plane, but officials on Friday added Cairo to
his itinerary because Mubarak will not be attending a meeting of
world leaders early next month at the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will use the U.N. session to meet with both Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton was eager to meet with Mubarak as
well to help jump-start the peace talks. The president spoke with
both Mubarak and Barak early Friday to discuss the Cairo meeting,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly juggling a variety of foreign policy challenges, Clinton
will travel to Colombia on Wednesday on a one-day trip to lend
support to the counternarcotics campaign started by President
Andres Pastrana.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At 10:13 a.m. Friday, investors in Emulex, a California company
that makes fiber-optic communications equipment, got some terrible
news.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News, a leading financial news service, reported that
the company's chief executive had resigned and that Emulex planned
to restate its earnings for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors rushed to shed their Emulex shares, and the stock
plunged from $103 to $45 in 15 minutes. The drop stripped more than
$2 billion from the company's market valuation before the Nasdaq
stock market halted trading in the stock about 10:30. The free fall
dragged down several stocks of companies in similar businesses and
even pulled down the broader Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones News Service, CBS.Marketwatch.com, the cable channel
CNBC and other financial news outlets soon joined Bloomberg in
reporting Emulex's woes, referring to a press release from the
company.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem. The story was not true, as investors
quickly learned, enabling Emulex to recover before the day was out.
The statement was the latest _ and most devastating _ in a string
of fake press releases and other hoaxes that are roiling the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   With trading volume soaring and longtime financial news
providers like Dow Jones competing furiously with newer Internet
services like CBS Marketwatch, business reporters have never faced
more pressure to put out stories fast. And with traders quick to
punish stocks of companies with bad news, the odds have never been
greater that a hoax will cause a stock to rise or fall, harming
investors caught in the cross currents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary thing to see something like this happen, because
what the hoaxers are doing is taking advantage of the intense
competition among the news agencies to get this thing out,'' said
David Callaway, executive editor of CBS Marketwatch.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents in New York and Los Angeles, along with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of
Securities Dealers and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, are
investigating the fake release. The apparent motive for the fraud
was to cause Emulex's stock to plunge, enabling someone to profit
by buying put options or selling the stock short. Put options rise
in value when a company's stock falls; short-selling is another way
to profit from price declines.
</P>
<P>
   Many more put options than usual were bought on Emulex on
Thursday and Friday, and a spokesman for the Chicago options
exchange said it was investigating who bought the puts. If caught,
the perpetrators might be forced to disgorge their profits and
could face criminal and civil fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Emulex shares regained nearly all their
losses after the company said that its business was stronger than
ever. They closed Friday at $105.75, down $7.31, on exceptionally
heavy trading of more than 11 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   But that bounce will be cold comfort for Emulex investors who
panicked and sold their shares Friday morning, or who had ``limit
orders'' to sell at some preset price, orders that were
automatically executed as the company's shares plummeted. The SEC
and NASD say that trades made Friday morning would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All transactions prior to the halt will stand,'' said Wayne
Lee, an NASD spokesman. So investors who sold their shares at the
wrong time have little chance of being made whole, although Lee
said investors could ask their brokers to share their losses.
Regulators said investors who lost money might also be able to
bring lawsuits against the perpetrators if they were caught.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the hoax appears to have been Internet Wire, a
Los Angeles service that distributes press releases to news
organizations and Web sites. At 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, just as the
financial markets were opening, Internet Wire put out a release
supposedly from Emulex that claimed the company was revising its
earnings for its quarter ended July 2 from a profit of 25 cents a
share to a loss of 15 cents a share ``due to compliance with
generally accepted accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The release stated that ``Net Earnings for fiscal 1998 and 1999
will also be revised,'' and some versions reported that Emulex
chief executive Paul Folino had resigned and that the SEC had begun
an investigation into Emulex's accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The release was automatically posted on some Web sites,
including the CBS Marketwatch site, and within a few minutes people
on the Emulex Yahoo message board began calling attention to it.
``EMLX SEC investigation SELLLLL,'' wrote someone calling himself
``charles-ptrs'' at 9:46 a.m. After others questioned whether the
release existed, ``mtnbrdr'' provided a hyperlink to the release.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Emulex stock, which had closed Thursday at $113.06,
steadily slid in the first minutes of trading Friday. By 10:13 it
had fallen to about $103, losing almost 10 percent of its value.
But Emulex stock is generally volatile, so the move did not garner
much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bloomberg sent headlines summarizing the apparent press
release to trading desks around the world, and the true rout began.
In three minutes, Emulex stock lost another $10, sliding close to
$90. Even without the Bloomberg headlines, that move would have
been big enough to attract the attention of other news
organizations, which closely monitor what stocks are rising and
falling.
</P>
<P>
   As CNBC, TheStreet.com and others geared up to produce their own
stories, Emulex kept falling. At 10:20, it touched $75. By 10:26,
it had fallen as low as $50. Each $10 slide erased $360 million
from retirement accounts, pension funds and Emulex employees'
savings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Emulex executives arriving at the company's
offices at 7 a.m. Pacific time were perplexed by the decline in the
company's stock, said Kirk Roller, Emulex senior vice president.
``I walked in, my administrative assistant immediately said to me,
`the stock's down 45 points,' '' Roller said. ``By the time I got
to Paul, the stock was down 68.''
</P>
<P>
   Folino, Emulex's chief executive, and Roller immediately asked
the NASD to halt trading in the company's stock. The NASD soon did,
but the damage had been done, and news organizations, including
TheStreet.com, which has a joint venture with The New York Times,
continued to report on the fake release until nearly 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Winkler, Bloomberg's editor &UR;  &LR; in &UR;  &LR; chief, said Bloomberg
had been right to report on the news release, especially since
Emulex stock was already dropping. But Winkler said he was
disappointed in his organization's reporting of the story.
Bloomberg should have clearly explained that it had been unable to
confirm the release or get a comment from the company, he said.
Instead, the service simply rewrote the release as fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not the critical thinking and judgment and scrutiny
that should have been applied as far as I'm concerned,'' Winkler
said. ``The way it was handled was not up to the standards that we
normally apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Stine, managing editor of Dow Jones News Service, said
financial wires were extremely competitive because the traders they
serve could make big profits if they got news even a few minutes
before their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does everyone want to be first? Yes,'' Stine said. As a
result, Dow Jones will generally use information from press release
wires like PR Newswire and Internet Wire without checking directly
with the companies mentioned in the releases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Internet Wire, which was founded only six
years ago, is the smallest of the three major press release wires,
trailing PR Newswire and Businesswire, much older organizations.
Dave Armon, senior vice president at PR Newswire, said his company
had much stricter procedures to verify press releases than Internet
Wire, including always checking releases with the companies that
supposedly had put them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a Web site where you can put in a credit card
number, type up a news release, and watch the news pop up,'' Armon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emulex said Internet Wire never contacted the company to ensure
the release was real. But Michael Terpin, chairman of Internet
Wire, said his organization had fallen victim to a ``sophisticated
fraud.'' The people behind the fraud ``were successful in
convincing somebody from the nighttime shift that they had
authorization from the daytime shift,'' Terpin said. ``They
obviously had some kind of familiarity with our policies and
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Terpin said the other wires had also been fooled into carrying
fake releases. ``We have 135 employees,'' he said. ``We're not a
little fly-by-night company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, fake press releases have moved the stocks
of Lucent Technologies and Pairgain, other high-technology
companies. Lucent fell after a fake report said its earnings would
be less than expected, while Pairgain jumped on a false report that
it would be taken over. Gary Dale Hoke, a former Pairgain employee,
was convicted of fraud in that case, while a Texas man has been
charged with the Lucent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of those hit as hard as the Emulex hoax, which was
reminiscent of the actual restatement of earnings from software
company MicroStrategy Inc. MicroStrategy, which traded as high as
313 before the March restatement, closed Friday at $26.88, giving
investors a lesson of the potential for losses that can occur when
a high-tech company has accounting problems.

GORE AND BUSH, IN FLORIDA, FOCUS ON FRIENDLY CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related story, BUSH-LATIN-AMERICA) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It seemed a long way to travel to preach to the choir.
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush both courted Florida
voters this week, but spoke mostly to the already converted.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his party's usual pilgrimage to the retirement
condominiums of Broward County north of Miami, a loyal Democratic
base, where he spoke about protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got goose bumps,'' said Renee Kugler, 66, of Tamarac, at
Gore's talk on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor campaigning in the state where his
brother Jeb Bush is in his first term as governor, met Friday with
a largely Cuban-American audience in Miami, a long-devoted
Republican constituency. He challenged Fidel Castro to embrace
democracy and got a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been five minutes during the Democratic
National Convention when I stopped to think about how well things
are going,'' said Heidi Marcelo, a 20-year-old Cuban-American, at
Bush's talk Friday morning at Florida International University.
``Now I've gone right back to Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   As campaign stops go, for both men, it was the equivalent of an
overstuffed armchair, soft, familiar and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But far back in the audience at Bush's speech, Jorge Herrera
wondered why a candidate would court votes he already has instead
of trying to change other voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, who is in a minority among Cuban-Americans, plans to
vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs to come here,'' said Herrera, 19, who studies
political science at Florida International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a middle class family, and Gore seems to suit my
needs more,'' he said. Other young Cuban-Americans might side with
him if they saw Gore in person, Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
   He came to hear Bush with an open mind, willing to be swayed,
said Herrera, who lives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``all Bush talked about today were the things that
people here wanted to hear,'' such as continued sanctions against
Cuba, and expanded trade elsewhere in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not seek votes in Little Havana. Bush did not court the
condo vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not reach out to black Miamians, almost a forgotten
constituency in Miami. But then, neither did Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore is already pretty solid with the black community down
here,'' said Garth Reeves, publisher emeritus of The Miami Times, a
newspaper devoted to black readers. ``We're a little afraid of
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the middle said they heard or saw little to sway them
in the newspapers or on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore doesn't talk about anything interesting,'' said Fred
Truby, a 37-year-old fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations. ``Who
is he? He's a Southern boy, but he's a senator's son. He went to
Vietnam for the war, but he didn't fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really upset about Bush,'' said Truby, who lives in South
Miami. ``While his dad was president, he was just a party boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, neither candidate seemed to care about that sliver of
undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where a large part of the population was Republican to
begin with and incensed by the Clinton administration's handling of
the Elian Gonzalez custody battle, Bush was welcomed as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not mention Elian Gonzalez; he did not have to. Many
players in the saga _ including Ramon Saul Sanchez, who organized
street protests _ were in the audience and are already in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's much-talked-about break from Clinton on the Elian
Gonzalez case _ saying that he thought a family court should decide
the matter _ has been largely dismissed and even ridiculed here as
a political gesture.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of dwelling on that issue, Bush tersely denounced
Castro and promised to resurrect free-trade negotiations with Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been more verbal about the situation in Cuba,''
said Alex Acosta, 18, who studies international relations at
Florida International. But he considers himself a strong Bush
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican rallies at Florida International have, like the
Democratic rallies at the condos, become a political tradition.
Bush's father and brother kicked off their Florida campaigns here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a supporter of his father and his brother, and he will
have my vote as well,'' said Scherry Jenkins, a member of the
Republican Women's Club of Coconut Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, had that same warm reception, if not more so, in what
people refer to here as the condo canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Kugler said she was willing to consider Bush, but she quickly
dismissed him after seeing recent news coverage of him. He just
seemed fake, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like Bush,'' said Kugler, who moved to South
Florida 28 years ago. ``He has this look on his face, this smirk.
He just doesn't cut it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, by contrast, ``oozes with compassion,'' Kugler said.
And Gore is tightly bound to them by his political promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescription drugs are a big burden for us,'' Kugler said of
the older residents of the condos. ``He's trying to make it
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Lil Kaufman, who lives in the Kings Point condo in Tamarac, said
there were some ``undecideds'' among the older residents going into
Gore's visit, but ``I think they're decided now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not that Gore pulled huge numbers to him on this trip,
but cemented the cracks in his support, older residents here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a tough one for Gore,'' said J.P. Monroe, a
political science professor at the University of Miami. ``This
state is leaning Bush.''

IN SPEECH, BUSH SETS GOAL OF FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH LATIN
NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUSH-LATIN-AMERICA)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech on
United States policy in Latin America that was delivered on Friday
by Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, at
Florida International University in Miami, as released by the
Bush-Cheney campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Should I become president, I will look south, not as an
afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment of my presidency.
Just as we ended the great divide between East and West, so today
we can overcome the North-South divide.
</P>
<P>
   This begins with a renewed commitment to democracy and freedom
in this hemisphere _ because human freedom, in the long run, is our
best weapon against poverty, disease and tyranny. ...
</P>
<P>
   The United States is destined to have a ``special relationship''
with Mexico, as clear and strong as we have had with Canada and
Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, we have had no closer friends and allies. And with
Canada, our partner in NATO and NAFTA, we share, not just a border,
but a bond of good will. Our ties of history and heritage with
Mexico are just as deep. Differences are inevitable between us. But
they will be differences among family, not between rivals.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen that bond, our two countries need a meeting at the
highest level, shortly after the American election _ even before
the new presidents of our nations are inaugurated. Should I be
elected, I will use that November summit to keep Mexican-American
relations moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   We must talk about the availability and cleanliness of water on
both sides of the border, about opening the promise of NAFTA to
small businesses and entrepreneurs, about economic development in
areas of Mexico that send illegal immigrants to this country, about
improving health and criminal justice in both nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is an emerging success story. Yet elsewhere in this
hemisphere, democracy is still on trial _ threatened by the false
prophets of populism.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to working closely with the nations of this
hemisphere but recognize that they cannot be bullied into progress.
We will treat all Americans _ North, Central and South _ with
dignity. I will improve our bilateral relations and work with the
Organization of American States to confront the problems of our
hemisphere. ...
</P>
<P>
   The future of this hemisphere lies with the creation of millions
of small businesses among the poor _ the surest path out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But the poor in Latin America often have no access to small
amounts of working capital _ to credit cards or bank loans _ that
would help them buy something as simple as an oven to bake and sell
bread. So I support what are called ``microloans'' _ small,
no-collateral loans allowing the poor to build a business and
employ their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   As president, I will ask Congress for $100 million dollars to
help microcredit organizations that are working in Latin America.
And I will ask the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank
to add to this investment. We will apply the power of markets to
the needs of the poor. We can also use the power of debt reduction
to relieve poverty and protect the resources that sustain life in
the Americas. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the United States cannot offer new trade with the nations of
Latin America, they will find it elsewhere _ as they are doing
already in new agreements with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Mexico signed a trade agreement with the
Europeans, while Canada has a new trade pact with Chile. All of
this while, in Washington, time has been lost. European businesses
and consumers are benefiting _ ours are not.
</P>
<P>
   I don't fault our European friends for making these deals. We
dropped the ball, and they're running with it.
</P>
<P>
   But we must get back into the game, and here is how I propose to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   First, I will secure fast-track authority _ the ability to pass
or reject trade agreements without amendment. Without it, as we
have seen, America is slow to move, and other nations are unwilling
to negotiate with us seriously. When the next president sits at the
Americas Summit in Quebec next April, other nations must know that
fast-track trade authority is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal will be free-trade agreements with all the nations of
Latin America. We can do so in cooperation with our NAFTA partners.
We should do so with Chile, and Brazil and Argentina, the anchor
states of MERCOSUR. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America,
with such vast economic potential, and our relations must reflect
this.
</P>
<P>
   We will also work toward free trade with the smaller nations of
Central America and the Caribbean. We must be flexible because
one-size-fits-all negotiations are not always the answer. But the
ultimate goal will remain constant _ free trade from northernmost
Canada to the tip of Cape Horn.
</P>

   CALIFORNIA CO. VICTIM OF PHONY PRESS RELEASE
</P>
<P>
   A phony press release sent over financial news wires set off a
60 percent decline in the shares of Emulex, a California company

   DOW JUMPS NINE POINTS, TO 11,292.63

   Stocks were mixed after new economic data suggested that the
Federal Reserve Board may not have to raise interest rates further.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.89 points, to 11,292.63.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.85 points, to

FRAGILE RECOVERY FOR VILLAGE OF SPAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHARON SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The ghost town of the white elephants.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way many old-timers here still think of this
historic mineral-spring village. For decades its gingerbready,
abandoned Victorian resort hotels perfectly demonstrated the
triumph of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics: Disorder
always increases. Porches inevitably sag. Roofs must collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, to boast that Sharon Springs has undergone a
miraculous rebirth is way premature.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the situation: The moldering wood-frame hotels have
ceased flaring like Ronsons from the torches of firebugs. The din
and sawdust of restoration are everywhere. The most threatened
hotels and guest houses are being renovated. Eager tourists are
arriving to seek out shabby chic amid the phosphorescence of decay.
Spas, mineral baths and curative waters have a select new
generation of acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   And it must be acknowledged: There is now cappuccino. There are
focaccia sandwiches. There is chilled curried ginger carrot soup.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mohawk Valley and Leatherstocking domains, the revival of
Sharon Springs ``is representative of what's happening all over the
region, but the village was so far down that the effort is all the
more impressive,'' said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal
Art Society of New York City. He has spent every summer near Sharon
Springs since boyhood and has observed the nascent renaissance with
surprise, and delight.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. James L. Seward, who represents Sharon Springs, said:
``There are many such efforts by revitalization groups in a lot of
towns in this region, but the turnaround in Sharon Springs is more
dramatic than anywhere in my district. These people are making
believers out of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, said Dawne Belloise, ``at least 80
percent of Main Street was condemned.'' Belloise, a Coloradan who
first saw the crumbling five-block main drag in 1990, was so
charmed by ``this eerie village,'' as she put it, that she moved to
Main Street and now, to her astonishment, she finds herself working
``100 hours a day'' restoring a ruined grande dame, the 130-room,
150-year-old Roseboro Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The improbable comeback of this profoundly neglected village in
an economically stressed region was not sanctioned by a penny of
government money at the start. Nor was it underwritten by
millionaire benefactors. ``It came right up from the ground, a
grass-roots effort by a group of individual people making
individual decisions,'' Barwick said. ``And it could reach critical
mass.''
</P>
<P>
   The viability of this revival is related to such variables as
the prevailing economy, the uninterrupted supply of affluent,
educated second-homers from New York City (three and a half hours
away) and Columbia County (two hours away) and new cyberworkers in
the area, and the exponential growth of a new travel phenomenon,
heritage tourism: the quest for things historic by well-heeled
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   There is history all right, in abundance. Sharon Springs _ which
had its first guest lodging in 1825 and has a current year-round
population of 550 _ once drew 10,000 resort visitors in the
summertime. In the mid-19th century, Vanderbilts and Roosevelts
arrived with Adirondacks of baggage. President Ulysses S. Grant
visited the village's Pavilion Hotel to take the waters. Oscar
Wilde led porch-side readings.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fickle rich abandoned the village for Saratoga Springs.
But members of the wealthy Jewish elite were snubbed there, so they
made Sharon Springs a high-end refuge of their own. Ultimately the
village became a magnet for middle-class Jews. Sharon Springs was
known for its magnesium water, iron-rich water, sulphur water and
``bluestone'' water for healing the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Sharon Springs got a second wind from the
West German government, which paid medical-care reparations to
Holocaust survivors, holding that therapeutic spa vacations were a
legitimate part of the medical package. Many hotel guests had
tattoos on their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was flourishing when I was there,'' said Ed Koch, former
mayor of New York City, who in the summer of 1946, at the age of
22, was a busboy in the Adler Hotel. ``But I couldn't enjoy the
mineral springs, because I was a slavey.''
</P>
<P>
   Barwick remembers ``streets awash with Satmars'' and ``70 women
on the Roseboro porch, all playing cards.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1960s the resort hotels were dying or dead, victims
of turnpike motels, cheap jet fares and a restless new generation
of tourists. Driving through on his way to Albany, Seward, who
lives half an hour from Sharon Springs, remembered that ``there
were times when you wouldn't see a living person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eerie scene,'' he said, ``with these magnificent
structures. The phrase `ghost town' would come to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The most imposing white elephant that survives in the village
was the disintegrating four-story Roseboro, which started life in
the 1830s as a residence, began welcoming guests in 1850 and kept
expanding until 1915. Until recently the collapsing structure was a
time capsule, with calendars on the wall from 1968 (the year it
closed).
</P>
<P>
   Its would-be saviors are Belloise and her partner, Dennis
Giacomo, now both 48, who were on vacation looking for property
near Cooperstown 20 miles away and were ``sucked in by Sharon
Springs the second we saw it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They bought an 1859 Italianate house on Main Street for $25,000
in 1992 and have been renovating it ever since. Giacomo, an
executive recruiter for Dennis Allen Inc., a specialist in
insurance-industry management, was able to move in ``because I'm in
a fax-and-phone business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor invited Belloise to be on the planning board, and
within a year she was heading it. Then she reinvented the inactive
Sharon Springs Chamber of Commerce. Soon Belloise, an overachiever,
became president of the Sharon Historical Society, and she and
Giacomo founded a free concert-and-theater series that since 1994
has drawn about 500 people to Main Street every Wednesday in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
   Belloise also led a successful 1996 application to list the 177
structures in the village on the National Register of Historic
Places as a mineral resort.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Doug Plummer, a former actor and caterer for Glorious
Food in New York City, and Garth Roberts, a pianist and
musical-theater director, were so taken with the area that they
bought a vacation house near Sharon Springs in the early '90s, and
then moved there permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to make a living, and eyeing the village's
defunct greasy spoon, they opened the Rockville Cafe and Bakery in
1993 on Main Street. Before long it became the local hangout for
townies, farmers and new residents, many of whom became the nucleus
for the rebirth of the village.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the collapsing Roseboro might be demolished or
succumb to firebugs, Belloise and Giacomo tried to find a buyer. No
luck. To their horror, they found themselves offering the owners a
low bid of $20,000, ``knowing they'd turn it down,'' said Belloise,
but ultimately it was accepted. ``We had a stiff drink. The reality
was that we thought we'd just committed ourselves to a $3 million
project, when we had maybe $30,000 to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, so far they have spent $250,000, by dipping into
savings, selling off properties and getting second mortgages on
everything in sight. Now they have a $150,000 line of credit from
the Bank of Richmondville, a local institution.
</P>
<P>
   Their ultimate goal is to open the Roseboro as a hotel, but in
the interim they have sufficiently refurbished the lobby, the
parlor and the men's prayer room (now the kitchen) to accept their
first banquet booking, a wedding on Sept. 23, ``the first in the
hotel in at least 40 years,'' Belloise said.
</P>
<P>
   Up Main Street, Plummer, 40, and Roberts, 39, are bringing back
a smaller white elephant, the stately American Hotel, an 1847 Greek
Revival structure with 26 rooms that closed in the 1950s. They
bought it for $18,000 ``and if you like decay,'' Plummer said,
``it's quite something.'' Mushrooms sprouted from timber supports.
On the second floor there were dead raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   Adding up their savings, loans from parents and friends, and a
crucial low-interest loan from the Mohawk Valley Economic
Development District, they have amassed $400,000 to save the
American. They and their contractors are toiling to open nine guest
rooms, a bar and a dining room by next April.
</P>
<P>
   Locals were startled by the energy of the newcomers. ``I
couldn't fathom the idea of these people getting in so much trouble
over an old hotel,'' said Omer Cousineau, 65, a letter carrier in
Sharon Springs for 30 years. ``You know, other people tried to
bring them back before, and failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, ``a lot of the older people around here were
opposed to change,'' said Henrietta McFee, 77, who has lived in
Sharon Springs since 1961. The new revivalists struggled for three
years to change the village zoning so that hotels, restaurants and
bars could legally operate once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I thought it was all over here,'' said
Richard Brustman, 58, who has witnessed the death and rebirth of
the town since 1945, when his family ran a hotel, the Brustman
House, on Union Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town was resigned to its fate, but Dawne wouldn't let
people give up,'' he said of Belloise.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ball got rolling, Seward helped the town get a $25,000
state grant to develop a park on Main Street; the New York State
Council for the Humanities kicked in $11,000 to install 20
permanent walking-tour plaques on Main Street. And Belloise, a Web
designer, created and paid for the village's elaborate site,
www.sharonsprings.com.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the nucleus of regenerators kept growing. Maureen
Iseman-Broeking, a model and actress and a friend of Plummer,
bought a house on Main Street and is now a local yoga and dance
teacher and village trustee. Clyde and Pat McLean drove to a garage
sale in Sharon Springs and wound up buying not only the garage, but
the house.
</P>
<P>
   They allow themselves to think that it will all work out.
``What's happened is great, but it could all disappear so easily,''
Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   The restorers, most of whom are not Jewish, keep toiling away,
trying to make Sharon Springs new again while retaining such
artifacts as the ritual mezuzas on the door frames and other traces
of the lost world. So what are all these gentiles doing restoring
these Jewish hotels?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were chosen,'' said Plummer with a laugh, adding: ``No,
really, we have a feeling that the hotels picked us. We believe
these are living entities. That's the only way to explain why they
survived so much adversity and neglect.''

 &HT;    `Art of War' makes casualty out of Snipes
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - ``The Art of War `` takes its lofty title from an
ancient handbook of military strategy by Asian general Sun Tsu, who
believed that wars can be won without ever having to actually
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Snipes, in contrast, prefers a more hands-on approach.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran action star ably demonstrates his martial arts and
weapons skills in the mundane thriller from Canadian director
Christian Duguay. The film features a handful of bracing chase
scenes and fight sequences, but they fail to prop up an
insubstantial plot.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes carries the big-budget B-movie with sheer charisma, but
he deserves better material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of War,'' which was not screened for critics, casts
Snipes as Neil Shaw, a deeply classified government agent. In the
dated prologue, set in Hong Kong on the eve of the new millennium,
Shaw performs a high-tech theft of Chinese military secrets and
battles an army of thugs before parachuting off a skyscraper under
heavy machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   The murky, convoluted story involves an impending Chinese trade
agreement with the United Nations. Before the treaty can be signed,
the Chinese ambassador is murdered at a U.N. banquet in New York.
Shaw, who officially doesn't exist, is framed as the assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw goes underground to clear his name. In keeping with genre
conventions, he enlists the aid of a beautiful U.N. translator,
Julia (Marie Matiko), who believes his innocence, and plays
cat-and-mouse with wily FBI agent Cappella (Maury Chaykin).
</P>
<P>
   His apparent foe is Asian business mogul David Chan
(Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), described as the Donald Trump of Hong Kong,
who has ties to the Chinese mob.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic intrigue runs much deeper, but most folks will
probably have it figured out well before the end of the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Other players include U.N. Secretary General Douglas Thomas
(Donald Sutherland), U.N. chief of security Eleanor Hooks (Anne
Archer) and Shaw's partner, Bly (Michael Biehn).
</P>
<P>
   The wobbly plotting merely marks time between action sequences.
The screenplay by Wayne Beach, who also wrote the similarly styled
Snipes vehicle, ``Murder at 1600,'' and newcomer Simon Davis Barry
is riddled with preposterous twists and coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   Former cinematographer Duguay, who previously directed
``Screamers'' and ``The Assignment,'' devotes his interest to the
violent set pieces, leaving the rest of the film to languish. His
pacing is erratic and the editing is choppy.
</P>
<P>
   Chaykin (''Entrapment'') provides what little humor the movie
can muster.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's escape from an FBI van is lifted nearly wholesale from
``The Fugitive.'' The derivative finale features a John Woo-style
two-gun standoff and ``Matrix''-like bullet trails.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who served as executive producer, sprints gun-in-hand
through overly familiar territory. He's battled political
corruption in ``Murder at 1600,'' played an innocent man on the run
in U.S. Marshals and been immersed in international intrigue in
``Rising Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also done much more involving and challenging work. ``The
Art of War'' is a rote, sloppy thriller that goes by the musty old
book.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VUNG TAU, Vietnam _ To explain why he is so excited about the
new trade agreement with the United States, Pham Van Tuat clambered
aboard the Xin Thu, his new 89-foot wooden fishing trawler, and
gestured into its spacious holds: Lower American tariffs for
Vietnamese seafood products in the United States, he explained,
will mean more demand for tuna and squid.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where this $125,000 trawler comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Xin Thu, the largest of his nine boats, can travel 400 miles
out to sea and bring back 200 tons of fish, Tuat said. To
demonstrate how, he bundled his visitors down into the engine room.
There, still bearing its maker's signature yellow paint, was
something that makes many American executives here as excited as
Tuat: a brand-new, $32,000, 480-horsepower Caterpillar engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be exporting to America soon,'' Tuat said triumphantly,
hurrying his guests onto a skiff to beat the ebb tide back to
shore. ``I'm planning to build another boat like this one. But even
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, Tuat's plans are the fruits of seven years of
toil by Anthony Salzman, an entrepreneur from New York. Salzman
came to Hanoi from Japan in 1993, hoping to capitalize on that
country's swelling investment in Vietnam. He wound up opening a
dealership for Caterpillar, which was among the most vocal
companies in urging the Clinton administration to lift the U.S.
embargo that blocked trade for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman, 49, is now one of Vietnam's most prominent American
residents, well known for his outspoken, unrelenting style. And he
is just one of many American executives here who say a trade pact
will unleash a tide of exports _ and lift his fortunes with it.
After five years of talks, the United States and Vietnam signed the
agreement July 13, and it is expected to be ratified by Congress,
though probably not this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton ended the embargo in 1994, the American
commercial venture in Vietnam has resembled its earlier military
one, with optimism quickly bogged down in a quagmire of red tape,
corruption and Communist recalcitrance. To skeptics, the new
agreement is yet another capitulation: tariffs on Vietnamese goods
would drop immediately, while Vietnamese tariffs and quotas on
American products would fall only gradually, in some cases enduring
as long as seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters here say the agreement represents a new,
irrevocable commitment by Vietnam to open the country to global
markets and to play by internationally accepted trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Vietnamese exports rise and foreign investment
returns, executives like Salzman say, demand will also rise for
American products, whether toothpaste or trucks and bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact is indirect,'' Salzman said.
</P>
<P>
   With rising export revenue, he predicted, ``my electric business
is going to grow, my marine-engine business is going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And as everything else grows,'' he added, ``the infrastructure
business should grow, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Salzman said he foresees $1 billion in sales for his venture,
V-Trac _ for Vietnam Tractor _ during the next 10 years if Vietnam
carries through on its commitments. But he and other veterans of
business here warn that change should not be expected overnight.
With or without the trade accord, Vietnam is still a poor,
Communist country, with an absence of legal, social and physical
infrastructure that sent foreign investment inflows plummeting to
about $1.5 billion a year in 1999 from roughly $3.3 billion in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Vietnam is no longer a hostile, war-ravaged
country. More than half the population is too young to have ever
seen an American GI. And Vietnam's other former adversaries,
meanwhile, have moved back in. France was the top investor in the
country last year, and Japan the top trading partner. The United
States is still only Vietnam's seventh-largest foreign investor and
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a challenging market, but I think the potential is
definitely here,'' said Michael Frisby, counselor for commercial
affairs at the American Embassy in Hanoi and a Vietnam war veteran.
``Companies should come and investigate this market, because with
ratification of the treaty the potential in Vietnam will increase
exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is already rich in resources. It is the largest producer
of black pepper and robusta coffee, which is used for instant
blends. And it is the second-largest exporter of rice, after
Thailand, and a key source of seafood, cashews and bauxite. Its
workers earn high marks from foreign employers _ and not just for
the low pay.
</P>
<P>
   The country also has much potential as a consumer market. More
than one-third of its 78 million people live in poverty, but some
of its roughly 18 million urbanites are sitting on what bankers and
economists estimate are billions of dollars in gold and other
hidden savings, with perhaps $1 billion to $2 billion more coming
in from relatives overseas every year. Many Vietnamese hoard their
money to avoid income taxes, and because they do not trust banks.
</P>
<P>
   Although American companies lack much market share here, their
brands are easily recognized. When Coca-Cola returned in 1994, it
found people still familiar with its logo. Offices in Vietnam at
that time were still using old IBM computers and keeping cool with
rusting Carrier air conditioners, all left behind when the United
States pulled out nearly 20 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The first Caterpillar equipment arrived here before World War
II, when Vietnam was still a French colony. More Cats, of course,
came during the American military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Old Caterpillar tractors and bulldozers were still rumbling
across the landscape in 1990, when Bruce St. John, then
Caterpillar's representative in Bangkok, traveled to Vietnam to
assess the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   He learned that Vietnamese mechanics still knew how to service
Caterpillar equipment. Given Vietnam's infrastructure needs, St.
John, who served in the Army in Vietnam in 1970 and 1971, predicted
a lucrative market for Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a very attractive opportunity,'' said St. John,
who now works at the same factory, in Mossville, Ill., where Tuat's
engine was built.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, St. John testified before Congress about the embargo.
Caterpillar's stance set off protests from groups that had been
urging the United States to pressure Hanoi to find American
soldiers missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar executives argued that Vietnamese markets were
falling to Japanese and European competitors and that more
influence on the MIA issue could be gained by trading with Vietnam.
In 1993, Caterpillar opened its office in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman took an unlikely road to Vietnam _ and to bulldozers.
His father, Herbert, secured the family fortune in 1967 when he
sold the company his own father founded, Standard Bag, to Boise
Cascade. Herbert Salzman went on to serve four presidents in
various positions at the State Department and started the agency
that would become the Overseas Private Investment Corp., which
guarantees American investments in third-world countries.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Salzman studied at Yale University and Duke
University law school. After working at American Express and Lehman
Brothers, he chose to explore his entrepreneurial roots, a decision
that took him to Portugal and Spain. Then he tried Asia, starting
in 1992 with Japan, where his wife was born.
</P>
<P>
   When his effort to crack Japan's closed markets did not succeed,
Salzman and his wife moved to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yen were pouring in,'' he recalled. ``It meant that Vietnam
was going to be an important Asian economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi was a long way from the Salzmans' apartment on Fifth
Avenue in Manhattan. When he and his wife called an exterminator to
rid their new home of rats, Salzman said, a man showed up with a
snake in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the Communist government to keep tabs on the new
capitalist arrivals were equally rustic. Salzman said he learned
that his phones were tapped when he heard officials breathing over
the line. Fax machines were illegal _ they were too hard to
decipher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Salzman said he never felt any animosity as a citizen of
Vietnam's former enemy. He set up the first American Chamber of
Commerce in Hanoi and began prospecting for business ideas that
would capitalize on Vietnam's obvious need for new infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman had just abandoned hopes of investing in a cellular
telephone operator when he met Caterpillar's Hanoi representative,
James Ferrara. Caterpillar was already fielding offers from its big
distributors in Hong Kong, Indonesia, France and Canada to expand
to Vietnam, Salzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman prevailed over the other bidders, he said, by appealing
to the company's traditional preference for family-owned
dealerships. In mid-1994, he set up V-Trac. A Caterpillar
spokesman, Jeffrey Hawkinson, said Ferrara was not available to
confirm Salzman's account.
</P>
<P>
   While many Vietnamese knew Caterpillar's name, Salzman needed to
spread the word that Cat was back. In 1995, he advertised a contest
offering a $1,000 prize for the oldest working Caterpillar
equipment in the country. The winning entry was a 1939 generator
serving on a tugboat. The overwhelmed winner carried off his prize
in two shopping bags filled with Vietnamese currency.
</P>
<P>
   Selling new equipment, however, was still difficult. The same
year, V-Trac lost a $7 million contract to supply bulldozers and
other heavy equipment to one of Vietnam's cement companies. Salzman
blamed the Jackson-Vanik law, a Cold War statute aimed at Communist
countries not allowing free emigration. The law prohibited trade
financing to such countries by the Export-Import Bank or by OPIC,
the agency started by Salzman's father. The Vietnamese cement
contract went instead to Komatsu of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President Clinton waived the Jackson-Vanik restrictions
against Vietnam, and last year V-Trac won $2.3 million in financing
from OPIC, the first deal the agency had made in Vietnam since the
war. V-Trac now employs 140 people in seven offices around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But financing is still difficult to obtain from risk-averse U.S.
government agencies, Salzman said. The Ex-Im Bank, for one, started
operations in Vietnam in December, but has yet to finance a deal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the trade accord may be a bigger boon to companies from
other countries as they invest in Vietnam. Textile companies from
Taiwan, for example, poured millions of dollars into Vietnam on the
prospect of exporting to the United States with reduced tariffs.
Now, a Taiwan trade official said, they are counting the minutes
until the agreement is ratified by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But what is good for Taiwan textile companies in Vietnam may
also be good for Caterpillar. Just north of Vung Tau, the Hualon
Corp. of Taiwan has a factory that makes cloth and polyester yarn.
When the plant opened in 1997, there was no electricity, so Hualon
paid $15 million for three Caterpillar generators. Now it is
planning to build a second plant next door, more than doubling its
power needs.
</P>
<P>
   Power is now available from the local utility, but Hualon's
generators remain cheaper _ and more reliable. Back in Vung Tau at
the Technical Raw Material Trading &AMP; Supplying Co., Phan Doan Hung
showed off a new, $400 million shoe factory left dormant for a day
by a power failure; its 2,200 employees had to stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   Hung and the companies in Europe, Korea and Taiwan that buy his
shoes said the trade agreement would mean more business for his
factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to export our product directly to America,'' he
added. ``That way we can earn a bigger profit.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that he has the power he needs to meet his contract
deadlines, Hung is buying a $61,000 Caterpillar generator. ``Please
come soon,'' he said to a visiting V-Trac executive. ``You see what
it's like today. I worry, worry, worry.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ford Vietnam, a joint venture between Ford Motor and a
Vietnamese partner, also uses Caterpillar generators to power its
$102 million factory near Hanoi. Business is slow: Ford makes only
100 of the 14,000 cars that the factory could produce each month.
Company executives are optimistic that the trade agreement will
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement makes me feel even more confident because of the
way it makes other businesses grow,'' said Deborah Aronson, general
director of Ford Vietnam. ``There's a significant retail population
that is looking to demonstrate its success.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronic power failures, however, underscore Vietnam's
limitations as a market and investment. Though the economy is
regaining speed, unprofitable state-owned businesses drain
government coffers, while banks, like so many countries in Asia,
are paralyzed by bad loans. Income tax rates are so high that it is
sometimes cheaper for foreign companies to hire expatriates than to
pay Vietnamese a competitive after-tax wage.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement also leaves unresolved a litany
of structural problems, executives say. Vietnam is only beginning
to experiment with capital markets; it recently opened a stock
market, but regulations still hobble businesses' ability to raise
money. Vietnam is trying to overhaul these rules, but its
bureaucracy is still Byzantine, its licensing rules unclear, and
its foreclosure and bankruptcy laws inadequate. Courts are not
independent; they answer to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   And some executives here do not share Salzman's faith that the
trade pact will permeate the economy. Ronald Kiel, 3M's managing
director in Vietnam, agrees that the accord is essential for
Vietnam's future but says the country's goods are too poor and its
infrastructure too decrepit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to see an explosion of industrial
output because the country isn't geared up for it,'' Kiel said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have more faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Vietnam does have the potential for explosive
economic growth, more so than most countries in Asia,'' said Wesley
Grove, the chief representative of Chase Manhattan Bank in Ho Chi
Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Letellier is another believer. Letellier is chief
executive of Morning Star Cement, a $400 million joint venture of
the Swiss cement giant Holderbank Financiere Glarus and Vietnam
National Cement.
</P>
<P>
   Booming demand for cement to build homes has sent Morning Star's
production soaring from 400,000 tons in 1998 to 1 million tons last
year. The trade agreement, Letellier predicted, ``will open the
Vietnamese market to U.S. investors, and this means new
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is good,'' he added, ``for the cement business.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to guess whose equipment Morning Star uses to
excavate the limestone to make that cement.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar's dividend doesn't end at the quarry. Increased
shipping traffic is also helping the Bien Dong Shipyard south of Ho
Chi Minh City. Bien Dong's workers are putting finishing touches on
a new $70,000 ferry; inside it is a $30,000 Caterpillar engine.
``After this one's done, we're building another for the same
purpose but with a 400-horsepower Caterpillar engine,'' said Phan
Ngoc Chuc, Bien Dong's director.
</P>
<P>
   Chuc is investing $200,000 and hiring 20 new workers to double
the shipyard's production and to take advantage of what he thinks
will be a boom in demand for another kind of vessel. Dwindling
catches and environmental concerns have prompted Vietnam to push
its fishing fleet farther out to sea, requiring larger, more
powerful boats. Such big boats are more economical when they remain
at sea, so Chuc foresees building other boats to transport their
catch to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Vung Tau, Tuat remembers that when he was a boy in the
1950s, he had to go only about a mile out to catch all the fish he
needed. Bigger boats won't be enough to compete in the American
market now, he realizes. He and other fishermen will need to
improve the quality of their product, he says, investing in more
ice and freezers that will burn more fuel.
</P>
<P>
   That may help Caterpillar sell bigger engines in Vietnam. But it
could help Tuat, too. One of his sons, it so happens, sells ice.
The other sells fuel.

VARGAS CHANNELS RAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ To watch Fernando Vargas fight is to think he's
engaged in a sort of chess match, his skills against his opponent's
with little if any emotion in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rage that burns inside him, the rage that has
caused him difficulties outside the ring, is also present inside of
it.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of his opponents, he simply has a knack for
channeling it in a cooly destructive manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely want to make my opponent pay,'' said Vargas, not
necessarily implying that his opponent had done anything wrong.
``It makes it sweet. I want him to pay. I think about all the bad
things that have happened in my life as if he did them to me. It
helps me get angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to pay for what he's said and done. It's like, `Did
you like that (punch)? How about that one?' It's like killing him
slowly, torturing him, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   LATEST ADDITION: Where does Vargas' anger come from?
</P>
<P>
   His father abandoned the family when Vargas was a child, which
left him with a crushing feeling of being unloved.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if that weren't enough, he'd always blamed himself. He
felt as if he had done something to drive his father away. The pain
has left him bitter to this day.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's also made him perhaps the most devoted father in
the world. He talks animatedly about his two boys every chance he
gets.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was Fernando Jr., 3. And now there's one-month-old
Amado.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of Amado? Loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the name and he always will be,'' said Vargas, a
resident of Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   STAR POWER: Vargas is becoming accustomed to an increasing
amount of attention and believes he deserves recognition.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's still amazed when fans fawn over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Quartey fight, I had to run from a bunch of people
to get into the limo. I thought, `What is this? A Michael Jackson
appearance?''' he said laughing. ``It was funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I do appreciate it, though. At the Julio Cesar Chavez
fight (against Kostya Tszyu a few weeks ago), I got an ovation that
I think was second only to Chavez. It gave me goose bumps. Me and a
friend looked at each other and said, `Can you believe that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living a dream I don't want to wake up from. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   FULL-TIME JOB: Vargas said that if he beats Thompson and signs
to fight Trinidad on Dec. 2, he will take only two weeks off before
resuming training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna go to Mexico and then come right back. That's it,''
he said. ``It'll be an easy camp because I won't have a chance to
get heavy. I guess I inherited a fat gene because I do get fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that mean (ital)big(endital) trouble after he retires?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be big and fat and just play with my grandchildren,'' he
said laughing.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHT MATTERS: The fighters weighed in separately on Friday
after their scuffle at a news conference on Thursday that left
Vargas with a bloody lip.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas weighed 153 pounds. Thompson came in two pounds over the
154-pound limit at the official weigh-in, but came back later at
153{. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly a year after Congress cleared the way for
insurance companies to own banks and vice versa, most U.S. banks
and insurers are still on the sidelines, unable, analysts say, to
see how to turn the new opportunity into profit.
</P>
<P>
   But early in September, a big Dutch company that pioneered
banking and insurance combinations in Europe, ING Group, is
planning to break into the American field with a stripped-down,
virtual bank that will eventually sell insurance. It hopes to
become a model for getting the most out of both businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is part of a larger plan by ING, a financial services
giant with operations in more than 60 countries, to build a
brand-name empire in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose U.S. headquarters is in Atlanta, has already
amassed a stable of about a dozen insurance companies, including
two big recent additions bought for nearly $14 billion. It says it
plans to spend roughly $80 million _ a huge amount in the insurance
world _ to unite everything under one umbrella and establish its
name across North America.
</P>
<P>
   Before Congress scrapped the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act
and other laws that had kept insurance companies and banks
separate, two U.S. giants, Travelers Group and Citicorp, joined
together as Citigroup in the kind of merger that financial services
executives had long argued would better serve customers and add to
their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But since the bill became law last November, bankers and
insurers have been waiting for signs that customers would rush to
do their banking and buy insurance with the same company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citigroup has had some success,'' said Tom Brown, chief
executive of Second Curve Capital, a financial services fund, ``but
the jury is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   For European companies, however, the verdict is in. Banking and
insurance combinations have been operating in Europe for more than
a decade, some with considerable success. Whether ING can make it
work here is far from certain, but it will not be for lack of
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the U.S. financial services will eventually
consolidate down to maybe 10 major entities,'' said Colin Devine,
an insurance analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.``ING is obviously
serving notice that it intends to be one of the 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ING's newest addition, an online bank, will feature a savings
account paying 6.5 percent interest _ triple the rate at most
established banks, but about on par with Internet banks that
require minimum deposits of $1,000 or so to open an account.
</P>
<P>
   ING Direct will have no minimums, no limits on withdrawals and
no fees. The bank also plans to offer consumer loans, mortgages and
certificates of deposit. Term life insurance and mutual funds,
which ING now sells through its insurance outlets, will later be
added to the bank roster.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, the bank will be run out of a renovated
six-story warehouse in Wilmington, Del., where real estate and
labor are relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will not offer checking accounts, which often are money
losers. But it will electronically link checking accounts that
customers have at other banks to their accounts at ING Direct,
allowing them to transfer money in and out, much as banks now let
customers electronically shift funds to and from brokerage houses.
As in many banks, deposits in ING Direct will be federally insured
up to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of branches, the bank will have a scattering of
cybercafes where people can drop in to buy pastry and coffee, surf
the Web and perhaps check on their digital accounts. Ewald Kist,
the chief executive of ING, said ING came up with the idea of the
cafes, which it has used with its online banks in Canada,
Australia, Spain and France, because ``people like to feel
something, see something real.'' The first ING Direct Cafe in the
United States is set to open in early October in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have bought a bricks-and-mortar bank, but that would
be nothing new for the U.S. market,'' Kist said. ``We're not in
competition with hundreds of thousands of banks. We're doing a new
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   And somewhat like beaters in a grouse hunt, ING will have 10,500
financial planners with insurance and brokerage licenses around the
United States, the largest force of its kind in the country, to
point out the virtues of the new bank to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wicker, a banking analyst at Meta Group, a technology
research firm in Stamford, Conn., said he thought the bank would
``definitely make a dent in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are skeptical. James McCormick, president of
First Manhattan Consulting Group, which specializes in financial
services and telecommunications, said he sees the bank as a niche
player rather than as a challenger to big banks like Wells Fargo
and Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   Customers concerned primarily about high returns from a bank
``are not loyal,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while this segment is not small,'' he added, ``not
everybody goes with a bank on that basis. So you have limited
growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ING's effort stands out as a bold attempt to capitalize
on a new opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company's formation through the merger of a bank and
an insurer in the Netherlands in 1991, ING has been quietly selling
insurance in the United States through regional companies like Life
of Georgia. ING's insurance predecessor, Nationale-Nederlanden, had
owned U.S. insurance companies since the late 1970s. But you had to
read the fine print to know that the companies were related or
Dutch-owned.
</P>
<P>
   ING's latest acquisitions, ReliaStar Financial Services, a deal
announced in May, and the nonhealth insurance units of Aetna
Financial Services, announced in July, will make ING one of the
United States' biggest insurers. Now it is planning to shed its
cloak of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a lot of noise about ING in the U.S.,''
Kist said. ``We are a strong company, a world player, and we want
to capitalize on that strong name.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new strategy, all of ING's U.S. possessions _
including its New York investment banks, ING Barings and Furman
Selz _ are being tied together with the parent's name and its
orange lion logo. For example, Equitable of Iowa, which the Dutch
company bought in 1997, has become ING Equitable Life.
</P>
<P>
   ING's expansion is the latest foray by European companies into
the world's biggest market for financial services. Companies like
Aegon (also based in the Netherlands), the Dutch-Belgian Fortis,
AXA of France and Allianz of Germany have been attracted to the
United States by favorable economics and regulatory policies.
</P>
<P>
   And they are becoming substantial players. Early last year, for
example, Aegon bought Transamerica Corp., a big U.S. life insurance
company. And in June, a unit of AXA, which already was a leader
here, bought Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., the New York
money-management and institutional research firm.

 &UR; ATLANTA: research firm. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though proposed foreign acquisitions in some U.S. industries,
notably telecommunications, have stirred nationalistic concerns,
there have been no such reverberations yet in the fragmented
financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   To European buyers, U.S. insurance companies, which generally
trade at lower price-to-earnings ratios than their European
counterparts, seem like bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with state-by-state regulation of insurance as
well as some aspects of banking in the United States, and even with
the European Union smoothing out the regulatory differences among
its 15 member nations, the Europeans say that doing business in the
United States is easier and less costly than it is in the patchwork
of countries and languages that make up Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, companies that want to be truly global feel
they must have a significant presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another lure is that with more and more Americans responsible
for managing their own retirement with 401(k) plans and the like
rather than traditional pensions, the personal investment business
is booming here far more than it is in Europe, where pensions are
still primarily a governmental obligation.
</P>
<P>
   And like their U.S. counterparts, ING and the other European
insurers doing business in the United States are focusing more on
investing these days than on insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So the Europeans have been steadily picking off U.S. companies.
And many are still on the hunt. But ING, Kist said, is finished
``with our shopping list for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The job at hand, he said, is to fit the pieces of the company's
empire together to maximize economies of scale and to centralize
different lines of business in headquarters around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The old marble and glass Georgia Life building, for example, set
on the edge of Atlanta deep in a hardwood forest, has been
designated ING's command post not only for the U.S. operations but
for those of Canada and Latin America as well. Des Moines, Iowa, is
to become the center for fixed annuities.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea of expanding ING's U.S. operations, Kist said,
was so that it would be able to become a low-cost provider. ``You
need to be well priced and you need to have a presence in all the
states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ING's U.S. competitors have also been consolidating, but so far
banks and insurance have largely remained separate. Banks have been
reluctant to buy insurance companies, experts say, because they
would have to tie up a lot of capital for generally sluggish
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurers cannot afford a bank big enough to give them a
national network of outlets for insurance, and even some that could
pony up the money say they regard banking profits as less
predictable than those from insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The industries, however, have been converging to some extent.
Many banks have contracted with insurers to sell policies through
their branches for a fee. And a handful of insurers have begun
experimenting with banking, mostly aimed at their insurance
customers.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the biggest U.S.
insurer of cars and homes, has started offering a range of
financial services online and through its agents. But unlike ING,
State Farm is completely new to banking and it concedes that it is
just getting its feet wet.
</P>
<P>
   So is MetLife, one of the biggest life insurers. On Aug. 16
MetLife said that it was buying a small New Jersey bank, Grand
Bank, and that it hoped to start up early next year _ perhaps,
analysts say, with an online operation.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ING is the company to watch. Brown, the financial
consultant and fund manager, said he expected that many competing
bank executives would open accounts at ING Direct to ``see how it's
going and to be a fast follower if it succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is among those who see long odds. ``In our experience,''
he said, ``pioneers usually end up with arrows in their back.''

AMERICAN EVANGELISTS ARRESTED IN CHINA RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS lede to update with Saturday events and information from
pastor; deletes `nearly 130' from 4th graf, as info now appears in
last graf; deletes last three grafs of original text and subs with
new graf of info. from pastor in Calif.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Three American evangelists who were detained in
central China on Wednesday along with a large group of Chinese
Christians were released on Friday, their pastor in California
said, and on Saturday they were flying to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Henan province, where the arrests were made, told a
U.S. diplomat that the three U.S. citizens had been detained for
``activities incompatible with the tourist status under which they
entered China,'' the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   All three Americans were born in Taiwan and belong to a
Protestant church in California that sends members on brief
missions into China to lend moral and financial support to the
so-called house churches. These are fervent Christian groups that
refuse to accept the leadership of the government-sponsored church,
and their members often suffer police harassment and detention.
</P>
<P>
   The three were detained along with Chinese followers of the
China Fangcheng Church, a large Protestant group whose leaders were
sent to labor camps last year.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor in California, who spoke by telephone to his Chinese
colleagues, said about 100 of the detained Chinese were still being
held at a police station or local prison. He did not know if any
would face criminal charges. One Chinese woman was beaten by
police, the pastor said, while another, who was pregnant, was
freed. Several of the other worshipers from the original group of
130 managed to escape.

 &HT;    Tech's freshmen should see action
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coach George O'Leary has 10 freshmen on the Georgia
Tech depth chart. The designation allows them to travel with the
varsity and gives them a chance to play during their first year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's freshmen might be the best the Jackets have had. And
there is a good chance that all 10 will see action Sunday at
Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the young players:
</P>
<P>
   Nate Curry, receiver, Miami. Curry is the second-fastest player
on the team, behind junior flanker Kelly Campbell. Curry has shown
he can catch in practice. He also could see duty on kickoff returns
or punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Smith, receiver, Clinch County. The Tech coaching staff
thinks it got a steal in Smith. The 5-foot-10, 175-pounder is
athletic and could run a reverse or even throw a pass. Smith also
could help on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Foschi, tight end, Old Brookville, N.Y. O'Leary always
liked Foschi as a player. At 6-4, 268, Foschi is tough, can block
and catch and is relatively fast. Leon Robinson, offensive guard,
Garden City. Robinson has a broken right hand. The 6-4, 290-pounder
has been a solid performer from the start. ``He's kind of a raw
talent, but he's a fluid kid,'' offensive-line coach Mac McWhorter
said. ``He's as athletic as any I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnathon Jackson, fullback, Jacksonville. Jackson could play
sooner than expected. Sophomore backup fullback Gary Johnson was
moved to the defensive line, and linebacker Ross Mitchell was moved
to fullback. Jackson has taken the majority of snaps this fall,
with Tech resting Ed Wilder as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cox, cornerback, Chicago. Cox backs up Jamara Clark and
has perhaps the best chance of seeing action Sunday. Cox is quick,
recovers well and plays the pass and the run.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Green, strong safety, Hyattsville, Md. Green, 6-2, 195,
is playing behind Chris Young but could be used in several roles as
a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Hobie Holiday, linebacker, Houston County. The 6-3, 248-pound
linebacker might not wind up as a linebacker. Tech already uses him
in the defensive line in certain situations. Holiday will play
behind Matt Miller, but definitely will play.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Smith, linebacker, Albany. Smith is the real catch of the
recruiting class. He is playing behind Ather Brown but could be a
starter soon. Smith can play inside and outside and at 6-2, 227, is
the closest thing the Jackets have to a prototypical linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Keyaron Fox, linebacker, Westlake High. Fox is a true outside
linebacker. He has exceptional speed and plays behind Recardo
Wimbush. At 6-2, 210, Fox is quick and agile and will see action
Sunday to try to help contain Virginia Tech quarterback Michael
Vick.

   Vice President Al Gore has found a soul mate, at least in his
views of how government should work. He is Vicente Fox, the
president-elect of Mexico, who is so simpatico with Gore that he
ordered a Spanish translation of a Gore report on reinventing
government. Gore wrote the 150-page report, titled ``From Red Tape
to Results,'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Fox made it required reading for his staff. The
gist of it is that government should be run more like a business,
with attention to customer service and performance agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, distilled the report's
message on his business cards. They read, in Spanish, ``To create a
good government that is competitive, transparent, honest,
participatory and proactive, one that works better, costs less and
benefits society.''
</P>
<P>
   A POSTCONVENTION HIGH
</P>
<P>
   For all the soporific effect that this year's party conventions
had on some viewers, it seems they left good feelings in many an
American heart. A poll by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University found that
opinions of the presidential campaign became much more positive
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 1,000 adults surveyed after the conventions, 50 percent
said they were encouraged by recent campaign events, while only 25
percent said they were discouraged. And 61 percent said they
thought the campaign's tone had recently been positive, while only
17 percent said it had been negative.
</P>
<P>
   All good news for Shorenstein researchers, whose concern about
political apathy and alienation led them to call themselves the
Vanishing Voter Project.
</P>
<P>
   WISHFUL IN WISCONSIN
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in
Wisconsin, John Gillespie, has challenged his opponent, Sen. Herb
Kohl, to a campaign spending cap of $4 million, or about $1 per
voter.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, a political novice, wants to ``get a handle on
outrageous campaign spending,'' said his campaign manager, Bruce
Pfaff.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie has two challengers in the Republican primary on Sept.
12, but he is considered the likely nominee. Kohl, the
multimillionaire philanthropist, is unlikely to agree to the cap,
said Joanne Anton, his campaign manager. She said that Kohl, who is
seeking his third term, will spend less than the $6.8 million he
spent in 1994 and will spend the least amount possible to run an
effective campaign.

USC QUARTERBACK IS EAGER TO RETURN, AND SMARTER, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The legal predicament surrounding
Rashard Casey has dominated discussion about Sunday's Kickoff
Classic between Penn State and Southern California at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   An accusation of assault, now being investigated by prosecutors,
is the reason the Nittany Lions refused to make Casey, their
starting quarterback, available Friday when both teams gathered for
news conferences at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he needs this,'' Penn State Coach Joe Paterno
told reporters. ``You couldn't resist asking him some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But another quarterback in the game is also dealing with
personal travail, and his story may prove to be a more enduring
tale. He is the Trojans' Carson Palmer, whose sophomore season
ended in 1999 with a broken collarbone in the third game.
</P>
<P>
   A drop-back passer who admires the Dallas Cowboys star Troy
Aikman and plays a little like him, Palmer is thought to be a
better professional prospect than Casey.
</P>
<P>
   While Casey has been known to flee the backfield quickly and did
not earn first-string status until his fifth year, Palmer started
as a freshman and is projected as the pocket-protected nucleus of
Coach Paul Hackett's attack for three more years. (Because of a
medical waiver, Palmer is still a sophomore.)
</P>
<P>
   At today's USC news conference, Palmer avoided discussing
allegations that Casey and a friend beat an off-duty police officer
in May in Hoboken, N.J., during an early morning fight outside a
bar. But Palmer did compare and contrast their playing styles, and
he spoke with admiration of his counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college football,'' Palmer said, ``it helps a lot if you
can run, because college teams don't really do a very good job of
stopping quarterbacks who get outside the pocket and make big
plays. From a fan's perspective, I think it would be more fun to
watch a guy like Rashard play.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno said Casey would wait longer this year before taking
flight. Palmer and USC understand the reasoning, because Palmer got
in trouble last fall by running with the ball. Near the end of the
first half against Oregon, Palmer took on a big Duck and came out
second best. With Palmer out for the season, USC lost six of its
next seven games and finished at 6-6. Hackett said his quarterback
has become more enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you develop as a quarterback, your judgment improves,''
Hackett said. ``When you are young and just getting started, you
feel like you can leap over tall buildings. There are times and
moments to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are also times to step out of bounds or slide to a
stop to avoid the full impact of a tackler, Hackett said. This
could allow Palmer to rise from the turf to do what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson is a driver with the ball; he throws in between the
seams and the creases because of his great strength,'' Hackett
said. ``He came to USC with the idea he would play in as many
high-profile games as humanly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game ``is Carson Palmer's kind of game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach added, ``It's the reason that he plays football.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer certainly looks the part. At 6 feet 5 inches and 220
pounds, he is clean-cut, lanky and fair-haired. In conversation, he
projects an air of self-confidence that stops short of cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing film study to prepare for defenses, Palmer said,
``Hopefully, there's one cornerback or safety we can pick on.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his injury and idleness last autumn, Palmer said he
was buoyed by his family, his girlfriend and his religious faith.
``I'm hurt for a reason,'' he said. ``It's going to work out in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to play football when he was small, but his parents
refused to let him, in part for financial reasons. When his father
brought home a helmet and pads before Palmer entered fourth grade,
``I just went nuts'' with happiness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother had a different reaction. ``It made my mom mad,''
Palmer said. ``She freaks out about me getting hurt.'' He broke the
same collarbone in high school, along with a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing his Pacific-10 school to Big Ten schools like Penn
State, Palmer said games rarely sell out on the West Coast because
there is more for the fans to do. He said it is the same for the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is the only thing going on,'' he said of Big Ten
schools. ``That's not what I wanted. I like to be able to go to the
beach.''

JOHNSON RETURNS AND WINS TUNEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Some of the world's finest athletes,
including a healthier and humbler Michael Johnson, may have been
running and leaping here Friday night, but in this particular year,
the only city that really matters in track and field is Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a summer of dress rehearsals in Europe, the
continent that writes most of the checks and generates most of the
consistent interest in the signature sport of the Olympics, and
this Golden League meet did a better job than most of whetting the
appetite for the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the U.S. Olympic trials in Sacramento,
Calif., Maurice Greene, Michael Johnson and Marion Jones competed
in the same place. The difference this time was that all three
emerged uninjured, if not unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Greene won the men's 100 meters in 9.88 seconds, which would
have been the fastest legal time this year if not for the fact that
the following wind was a tenth of a meter per second over the
allowable limit. Johnson won the men's 400 in 44.07 seconds in his
first race since he and Greene pulled up with injuries on July 23
and failed to finish the highly anticipated and hotly debated
200-meter final in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones, she won the women's 100 in 10.83 seconds, the
second-fastest time this season; it was five-hundredths of a second
slower than her 10.78 in London this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones did not fare nearly so well in the long jump, her
second event of the evening, finishing fifth after fouling on four
of her six attempts and jumping no better than 21 feet 7{ inches on
her two fair efforts. Both were well short of the 22-10 effort of
the winner, Tatiana Kotova, a Russian who won the first three
Golden League meets this season before missing the last two because
of minor injuries from an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I can't get two events in one meet right,'' said
Jones, who will try to get five events right in Sydney, where she
hopes to win gold medals in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In her last outing, on Aug. 11, Jones won the long jump in
Zurich, Switzerland, after struggling in the 100, getting off to a
rotten start and chasing down Inger Miller to win by a hundredth of
a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was just the opposite,'' Jones said, sounding fresh
and eager after nearly two weeks at home in Raleigh, N.C., with her
husband, C.J. Hunter, and her coach, Trevor Graham. ``Here I
thought my 100 was very good, and I jumped so-so. But I'm very
pleased with my start in the 100. That's what I was concerned about
and what we corrected when I went home. That was not Marion in
Zurich. For the past three years, I'm a master of my technique, and
to run a race like that, I don't know what came over me. But Trevor
definitely drilled me when we got home.''
</P>
<P>
   The more daunting task is drilling Jones effectively in the long
jump. Though she has not lost a 100 since 1997, Friday night's loss
was her fourth in the long jump this season, and she is not
scheduled to jump again in competition until the Olympics begin
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Devers has been much more consistent in the 100-meter
hurdles and Friday night she all but clinched a share of the Golden
League jackpot (50 kilograms of gold) by winning in 12.53 seconds.
To earn a share, athletes must win their event in five of the seven
Golden League meets and then compete in the Grand Prix final in
Qatar after the Olympics. Devers, undefeated in the hurdles this
season, has already won five Golden League races; the last is next
week in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Greene also has a chance to win the jackpot. Since returning to
competition in Zurich after his hamstring injury, he has reasserted
himself as the Olympic favorite in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really putting a lot of pressure on myself to come out
there and run fast,'' Greene said. ``The wind was too much, but who
cares?''

FAMILIAR SCENE FOR COMETS, AND HISTORY IS ON THEIR SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene has shifted back to the familiar stage, with the
principal stars ready again from last year, the year before and the
year before that.
</P>
<P>
   This summer theater brings the promise of suspense, but always,
it seems, leads to an inevitable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Comets brushed by the Liberty in Game 1 of the WNBA
championship, 59-52, on Thursday night in Madison Square Garden
thanks to their superstars whose timely shots seemed to find the
basket by muscle memory, and whose defense befuddled the home team
all night.
</P>
<P>
   Because the WNBA championship is a best-of-three series, the
Comets can win their fourth consecutive league title on Saturday in
Houston, at the Compaq Center. The Liberty needs to win twice in a
place where the Comets have lost only one playoff game in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in those four years, New York arrives in
Houston as the undaunted obstacle. ``We're not going down there to
lose, I can tell you that,'' Liberty guard Becky Hammon said after
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the Comets' ever since we opened up in 1997,''
Comets coach Van Chancellor said. ``We are back to Houston. But
just because we go to Houston doesn't mean we win.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds say otherwise. In 1997, New York went to Houston for
the one-game championship with the confidence of having won three
regular-season games against Houston, then promptly lost, 65-51. In
1998, Phoenix was Houston's victim. Last year, the Liberty pushed
the Comets to the limit, Teresa Weatherspoon's improbable halfcourt
shot forcing Game 3, before bowing out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to believe in the impossible, when no one else
does,'' Weatherspoon said. ``Sure, we're somewhat frustrated
because we didn't get this one at home and didn't play a tremendous
basketball game, didn't put the ball in the basket. But those
things happen and you have to come in and correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York needs to correct its shooting first. The Liberty, which
never led in Game 1, lost because it shot 32.1 percent and only
center Tari Phillips scored in double figures. She had the best
individual effort of anyone, including Houston's Cynthia Cooper,
who hit the winning shot. Phillips had a game-high 24 points,
shooting 10 for 19, and pulled down a game-high 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   No one else on the Liberty made more than two field goals, going
0 for 8 from 3-point range, struggling to get free off screens.
Tamika Whitmore missed 10 shots from short range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them credit for their defense because they are very
athletic and they can challenge shots,'' Liberty coach Richie
Adubato said, ``and we give up four, five inches to each person in
our guard and small forward situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammon hit just one outside shot all night, guarded by Cooper,
who is five inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty hopes to build on the bright spots in the loss. The
Comets outrebounded the Liberty by only 35-34, while the Liberty
held Houston to 35.5 percent shooting. For the final motivation,
the Liberty can draw upon Weatherspoon's epic shot in last year's
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, meanwhile, are fueled by the thought that they can
become the first professional sports team since the NHL's Islanders
(1980-83) to win four straight titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go out and play for 40 minutes and not make it come
down to a halfcourt shot,'' Swoopes said. ``If we go out and take
care of business in the first half and in the second half, then we
should walk away champions.''  &QL;

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Shortly after Florida State's football
players assembled to begin their quest for a second straight
unbeaten season, the team doctor was giving his annual speech about
the various viruses that could strike them.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a slide of a player who had lost much of his hair.
Suddenly, many of the players in the room began pointing at Chris
Weinke and chanting, ``Chris! Chris! Chris!''
</P>
<P>
   It was their playful way of having a few laughs at the expense
of Weinke, their 28-year-old quarterback, who has a prominent bald
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not holding his age well,'' tight end Ryan Sprague said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that word is out that Weinke's high school class in St. Paul
had its 10-year reunion this year, Weinke, Florida State's senior
leader, may face a new wave of jokes about his age. He has been
called Methuselah and Rip Van Weinke by his teammates, but not
often in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've laid down the law,'' said Weinke, who will be back at
quarterback Saturday night when Florida State, ranked No. 2 in the
Associated Press poll of reporters, opens its season at home
against Brigham Young, which was 8-4 last season. ``I don't want to
date myself. For the most part, I don't feel out of place at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He fits most on the football field, where he is a dream come
true for Coach Bobby Bowden, who is 70. Weinke is the first
three-year starter at quarterback in a quarter-century at FSU. With
Weinke surrounded by talented blockers and receivers and
experienced running backs, Bowden says he has a pat hand on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke comes into this season with a 21-1 record as a starter,
including 20 victories in a row. He holds school records for the
number of 200-yard games passing (20) and yards per completion
(14.8) and is in position to break many of the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better today than he was last year,'' Bowden said. ``He's
sharper and more accurate with his passes, and there's less
hesitation on where he's going with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Weinke decided in January that he would return for his
senior season rather than opt for the National Football League
draft, he decided to improve his physical condition dramatically.
Never mind that teammates say he is a millionaire already, mostly
from real estate investments with the money he received from six
seasons as an infielder in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. He
dropped nearly 20 pounds, to 229.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do whatever I could do to be the best that I could
be,'' he said. ``My main focus was getting quicker.'' He will still
be a drop-back passer, mindful of the career-threatening neck
injury he suffered two seasons ago, but he says he will not be an
easy target anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see me running around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His offensive line, acutely aware that Weinke's health may well
make a difference in whether the Seminoles repeat as national
champions, has sworn to keep the opposition off of him. Of course,
it helps that Tarlos Thomas, a senior, and Brett Williams, a
sophomore, are pro-caliber tackles and that the senior guards
Justin Amman and Jerry Carmichael have extensive starting
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal this year is not to give up any sacks,'' Thomas said.
``I mean we don't want his jersey dirty, unless we're patting him
on the back after a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke was never close to leaving FSU for the NFL, he says now.
For one thing, some pro scouts projected him as a third-round pick,
at best. For another, he knew the Seminoles were loaded for another
title run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sit on the bench and make the minimum of whatever
they're paying up there,'' he said, ``and I'd be watching Florida
State on TV every Saturday, knowing I could be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch Weinke shrugs off talk about his Heisman
Trophy candidacy, which figures to blossom if FSU picks up where it
left off last season, when it capped a 12-0 season with a 46-29
victory over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to win any awards,'' he said. ``I'm not here to
do anything but win a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the next breath, some ego does surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to realize that I came back for a reason: to
be the most dominating quarterback who has ever played here,'' he
said. ``I think I can do that, because I know what it takes to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Weinke will not have his favorite receiver, Peter
Warrick, who has gone to the pros. While Bowden says that because
of Warrick's distinctive explosive moves, the next version of him
``is probably down in elementary school somewhere; about every 10
years you see one like him,'' Weinke believes the Seminoles are
loaded with talented receivers.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that in the two games Warrick missed last season,
against Miami and Wake Forest, he completed passes to 11 and 10
receivers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one big reason I came back,'' he said. ``I know what
kind of ability these guys have.''

 &HT;    QBs can expect quick hooks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kentucky coach Hal Mumme calls himself a
``one-quarterback coach.'' For that reason, the SEC's top passer
from a year ago is playing at a Division II school this season.
</P>
<P>
   For several Southeastern Conference teams, however, two
quarterbacks won't be a crowd in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, the defending SEC champion, will start quarterback
Andrew Zow in Saturday's opener at UCLA. However, Crimson Tide
coach Mike DuBose said sophomore Tyler Watts also will play a
couple of series against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida, Steve Spurrier is expected to start senior Jesse
Palmer, but the Gators coach won't have much patience if the
Canadian struggles. Redshirt freshman Rex Grossman and freshman
Brock Berlin, who enrolled in Florida during the spring, had
contended for the job until Palmer pulled away in preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback battles in Tuscaloosa and Gainesville could help
decide the SEC. If the Crimson Tide and Gators get consistent play
under center and avoid quarterback controversies, the teams should
be near the top of their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   LSU still hasn't settled on a starter, and South Carolina's
competition isn't over, either.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look:
</P>
<P>
   Alabama: DuBose finally named Zow the starter last week. Zow, a
junior from Lake Butler, Fla., was clearly the better quarterback
in camp, but DuBose faced tremendous pressure to start Watts, who
was a star at Pelham (Ala.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose said Watts would get at least one series in each half
against UCLA. Zow has a stronger arm than Watts. Watts is more
mobile and is an accurate passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Zow) is having an off day, I will go to the second
quarterback,'' DuBose said. ``But that's not a demotion. That's
simply trying to help the football team and would not be indicative
of who would be the starter the following week.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida: Palmer, who completed only 46 percent of his passes
last season with five interceptions and two touchdowns, is the
favorite to replace Doug Johnson, who graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer won the job in camp, but Spurrier is worried about his
ability to play well in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't just go all out and say he's our guy because his
history is he doesn't have a track record,'' Spurrier said. ``I
wish he had a track record of going the distance about five weeks
in a row. Now don't get me wrong, I think he's very capable. I
think he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Palmer does the job, then the Gators might redshirt Berlin,
USA Today's Louisiana player of the year last year.

 &HT;    Ford, Trilogy to put dealers online
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin's Trilogy Software Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. will expand their efforts to make Ford a leader in Internet
auto sales with an online program that allows consumers to select,
price and order a car directly from dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   FordDirect.com, a new business formed by more than 4,000 Ford
dealers and the No. 2 U.S. automaker, will launch next month in
California, the company and dealers announced Friday. It is a
linchpin of Ford's long-term strategy to get most of its revenue
from the Internet while capitalizing on the efficiencies of online
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big endorsement for e-commerce,'' said Joe Liemandt,
Trilogy's Chief Executive Officer.
</P>
<P>
   FordDirect.com, which will be owned and operated primarily by
the dealers, could swiftly become one of the largest online
startups, based on Ford's revenue of $162 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is not expected to affect Texas dealers any time
soon because of uncertainty over state restrictions on Internet
sales of new cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is way down on the list, because they (Ford's dealers)
feel it's going to be much more difficult to comply fully with what
the state asks us to,'' said Chris Porch, chief executive of Ford
Trilogy Joint Venture.
</P>
<P>
   That business, which employs about 150 people in Austin, was
launched earlier this year to strengthen Ford.com and enable Ford
dealerships to do business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   FordDirect.com takes that further.
</P>
<P>
   The site will provide about five dealers in the ZIP code of the
car buyer and provide maps and the distance to each.
</P>
<P>
   Each dealer's entire inventory will be available for browsing,
and prices, which dealer sites don't offer now, will be available,
Ford officials said. In addition, the database will include
vehicles en route from the factories, Porch said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will be able to configure the options they want and
will see the closest matches to their choice. They'll also be able
to put a down payment on their credit card and arrange financing
from Ford Credit Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changing times call for a change in procedures,'' said
Jerry Reynolds, chairman of the dealer group that approached Ford
about the venture months ago to give consumers ``the convenience,
trust and value they are looking for in online transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Connor, president of the Ford division of Ford Motor Co.,
called the venture ``nothing other than a true breakthrough'' in
giving consumers online ``confidence and peace of mind, knowing
that the entire experience is backed by Ford and our dealer
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers will pay $25 for every referral they get from
FordDirect.com, and $200 for what Chris Markey, Internet director
of Covert Ford, called ``shrink-wrap deals.''
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, customers will have chosen a car from the
dealer's lot, put a down payment on a credit card and financed the
purchase through Ford Credit. All the dealer has to do is get the
purchase agreements signed and deliver the car.
</P>
<P>
   Markey said Covert sells about 120 cars a month, 12 percent to
15 percent of its volume, over the Internet now. Covert is among
the top 15 Ford dealerships in the country, Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 1,200 requests (for information) a month. We're
hoping FordDirect will add 100 to 200 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement gives Trilogy a respite from recent
disappointments in several of the online businesses it has launched
in recent years, including carOrder.com. One of many online car
brokers, carOrder.com laid off 100 employees last week, admitting
it couldn't make money brokering autos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for the demise of these lead-providing services in the
next five years, because customers are going to be bypassing them
and going directly to the dealers,'' Markey predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Trilogy's Porch said lessons learned at carOrder.com will
help it build the FordDirect.com sites for dealers.

 &HT;    Cornhuskers are ready to roll
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ In January, Eric Crouch kept squirming in his
seat while watching the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful. Very painful,'' the Nebraska quarterback said.
``I just kept thinking, 'Man, that could be us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was undefeated Florida State and Virginia Tech
playing in New Orleans for the national championship. The
Cornhuskers finished 12-1 and ranked No. 3 last season because of a
24-20 upset loss to Texas on Oct. 23. Nebraska later avenged that
loss by beating the Longhorns 22-6 in the Big 12 championship game,
but it wasn't enough to get the Cornhuskers into the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the year, a lot of people thought we were the
best team in the country,'' wingback Bobby Newcombe said. ``I
didn't argue with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Nebraska's strong finish, which included a 31-21 win
over Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl in a game that wasn't that close,
the Cornhuskers are a consensus No. 1 in the major preseason polls.
They are a strong favorite to be playing for this season's national
title on Jan. 3 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If such high expectations are a burden, Nebraska is bearing it
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team did finish strongly and there is a possibility that
this could be a great football team,'' said third-year coach Frank
Solich, now solidly entrenched after taking over for Tom Osborne in
1998. ``There's a lot of football to be played, but if we reach our
potential, I'm excited about where that might lead us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is a logical pick because of the way the team evolved
since early in the 1999 season. The offense could not hold on to
the ball. By the third game, Solich replaced Newcombe at
quarterback with Crouch and the offense started to settle down.
Nebraska still fumbled too many times _ 49 in all, with 25 lost _
but rolled over opponents like the Cornhuskers of old.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch, who has added 10 pounds of muscle and will play at 205,
ran for 889 yards and became the first quarterback since 1955 to
lead Nebraska in rushing. Fully recovered from offseason shoulder
surgery, Crouch should be even better in 2000. He will direct an
offense that returns 10 starters and led the Big 12 in rushing with
265.9 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this offense has a chance to be really good,'' said
Crouch, who was the Big 12 co-offensive player of the year with
Texas quarterback Major Applewhite. ``We're so much more
comfortable with one another than we were at this time a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing from the Nebraska offense is a big-time
I-back, which has always been a staple of Cornhusker football. A
year ago Solich kicked his best I-back off the team, the
disgruntled DeAngelo Evans. Talent returns in Dan Alexander (865
yards) and Correll Buckhalter (662), and junior-college transfer
Thunder Collins ran for 1,548 yards and 23 touchdowns two years ago
at East Los Angeles Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense is not as set, which is why the Cornhuskers are
not a cinch to make it to Miami. They will miss the Browns, Mike
and Ralph, who gave Nebraska one of the most talented secondaries
in the country. New players also will fill four of the seven
positions up front.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska also has to replace Charlie McBride, its longtime
defensive coordinator. Craig Bohl, the former linebackers coach,
has the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be Charlie McBride, but I can continue to implement
his philosophy,'' said Bohl, who played for Nebraska 1977-79. ``At
Nebraska, when one guy leaves somebody is supposed to be ready to
step up to the plate. That goes for players and coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At Nebraska, the defense should never be the weakness of the
team,'' said linebacker Carlos Polk.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska should be 9-0 when it goes to No. 9 Kansas State on
Nov. 11. On Sept. 9, the Cornhuskers go to Notre Dame, which could
be very embarrassing for the Irish. Nebraska goes to Oklahoma on
Oct. 28, but the improving Sooners still aren't ready for that kind
of challenge.
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska wins in Manhattan, Kan., where it lost two years
ago, it should finish 11-0 and meet Texas again for the Big 12
title. And if the Cornhuskers win all of their games, they won't be
on the outside looking in at the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``How good can this team be?'' Newcombe asked. ``As good as it
wants to be. If we're willing to work for it, the sky's the limit.
I really believe that.''
</P>

GIULIANI MAY FILE SUIT AGAINST ANIMAL GROUP OVER ADS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wis., Pa., Va.)   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Angry over the use of his face on billboard
advertising as far away as Oshkosh, Wis., Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
repeated a threat to file suit against an animal rights group that
is trying to publicize a possible link between milk consumption and
various illnesses, including prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad is tasteless,'' Giuliani said at a news conference on
Friday, adding that he would decide over the weekend whether to sue
the group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is
based in Norfolk, Va. ``My illness is a very public matter, which I
am fine with, but I don't like people exploiting it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's threat of legal action, which he made initially in
comments to reporters on Thursday night, did not appear to have
deterred the animal rights group, which said it would put up more
of the billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on ads that the group, known as PETA, has
posted this week in three cities in milk-producing areas _
Lancaster, Pa., and Oshkosh and Appleton in central Wisconsin. The
ads parody the ubiquitous ``Got Milk?'' campaign sponsored by the
dairy industry, and are dominated by what appears to be an oversize
mug shot of Giuliani with a band of white _ intended to look like
milk _ above his upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   A brief text reads ``Got prostate cancer?'' Below that phrase,
it asserts, ``Drinking milk contributes to prostate cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   PETA, known for its strident tactics in promoting animal rights,
said the ad was intended to protest the dairy industry, not
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Friedrich, the group's vegetarian-campaign coordinator,
said on Friday that PETA hoped the ad would draw attention to
studies that have raised the possibility of a link between dairy
consumption and several types of serious illnesses, and to what he
called the hypocrisy of the dairy industry in promoting the health
benefits of milk.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are uncertain about the exact cause of
prostate cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, there is
an increased risk of the disease associated with eating animal fat,
red meats and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich would not say how many more billboards would be
erected, or where. But it seemed unlikely that the ads would find
their way to New York City, since PETA said it had already been
rejected by several companies that post ads on billboards, in
subways and on taxis in the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the advertising agency in Wisconsin that put up the
two billboards there said they would be taken down. Wisconsin farm
leaders attacked the ads as misleading and insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has declined to specify which treatment he is
undergoing for his prostate cancer, has reacted to the ads by
keeping a glass of milk at his side in public appearances and by
making repeated references to drinking milk. At a town hall meeting
at the Norman Thomas High School on East 33rd Street in Manhattan,
he turned from the podium several times to drink a glass of milk
and to refill it from a half-gallon carton. And on his weekly radio
call-in show, he broke away for a commercial by telling the
program's listeners he would ``take a short glass of milk and come
back.''

UNFORESEEN SIDE EFFECTS RUINED ONE BLOCKBUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 27)  
 (EDS: With PFIZER-MARKETING) 
By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pfizer's marketers were turning an antibiotic called Trovan into
a blockbuster when misfortune struck last year.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were prescribing Trovan at a rate of 300,000 patients a
month when regulators forced Pfizer to take the drug off the
shelves of most pharmacies. At least 14 people taking Trovan had
suffered from acute liver failure, including six who died.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer lost a potential billion-dollar drug _ and one that had
cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.
</P>
<P>
   The case showed how a new drug, marketed by an expert like
Pfizer, could be swiftly prescribed to thousands of patients before
all the side effects were known. Pfizer said its tests of Trovan
had not revealed any serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   All drug companies have become more adept at getting out the
word about new drugs to physicians and consumers. The companies,
watched eagerly by investors, are under pressure to generate strong
sales as soon as a drug is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   With Trovan, Wall Street analysts were betting that Pfizer could
generate up to $1 billion in sales in a year.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize Trovan's potential, Pfizer had conducted clinical
studies _ enough so that regulators had approved Trovan for 14
different uses, the largest number ever for a drug's initial
approval.
</P>
<P>
   When Trovan went on the market in February 1998, Pfizer's
thousands of sales representatives were ready. A year later, the
company said more than a million prescriptions for Trovan had been
written.
</P>
<P>
   But serious possible side effects that were never apparent in
clinical trials surfaced quickly when the drug was prescribed
widely. Patients began experiencing liver toxicity just months
after the drug first became available. In July 1998 the Food and
Drug Administration asked Pfizer to add information about possible
liver toxicity in the information provided in each Trovan package.
</P>
<P>
   By June 9, 1999, regulators had received reports of more than
100 cases in which patients taking Trovan had suffered liver
problems. On that day the FDA warned doctors that Trovan should be
used only in rare cases and only in hospitals. And Pfizer sent
letters to doctors and pharmacies, telling them that Trovan's use
was restricted. It offered to reimburse the pharmacies for any
Trovan they had in stock.
</P>
<P>
   But not all doctors and pharmacies immediately received the
news. And some patients were given Trovan after the FDA's warning.
On Jan. 19 of this year, Kenneth Madding, a machinist in Marion,
Ill., received a prescription for Trovan from a local pharmacy.
Madding, who was 34, had developed a lung infection after having
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Madding's wife, Betty, said that her husband's condition
worsened immediately after he took the drug. Five days later he
died. His wife and the lawyers she has hired say Trovan caused his
death. Betty Madding filed a lawsuit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer said on Friday that it had not seen the lawsuit and could
not comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. John F. Niblack, Pfizer's top scientist, said earlier this
month that the company had argued with the FDA, contending that
Trovan's advantages outweighed its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Niblack said that all drugs had some risks associated with them.
``What if a medicine helped 9,999 people, but hurt one?'' he asked.
``What risks are we willing to accept?''
</P>
<P>
   In Trovan's case, he said, the data seem to show that it hurt
one patient in every 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinical trials that Pfizer conducted to receive FDA
approval, William C. Steere Jr., the chairman of Pfizer, said there
was no evidence that Trovan could cause liver problems. As in all
drug trials, the patients involved are carefully screened, he said,
and many with complicated health problems are ruled out. That means
some side effects do not show up until after a drug is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the drug in the general population, and then everyone
is taking it,'' Steere said. ``We just hold our breath and wait to
see if there is something unique with the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Trovan, he said, ``it turned out there was.''

 &HT;    Small track, big thrills
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The largest crowd to assemble for a sports event this
weekend will be at Bristol Motor Speedway for tonight's
Goracing.com 500.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 are expected to gather around the half-mile
oval track to see one of the most exciting Winston Cup races of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Season-ticket holders from 50 states and seven countries make
the annual pilgrimage to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains
each August. Rusty Wallace, who has won nine times at Bristol, said
it is easy to understand the popularity of the legendary night
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most exciting race out there,'' said Wallace,
tonight's pole sitter. ``Since it's the most exciting, everybody
wants to go to it. The track is small, compact and full of drama.
There are a lot of exciting places around (NASCAR), but nothing
like this place.''
</P>
<P>
   But the track, now owned by Speedway Motorsports Inc., was not
always Winston Cup's hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Clark, the president and general manager of Atlanta Motor
Speedway, worked in public relations at Bristol from 1977-82. He
said a big turnaround in the track's history was when lights were
installed during his first year.

KAUFFMANN MOVES CLOSER TO MAIN DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky . , Ind.)  By RON DICKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cedric Kauffmann was a long shot to compete in this
week's U.S. Open qualifying. Now he is on the verge of making the
main draw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann, who is from a suburb of Paris, is No. 312 in the ATP
rankings. With little chance of playing at all, he flew to New York
as the second alternate for the qualifying rounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the first alternate, Karsten Braasch, reported 15 minutes
late to Monday's sign-in, so Kauffmann replaced him. On Tuesday,
Gregory Carraz pulled out of the competition with an injury,
allowing Kauffmann into the bracket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Kauffmann has pounced on the opportunity. In the
first round he defeated Marcos Ondruska, once ranked 26th, in
straight sets. Friday he beat another tour veteran, Marc-Kevin
Goellner, 7-6 (4), 7-5. To get into the main draw, which begins
Monday, Kauffmann must defeat the journeyman Mark Knowles on
Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be nervous in the warm-up, but after that I'll
be fine,'' said Kauffmann, a baseline specialist with quick feet.
``I have nothing to lose. I got very, very lucky. This is a chance
of a lifetime.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann has made $7,500 for reaching the final qualifying
round, nearly twice as much as his prize money total for the year.
He plays mostly in entry-level professional tournaments called
Futures. In his last Futures event, he earned $117 for losing in
the first round. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staying at a friend's apartment in Brooklyn, Kauffmann takes the
subway to the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona
Park, in Queens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann, who earned a finance degree at the University of
Kentucky, is not banking on an athletic career. Every day he stops
at a Kinko's near Grand Central Terminal to check his stocks on the
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make more money in finance than I ever will in tennis,''
he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vinck Qualifies  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christian Vinck of Germany is the only player to beat Andre
Agassi in Agassi's hometown of Las Vegas. Vinck, who accomplished
that feat at a minor tournament in 1997, updated his resume Friday
by qualifying for the Open with a 6-1, 6-2 third-round victory over
James Sekulov.
</P>
<P>
   Olympians Fare Well  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olympians in the Sydney Games had a good day Friday. Sebastien
Lareau of Canada earned a spot in the Open's main draw by defeating
Hugo Armando, 6-4, 6-3. Alex O'Brien, a doubles specialist, is a
victory away from qualifying for singles after he beat Michael
Kohlmann, 7-6, 6-3. Other second-round winners in the men's bracket
were Wayne Black of Zimbabwe and Barry Cowan of Britain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Petra Mandula will have a chance at the
main draw before she represents Hungary in the Games. Mandula
defeated Anca Barna of Germany, 2-6, 7-5, 6-0. Janet Lee, who was
born in Lafayette, Ind., but will represent Taiwan in the Olympics,
needed three sets to beat Anna Zarska of Poland, 6-0, 3-6, 6-0. Lee
must win her match on Saturday to make the Open. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucic Coming Back  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mirjana Lucic took another step toward rebuilding her career by
winning her third straight match to qualify for the main draw.
Lucic, whose WTA ranking has plummeted 202nd from 32nd, dropped the
first set to Sandra Nacuk and was down 2-0 in the second before
rebounding for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Motivated to Win  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that he would rather qualify as a winner than a lucky
loser, Israel's Harel Levy trounced Rodolphe Cadart, 6-1, 6-0. As
the top-ranked qualifier, Levy was already assured of a spot in the
main draw. &QL;

THIS IS THE BIG ONE FOR VARGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Fernando Vargas calls this his megafight.
</P>
<P>
   For if the Oxnard resident fails to beat relative unknown Ross
Thompson tonight in a championship bout televised on HBO, his dream
fight against Felix Trinidad _ tentatively scheduled for Dec.2 _
would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not incentive enough, Thompson has been kind enough to
provide more: The No.1 contender out of Buffalo, N.Y., hasn't
stopped insulting the champion since the fight was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity boiled over at a news conference on Thursday, when
Thompson punched Vargas and Vargas responded in kind before
security guards were able to restore order. Vargas was left with a
bloody lip and bubbling rage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bulk of his focus has shifted from Trinidad and what
that fight could mean to Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is going to get punished before he gets knocked out,''
Vargas said during the news conference. ``I'm definitely going to
carry him for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get hurt. He's definitely going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson (24-3-1, with 16 knockouts) probably would've gotten
hurt even if he'd kept his mouth shut and his hands to himself. But
he's a great talker. His insults _ ``He's a bum. He can't fight,''
for instance _ are genuine but also calculated. He said calmly a
few days before the fight that he intended to get under Vargas'
skin.
</P>
<P>
   However, he doesn't appear to have the skills to back up his
mouth. Thompson was a candidate to make the 1992 Olympic team but
failed and has lost his biggest fights as a pro, to James Page and
Oba Carr.
</P>
<P>
   This, he can only hope, is his coming out even though he's a
30-1 underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed my time would come and this is it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas (19-0, 17 KOs) has a history of losing his cool outside
the ring. The scuffle on Thursday and his pending assault case are
the latest proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   However, even a prefight punch to the jaw isn't likely to knock
Vargas off his game. In the ring, he dismantles his opponents
methodically and without a trace of emotion. He's too smart and has
too much at stake to make a mistake as a result of a no-name
fighter's empty bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never in my life lost my head in the ring,'' Vargas said
earlier this week. ``I'm not saying I haven't on the outside but
I've never lost it on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks I'm going to get mad and go off my game plan,
it'll never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas certainly was calm and cool in his last fight, an
impressive decision over tough-as-they-come Ike Quartey in April.
Vargas stood up to Quartey's relentless aggression and simply
outworked his Ghanaian challenger.
</P>
<P>
   That victory further established Vargas' reputation as a rising
star and set the stage for the possible fight with Trinidad in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Vargas is excited about that prospect. He could climb
to the top of the boxing world with a victory _ which translates
into boundless riches and fame _ after a mere 21 fights.
</P>
<P>
   He probably would be an underdog but many experts believe he has
a good chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything I've ever wished for and prayed to God for,''
he said. ``I feel I'm not getting the recognition I should be
getting, being rated as one of the very best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand I have to keep proving people wrong, though. And
that's what I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he has something to prove to Thompson. &QL;

SURFING THE NET:  TECH-WARY BOARD RIDERS FIND THE WEB ISN'T ALL WET &HT;      By GREG AMBROSE
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dr. Mark Renneker is no technophobe. He's just
angry that technology has sullied the purity of the sport he loves:
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate how surfers are allowing themselves to be enslaved by
being spoon fed by the Internet services,'' Renneker said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when a record heat wave one week made conditions
hellish for the staff and patients at San Francisco General
Hospital, Renneker planned a last-minute surf getaway by
downloading a weather map packed with arcane meteorological icons
and lines.
</P>
<P>
   After expertly analyzing the data, Renneker then jumped on a
flight to Alaska, where he and a friend surfed fun waves under the
midnight sun. He made it back to the hospital before his next
shift.
</P>
<P>
   In an irony not lost on many surfers, people who disdain the
metaphor ``surfing the Net'' as demeaning to their sport are
increasingly turning to the Web to help them find waves.
</P>
<P>
   This shifting tide has online surf sites ramping up staffs and
utilizing the latest in technology _ from Webcams to satellite
imagery to real-time ocean buoy wave reports _ in the hopes of
pocketing a piece of the $2 billion surfing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two most advanced surf sites, San Francisco startups
Swell.com and Hardcloud.com, are battling for the attention of
reluctant Net &LR;   &LR; surfers like Renneker, who are juggling the demands
of career and family as they continue to pursue their passion for
wave riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is, where people spend their time is where they
will spend their money,'' says Hardcloud.com Editor Jim Kempton,
who found the perfect lure to steer traffic to Hardcloud by
purchasing Surfcheck, an Internet surf-forecasting site.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kempton, Hardcloud.com, with an office in San
Francisco's Mission District, wants to provide a global village
that quickly and easily connects the scattered surfing tribes with
information about other surfers, events and surf destinations
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in February with $6.5 million in venture capital,
Hardcloud's editorial staff is paying itself miserly wages by
dot-com standards. But the online surf magazine is nurturing its
cash until the real moneymaker begins to pay off: the Internet surf
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainability is the big mantra in the editorial offices
here,'' said Kempton, who is counting on sponsorships with the
print media and other companies as well as e-commerce to eventually
pay the bills and turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if we capture the volume of the 10 best shops,
we're going to make it,'' says Kempton, whose company scored a coup
in a musical alliance with MP3.com. ``We'll be bigger than most of
the shops in the industry and able to market to thousands of people
who aren't able to get to a surf shop now.''
</P>
<P>
   Swell.com, located in San Francisco's Richmond District, is also
working toward becoming a one-stop shop to fill surfers' needs for
information, entertainment, surf clothing and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   AN EYE ON THE COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both sites are closely matching each other's moves.
</P>
<P>
   Both startups have been cruising the virtual waters like
ravenous great white sharks, devouring smaller surf Web sites and
print media surfing editors and writers in an effort to become the
apex predator in the online ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Swell.com is spending its $15 million in venture capital raiding
the offices of print media surf magazines in the Media Valley of
San Clemente (Orange County), heart of the surf industry and where
both startups have offices. Hardcloud's Kempton, a former editor of
Surfer magazine, also has recruited photographers, editors and
writers, leaving the print surf media scrambling for replacements
in a field where experienced workers are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Both startups are also keeping a wary eye on extreme-sports
sites Bluetorch and EXPN, which focus on streaming videos of
surfing competition and travel adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Hardcloud got its rival's attention by acquiring Surfcheck,
which uses 100 spotters around the world to report on surf
conditions at top beaches, augmented by 125 strategically placed
cameras that let surfers view real-time waves from California to
South Africa and prime surf spots in between. Additionally, trained
meteorologists' long-range forecasts of significant swells help
fuel surfers' exotic travel dreams and provide practical local
information.
</P>
<P>
   Swell immediately bested Hardcloud by acquiring Surfline, the
father of all surf-forecasting sites.
</P>
<P>
   Surfline provides computer programs and data that allow people
to do their own forecasts, but not everyone is willing to invest
the necessary time. ``Most people just want us to tell them what
the waves are going to be like, and we do that for them,'' said
Sean Collins, Surfline's founder, who took surf forecasting out of
the dark ages by adapting government meteorological data and
tailoring it toward surfers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every surfer is a surf forecaster, always looking at wind,
tides, swell, doing the calculations in their head,'' Collins
added. ``We're just carrying it a little bit further for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Surfline's subscription fax system, which contains detailed
reports and toll-call services that provide the same daily reports
and long-term forecasts, surfers are able to keep working until
they see a swell predicted a week in advance, take some vacation
time and head to Mexico or Costa Rica for the swell's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Surfline had an immediate benefit for Swell. Many of
the 5 million people who access Surfline's faxes and who make 1
million toll calls yearly now swarm to Swell.com for free online
reports and forecasts. Additionally, Surfline now offers Surf
Alert, which e-mails surfers when a good swell is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTOR'S DUTY
</P>
<P>
   In Half Moon Bay, it is crucial that Jeff Clark has the
most-precise weather information available each winter when he runs
the Men Who Ride Mountains surfing contest at Mavericks, the
treacherous surf spot off Pillar Point.
</P>
<P>
   As the contest director, it is his job to alert a special group
of surfers from Australia, Hawaii and throughout California to grab
a plane for the day that the waves will be epic for the surf
contest. Clark relies on his own years of experience interpreting
conditions that he can see in the ocean near his home, as well as
storms thousands of miles away visible on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also seeks input from Mark Sponsler of StormSurf, whose
incredibly detailed and sophisticated reports Clark shares with
other surfers on his Web site, www.maverickssurf.com.
</P>
<P>
   With such expertise for the surfing masses to tap into,
forewarned surfers swarm the coast well before most swells actually
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   While appreciating Sponsler's input and accurate forecasts,
Clark is pleased that many smaller swells slip under StormSurf's
radar screen. ``I'm a firm believer that the guy who gets up early
and checks out the ocean deserves to be the only guy out,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, what the satellites say and what I see hitting the
shore are different. Nothing beats experience, and knowing what you
are looking at,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   SHOCK OF THE NEW
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult task for the surf Web sites is convincing the
purists to embrace the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Bay Area wave riders, former Surfer magazine editor
Matt Warshaw is tormented by his relationship with the Internet.
Warshaw likes to keep his search for surf low-tech as an antidote
to the high-tech nature of just about everything in the Bay Area,
but his link to Swell complicates his quest for simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, the author of the surfing world's first encyclopedia,
is the online librarian for Swell, letting its writers use his
extensive computerized database of surfing literature that reaches
back to the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   With great difficulty, Warshaw has refrained from using Swell's
online surf-forecast services, preferring to find waves through
traditional methods. ``I made sure I live near the beach with a
good view of the surf, and look at it in the morning and plan my
day,'' said the Sunset District resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, I'm still single and can afford to live where I
want. If I suddenly had a family and lived 20 miles inland, I'd
probably log on to the beach cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   FEWER PHONE CALLS
</P>
<P>
   For years, Warshaw has been deluged by calls from friends asking
about the surf conditions. But these days, the calls come less
often as more of his friends surf the Internet to find out about
the waves. Technology also has intruded on his quietly satisfying
morning surf-check ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel good to stand on the bluff at Taraval Street
with two surf cameras aimed at you,'' Warshaw said. ``It feels like
you're at the 7-Eleven, or in a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Renneker, the San Francisco physician, has spent years teaching
himself the intricacies of surf forecasting, learning to decipher
isobars, barometric pressure, wind gradients, fetch and other
elements essential for understanding how waves are created. He
makes deft use of modern technology in his search for waves, and
yet he is no friend of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the increased access to information about weather and
swell forecasting to really run against the grain of the nature of
surfing,'' Renneker said. ``By that I mean the surprise, the
wonderment of getting out and finding the surf yourself, the
adventure and thrill of discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE
</P>
<P>
   Renneker points out that before technology allowed surfers to
peer into the heart of storms to determine when and where the
wind-born waves would arrive, surfers roamed the coast by car,
searching for surf. And along the way they gained knowledge of how
the swells, winds and tides interact differently at each surf spot
to produce good waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That knowledge is being lost among surfers,'' Renneker said.
``The new technology also creates disappointment more often than
happiness. If a swell is forecast and you have a picture of it in
your mind, if it isn't what you expect, then you have scorn for
what you find.''
</P>
<P>
   SurfFax creator Steve Decile is amused by his longtime
collaborator's disdain for high tech. ``Doc pooh-poohs the
technology, but I send him eight pages a day of material I get off
the Internet and he uses it for his own surf forecasts.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Decile, he still finds wonderment in his relationship
with the ocean, even though technology has stripped away much of
the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving down the street, I'll see a swell and say to my wife,
`Look at that, that is from a storm 11 days ago off New Zealand and
I predicted the waves.' I still can't get over that after all these
years.''

AVAILABILITY OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA ONLINE CAN BE A DOUBLE-EDGED
SWORD &HT;    By GREG AMBROSE
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Rapid advances in technology can create growth
opportunities for some surf-forecasting companies while leaving
others high and dry.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of meteorological data online has been a
blessing and a curse to SurfFax founder Steve Decile, who has
attracted enough paid subscribers to turn his hobby into a
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   Faxing was high tech nearly a decade ago, when the Santa Barbara
surfer decided that surf reports delivered over the telephone were
too difficult to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you could give more information on paper and save
the paper and use it as a journal,'' Decile said. ``It makes an
excellent reference library.''
</P>
<P>
   So Decile became a student of meteorology with an emphasis on
surf forecasting, and working out of his home by computer he
created SurfFax. He shared each of his hard-learned meteorological
lessons with his subscribers, using humor and insight to teach them
how to become their own surf forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of subscribers across the Pacific have come to rely on
the detailed SurfFax reports and weather charts that forecast
swells and describe wave conditions. One of the customers he is
most proud of is the Army Corps of Engineers, which uses his faxes
to help with its coastal projects.
</P>
<P>
   But high technology is constantly being surpassed by higher
technology, and the same online data that have made Decile's
forecasting work easier have resulted in companies like
Hardcloud.com and Swell.com being able to lure his customers away
for a free ride on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mark Sponsler wouldn't mind growing rich through his
devotion to high technology, but the creator of StormSurf is too
busy enjoying the ride. Advertising barely pays to keep his site
operating, which is OK with Sponsler, who enjoys comparing ideas
and knowledge with others who share his passion for surf
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to make a living off of it,'' he says. ``We
could dummy it down a lot and widen our audience, but our focus is
for expert-level surfers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsler sees broadband Internet access as the wave of surfing's
forecasting future, with cable modems and DSL enabling people to
make full use of the incredible amount of weather data available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that, you're back in the Stone Age,'' says Sponsler.
His observations show that people are hitting his site during
working hours Monday through Friday, which tells him they are at
work using machines with high-speed Net connections. That allows
them to easily access graphics from the government-sponsored
QuikSat satellite program that displays wind speed and wind
direction across 95 percent of the ocean's surface every day, a
technology only recently made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look right into storms as they are forming, see how
big the fetch (the distance that the wind blows across the ocean,
which creates waves) is and confirm what wave models suspect is
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   StormSurf.com is a serious site geared toward experienced
surfers with a desire to learn more about meteorology. The free
site examines significant storms in the Pacific and forecasts the
surf they will generate. The site also provides an in-depth series
of links and tools to allow surfers to expand their knowledge and
even take information from the center of storm, plug it into a
Java-based program and see exactly when the swell will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, we used to waste a lot of time driving around
looking for waves. Now you can have it all scoped out before you
leave home,'' Sponsler says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd that surfs Mavericks (in Half Moon Bay) are ocean
engineers, lawyers, doctors, environmental scientists, very
successful in their professions. Forecasting helps people narrow
that target to make maximum use of the precious surf time they
have, and then spend more time doing meaningful things with other
people.''

ORACLE TO OFFER FREE SALES SOFTWARE &HT;    By KELLY ZITO
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a direct swipe at market leader Siebel
Systems, Oracle Corp. next week will begin giving away software
over the Internet that is designed to manage sales data.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the world's No. 2 software company will officially
launch OracleSalesOnline.com. Instead of installing software from
CDs, salespeople will be able to manage contact information,
scheduling and sales forecasts through the site using a Web
browser. The software, called ``sales-force automation,'' resides
on Oracle servers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Redwood Shores company is making its
software available online for free, according to Lisa Arthur,
Oracle's vice president of e-business marketing. The company
specializes in developing software that stores and manages vast
amounts of corporate data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed event in sales-force automation,'' Arthur
said. ``It gives people a way to get into e-business quickly at no
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the company is up-front about the money-making strategy
behind the tactic _ Oracle hopes to sell additional sales and
marketing software as well as consulting services to the users of
OracleSalesOnline _ it doesn't mention the venture's other goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fully featured product directly aimed at Siebel, the
company which clearly leads the market,'' wrote Lehman Bros.
analyst Neil Herman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle is giving away the first dose for free and then
charging once you're addicted to the results,'' Herman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One competitor said such a ``Trojan Horse'' strategy will likely
alienate potential Oracle customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to make money by selling add-ons and services,''
said Keith Raffel, founder of Mountain View's UpShot.com, which
offers sales-automation software for $55 per month per user. ``With
us, it's what you see is what you get. We don't have hidden
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo's Siebel Systems, the No. 1 maker of so-called
customer-relationship management software, also took the
announcement in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been working on this for five years and they have less
than 1 percent market share,'' Siebel chief executive Tom Siebel
told Bloomberg News this week. ``So the fact that they have another
product that they're shipping for free is no news.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Oracle has ``little presence'' in the sales-force
automation market, Herman wrote. And free software may do little to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is some risk in this strategy, as sophisticated
buyers typically associate free software with lower quality or lack
of depth and breadth of functionality,'' Herman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said the software code is exactly the same as the one a
customer would receive on a traditional CD.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Oracle said 300 companies are using OracleSalesOnline,
including NetLedger, a San Mateo online accounting firm, Enterprise
Rental Car and GE Medical Systems.

VENUS WILLIAMS AND SELES SET FOR NEW HAVEN SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Monica Seles, still trying to regain the form
that made her one of the dominant women's players in the early
1990s, and Venus Williams, the reigning Wimbledon champion, won
Friday to set up a showdown between the top two seeded players in
Saturday's final of the Pilot Pen tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Seles, the winner of nine Grand Slam titles
but none since 1996, recovered to beat the veteran Nathalie
Tauziat, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, Friday afternoon at the Connecticut Tennis
Center. On Friday night, the top-seeded Williams, who has won her
last three tournaments and 18 matches in a row, defeated Amanda
Coetzer, the fifth-seeded player, 6-3, 6-4, in the second
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has beaten the 26-year-old Seles in all three of their
previous meetings, including a final two weeks ago in San Diego,
when Williams was extended to three sets before defeating Seles,
6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 2 inches and 120 pounds, the 28-year-old Coetzer gave
away 11 inches and 40 pounds to Williams. And where Williams is a
power hitter, Coetzer is a counterpuncher whose only chance Friday
night, she conceded before the match, was to induce errors. She did
that, since Williams committed 26 unforced errors. But Williams
compensated for those errors with 26 winners, two aces and about a
dozen service winners.
</P>
<P>
   Coetzer took a 3-2 lead in the first set on a service break in
the fifth game. But she could never break Williams' serve again and
was broken three times under Williams' withering ground-stroke
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Tauziat had never won a set from Seles in nine
previous meetings on clay, grass, hard courts and indoor carpet.
But she took advantage of a slow start by Seles and won the opening
set by breaking Seles' serve in the first and third games while
saving break points in the second and fourth games. Seles, who got
in only 48 percent of her first serves in the
one-hour-and-22-minute match, committed 15 unforced errors in the
first set.
</P>
<P>
   But Seles, who has won three tournaments this year and is ranked
sixth in the world, got stronger and steadier as the match
progressed while Tauziat gradually faltered.

ENGVIST ON A ROLL AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Thomas Engvist of Sweden, it could be coming together at the
right time. Engvist, who took the title in Cincinnati earlier this
month and then reached the quarterfinals in Indianapolis, defeated
Fabrice Santoro in straight sets Friday in Commack, N.Y. The
victory propelled him into the Hamlet Cup semifinals and signaled
his readiness for next week's U.S. Open. ``Everyone has different
ways of preparing for the big ones,'' said Engvist, who is seeded
seventh for the Open. ``For myself, I like to play a lot of
matches. When I do that, I play better. I'm confident, I'm winning
matches ... this has been the best I've been preparing ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Serving 11 aces and refusing to be goaded by Santoro's
frustrating array of drop shots, slices and dinks, Engvist rallied
from 0-4 in the first set to post a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory. Saturday,
Enqvist will face the winner of the match between Michael Chang and
Arnaud Clement of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one on the tour plays like Fabrice,'' said the third-seeded
Engvist. ``I thought it was a really good match.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's other semifinal, top-seeded Magnus Norman, the Swede
who is the defending champion, will play 11th-seeded Richard
Krajicek of the Netherlands. Krajicek was waved into the semifinals
on a walkover when Carlos Moya withdrew Friday morning with an
injury to his right big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Moya, who defeated Jan-Michael Gambill 3-6, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5),
apparently injured his toe during the match, which began Thursday
evening but lasted past midnight. His status for the U.S. Open is
uncertain, although he insisted he would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not even thinking about not playing,'' Moya said. ``I am
hoping to play.''

PROMISES OF CUTBACKS FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Democrats and Republicans pretend to represent distinct
choices in governance, there's one area where you can't tell fish
from fowl.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Contract with America and the GOP's triumphant
battle for Capitol Hill supremacy? Remember the pledges to downsize
government?
</P>
<P>
   Well, after all was said and done, the revolutionary Republicans
proved no less enthusiastic about big government than the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know this? Stephen Moore, the Cato Institute's
director of fiscal policy studies, and fiscal policy analyst
Stephen Slivinski recently completed a study titled ``Return of the
Living Dead: Federal Programs That Survived the Republican
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   What's most impressive about their revelations is how the
GOP-controlled Congress not only failed to shrink the leviathan,
but also how it gave many programs in question more money than even
the Clinton administration had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Total nondefense spending will expand by 11 percent in real
inflation-adjusted terms from 1999-2001. Overall expenditures for
95 of the largest ``living dead'' programs have risen 13 percent
since Republicans took over Congress in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major reason for all the new spending,'' Moore and Slivinski
say, ``is the inability or unwillingness of Republicans to
eliminate virtually any government program.'' Thus, they say, there
seems to be a consensus in Washington that ``the era of big
government is here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the truly great ironies is that some surviving programs
weren't just GOP ``Contract'' targets, but also had been singled
out for elimination as far back as '92 by California Democrat Leon
Panetta when he was House Budget Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After an impressive beginning following the 1994 election that
gave congressional control to Republicans, the GOP apparently lost
its nerve. Nearly 200 programs were axed from 1995-97 and domestic
discretionary spending declined slightly in real terms. Since the
first year of the Republican revolution, though, ``the trend has
clearly been toward more expansive budgets each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting failure of the GOP will involved
the Commerce, Education and Energy departments, which the
revolutionaries had vowed to dismantle. Not only have they
survived, but two of the three Cabinet agencies enjoy significantly
larger budgets now than they did five years ago. The GOP, in fact,
has spent more on the Education Department than the White House
proposed two of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   This is a development largely overlooked by fiscal mavens,
probably because the emergence of a putative budget surplus has
made the quest to rein in federal spending a matter of less
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus, however, is a chimera mostly created by surpluses
from excess Social Security revenues and taxes dedicated to
specific spending activities but not appropriated for the intended
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   There may indeed by good reasons to choose sides this election
year based on the parties' respective differences. As it happens,
though, spending proclivities isn't one of those differences.

WOODS BREAKING RECORDS, NOT WINNING HABIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Tiger Woods has developed two habits he does not
want to break: winning golf tournaments and setting records.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's second round of the NEC Invitational, Woods
added another spectacular day to his spectacular summer. He flirted
with shooting a 59. He tied the Firestone Country Club course
record, shooting a 9-under-par 61. And by building a seven-stroke
lead, he threatened to turn another tournament into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no ill effects from last weekend's emotional victory at
the PGA Championship, Woods was 15-under, seven strokes ahead of
Phil Mickelson and eight strokes ahead of Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   It has become obvious that Woods does not believe in letdowns.
Instead, he never lets up. His score of 125 set a PGA Tour record
for 36 holes, breaking the old mark of 126 set by six other
players. Woods also tied the course record of 61 set by Jose Maria
Olazabal in 1990, and it was Woods' 29th consecutive round of
shooting even par or better, another tour record. Both Mark O'Meara
(1993) and Craig Stadler (1997) have shot 28 consecutive rounds of
even par or better, but since 1980, when the tour began keeping
that statistic, nobody had shot 29 consecutive rounds without
shooting over par.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, that is, until Friday. From the first few holes, it was
obvious Woods was on top of his game, which meant he would finish
on top of the leader board. The big question was: How low would he
go? Through his first seven holes, Woods was five under par for the
day, and some people in his gallery began screaming, ``Fifty-nine,
fifty-nine.'' Only three players in tour history have shot 59 in
competition _ Al Geiberger, Chip Beck and David Duval. Woods didn't
get the 59. But that didn't spoil his day.
</P>
<P>
   How does it feel to be in the kind of zone Woods is in?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an idea of where you want to put the golf ball, and
you're able to do it,'' said Woods, who put himself in excellent
position to win this World Golf Championships event for the second
consecutive year. ``The game looks easier when you do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked easier than easy for Woods. It looked almost
effortless, an awesome display of power, control and putting. On
the par-5, 625-yard No. 16, one of the most famous holes in golf,
Woods became only the fourth player to send a ball flying over the
green in two shots, joining Arnold Palmer, Raymond Floyd and John
Daly.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a 356-yard drive, Woods cooked a 2-iron shot that
landed 6 feet past the pin and rolled into the back rough. The
crowd went wild. Woods almost made eagle when he barely missed his
chip shot from 20 feet, but he converted the next putt for birdie
while giving another example of how his game differs from everyone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also birdied the par-4 No. 17 to reach nine under par,
meaning he needed an eagle at the par-4 No. 18 to make 59. After
hitting his tee shot at No. 18 into the right rough, Woods hit his
approach shot over the green, chipped to 8 feet, then made the putt
for par to shoot 61.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps two missed putts cost Woods a chance at 59 _ a 15-foot
birdie putt at No. 13 that stopped just short of the hole, and a
4-foot putt that Woods missed at No. 14 that led to his only bogey
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he never seriously considered shooting 59. His main
goal was to increase the one-shot lead he started the day with.
From that perspective, the day was a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, meanwhile, had to feel somewhat helpless. The
majors are over, Woods has won seven times this year, and this
37-player event is an excellent chance for a huge payday, with a $5
million purse and $1 million going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But in Woods' case, the rich may get even richer. How was
Mickelson supposed to feel? He shot his second consecutive 66, he
started the day with a birdie and an eagle, yet Mickelson lost
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking a lot more under par to win tournaments now,''
said Mickelson, who will be paired with Woods in Saturday's final
group.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Woods was paired with Jim Furyk, who shot a 69, but
who could not keep up.
</P>
<P>
   On No. 11, Furyk hit a great approach shot within 4 feet of the
pin. But Woods outdid him, hitting a wedge shot from 80 yards that
landed inside of Furyk's ball, 3 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day. And Woods still had the weekend to try
and outdo himself
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Tiger ever enters a tournament that he doesn't
think he can win,'' said Fluff Cowan, who caddies for Furyk and who
used to caddie for Woods. ``Nearly flawless golf. That's how I'd
describe what I saw today.'' &QL;

KANSAS MAN SET FOR SENTENCING ON SEX OFFENSES HANGS SELF IN JAIL
CELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A man facing almost 30 years in prison for
sexual encounters with young girls used a bed sheet to hang himself
early Friday in his Johnson County, Kan., jail cell, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre M. Nammour, who was scheduled to be sentenced next week in
Johnson County District Court, had been in the jail in Olathe since
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy making a bed check discovered the 35-year-old Fairway
resident about 12:10 a.m. Friday, according to Sheriff's Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics were called, but efforts to revive Nammour were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The individual-inmate cells in the facility that opened in 1988
were designed to prevent such incidents, but authorities said that
Nammour had been able to attach the sheet to an air vent. Although
the county recently opened a new jail, many prisoners still are at
the old jail, including maximum-security inmates such as murder
suspect John Edward Robinson Sr.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy had checked on Nammour less than 30 minutes before his
body was found, and authorities were attempting to pin down exactly
how long it had been. Cell checks routinely are made every 15 to 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although they did not term it a suicide note, officials also
said they had recovered a letter addressed to one of Nammour's
relatives in which he described his state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   A news release from Nammour's attorney, Patrick W. Peters, said
Nammour had previously told police and jail officials that he had
felt like killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was not on suicide watch at the time of his death, jail
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been put on suicide watch earlier, but jail psychiatric
personnel had subsequently approved his removal from that status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre felt very bad about the pain he had caused to others,''
Peters said in his news release. ``He pled guilty so that the three
girls would not have to come to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Nammour pleaded guilty in July to charges of rape, aggravated
criminal sodomy and two counts of indecent liberties with a child.
The charges involved 13- and 15-year-old sisters and another girl
who was 11 at the time videotapes were made.
</P>
<P>
   Police had recovered videotapes of Nammour having sex with the
girls, according to prosecutors and police. Detectives with the
Sheriff's Department estimated that they recovered about 1,000
hours of video footage involving six girls.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys were to recommend a 29-year prison term at his
sentencing, scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last jail suicide in Johnson County was in March 1995, when
a Fairway man jailed on arson charges used a cord from a laundry
bag to hang himself.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at that time said it was the first suicide at the jail
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, a convicted sex offender who was going to be
sentenced to prison shot himself to death in a Johnson County
Courthouse rest room.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was free on bond before his sentencing, smuggled a
.357-caliber handgun into the courthouse. Metal detectors have
since been posted at courthouse entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said members of Nammour's family were traveling to the
Kansas City area Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nammour was an emigre from Lebanon who had come to the United
States in 1988 after fighting for a pro-Israeli and American
militia, according to Peters.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked in the United States as a computer technician.

SKIMMING IS A SECRET NO MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Jockey Garrett Gomez was leaning against a
wall at trainer Bobby Frankel's barn one morning this week,
speaking of the splendors of the colt named Skimming, when Frankel
walked out of his office and joined the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't brag on this horse too much,'' Frankel admonished
half-seriously. ``I like to sneak in the back door. Like North
Carolina State when they won the NCAA.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's allusion to a 1983 basketball tournament is a bit out
of date _ but then, so is his wish to keep Skimming a secret going
into the $1 million Pacific Classic today at Del Mar racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   If Skimming's potential ever was a secret, it was given away
when the 4-year-old son of Nureyev and Skimble won the San Diego
Handicap earlier this month by eight dominant lengths over Prime
Timber. That gate-to-wire victory made Skimming the ``now'' horse
and the obvious choice for bettors hoping to beat Pacific Classic
favorite and defending champion General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   All Frankel, a Hall of Famer and a four-time Pacific
Classic-winning trainer, has to do is maintain Skimming's recent
form, and the horse's front-running speed should be too much for
his six opponents in the 1-mile signature race of the Del Mar
summer.
</P>
<P>
   That's easier said than done, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race (the San Diego) might have been too good,'' Frankel
said, worrying that Skimming might have run the race of his life
three weeks too soon. ``The edge I've got going in this race is
that I don't think anybody can run with him early. The negative is
that I'm picking up weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Skimming will carry 124 pounds, like all of the older horses in
the Pacific Classic, while 3-year-old Tiznow will get in with 117.
Skimming's burden is 12 more than he had in the 11/16-mile San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle: He hasn't run in a Grade I stakes before, and
hasn't won a race as long as 1{ miles.
</P>
<P>
   And another: He no longer has the element of surprise. The other
riders know they can't let Skimming get away with an easy lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankel believes any horse who tries to stay with Skimming
in the opening furlongs will be committing ``suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also trains one of the other potential early-speed
horses in the Pacific Classic. That's the 4-year-old gelding
Euchre, winner of the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park last time
out. Skimming is owned by Juddmonte Farms, Euchre by Frank
Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Frankel instructs Euchre jockey David Flores to lay off
the pace, an early challenge to Skimming could come from Tiznow or
Forty One Carats _ or from nobody. Tiznow will race without
blinkers this time, indicating trainer Jay Robbins wants him to lag
early and wait for the front-runners to tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Skimming) runs like he did last time, you know he'll be
in front turning for home,'' said Frankel, whose Missionary Ridge
(1992) and Bertrando (1993) scored the only gate-to-wire victories
in the Pacific Classic's nine runnings.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel thinks Skimming ran so brilliantly in his prep _ going
three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 3/5 finishing in 1:41 _ because he
took to the Del Mar surface particularly well. It was the colt's
first race at Del Mar, and it marked his third victory in five
starts since coming to the United States from England, where the
rules prohibited treating his pulmonary bleeding problem with
lasix.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't one of the stronger Pacific Classic fields. Early
Pioneer, the longshot Hollywood Gold Cup winner, is out with a
minor injury. A Skimming victory might be the most exciting
possible result.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who picked up the mount because Alex Solis was out of
town on the day of the San Diego, thinks Skimming shows the
qualities of a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good horse has got to be able to make (multiple) moves
throughout a race, and he can do it,'' Gomez said. ``If they're
going slow, he can be on the lead, and if they're going fast, he
can sit second or third.''
</P>
<P>
   Skimming showed he isn't a one-dimensional front-runner when he
rallied from a close fourth to win his U.S. debut under Solis.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, 32, a fringe top-10 jockey at Del Mar, was the regular
rider for the popular Budroyale, and guided Concern to victory in
the 1994 Arkansas Derby. Asked this week to name the best horse he
has been on, Gomez thought for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be ... this horse right here,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Frankel asked Gomez not to give away the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. &QL;

SEVEN DODGERS SUBPOENAED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A defense lawyer said seven members of the Dodgers
organization, including manager Davey Johnson and general manager
Kevin Malone, were served subpoenas Friday to testify in the
criminal proceedings stemming from the arrest of a fan during the
May 16 fight at Wrigley Field in which several players and coaches
went into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ronald Camacho, who was arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct and has a history of problems with the law, said
catcher Chad Kreuter, right fielder Shawn Green, left fielder Gary
Sheffield and coaches Glenn Hoffman and Rick Dempsey were also
subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   The papers were served through Chicago attorney Mike Abernathy,
who was retained by the Dodgers to handle the case here.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adamski, one of the lawyers representing Camacho, said a
date for a criminal case hasn't been set, but he believed it would
take place in October. Adamski said a civil case was still pending
against the Chicago Cubs, the Dodgers and several of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to do with the criminal case,'' Adamski said. ``We
want these guys to come in. They are the best proof to show how
chaotic it was in the stands. What's going on right now only
concerns the criminal case. The civil case will have a life of its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was in the stands watching the game and came onto the
field when the altercation escalated. However, the Dodgers have
been instructed not to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot comment on pending litigation,'' Dodgers senior vice
president Derrick Hall said. ``The players all gave the lawyer we
have locally in Chicago the authority to accept (the subpoena).''
</P>
<P>
   Adamski said his immediate focus is the criminal case, but each
of the members of the Dodgers organization served with a subpoena
would be targets for a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get over the fact Kevin Malone went on the field,''
Adamski said. ``Davey Johnson was (served) because he was right in
there. Hoffman and Dempsey went in (the stands) and were in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Green, in the tape we've seen he wasn't doing much and
he may be dropped. Sheffield was being a thug and so was Kreuter.''
</P>
<P>
   Camacho was one of three fans arrested in the aftermath of the
fight in which several members of the Dodgers went into the stands
and battled with fans.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball suspended 16 players, three coaches and an on-field
assistant for a total of 89 games and fined them $77,000. That was
later reduced to five players, two coaches, an on-field assistant
and $71,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Of those subpoenaed, only Kreuter (eight games), Sheffield
(five) and Dempsey (eight) were ultimately suspended.
</P>
<P>
   SHEFF'S STATUS: Sheffield, sitting out his five-game suspension
and nursing a flu-like bug, remained in Los Angeles instead of
accompanying the team to Chicago. Sheffield, who leads the Dodgers
with a .331 average, 40 homers and 96 RBI, is eligible to return
for Sunday's series finale with the Cubs, but team officials said
he may not be healthy enough to play until Monday in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Jeff Branson made his first start for the Dodgers
in the first game. He played second base and went 2 for 4. ...
Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw allowed his first run since the All-Star
break when Willie Greene singled in Sammy Sosa with two outs in the
ninth inning of the first game. Shaw's scoreless streak ended at
162/3 innings, but he still recorded his 19th save of the season.
He pitched a scoreless ninth in the second game for his 20th save.
... After getting hits in his last three at-bats Thursday, third
baseman Adrian Beltre went 4 for 4 in the first game and walked in
his first at-bat of the second game. &QL;

TROJANS TAB McCULLOUGH AS STARTING RUNNING BACK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After being coy about who will start at
tailback all training camp, the USC coaching staff has decided that
sophomore Sultan McCullough will make his first career start for
the Trojans against Penn State on Sunday in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sultan will get the start,'' running backs coach Kennedy Pola
said. ``We're gonna mix it up, but Sultan will play in our regular
package and Malaefou (MacKenzie) will play in our three (wide
receiver) package. But we'll change it to keep things
off-balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback was the last position on the depth chart that had not
been officially decided. McCullough and MacKenzie are both expected
to play significant amounts of the game, and senior Petros
Papadakis will play in short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER WEATHER: The Trojans were thrilled with the weather in
the New York-New Jersey area Friday. There was little humidity and
it was cooler than in 1996, when the Trojans also played Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time, I remember it was so hot, I didn't even want to go
inside the Statue of Liberty,'' defensive tackle Ennis Davis said.
``This is much better. I keep praying the weather doesn't change.
But we're prepared for the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S CASEY? Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey was
conspicuous by his absence from Friday's media day. The Nittany
Lions brought several players, but not Casey, who is accused of
felony aggravated assault against an off-duty police officer and
has been a huge source of controversy for head coach Joe Paterno
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he needs this. I don't need this,'' Paterno
said. ``You guys wouldn't let him talk about football.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Casey, Paterno had a surprising response about how
the incident affected his quarterback and the Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might turn out to be a blessing,'' Paterno said. ``He's
really asserted more leadership and the kids have rallied around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno said he told Casey, a native of nearby Hoboken, N.J.,
not to ``let anyone take away from a trip that should be about
going home to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the assault incident, Paterno said he has still not
discussed it with Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine at what point it might be (a distraction),''
Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   SEA SICK: USC wide receiver Marcell Allmond experienced some
problems during the team's cruise of New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick. I don't like that,'' Allmond said. ``My stomach is
still turning but I'll get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allmond, who will start Sunday, should get plenty of
opportunities if the Nittany Lions decide to double-cover wide
receiver Kareem Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping it will be a little bit of a breakout for me,''
Allmond said.
</P>
<P>
   NOT-SO-CLASSIC MEMORY: Paterno claims he doesn't remember that
Curtis Enis gained a Kickoff Classic-record 241 yards against USC
in 1996. But Hackett, who was coaching with the Kansas City Chiefs
at the time, said he knew all about the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alumni have continued to remind me about Curtis Enis and
the outcome of that game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   BOUNCING BACK: Hackett was pleased with USC's energy during a
90-minute practice held at the New York Giants' indoor facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the long plane ride and being stagnant, we needed to
break a sweat,'' Hackett said. ``It was good. I feel we're getting
our energy back.''
</P>
<P>
   SURPRISE VISITOR: New York Giants head coach Jim Fassel, who
played at USC in 1969, stopped by Friday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a USC guy, and he's been a rival,'' Hackett said. ``He
coached at Stanford when I was at USC (as an assistant) and we've
known each other in the NFL. He's also a Manhattan Beach guy.''
</P>
<P>
   BACKUP QUARTERBACK: Former Westlake (Calif.) High quarterback
Zac Wasserman is battling another freshman, Sean Schellenger, for
the No.3 position on the Nittany Lions' depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fine prospect,'' Paterno said. ``But it's hard to get
the freshmen enough work. But one of them might be a backup, so
we've got to get them ready.''
</P>
<P>
   CONFERENCE HONOR: Hackett said he is aware that the sagging
reputation of the Pacific-10 Conference will be at stake again in
this national matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that all the other coaches in this league
said, `Hackett, it's up to you.' That was an indication,'' he said.
``Our feeling is that this is a new year and the Pac-10 will stand
on its own.'' &QL;

 COALITION OF AMERICAN INDIANS PLAN BANK TO SERVICE TRIBAL FINANCIAL
ENDEAVORS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ After two years of planning, 11 Indian tribes
or tribal corporations from across the country, including the
Mashantucket Pequots of Connecticut, have agreed to commit $1
million each to found the nation's largest intertribal bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Native American National Bank, which would have its
headquarters in Denver, would be subject to the same regulations as
any other bank in the United States. It would focus initially on
providing large-scale loans to Indian-owned businesses, though it
would also invest in non-Indian companies, its members said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's goal is to help alleviate the misery afflicting many
American Indians by harnessing hundreds of millions of dollars to
invest in new tribal ventures, like buffalo slaughterhouses in the
Great Plains and lumber mills in the Northwest. The tribes say they
hope to move rapidly into territory that commercial banks _ wary of
the complications and risks associated with lending to Indian
tribes that do not recognize many federal laws _ have long been
reluctant to explore.
</P>
<P>
   But their plan faces hurdles. Though they already have $11
million in pledges, the tribes are seeking to raise another $19
million in start-up capital: $15 million in investments from large
commercial banks and $1 million each from four additional tribes.
And once the money is raised, the bank will need to attract
hundreds of millions of dollars to invest, banking experts said.
Typically, that investment capital comes from deposits, and Indian
officials estimate that existing banks hold at least $200 million
in deposits from tribes and their members.
</P>
<P>
   But there is uncertainty about whether those depositors would
turn their money over to the new bank, and whether there are enough
profitable loans to be made to Indians and tribes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Native American National Bank expects to submit its federal
charter application in October, said Tex Hall, the chairman of
Native American National Bancorp, the bank's holding company, and
of the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the bank would be unique in several respects,
tribal and banking industry officials said. With $30 million in
projected start-up capital, it would be the largest financial
institution ever created, owned and controlled solely by American
Indians, and the first created specifically to invest primarily in
other tribe-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never seen the tribes get together to do a banker's
bank, one that would focus on transactions between tribes
themselves,'' said Jan Kalmus, a national bank examiner and
licensing expert with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, which issues national bank charters.
</P>
<P>
   The bank would also be unusual in taking on two roles at once:
as a community bank serving Indians, and as a national bank making
corporate-sized loans. Although it would be small for a bank with
coast-to-coast ambitions, it would be much larger than most
community banks.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing Native American National Bank is necessary for
several reasons, its members said. Foremost among them is the
dissatisfaction many tribes have with the federal government's
tight hold on billions that the tribes have amassed by leasing
their land and from court settlements awarded to them over the
decades. But they have not been able to use the money, which the
government holds for them in trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this, the federal government is going to
continue to hold us hostage,'' Hall said. ``We have to capitalize
our own private bank. What we're talking about is nation building,
tribal nation building.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to start a national Indian bank comes at a time when
extraordinary amounts of cash from casino gambling are tumbling
into many tribal coffers. The Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn.,
for example, now has gross annual revenue of more than $1 billion,
making the Pequot tribe one of the wealthiest in North America. The
new bank would cater to managing such tribes' financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Native American National Bank is part of a wave of banks owned,
wholly or partially, by Indian tribes. There are 10 such banks in
the United States and Canada, up from three in 1995, said J.D.
Colbert, president of the North American Native Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Native American National Bank represents a broad coalition
trying to create wealth among all tribes, Kalmus said:``That has
not been done before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Pequots are the only tribe in the Northeast that has
agreed to underwrite the bank. The other tribes, Hall said, are the
Seminoles in Florida; the Cheyenne River Sioux in South Dakota; the
Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa in Michigan; the Mille
Lacs Band of Chippewa in Minnesota; the Ute Mountain Tribe in
Colorado; the Tlingit and Haida tribes, jointly, in Alaska; the
Arctic Slope Regional Corp., comprising several tribes in northern
Alaska; the Navajo Tribe in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico; the
Puyallup Tribe in Washington; and Hall's Three Affiliated Tribes in
North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hayward, the Pequot tribe's vice chairman, who preceded
Hall as chairman of the bank's holding company, committed to
joining the bank late last year, said a tribal spokesman, though
Hayward himself declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   To raise half of the $30 million Indian leaders say they want to
have before applying for a charter, Native American National
Bancorp is also hoping to lure investments from three commercial
banks: Bank of America, Bank One and Wells Fargo, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is also seeking million-dollar commitments from an
additional four tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Mohegan tribe, in Montville, Conn., said they
were considering joining the bank venture. ``It's very important
for Indian tribes to be going into this venture,'' said Jayne
Fawcett, the Mohegans' vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders said the move to start their own bank was a
response to several recent trends. For one, the influx of millions
of dollars from casino gambling revenue on some reservations around
the country has created an unprecedented source of tribal capital,
they said, and intensified the efforts of many tribes that do not
have casinos to become financially independent.
</P>
<P>
   But on another level, more Indians have begun pressing the
federal government to account for billions of dollars it has held
in increasingly disorganized trust accounts on tribes' behalf. The
trusts have been largely inaccessible to Indians since the
mid-1800s, Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption back then was that Indians were basically
incompetent to handle their financial affairs,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes have recently begun using aggressive measures to get
control of that trust money. A federal lawsuit, brought by a
Blackfeet tribal member in 1998, for instance, seeks to force the
U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs to hand over $3 billion to 300,000
individual Indians and hundreds of tribal governments nationwide.
The suit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor in the Indians' desire to bank for
themselves: the discomfort, on both sides, with Indians' borrowing
from mainstream commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a little fearful of giving Indians loans,'' Greg
Bourland, chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe in South
Dakota, said of non-Indian banks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a difficult legal, and certainly a difficult
emotional, issue,'' said Kalmus. ``Native American National Bank
would be very much more sensitive to those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fitzgerald, Bank of America's national program manager
for Indian-related investments, said an Indian-owned national bank
might be more willing to subsidize tribal projects than non-Indian
banks.
</P>
<P>
   But banking experts say a national Indian-owned bank seeking to
invest primarily in tribal ventures will face many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to serve a niche market that's spread over a
broad geographic area,'' said Bert Ely, a banking industry
consultant in Alexandria, Va. ``It's going to be awful hard to
service your business if it's scattered across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials say the bank would be staffed to handle
hundreds of million-dollar loans simultaneously. To build enough
investment capital, a national bank should be able to attract about
10 times the amount in its start-up fund, banking experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How quickly are they going to be able to reach that asset
size?'' Ely asked. The chief executive of the planned bank, John
Beirise, a former head of institutional banking at Mercantile
Bancorporation Inc. in St. Louis, is writing the charter
application, but he declined to be interviewed.

LAZIO DEFENDS TAX-CUT PLAN AS TOOL TO SPREAD PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A day after he unveiled his tax cuts proposal,
Rep. Rick Lazio Friday fended off skepticism from Democrats and
sought to defend his plan as a way to continue to spread
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican nominee, visited a thriving business in
nearby Malta and then came here to discuss his tax plan in
interviews with five television stations. Aides to Hillary Rodham
Clinton, his Democratic opponent for the U.S. Senate, have called
it a ``reckless'' venture that would squander the surplus and
stifle the economic boom. Clinton's campaign office said Lazio's
plan would produce $1.24 trillion in cuts, rather than the $776
billion Lazio cited.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio fired back, saying: ``This is a campaign that is based now
entirely on fear-mongering, on negative attacks, on ripping our
state apart. I can't imagine that Mrs. Clinton is proud of the kind
of campaign that she's waging right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's tax cut plan _ a compilation of ideas he has talked
about on the stump as well as those advocated by other Republicans
_ includes as its centerpiece a proposal to allow people to deduct
from their federal income taxes the payroll tax that finances
Social Security. He also called for reducing the capital gains tax
to 15 percent from 20 percent and eliminating the inheritance tax
and the so-called marriage tax, among other taxes. He suggested
that federal surpluses of $4.4 trillion projected over the next 10
years would offset any loss of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in five satellite interviews with stations in
Buffalo, Binghamton, Syracuse, Rochester and Westchester County _
all markets in a region that both camps consider a key battleground
for votes _ Lazio sought to drive home his points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estimates we have are based on nonpartisan sources,''
Lazio told viewers in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reduction in the capital gains is important to stimulate
business to continue to invest in themselves'' was a message for
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a responsible tax plan that will help incentivize
economic development,'' he said to Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, Clinton, for one, remained
unconvinced. Her proposals would trim taxes by $496 billion over 10
years and include a cut in, rather than elimination of, the
marriage penalty and inheritance tax. She has said that the surplus
should be used first to pay down the national debt and then to
shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary has presented New Yorkers a plan to provide targeted
tax cuts and preserve Medicare and Social Security,'' said Cathie
Levine, a spokeswoman for Clinton. ``Rick Lazio's reckless $1.2
trillion tax cut would explode the deficit and drive interest rates
sky-high.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comment was in a statement that included a 2,243-word
compilation of what the Clinton campaign said was Lazio's history
of negative campaigning.

METS TAKE THEIR CUTS AND HAND JOHNSON ANOTHER BEATING
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On April 15, 1989, a wild 25-year-old left-hander
started for Montreal against Pittsburgh and could not get out of
the second inning. None of the five outs he recorded were
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, three teams and 352 games later, that pitcher
faced a Mets lineup that included no position players who were
active then. And for the first time since then, Randy Johnson, the
second most prolific left-handed strikeout pitcher in baseball
history and the best pitcher in the National League, failed to fan
a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets own Johnson. There is no mistaking that now, not after
they clobbered him and the Arizona Diamondbacks, 13-3, at Shea
Stadium in a victory that increased the Mets' lead in the National
League wild-card race to 5 1/2 games over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Since the opening game of the division series last October,
Johnson has faced the Mets four times. The Mets have won each game,
and in those games Johnson is 0-3 with a 7.29 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the major league strikeout leader this year, has 2,971
career strikeouts, second only to the Hall of Famer Steve Carlton
among left-handers. Despite his struggles against the Mets, he had
always shown hints of his dominance. In 182/3 innings over three
games, Johnson had struck out 29 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night he fanned no one and could get only seven outs.
The Mets collected six hits and six runs in two and a third innings
off Johnson, who walked two, made one error and watched as a Gold
Glove-winning teammate made another.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was not throwing as hard as usual _ his fastest pitch
was 94 mph _ and he gave up several hits off his slider. But more
than anything else, the Mets seemed to be afflicting his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile, who had no hits and five strikeouts in 10 career
at-bats against Johnson, knocked a slider up the middle for a
leadoff single in the second. Johnson was unnerved, and Benny
Agbayani walked on four pitches to bring up Jay Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller, Johnson's personal catcher, who did not start
when the Mets knocked out Johnson in the fourth inning at Arizona
three weeks ago, set up inside on Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said this week he needed to establish his inside
fastball to beat the Mets, and he tried to do it here. But the
pitch missed badly, and Payton drove the outside fastball to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   His single scored Zeile and sent Agbayani to third. Mike Bordick
chopped a ball to third, where Matt Williams, a three-time Gold
Glove winner, bobbled it on the transfer from his glove to his
hand. As his throw arrived home, Agbayani slid around Miller to
give the Mets a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The next two batters bunted: Rick Reed to get Payton to third,
and Joe McEwing to bring Payton home. McEwing, the reserve who is
Johnson's celebrated nemesis, got a slider and bunted it hard
toward first base. The Diamondbacks did not expect that, and first
baseman Greg Colbrunn could only step on first as Payton scampered
home with the Mets' third run.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the error and the bunt, Johnson was having no luck.
But he made his own bad luck in the third. Edgardo Alfonzo,
starting for the first time since Monday after missing time with a
stiff neck, lined a slider to left to lead off the inning, bringing
up Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza chopped a ball in front of the plate, and Johnson caught
it on one hop. He wheeled to second to start a double play, but
fired low, under the glove of Tony Womack at second. Johnson threw
his head back in disgust as Alfonzo went to third, and Zeile drove
Alfonzo in when he singled on a fastball above the belt.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Johnson walked Agbayani on four pitches. Again, Payton
followed with a drive to right with runners on.
</P>
<P>
   But this hit, off a 90 mph fastball, was harder and farther than
the right fielder Danny Bautista thought. Bautista came in on it,
then had to hustle back, taking an awkward angle. He stuck up his
glove, but the ball carried over it and rolled to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Two runs scored to put the Mets ahead, 6-0. Agbayani was thrown
out at home, but the 38,237 fans at Shea Stadium did not care. They
were having too much fun roaring at Johnson as he marched slowly to
the dugout, lifted in the third inning, his shortest start in more
than four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got to within three runs in the sixth inning
when Steve Finley homered off Reed, who went seven innings and
improved to 8-4. But in the bottom of the sixth, after a
bases-loaded walk, Agbayani whacked a bases-clearing double that
put the Mets ahead, 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   A rout was on, the victory was secured, and the improbable feat
of beating Johnson had become routine for the Mets. &QL;

GOP AD AIMS TO DIFFUSE GORE'S BOOST FROM PRESCRIPTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark. Del. La., Mich., Mo., Ohio, Pa., Wash., Wis.)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days after canceling one advertisement that
attacked Vice President Al Gore on his trustworthiness, the
Republicans Friday released another that criticizes Gore's plan for
providing a prescription drug benefit for older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is spending $7 million to
broadcast the 30-second advertisement in nine states beginning
Monday. The sum is a huge one this early, and it underscores how
urgently the Republicans believe they need to counter Gore's surge
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the party prepares to run the commercial, the campaign
of Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, is distancing
itself from it by paying for its own commercials on the same
subject, but without the comparison to Gore's plan or the
suggestion that Gore's plan is bad for older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP commercial says in part: ``And Al Gore? Gore opposed
bipartisan reform. He's pushing a big-government plan that lets
Washington bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe.
The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats decide. The Bush
Prescription Plan: Seniors choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said that the commercial was
misleading because Bush had not offered a specific prescription
drug plan: ``Zip, zero, nada, nothing,'' Lehane said, adding that
the commercial seemed to be a defensive move.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists acknowledged that Gore had gained ground
with his constant discussion of prescription drugs, and said that
the party hoped at least to neutralize his success on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we neutralize it, we can go back to our issues of
character, integrity and leadership,'' one strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed little concern among Republican officials that the
party would be branded as the first to go negative in what has
rapidly become the opening round of the fall campaign, even though
the traditional Labor Day opening is more than a week away. Their
real concern is that Gore has successfully moved _ ``pivoted'' one
said _ into the fall campaign by discussing an issue voters care
about.
</P>
<P>
   And with that pivot, Gore, after months of stasis, began setting
the campaign agenda at a time when the Bush campaign has appeared
off-course. Republicans, along with everyone else, have been
watching Gore's favorable ratings rise in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Wednesday canceled a commercial that had been sent out
to 350 television stations. It used excerpts from an interview with
Gore from six years ago in which Gore said that President Clinton
had never lied.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence over that commercial reflected a debate within
Republican circles on how negative Bush should go against Gore, and
how soon. The emergence of the GOP's commercial Friday effectively
answers that question, for now. The party and the campaign both
wanted to erode Gore's success; putting the advertisement in the
mouth of an anonymous narrator in a commercial paid for by the
party allows Bush to claim the high road, but still get a message
across.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial features a moment in which Bush says: ``Every
senior will have access to prescription drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the issues on which he has had an advantage
over us,'' said one Republican strategist referring to Gore. ``If
we don't have an adequate response, then people will care about an
issue that he has an advantage on. This is a recognition that Gore
has gotten people talking about this issue, and it ranks in the
double-digits with people, so yes, it's a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is intended for undecided voters. It is to run in
Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.

TWO WHO CLUCKED FOR REVENGE ARE ARRESTED FOR HARASSMENT c.2000 N.Y.
Times News Service   Two former employees of a mortgage brokerage
firm near Albany became so annoyed when a New York City woman
pulled out of a deal, the police said, that they harassed her for
months by calling on the phone and clucking like a chickens.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two men, Scott Chittenden, 28, of Cohoes, N.Y., and Victor
Guilianelle, 32, of Ballston Lake, N.Y., were arrested on Thursday
and charged with aggravated harassment, the Cohoes Police
Department said. Both are free on bail pending a court appearance
next week. If convicted, each faces up to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   To protect her privacy, the police withheld the name of the
woman, who is a secretary at the State Labor Department in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to clucking over the phone, the police said, the two
men also clipped Perdue chicken advertisements from newspapers and
mailed them to their victim, and Chittenden once called her,
pretending to be Regis Philbin and inviting her to be a contestant
on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was really funny,'' said Detective Lt. Tom
Ross, of the Cohoes department. ``And once they saw her reaction,
they got caught up in it. They got hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The two made 30 to 40 calls over three or four months, Ross
said, after the woman reneged on a home mortgage deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, she got a better rate,'' he said. ``I think we've all
been hit up with telemarketers. Usually, they're just rude. These
guys took it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman received some of the calls at her office, a
spokeswoman there said. Distraught, she informed her boss, who
asked investigators for the Labor Department's inspector general to
trace her calls. That led to Chittenden's home and the office of
Tri-City Funding in Clifton Park, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man works at Tri-City any longer, according to Joseph
Zappone, a lawyer representing the company. He would not say
whether their departures were tied to the charges, but said that
Tri-City officials had no knowledge of any harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our business practice to use aggressive business
tactics in any way, shape or form,'' Zappone said.

BELTRE BELTS, DODGERS SWEEP CUBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sometimes the hefty swings are empty, and Adrian
Beltre looks like he's trying to hit a baseball farther than Mark
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing new, but Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he
spoke to Beltre occasionally about the positives of the controlled,
easy swing, and how the ball can jump of the bat anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month Beltre's taken the advice and transferred it
to performance. And after the young third baseman had five hits and
drove in five runs as the Dodgers swept a doubleheader from the
Chicago Cubs 5-3 and 3-1 on Friday at Wrigley Field, Johnson hopes
the lesson stays learned.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's biggest hit was a three-run homer with two out in the
eighth inning of the first game. It gave the Dodgers a 5-2 lead,
and set up a nice second game in which left-hander Carlos Perez
(5-6) made a spot start and won for the first time since May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he looks at that (homer) on video replay,'' Johnson
said. ``He just met it and he crushed it. He doesn't have to
overswing, and he knows that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 21, went 4 for 4 with four RBI in the first game and was
1 for 3 with an insurance RBI after a double in the eighth inning
of the second game as the Dodgers went ahead 3-1. Since the
All-Star break, Beltre is batting .359 (55 for 153) with five
homers and 32 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at (Beltre) a few weeks ago when we (were) down in
the 'pen and said, `Who would you least like to face in a big
situation,' and it's him,'' said right-hander Jeff Shaw, who
recorded his 19th and 20th saves in the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very scary. He can take a wild swing one time, and then
hammer the same pitch. Sometimes we forget how old he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers swept their first doubleheader since July 6, 1992
against Montreal, and extended their winning streak to five games.
But, as always seems to be the case, two steps forward is followed
by a move in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Devon White, who tripled in a run and scored
another as the Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the fifth inning in the
nightcap, could be heading for the 15-day disabled list. He injured
his left quadriceps running out a grounder in the ninth inning and
was removed from the game.
</P>
<P>
   It forced Johnson to use Dave Hansen in left field, and it
creates a problem since left fielder Gary Sheffield must sit today
because of his suspension. The Dodgers are expected to recall
outfielder Bruce Aven from Triple-A Albuquerque to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pulled it,'' Johnson said of White. ``It should be a
minimum of a week, but we'll know more (today).''
</P>
<P>
   A determination of whether White will be disabled should come
today, but Aven will come anyway. The Dodgers had recalled
right-hander Mike Judd as insurance in case Perez was a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Perez allowed one run in 61/3 innings and broke a
three-month winless drought. The bullpen was asked to pitch 72/3
innings on the day, but none were in long relief. Therefore, Judd's
expected to be sent back to Albuquerque. If the Dodgers need to
place White on the disabled list, lefty Onan Masaoka is expected to
be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was still the kind of day the Dodgers needed,
especially winning a Perez start. The left-hander was making a spot
start, but may have made a push to rejoin the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Perez teetered on the edge for his first five innings, getting a
pair of double plays and some well-timed pop-ups to survive. The
Cubs had two runners on base in each of the first four innings, and
in the final three innings their first two batters reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for Carlos to pitch six-plus innings and only give up
one run, that was fantastic,'' Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter said.
``He had some situations where he could have given up the farm, but
he got out of them. He made some great pitches when he had. We
worked the outside of the plate well.''
</P>
<P>
   The only run Perez allowed came via a pinch-hit homer by Gary
Matthews Jr. with one out in the seventh inning. It pulled the Cubs
to within 2-1, but it was also the last pitch Perez threw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the first game and I was thinking the umpire
was giving the outside corner,'' Perez said. ``I like to use the
inside corner when I have my command, but when I saw the umpire
giving the outside corner in the second game, I said, `OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one is ready to get caught up in back-in-the-race fever, but
the Dodgers (67-61) are feeling good about how the last few days
have played out.
</P>
<P>
   They remain seven games behind San Francisco in the National
League West with 34 games to play, but with their next 15 games
against teams with losing records, now is the best time to get back
in position to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game against Montreal, when we hit (six homers),
that game woke us up,'' Kreuter said. ``I think now you're seeing,
in the last five games, the offense, defense and pitching are
coming together at one time. You can't ask for a better time than
now.'' &QL;

<P>
   At 10:13 a.m. Friday, investors in Emulex, a California company
that makes fiber-optic communications equipment, got some terrible
news.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News, a leading financial news service, reported that
the company's chief executive had resigned and that Emulex planned
to restate its earnings for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors rushed to shed their Emulex shares, and the stock
plunged from $103 to $45 in 15 minutes. The drop stripped more than
$2 billion from the company's market valuation before the Nasdaq
stock market halted trading in the stock about 10:30. The free fall
dragged down several stocks of companies in similar businesses and
even pulled down the broader Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones News Service, CBS.Marketwatch.com, the cable channel
CNBC and other financial news outlets soon joined Bloomberg in
reporting Emulex's woes, referring to a press release from the
company.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem. The story was not true, as investors
quickly learned, enabling Emulex to recover before the day was out.
The statement was the latest _ and most devastating _ in a string
of fake press releases and other hoaxes that are roiling the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The two most prominent cases have been Lucent Technologies and
PairGain Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   With trading volume soaring and longtime financial news
providers like Dow Jones competing furiously with newer Internet
services like CBS Marketwatch, business reporters have never faced
more pressure to put out stories fast. And with traders quick to
punish stocks of companies with bad news, the odds have never been
greater that a hoax will cause a stock to rise or fall, harming
investors caught in the cross currents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary thing to see something like this happen, because
what the hoaxers are doing is taking advantage of the intense
competition among the news agencies to get this thing out,'' said
David Callaway, executive editor of CBS Marketwatch.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents in New York and Los Angeles, along with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of
Securities Dealers and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, are
investigating the fake release. The apparent motive for the fraud
was to cause Emulex's stock to plunge, enabling someone to profit
by buying put options or selling the stock short. Put options rise
in value when a company's stock falls; short-selling is another way
to profit from price declines.
</P>
<P>
   Many more put options than usual were bought on Emulex on
Thursday and Friday, and a spokesman for the Chicago options
exchange said it was investigating who bought the puts. If caught,
the perpetrators might be forced to disgorge their profits and
could face criminal and civil fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Emulex shares regained nearly all their
losses after the company said that its business was stronger than
ever. They closed Friday at $105.75, down $7.31, on exceptionally
heavy trading of more than 11 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   But that bounce will be cold comfort for Emulex investors who
panicked and sold their shares Friday morning, or who had ``limit
orders'' to sell at some preset price, orders that were
automatically executed as the company's shares plummeted. The SEC
and NASD say that trades made Friday morning would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All transactions prior to the halt will stand,'' said Wayne
Lee, an NASD spokesman. So investors who sold their shares at the
wrong time have little chance of being made whole, although Lee
said investors could ask their brokers to share their losses.
Regulators said investors who lost money might also be able to
bring lawsuits against the perpetrators if they were caught.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the hoax appears to have been Internet Wire, a
Los Angeles service that distributes press releases to news
organizations and Web sites. At 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, just as the
financial markets were opening, Internet Wire put out a release
supposedly from Emulex that claimed the company was revising its
earnings for its quarter ended July 2 from a profit of 25 cents a
share to a loss of 15 cents a share ``due to compliance with
generally accepted accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The release stated that ``Net Earnings for fiscal 1998 and 1999
will also be revised,'' and some versions reported that Emulex
chief executive Paul Folino had resigned and that the SEC had begun
an investigation into Emulex's accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The release was automatically posted on some Web sites,
including the CBS Marketwatch site, and within a few minutes people
on the Emulex Yahoo message board began calling attention to it.
``EMLX SEC investigation SELLLLL,'' wrote someone calling himself
``charles-ptrs'' at 9:46 a.m. After others questioned whether the
release existed, ``mtnbrdr'' provided a hyperlink to the release.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Emulex stock, which had closed Thursday at $113.06,
steadily slid in the first minutes of trading Friday. By 10:13 it
had fallen to about $103, losing almost 10 percent of its value.
But Emulex stock is generally volatile, so the move did not garner
much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bloomberg sent headlines summarizing the apparent press
release to trading desks around the world, and the true rout began.
In three minutes, Emulex stock lost another $10, sliding close to
$90. Even without the Bloomberg headlines, that move would have
been big enough to attract the attention of other news
organizations, which closely monitor what stocks are rising and
falling.
</P>
<P>
   As CNBC, TheStreet.com and others geared up to produce their own
stories, Emulex kept falling. At 10:20, it touched $75. By 10:26,
it had fallen as low as $50. Each $10 slide erased $360 million
from retirement accounts, pension funds and Emulex employees'
savings.

L.A. UNFAIR TO WOMEN WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles women don't get a fair return on what
they invest in the fabric of the city, according to recent
testimony before a City Council committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to promote gender equity, from government
contracts to the city's flourishing adult entertainment industry,
women often are discriminated against and underrewarded, and
sometimes abused, speakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Wu, president of the Los Angeles City Commission on the
Status of Women, said the commission and the City Council intend to
explore ways to address women's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 360,000 women-owned businesses in Los
Angeles County, and research indicates that by 2005, fully half of
area businesses will be owned by women.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles adheres to a federal goal of awarding a minimum of 4
percent of city contracts to women-owned businesses. In 1999, $1.1
billion in contracts were awarded, and $55.2million, or 4.6 percent
went to women.
</P>
<P>
   Women and minorities are better represented in some fields than
in others and, in some kinds of contract awards, women and
minorities get 40 percent to 50 percent of the work, Diane Castano
Sallee, director of the Los Angeles Minority Business Opportunity
Committee, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Los Angeles County is one of the most diverse in the
nation and has perhaps the largest pool of women and minorities to
draw from, it could lead the way in awarding contracts to those
groups. The key is communicating opportunities to the businesses
that are seeking work, and the city is building on several programs
to do that, Sallee said.
</P>
<P>
   Gender pay equity, enforcement of sexual harassment and job
discrimination laws, and -- especially for poorer women -- better
transportation and affordable, available child care are always near
the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers noted many of the discrepancies:
</P>
<P>
   --Female nurses average 15 percent less pay than male nurses.
</P>
<P>
   --The man who seats you in a restaurant is called a maitre d'. A
woman who seats you is called a hostess and is paid significantly
less.
</P>
<P>
   --Women are seamstresses. Men are tailors and generally earn
more.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.'s entertainment industry has a notorious record, speakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The adult entertainment industry is an $8 billion to $12 billion
business -- largely based in Los Angeles County. More than 1,000
people perform sex acts for money each month, and they are
sometimes forbidden to use condoms to protect themselves. They have
no health benefits and are subject to abuse by those who make money
off them, a former sex worker told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream movie industry has its own gender issues. Screen
Actors Guild statistics show there are twice as many roles for men
as for women, and men work twice as many days on average. Women
over 40 get only 24 percent of women's roles available.
</P>
<P>
   Men over 40 get 36 percent of men's roles.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the solutions proposed to the city Friday included
access to 24-hour affordable child care, better transportation,
tuition reimbursement for city employees and educating women about
finance options.

 UNDATED: employees' savings. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the same time, Emulex executives arriving at the company's
offices at 7 a.m. Pacific time were perplexed by the decline in the
company's stock, said Kirk Roller, Emulex senior vice president.
``I walked in, my administrative assistant immediately said to me,
`the stock's down 45 points,' '' Roller said. ``By the time I got
to Paul, the stock was down 68.''
</P>
<P>
   Folino, Emulex's chief executive, and Roller immediately asked
the NASD to halt trading in the company's stock. The NASD soon did,
but the damage had been done, and news organizations, including
TheStreet.com, which has a joint venture with The New York Times,
continued to report on the fake release until nearly 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Winkler, Bloomberg's editor &UR;  &LR; in &UR;  &LR; chief, said Bloomberg
had been right to report on the news release, especially since
Emulex stock was already dropping. But Winkler said he was
disappointed in his organization's reporting of the story.
Bloomberg should have clearly explained that it had been unable to
confirm the release or get a comment from the company, he said.
Instead, the service simply rewrote the release as fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not the critical thinking and judgment and scrutiny
that should have been applied as far as I'm concerned,'' Winkler
said. ``The way it was handled was not up to the standards that we
normally apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Stine, managing editor of Dow Jones News Service, said
financial wires were extremely competitive because the traders they
serve could make big profits if they got news even a few minutes
before their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does everyone want to be first? Yes,'' Stine said. As a
result, Dow Jones will generally use information from press release
wires like PR Newswire and Internet Wire without checking directly
with the companies mentioned in the releases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Internet Wire, which was founded only six
years ago, is the smallest of the three major press release wires,
trailing PR Newswire and Businesswire, much older organizations.
Dave Armon, senior vice president at PR Newswire, said his company
had much stricter procedures to verify press releases than Internet
Wire, including always checking releases with the companies that
supposedly had put them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a Web site where you can put in a credit card
number, type up a news release, and watch the news pop up,'' Armon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emulex said Internet Wire never contacted the company to ensure
the release was real. But Michael Terpin, chairman of Internet
Wire, said his organization had fallen victim to a ``sophisticated
fraud.'' The people behind the fraud ``were successful in
convincing somebody from the nighttime shift that they had
authorization from the daytime shift,'' Terpin said. ``They
obviously had some kind of familiarity with our policies and
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Terpin said the other wires had also been fooled into carrying
fake releases. ``We have 135 employees,'' he said. ``We're not a
little fly-by-night company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, fake press releases have moved the stocks
of Lucent Technologies and PairGain, other high-technology
companies. Lucent fell after a fake report said its earnings would
be less than expected, while PairGain jumped on a false report that
it would be taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Dale Hoke, who worked at PairGain's engineering development
operations in Raleigh, N.C., used online brokerage accounts at
Etrade and Ameritrade to buy and sell stocks, trading in PairGain
shares and posting false messages on the Internet. He pleaded
guilty to fraud and was ordered to pay $93,000 and sentenced to
five years' probation, including five months of house arrest.

   Imagine a meeting that puts Israel's chief rabbi, an emissary of
Iran's top ayatollah, the head of the World Council of Churches and
a granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi together in the same room. An
unexpected grouping, to be sure. But it would have only a few of
the spiritual figures due to begin meeting at the United Nations on
Monday, when 2,000 people from 90 nations and a wide spectrum of
faiths are to begin spending four days on issues related to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a unique opportunity for religious leaders to have an
impact on the political process,'' said Bawa Jain, a veteran of
interfaith activities who is general secretary of the event, the
Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Jain, 44, a native of India and citizen of the United States who
lives in New Jersey, has traveled widely, asking prominent people
in the worlds of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism
and other faiths to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, backed by a large advisory board filled with
religious figures, scholars and diplomats, has been organized in
cooperation with the office of the U.N. secretary-general. But it
is not an official U.N. event, and its financing has come largely
from foundations.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of its breadth, the event is not unique. At meetings in
South Africa last year and in Chicago in 1993, the Parliament of
the World's Religions drew wide interfaith participation.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be, as Jain said, the biggest in terms of the high
level of leadership involved. Among its goals is the creation of an
advisory council of religious leaders to work with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to have helped in attracting participants are the
event's location, at the United Nations; its timing, in the year
2000; and its focus on peace. Five hundred delegates are coming,
many with associates as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the religious figures mentioned above _ Rabbi
Meir Lau, from Israel; Ayatollah Abdollah Vaeze Javadi, from Iran;
the Rev. Konrad Raiser of the World Council of Churches; and Ela
Gandhi _ those attending are to include Cardinal Francis Arinze, a
Vatican official representing Pope John Paul II; Kuni Kuniaki, high
priest of Shintoism's Grand Shrine at Ise, Japan; and Bishop Vashti
McKenzie, first female bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   (One major figure not attending is the Dalai Lama, spiritual
leader of Tibet, whose presence at the United Nations was blocked
by objections from China, casting a shadow over the proceedings.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jain belongs to the Jain faith (it is not at all unusual, he
said, for believers to carry its name as their own). It originated
in India and espouses ahimsa, or nonviolence toward all living
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   He is vice president of the Interfaith Center in New York, an
organization headed by the Rev. James Parks Morton, retired dean of
the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Morton spoke of Sushil Kumar, Jain's spiritual
mentor, who was long active in promoting dialogue among religious
groups. ``All of the big, international interfaith conferences I
attended, he was there,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said Kumar had a religious vision at age 7, was ordained a
Jain monk at 15, and was deeply affected by the violence between
Hindus and Muslims that marred the independence of India and
Pakistan half a century ago. Kumar, he said, pursued interfaith
activities as a way of improving relations between adherents of
different religions.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar came to the United States in 1975 and, six years later,
found a site for the area's first Jain temple, on property once
occupied by a Jewish summer camp in Blairstown, N.J. Jain, then
running a construction company in India, supplied craftsmen for the
project. Before Kumar died in 1994, he asked Jain to take a lead in
interfaith efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said the process culminating in the event next week had
originated in a conversation between Ted Turner and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Turner suggested that religious
leaders ought to come together to promote world peace, Jain said.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said a U.N. official had asked him to get involved, after
which he sought assistance from David Finn, founder and chairman of
Ruder-Finn, a public relations company in New York. Finn's daughter
Dena Merriam, a Ruder-Finn partner and vice chairman who works with
religious and cultural organizations, joined in, lining up
foundation support.
</P>
<P>
   The event's advisory board has more than 40 people, including
the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Kueng. Its chairman is Maurice
Strong, an adviser to Annan who organized the Earth Summit in
Brazil in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said he found inspiration for the event in the memory of
Kumar. ``It's his blessing,'' Jain said.

CLASSIC MEDIA BUYS 60% OF HARVEY ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mr. Magoo may have trouble seeing them, especially
Casper the Friendly Ghost, but the nearsighted bumbler has a new
set of comic character friends under a stock and cash deal between
The Harvey Entertainment Co. and New York investors.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Harvey, home to Casper, Richie Rich, Baby Huey
and other characters, concluded a four-month search for a
much-needed cash infusion by announcing it had sold a 60 percent
stake to Classic Media LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Media, based in New York and headed by former Golden
Books chief Eric Ellenbogen, brought to the table Mr. Magoo, $26
million cash and other equities, Harvey spokesman David C. Collins
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey had all these great characters and no resources to move
them forward into entertainment projects,'' Collins said. ``This
deal puts in a new character as well as the cash to develop
projects and leverage these characters.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight companies made investment offers to Harvey
Entertainment, leading the company to announce earlier this month
that it had hired Houlihan Valuation Advisors to evaluate the
proposed deals.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Media is a new company engaged in managing entertainment
properties. Investors in its deal with Harvey Entertainment include
Hollywood veterans Frank Biondi and Steve Tisch.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenbogen declined to comment on the investment Friday, citing
securities regulations governing pending deals.
</P>
<P>
   In a company release, Ellenbogen said Harvey Entertainment's
classic character library perfectly complements his company's focus
on family and kids entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies hope to close the deal by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Harvey Entertainment has signed a letter of intent for
Classic Media to invest $26 million cash and all outstanding stock
of its UPA Industries Inc. (owner of Mr. Magoo) in exchange for a
new $30 million issue of 7 percent cumulative convertible preferred
stock of Harvey Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Media will also get warrants to purchase additional
shares of Harvey common stock and restructure Harvey's existing
preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of intent provides for a due diligence period after
which Classic Media must decide whether to follow through with the
investment or withdraw its offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board of directors felt that this proposal represented the
best combination of capital, new management expertise and
likelihood of consummation,'' Harvey's chairman and chief executive
officer Roger A. Burlage said.
</P>
<P>
   No indication was made whether Harvey Entertainment will retain
its name and current management.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Entertainment manages and exploits hundreds of branded
characters through merchandising and licensing. It also has a
library of more than 150 B-movies and 165 television episodes,
including 91 episodes of Harvey Classic animation.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is also involved in producing and distributing motion
pictures and television programs through its PM Entertainment
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to release the animated direct-to-video
``Casper's Haunted Christmas'' through United Home Video on Oct.
31. It is also slated to air on network television in November.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's stock rose 0.188 to 2.94 on volume of 113,700 Friday on
the Nasdaq.

IS McCULLOUGH NEW KING OF TAILBACK U? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Maybe if you were raised to believe you were
some kind of royalty, you too would be prone to fits of outrageous
self-confidence. As Sultan McCullough was, and is.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the name. It's Muslim and it's pronounced
(ital)SOOL-tawn(endital). The USC tailback was named by his late
father, whose own given name was Bruce, later changed to Shaheed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I didn't know what my name meant. I asked my
mom,'' the now-20-year-old McCullough said the other day as he
lugged his helmet and pads to the locker room following a Trojans
practice session in Irvine. ``She told me it meant `king.' I
thought I was kind of special. I thought I couldn't die. I thought
I couldn't endure pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got beat up a few times, and I found out that wasn't
true.''
</P>
<P>
   A buoyant confidence could not be pounded out of him, though.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough charges into his second collegiate season, beginning
with Sunday's Kickoff Classic game against Penn State at Giants
Stadium in New Jersey. He is more than comfortable with the notion
he will be the key to the USC ground game and the USC ground game
will be pivotal in the team's success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the next star, the next running back, the next
go-to guy,'' said McCullough, who idolizes Marcus Allen.
</P>
<P>
   He described a USC offense with three kings: ``Carson Palmer in
the passing, Kareem (Kelly) in the receiving, and Sultan in the
rushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trojans-watchers share two-thirds of McCullough's confidence in
that area. Palmer, the strapping quarterback returning from injury,
is the team's star and leader. He's a given. Kelly, the
sprinter/wide receiver, was the 1999 Pacific-10 Conference Freshman
of the Year. He's a given.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough comes off a redshirt freshman season in which he
gained 413 yards and scored, ahem, one touchdown as Chad Morton's
backup. He has something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   The question has always been whether McCullough can translate
his sensational speed into tough yards between the tackles. He was
the 1999 Pac-10 100-meters champion and is advertised as the
fastest USC football player ever. But the upright running style he
uses on the track is entirely different from the
low-center-of-gravity approach he needs on the field.
</P>
<P>
   As if to demonstrate how much he has learned in this regard,
McCullough put his pads and helmet down on the grass and dropped
into what looked like a boxer's crouch. Then he slapped his thighs,
hips and shoulders rapidly. Tacklers ricocheting off. No pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a football player now,'' USC head coach Paul Hackett
said. ``He has decided this business of being a track guy isn't
founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett calls McCullough's acquired skill ``in-line running,''
referring to a back's ability to pick for yards at the crowded line
of scrimmage. The coach got a glimpse of it when McCullough rushed
for 154 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries in the Trojans'
second and final preseason scrimmage last week at Orange Coast
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see him bounce off tacklers and get underneath guys,
you say, `Ahhhh!''' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's confidence has been tested, to be sure. A prep
All-American at Muir High in Pasadena, Calif., he enjoyed the
atmosphere in which a player dealt directly with his head coach.
Expecting to find a sympathetic ear in the same office in college,
he instead found a thicket of assistant coaches and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   He felt isolated and felt worse during his redshirt season in
1998. McCullough watched the road games on television and sulked.
He started 1999 as USC's fifth running back and couldn't be
disappointed to wind up as the team's second-leading rusher behind
Morton's 1,141.
</P>
<P>
   Now Morton has moved on to the New Orleans Saints. USC's depth
chart lists a three-headed replacement _ McCullough, junior power
runner Malaefou MacKenzie and senior short-yardage man Petros
Papadakis. On paper, Tailback U has become Tailbacks U. But it
seemed to be McCullough's position to lose, a notion proven true
when he was named the starter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he crashes into a Penn State defense that hasn't allowed
a 100-yard game to any running back in 15 games but has nine new
starters. A strong opener for McCullough will signal good things
ahead for the Trojans. They might think of themselves as a passing
team these days. But it's no coincidence that USC's decade-long
absence from the season-ending top 10 coincides with their slide
below the 2,000-yard mark in annual team rushing.

<P>
   ``It's my first game as a starter, and I want to see what I can
do against the best,'' McCullough said. ``If I do my job this week,
all the questions will be answered. Am I tough? Can I run in the
middle?''

TAKING SOME OF THE CHAOS OUT OF HERALD SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps no intersection in the city is as chaotic as
Herald Square, where the traffic of 34th Street, Broadway and
Avenue of the Americas intersects with tens of thousands of
shoppers, tourists and Midtown workers in a compressed patch of
streets that defy the rules of sound urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore some order to the area, the city's
Department of Transportation has embarked on the final stage of a
reconfiguration that would eliminate a lane of traffic on Broadway,
reverse the flow of cars on 33rd Street, and create pedestrian
plazas below 34th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The changes seek to make things easier for the roughly 20,000
people who travel through the area during a typical peak hour,
competing with thousands of vehicles moving through Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike similarly congested Times Square, the Herald Square area
and its traffic patterns are particularly problematic, with
southbound Broadway running into the northbound Avenue of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the traffic changes, the plan adds more
pedestrian islands for those who want to walk through the
intersection. The plan was designed by Transportation Department
engineers who had been monitoring the area for about three years.
Herald Square is either home to or near several subway lines, a
PATH train station, an entrance to Pennsylvania Station and several
department stores, including Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department and the 34th Street Partnership,
the local Business Improvement District, finished placing barriers
on Broadway and Avenue of the Americas between 34th and 33rd
Streets and in certain lanes yesterday. City officials said they
had also installed video cameras throughout the area to monitor the
flow of traffic, and they will review the tapes each month to judge
the impact of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 priority is safety,'' said Joseph G. Albano, the
Manhattan borough commissioner for the transportation department.
``We are concerned with it, but we are also looking for a way to
balance the needs of both the vehicular and pedestrian traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   According to 1997 state transportation data, 315 people were
treated at hospitals for injuries in accidents around Herald
Square. The intersection of West 34th Street, Broadway and the
Avenue of the Americas ranked as the third most dangerous in
Manhattan and seventh most dangerous in New York City, officials
said. From 1994 through 1997, 25 people were killed in crashes in
Herald Square, according to Transportation Alternatives, a local
advocacy group that promotes travel without cars.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Pisark, the vice president for retail services at the 34th
Street Partnership, said: ``This experiment really favors
pedestrians'' and ``seems to work. Buses were getting through,
people were making it through.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes will be made permanent if city engineers determine
that the current experiment has been a success, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And there were signs that it just might work. Pisark said he saw
something unusual yesterday: an ambulance swiftly made its way
south on Broadway through Herald Square in rush-hour traffic. ``My
hat's off to the Department of Transportation,'' he said. ``That's
quite a feat.''

NORTHRIDGE HOPES TO AVOID FLAGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not just lip service.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge football coach Jeff Kearin wants his
football team to cut down on penalties. And he's taking steps to
make sure the Matadors aren't the most penalized team in the Big
Sky Conference again.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin brought in several Big Sky officials, as well as local
officials from other conferences, for both Wednesday's practice
scrimmage and today's 10:45 a.m. PDT scrimmage at North Campus
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no questioning that it's part of discipline,'' Kearin
said. ``We play kind of an aggressive defense. We lead the
conference in defensive holding, for example. They were legitimate
calls. I can't say they're not if they called them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive penalties _ the holding, clipping, illegal
procedure _ I don't mind. You mind, but you can handle those. It's
the ones like the late hits and personal fouls that you worry
about. We need to play the game between the whistles and the
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, CSUN had 121 penalties for 1,095 yards _ about 150
yards more than Northern Arizona, the second most-penalized team.
CSUN, which averaged 98.3 penalty yards per game, had more than
double the penalty yards as Montana _ the least-penalized team in
the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had 15 penalties last season in a 34-21 loss to
Portland State _ a game they had to win to stay in the hunt for a
playoff berth. Even Kearin was flagged twice last year. He's vowed
that won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN will see if it's made any strides when it opens the season
a week from today against Air Force in Colorado Springs. That
should be a tough assignment _ Air Force is expecting a sellout for
Parents Weekend at Falcon Stadium (capacity 52,480).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why coach Kearin is getting all these refs in
practice,'' fullback Crayton Milton said. ``It's just like
practicing for a game. The refs tell you what you should and
shouldn't do. We're on the road to getting better at that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRADY'S STATUS: Quarterback Marcus Brady's right throwing arm is
fine, according to Kearin. Brady sat out most throwing drills
Thursday because of a twinge and soreness in his arm, but he
competed in drills again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good not using him,'' Kearin said. ``He needed a rest
and the other guys needed the repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURY REPORT: Milton has a sore neck and probably won't play
today. ... Offensive linemen Johnny Acosta (back) and Mike Allen
(ankle) didn't practice Friday. ... Keith Kincaid returned to
practice after nursing an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT SCRIMMAGE: Today's scrimmage won't include tackles to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it easy,'' Kearin said. ``We're beat up and we're
sore. It's typical training camp stuff but I don't want to get
anybody hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   A barbecue will follow at 12:30 p.m. PDT.
</P>
<P>
   HICKS TO SUIT UP: Running back Matt Hicks is expected to
participate in his first practice with the Matadors on Monday.
Hicks _ who transferred from Air Force _ was admitted to CSUN on
Friday. &QL;

POLICE RECOVER BODIES OF BROOKLYN TEEN-AGERS DROWNED IN THE HUDSON
RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bodies of two emotionally disturbed teen-agers
from Brooklyn who disappeared after jumping into the Hudson River
on Tuesday have been found, and the group home supervisor who took
them to the river's edge has resigned, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the boys, Arimendis Lajara, 15, and Cedric
Florence, 17, were found 12 hours apart not far from where they
disappeared at the confluence of the Hudson and Croton Rivers in
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. They were identified by family members, said
the Westchester County medical examiner, Millard Hyland.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric's body was found about 8 p.m. Thursday about 70 yards
west of Tellers Point, the southern-most point of Croton Point
Park. He died of asphyxia by drowning, Hyland said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy is scheduled Saturday for the second boy, whose body
was pulled from the water at 9:50 a.m. Friday about half a mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, who lived in a group home on the grounds of the
Brooklyn Children's Psychiatric Center, had been on a camping trip.
They were hiking with four other boys and a supervisor, Lenox
Gabriel, down a steep path to the water's edge when three of the
boys jumped, fully clothed, into the water. Gabriel jumped in to
try to save them; one boy managed to swim to shore, but the others
disappeared in a treacherous spot where the rivers converge and
crosscurrents can swiftly overwhelm swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel, 47, who had to be pulled from the water himself, was
hospitalized. He has since resigned as community residence manager
of the group home.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Gabriel had told them that he never intended to
take the boys swimming; he and other counselors on the trip had
been warned against going in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel could not be reached Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal and departmental investigations by the Westchester
County police and the Office of Mental Health are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   An intensive search for the boys that involved several agencies,
including the U.S. Coast Guard, shifted from a rescue effort to a
recovery mission Thursday, when, after 48 hours of searching,
officials began to lose hope of finding the boys alive.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of their bodies, however grim, was a source of
relief for the boys' families, who said it brought an end to the
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   A recreational boater spotted Arimendis' body floating in the
water Friday, in an area where swimming is prohibited, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The other boy's body was recovered by a member of the Coast
Guard Auxiliary who had been alerted by a water scooter rider.

COWBOYS COACH SAYS HE WILL FIT SYSTEM TO PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Mercifully, the Cowboys' 0-5 preseason has come
to a close. Evaluations are in, auditions are a wrap and final cuts
are being withheld upon notification of next-of-kin.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams have until 3 p.m. CDT tomorrow to be down to 53
players.
</P>
<P>
   But the wheels already are turning for Dave Campo and his 19-man
coaching staff. They were at Valley Ranch yesterday, trying to find
the best personnel to be fitted with the right schemes.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, they were trying to come up with the best team they
could buy for $62.172 million, the NFL's salary-cap limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to bring the scheme to the players,'' Campo said
yesterday. ``The mistake that you make is when you say, `This is my
scheme, and you're going to do it.' We've never done that here, not
defensively ... and we won't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will tailor something to get the best out of whichever 11
guys that we have lined up.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's biggest concern going into the Sept. 3 season opener
against the Philadelphia Eagles is a ``young secondary,'' even
though three of the Cowboys' four starters _ Darren Woodson, George
Teague and Ryan McNeil _ each have eight or more seasons of NFL
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But] rookie Kareem Larrimore from West Texas A&AMP;M is being
counted on _ as a matter of attrition _ to start at left cornerback
eight days from now at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cowboys' 24-17 preseason loss to the St. Louis Rams on
Thursday night, ``Kareem played better than you might think,''
Campo said. But the fourth-round draft pick has had first-half
lapses in each of his three preseason starts in place of Kevin
Smith, now on the reserve/retired list.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four cornerbacks who started for the Cowboys last season
_ Deion Sanders, Kevin Mathis, Smith and Charlie Williams _ only
Williams is still with the team. And he's recovering from a
summerlong staph infection caused by off-season knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   To hide Larrimore _ or help him, depending on your point of view
_ the Cowboys have several options:
</P>
<P>
   Play two-deep zone, with safety help provided to Larrimore on
most pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   Disguise coverages to muddy the reads between quarterback and
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Run stunts/games up front, then bring pressure with a linebacker
or a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make it to where it's not a `coverage situation'
every time \Rfor Larrimore\S ... where the quarterback doesn't have
a lot of time to throw,'' Campo said. ``But I really believe that
our front four is going to come on and rush the passer this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It rarely showed this preseason. The Cowboys played nine
quarters without registering a sack until middle linebacker Dat
Nguyen broke through Thursday night to tackle Trent Green for a
10-yard loss on the Rams' opening drive.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lone sack of the game for either team. The Cowboys
finished the preseason with eight sacks and an average of barely
one quarterback pressure per quarter in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by the numbers, Campo instead finds solace in defensive
end Greg Ellis' return for the season opener after breaking his leg
in two places Dec. 12. And Ebenezer Ekuban re-emerged at left
defensive end against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ekuban looked like he did at the end of last season,'' Campo
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Larrimore watch continues, with much faith, hope and
scheming to help him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to understand that \RLarrimore\S is a
rookie who is seeing a lot of situations out there for the first
time,'' Campo said. ``If he's the guy \Rto start\S, which looks
like he will be, we'll take steps to make sure the scheme comes to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Briefly Wide receiver Chris Brazzell's hamstring
injury suffered against the Rams was not serious. He is listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Troy Hambrick, an all-special teams contributor,
suffered a high-ankle bruise while lead-blocking on Joey Galloway's
punt return. Free-agent rookie Hambrick also is listed as
day-to-day. Said Dave Campo: ``It took four different guys ... to
do what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo called this preseason ``very, very successful ... probably
the best we've had in years'' in spite of the Cowboys' 0-5 record.
Campo's logic: Minimal injuries going into the season. Tight end
David LaFleur (groin) played against St. Louis, while running back
Emmitt Smith (calf), wide receiver Jason Tucker (groin) and
fullback Robert Thomas (knee) are all expected to resume practice
today after missing the Rams game.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches were in the dark for about an hour at Valley
Ranch yesterday. A power outage delayed review of the game tape. It
also knocked out computers and e-mail at one of the NFL's busiest
times of the year. nn

GIULIANI FUND-RAISER MOVES TO ASSIST LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chief fund-raiser for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
aborted campaign for U.S. Senate is moving to set up an independent
committee to tap money from Giuliani's national network of
contributors and finance television advertisements on behalf of
Rep. Rick Lazio's campaign for the Senate, political leaders have
said.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican said it was ``90 percent certain'' that the
fund-raiser, Bruce Teitelbaum, would go ahead with creating the
committee. Although some details of its structure were still being
worked out, the committee would be set up independently of Lazio,
and would be exempt from most restrictions on campaign
contributions, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   As contemplated, the independent committee would provide prove a
much-needed assist for Lazio, the Suffolk County Republican who
entered the race only three months ago to replace Giuliani, who is
undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been under pressure to raise money fast in order to
catch up with his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for Senate has collected $18.6 million,
compared with the $8.5 million accumulated by Lazio, who has said
he needs at least $15 million to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum is reported to have said he thought he could raise
several million dollars from the network of Giuliani's supporters,
or, perhaps more accurately, opponents of Clinton. The money would
probably go to finance television advertisements and other
activities, like a get-out-the-vote drive, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are some risks here for Lazio. He has
repeatedly criticized Clinton for what he has described as campaign
finance abuses, in particular, her use of committees that collect
largely unregulated soft money.
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, he signed a ``New York Freedom From Soft
Money Pact,'' while Clinton was collecting such contributions in
California. And he has also campaigned with Sen. John McCain, who
has led the effort in Washington to eliminate soft money and who is
expected to make a television advertisement on Lazio's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum helped Giuliani raise $23 million before he quit the
race, an amount that stunned Clinton and her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum declined to comment this week. Lazio's campaign
manager, Bill Dal Col, did not return several calls seeking comment
on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is largely unregulated contributions raised by
political party committees and outside groups. By law, it is not
supposed to be used to directly promote a candidacy, but the
parties have found ways to work around that. Contributions to the
official campaign committees, like those set up for Lazio and
Clinton, are limited to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign says she has two soft-money accounts set up
with outside committees. Lazio has none, his aides said. One
official familiar with the negotiations to set up the new committee
said that in order to avoid such criticism the committee would be
an independent entity that would raise and spend money on its own _
and, at least officially, without Lazio's knowledge, to make
certain that the committee does not run afoul of election laws.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Lazio acknowledged this week that they were aware of
what Teitelbaum, and a small group of other Lazio supporters, were
trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Teitelbaum is notable for political, as well as
financial, reasons. Until now, Giuliani has seemed to offer what
many Republicans have viewed as perfunctory support for Lazio,
although he did urge his donors to turn over contributions to the
congressman.

WRESTLERS' DISPUTE MIRED IN COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympics begin in three weeks, but the roster of the
U.S. Greco-Roman wrestling team remains in a legal chokehold.
</P>
<P>
   A match between Matt Lindland and Keith Sieracki took only
minutes at the Olympic trials in June, but two months later, the
outcome remains locked in a judicial tug of war between federal
arbitrators and federal judges. Sports law experts say the ultimate
referee could be the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki, an Army sergeant, defeated Lindland, a four-time
national champion in the 167{-pound category, by a score of 2-1 in
their deciding bout at the Olympic trials. Lindland filed an
immediate protest, saying he had been tripped in violation of
Greco-Roman rules, which prohibit the use of the legs to conduct a
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. wrestling federation, the sport's national governing
body, rejected the protest, and the case became as entangled as the
two wrestlers on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic athletes have the right to seek binding federal
arbitration to resolve disputes, according to the federal Olympic
and Amateur Sports Act. All sports federations under the Olympic
umbrella also agree to be bound by rulings of the American
Arbitration Association, and the U.S. Olympic Committee has
Olympians sign a code of conduct form saying they will submit to
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the whole resolution process has been thrown on its ear,''
said Jeff Benz, a lawyer who represented the cyclist Christine
Witty in another arbitration case. ``We're back to having courts
resolve sports disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland first filed for arbitration, and an arbitrator ordered
a rematch, which Lindland won, 8-0. Saying he thought the rematch
was merely practice, Sieracki then filed his own arbitration case,
saying the first arbitration decision should be invalidated because
he had never been invited to the proceeding to defend himself.
Thursday, an arbitrator ruled in Sieracki's favor, and it appeared
he would be heading to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindland took his case to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago, which ruled later on Thursday that the original
arbitration should be enforced and that USA Wrestling should submit
Lindland's name to the USOC for participation in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The committee now finds itself with a difficult decision. Both
Sieracki and Lindland have won arbitration rulings. The committee
is not bound by the 7th Circuit ruling, although Judge Frank
Easterbrook wrote in his decision, ``We trust the USOC will act
responsibly once it receives USA Wrestling's nomination of
Lindland.''
</P>
<P>
   Easterbrook suggested that both wrestlers might have to be named
to the Olympic team. International Olympic rules would not allow
for that without a waiver from wrestling's world governing body.
Short of that, the USOC will have to choose either Sieracki or
Lindland or let the case play itself out in the courts, legal
experts said. Mike Moran, a spokesman for the committee, said
yesterday that it would study the matter over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The case has pointed out the weakness in the USOCs arbitration
process. Ed Williams, a New York lawyer who helped write the
athletes' rights section of the Olympic and Amateur Sports Right
Act, said it might be necessary to amend the act to make sure that
all parties were brought together at one arbitration hearing so
that conflicting arbitration rulings did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it might be necessary to state in writing that
``field of play'' decisions made by referees or umpires are off
limits to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this decision by the first arbitrator may cause other
athletes to consider whether they want to arbitrate field-of-play
decisions,'' Williams said, which could lead to a chaotic situation
in which baseball players take umpires' calls to arbitration and
figure skaters challenge judges' subjective rulings. ``It has been
generally understood that decisions by referees or umpires are not
subject to arbitration, but we haven't written it down in the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sieracki is exploring his legal options, said his
lawyer, Lt. Col. Dan Shaver. One is to seek to have the arbitration
ruling in his favor validated by a federal appeals court, just as
Lindland did. That would leave conflicting decisions, which may
require the Supreme Court to adjudicate, sports law experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides my divorce, it's the most frustrating thing I've ever
been through, and my divorce was pretty frustrating,'' Sieracki
told The Associated Press. He added: ``I've always felt you were
supposed to leave it all on the mat, not in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland called the conflicting legal rulings ``insanity'' but
told reporters he felt he felt compelled to appeal what he thought
was a ridiculous outcome at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know you're right, it's hard to say, `Whatever,' and
walk away,'' Lindland said. ``My nature is not to quit.'' &QL;

PESTICIDE MAKERS ARE SUED OVER LOBSTER DEATHS IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Ill.)   By ALAN FEUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 1,100 lobstermen from New York and Connecticut filed a
federal lawsuit on Friday charging that pesticides sprayed last
year to kill mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus had devastated
the lobster population in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Central Islip,
N.Y., seeks at least $125 million from five pesticide
manufacturers. They are accused of disregarding the likelihood that
their products would seep into coastal waters and kill marine life.
While the suit acknowledges that New York  &UR; s &LR; tate, Connecticut, New
York City and Suffolk County used the pesticides to fight the
spread of West Nile, it does not accuse any public officials of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says lobstermen have witnessed a ``dramatic and
severe'' decrease in the number of lobsters in Long Island Sound.
This decrease, the suit maintains, began immediately after heavy
rains washed the pesticides into the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Laura McGowan, a spokeswoman for Clarke Mosquito Control
Products Inc. of Roselle, Ill., one of the defendants, said she had
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it. Representatives
of the other pesticide manufacturers named in the suit could not be
reached for comment. They are Cheminova Inc. of Wayne, N.J.; its
parent, Cheminova Agro of Denmark; Agrevo Environmental Health,
which has headquarters in Frankfurt; and Zoecon Corp. of
Schaumburg, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone N. Jones, the lead lawyer for the lobstermen, said the
spraying of pesticides had wiped out about 90 percent of last
year's full-grown lobster population. Jones also said the
pesticides had killed many young and larval lobsters, meaning that
the lobster harvest in the sound could be damaged for 5 to 10 more
years.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the lobstermen had chosen to sue the pesticide
manufacturers because they were in the best position to warn
government officials of the product dangers. ``They had the
information in their control that in all likelihood, this fishery
would be wiped out,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also pointed out that like insects, lobsters are
arthropods and are particularly susceptible to pesticides.

TWO NEW CASES OF WEST NILE FEVER CONFIRMED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two elderly women have become seriously ill from the
West Nile virus, bringing the number of those infected this summer
to five, health officials said Friday as they announced that the
city would intensify its spraying of pesticides over the weekend in
response.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people infected this year with the virus is
sharply lower than it was at this point last year, when the West
Nile virus first emerged in the Western Hemisphere and killed seven
people in the New York metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   But while health officials were far more prepared this year to
combat the spread of infected mosquitoes _ at this point last year,
the city had yet to identify the disease that was sickening
residents _ the evolution and the spread of the disease are still
confounding health experts as West Nile expands beyond municipal
and state borders.
</P>
<P>
   And once again officials are being forced to turn to costly
pesticide spraying even though its efficacy is hard to know
definitively.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two women whose cases were disclosed Friday is an
87-year-old from Brooklyn who was admitted to a hospital on Aug. 7
for surgery and who developed encephalitis on Aug. 15. She later
suffered seizures and is now in a coma in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The other woman, who is 84, is in stable condition in a hospital
after becoming ill on Aug. 18 with symptoms like those of
encephalitis. She was admitted to the hospital last Sunday. Initial
tests indicated that both women had contracted the West Nile virus.
Officials would not release the victims' names.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to draw definite conclusions about the
final path that West Nile will take this year. Health officials
have long warned that the next two-week period is likely to yield
the greatest number of sick people. But some interesting
distinctions have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   One is clearly that for all the difficulties in predicting the
ways of the illness _ where it will emerge most strongly, who is
most vulnerable to it, what will combat it best _ the state has
done a formidable job of warding off a larger calamity this year.
</P>
<P>
   By this point last summer, 10 people had been identified as
having fallen ill with West Nile and one would soon die, though
health officials mistakenly thought it was St. Louis encephalitis
that was causing the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading larvicide and conducting a public information campaign
intended to rid the city of standing pools of water and to
encourage residents to reduce bites by wearing long pants and
long-sleeved shirts contributed to the smaller numbers of cases,
experts agreed. ``The various things that the state and city have
done to reduce exposure has undoubtedly had a positive effect on
reducing cases,'' said Ward Stone, chief wildlife pathologist for
the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

L. BRYCE BOYER, 84, PSYCHOANALYST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. L. Bryce Boyer, a psychoanalyst who advanced the concept of
countertransference in doctor-patient communication, died on Aug. 9
in Walnut Creek, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer, whose practice was in Berkeley, Calif., was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Transference, in psychotherapy, is the unconscious tendency of
patients to transfer to analysts feelings and attitudes associated
with significant influences in the patients' early lives. The
feelings, affectionate or hostile, may relate to a parent, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   In countertransference, the analysts may experience emotional
reactions reflecting their own inner conflicts and needs.
</P>
<P>
   In classical psychoanalysis, countertransference was regarded as
an obstacle to treatment. But Boyer argued that analysts' feelings
could be important tools in understanding patients and helping the
analysis to progress. It was not a popular view, and many
mainstream analysts shunned Boyer and his approach.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer also believed that psychoanalysis should be more than a
treatment for the neuroses of the ``worried well,'' as he put it.
Instead he championed it as a treatment for people with serious
psychological disturbances like psychosis, severe borderline
pathology, psychosomatic illness or addiction.
</P>
<P>
   He lectured throughout the Americas and Europe and published
numerous books and articles. His ideas found a more favorable
reception abroad, he thought, particularly in South America.
</P>
<P>
   His most important papers were collected in ``The Regressed
Patient'' (1983) and ``Countertransference and Regression'' (1998).
Each remains in print.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer was the founder of Boyer House in San Rafael, Calif., a
residential psychoanalytic treatment center operated by a nonprofit
foundation. He trained the staff and provided the guidance for the
treatment of clients, who live in households of three to five
people in central Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Boyer was born in Vernal, Utah, and received his medical
degree at Stanford University in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Dr. Ruth McDonald Boyer,
an anthropologist and historian of folk art; two sons, Nehemiah and
Dewey; nine grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer shared a keen interest in his wife's professional work.
They traveled together and occasionally joined forces writing and
editing.
</P>
<P>
   They studied indigenous cultures and the effect of outside
forces on them, and developed a lasting relationship with the
Mescalero Apaches, who adopted Boyer, an avid student of folklore
traditions, as a shaman.

LAUSD COVETS SELLECK PROPERTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actor Tom Selleck's brother is facing off against
the Los Angeles Unified School District in a jobs vs. schools
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Daniel F. Selleck wants to build a $20 million
commercial complex in Van Nuys, a suburb of Los Angeles in the San
Fernando Valley. But the planned facility -- which would employ
2,000 people -- is being challenged by LAUSD officials who want the
property for a much-needed high school.
</P>
<P>
   Selleck told a city Planning Commission hearing officer that he
bought the old Carnation Ice Cream plant at 8015 Van Nuys Blvd. in
May 1999 and was moving forward with development plans when the
district contacted him two weeks ago about using it for a high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just putting the final touches on this major
project,'' Selleck said after the meeting. ``Waiting until the last
minute isn't a wise way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Selleck Development Group is willing to negotiate
with the district -- but only if the school board sticks to a tight
``good faith'' time schedule without dragging the deal on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is money, and we can't sit around waiting forever for
them to make a decision,'' Selleck said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials asked the commission to delay granting Selleck
a permit to develop the property so they could decide whether they
want it for a high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crisis stage here, and schools must be a
priority,'' said school board member Julie Korenstein.
</P>
<P>
   The district plans to open 18 new schools in the Valley within
the next seven years and broke ground in Van Nuys this week on the
Valley's first new elementary school in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Korenstein said the Northeast Valley is one of the areas hardest
hit by the county's school crisis, with more than 12,000 students
attending three of the area's high schools: James Monroe High, Van
Nuys High and Francis Polytechnic High. In the next six years, she
said, the number will grow by at least 6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Selleck said he plans to begin construction in October on a
project that includes manufacturing, retail space, a warehouse and
a fast-food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Korenstein said the district has been considering the site for
the last two years and approved an initial feasibility study in
November -- showing the school would cost from $83 million to $92
million to build -- but has not yet made a purchase offer to
Selleck. She could not say why the district had waited until this
month to contact Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a prime spot, and the bottom line is, if it comes down
to taking the land by eminent domain we might have to consider
that, but we're more than willing to negotiate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, invoked the Belmont
Learning Center and Ambassador Hotel scandals in arguing for a
quick decision on the use of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont was half built before explosive and toxic gas problems
that had been largely ignored forced the district to abandon the
$170 million project. LAUSD also has been locked in a 10-year war
over seizing the Ambassador Hotel property by eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the need for schools, but we don't want to see
another long, drawn-out debacle like the Ambassador Hotel or
Belmont,'' Alarcon said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to the developer, who has shown they can build
good projects that create quality jobs like they did at the former
(General Motors) plant site.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Bellomo, the district's top environmental safety officer,
said a new environmental review system would help speed along the
process, and a full report from the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control is due in the next few months on whether any
environmental safety mitigation measures are needed at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horror stories of the Ambassador Hotel are over,'' Bellomo
said. ``We've already developed a work plan for this site, and
we're prepared to move quickly as far as the environmental issues
are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the site was particularly attractive because it does not
appear to be heavily polluted.
</P>
<P>
   The zoning hearing was headed by Robert Duenas, a city planner,
who extended the public input period until Sept. 4. The full
Planning Commission is set to make a final decision on Selleck's
application for a zoning variance Sept. 28.

SERGE LEBOVICI, 85, OF FRANCE; STUDIED MOTHER-AND-CHILD BOND 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Serge Lebovici, a psychoanalyst known for his work with
infants, children and adolescents and a major figure in French
psychoanalysis, died on Aug. 12 in the south of France, where he
had gone for a professional project. He was 85 and lived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovici wrote more than 500 scholarly papers and books, many
dealing with the development of babies and with the bond between
mother and child. For some 30 years he examined that bond in the
light of the work of the psychologist John Bowlby, who focused
largely on attachment theory and the damage that ensues when
children are separated from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   He also explored the biological basis for that bond, the
fantasies of the mother and the autoerotic activity of the child.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 to 1977, Lebovici was president of the London-based
International Psychoanalytical Association, which was founded by
Sigmund Freud in 1910. He was the first French analyst elected to
the post.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced in the mainstream of Freudian analysis and promoted
it throughout his career. He also defended its classical approach
against unorthodox practitioners and introduced his French
colleagues to the works of Anna Freud and Melanie Klein, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Two books that he edited with colleagues remain in print in this
country, ``Psychoanalysis in France'' (International Universities
Press, 1980) and ``International Annals of Adolescent Psychiatry''
(University of Chicago Press, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Serge Lebovici was born in Paris. His medical studies at the
University of Paris were interrupted by World War II, and he spent
two years as a prisoner of war. After the war he trained as a
pediatrician but soon turned to child psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the child psychiatry clinic of the University of Paris
in 1946 and began his psychoanalytic training with Sacha Nacht,
head of the Paris Psychoanalytic Society. In the years that
followed he played a major role in the development of child
psychiatry and influenced generations of its practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Lebovici became a professor of psychiatry at the
University of Paris-Nord, and he remained on the faculty until his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovici's survivors include his wife of 58 years, Dr. Ruth Roos
Lebovici, a psychoanalyst; two daughters, Marianne and Elisabeth;
and two grandsons.

WILLIAM CASHEL JR., 80, EX-CHAIRMAN OF CAMPBELL SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Del., Calif., N.J., Ky., Okla.)   By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William S. Cashel Jr., the former chairman of Campbell Soup and
the chief financial officer of AT&AMP;T during its deregulation, died
on Tuesday at his home in Amelia Island, Fla. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his wife,
Marie, said.
</P>
<P>
   Cashel spent most of his career with American Telephone and
Telegraph, rising to the position of vice chairman and chief
financial officer in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The government ordered the reorganization of the company in
1982, which required it to divest itself of 22 local telephone
companies, while retaining its long-distance service; Western
Electric Co., its manufacturing arm; and Bell Laboratories, its
research operation. Cashel led a group of executives from all parts
of the company charged with devising an equitable breakup that
would meet the government mandate and ensure the financial
viability of all of the new companies.
</P>
<P>
   The team came up with a plan for dividing over $80 billion in
assets _ everything from physical equipment like the cables that
brought service to businesses and homes to accounts receivable.
When Cashel left AT&AMP;T in 1983, the final plan had been submitted to
the company chairman, Charles L. Brown. The breakup was completed
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Cashel was named chairman of Campbell Soup in 1984; he had been
on the company's board since 1976. He served as chairman for four
years, and retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cashel graduated from Dartmouth College in 1941 with a
bachelor's degree. During World War II he served with the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 he joined Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, one of the local telephone companies within AT&AMP;T, as
an engineer. In the next 31 years, Cashel held several positions
with AT&AMP;T units, including general manager at Diamond State
Telephone Co. in Wilmington, Del., and president of Bell Telephone
Co. of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia from 1970 to 1977, before he
became chief financial officer of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, William
III, of Pasadena, Calif.; Robert, of Summit, N.J.; and Peter, of
Harrodsburg, Ky.; a daughter, Christine, of Stillwater, Okla.; and
seven grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A SEARCHING LOOK AT FLIGHT 800 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 26:
</P>
<P>
   As flying becomes safer, crashes become harder to explain. That
has been the paradox hovering over the investigation of the TWA
Flight 800 disaster. In the immediate aftermath of the crash, which
killed all 230 people on board, there were theories that the plane
had been brought down by terrorists or an errant missile.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after one of the most painstaking investigations in the
history of aviation, the National Transportation Safety Board has
ruled out those possibilities. Instead, the board determined that a
``fuel/air explosion inside the center wing tank'' was the probable
cause of the Boeing 747's breaking up in midair off Long Island,
N.Y., 12 minutes into its flight from Kennedy Airport to Paris on
July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What is not known for certain is what ignited the explosion,
though a short circuit in electrical wiring is strongly suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The only wiring inside fuel tanks consists of low-voltage wires
for fuel gauges. A short circuit there is deemed unlikely. But
inspectors believe that a short circuit in wiring outside the tank
may have led to a surge of current in the wiring inside, providing
the spark. In the absence of certainty, the Federal Aviation
Administration has drafted three dozen airworthiness directives on
fuel tank safety that seek to address each possible ignition and
explosion source.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to make a jet's fuel tanks less flammable. The
fuel in an aircraft's center wing tank is flammable roughly a third
of the time, when the combination of air, fuel vapors and
temperature is just so.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says that ``nitrogen inerting'' technology has been
rapidly developed as a result of the crash. This technology should
soon enable airlines to replace the air in gas tanks with inert gas
before takeoff, significantly reducing the amount of time the
center wing tank's fuel is flammable. The other approach is to
eliminate possible sparks. Here the FAA has focused on worn wiring.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800 will also be remembered for its impact on the way
victims' families are treated in the aftermath of an air crash.
Reacting to the families' plight, Congress passed legislation
requiring that airlines act more efficiently and more humanely in
providing them assistance and information. But the most fitting way
for government and industry to honor the dead is through steps
designed to prevent a similar disaster in the future.

EDITORIAL: FINDING QUALIFIED TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
 -NYT   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 26:
</P>
<P>
   New York state's education commissioner, Richard Mills, and New
York City's schools chancellor, Harold Levy, have reached a
compromise on a lawsuit by the state aimed at barring the city from
placing uncertified teachers in low-performing schools as of next
month. The accord gives the city breathing room but requires it to
reach full compliance by 2001. This will not be easy, given a
nationwide teacher shortage that could stagger schools statewide
unless Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature develop a strategy to
produce and recruit high-quality teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mills brought the lawsuit to enforce a new state regulation
requiring the city to hire only certified teachers in
low-performing schools beginning this fall. The compromise allows
the city to delay its compliance in high-shortage fields like math
and science, in recognition that filling these positions will be
difficult. But the same regulation that resulted in this suit will
soon require that every newly hired teacher in the state be
certified. This will be problematic. There is a national bidding
war for teacher talent, and about half the state's teacher corps
could actually retire over the next decade. For starters, New York
needs to pass a law allowing seasoned teachers who have reached age
55 to pay their pensions into an annuity and continue teaching
without an earnings limitation.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature has begun to focus on the problem but has
fallen short of the inventiveness that is on display in
Massachusetts, California, New Jersey and North Carolina. In the
1990s, Gov. James B. Hunt led North Carolina to greater gains on
national reading tests than in any other state. North Carolina
raised statewide teacher salaries, supplied novice teachers with
paid mentors as well as other supports, and gives financial rewards
for teachers who achieve national certification. Albany will need
to devise similar measures to get New York through its teacher
shortage.

EDITORIAL: REAL CONFESSIONS

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 26: &QL;

   Court TV, which has distinguished itself with live coverage of
court proceedings, will offer a new and bizarre program this fall.
``Confessions,'' the new entry, will be a 30-minute show, with each
episode presenting three videotaped police confessions of people
who have committed murders, rapes and other violent crimes.
Broadcasting the tapes is legal because they are part of the public
record in cases where the suspects were convicted or were found not
guilty by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV executives say ``Confessions'' fits in perfectly with
their network's mission of exposing the inner workings of the
criminal justice system. But culling out the grisliest snippets of
selected criminal confessions is little more than a rank appeal to
prurience and the thrill of violence, motivated by the network's
desire for an audience-grabbing hit.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be cheaper to produce than simply replaying grainy
videotapes made by police and prosecutors. Each confession will be
edited down to 10 minutes or less. There will be no host or
narration, no explanation of the cases, how the suspects were found
or how long the interrogation process actually took, because that
would detract from the show's ``watchability,'' explains one Court
TV executive.
</P>
<P>
   Since a confession tape is ``just a guy talking,'' says the
executive, it may not hold viewers without some added visual
texture. So the show's creators will put in split-screen
re-enactments of the crime scene and other atmospheric images,
alongside the criminal confessor.
</P>
<P>
   Since its beginning, Court TV has given viewers solid programs
focusing on many aspects of criminal justice. The role confessions
play is a worthy subject. But a few minutes of isolated tape cannot
provide meaningful insight into criminality or even into the minds
of these particular offenders. Worse, the utter lack of context can
actually misinform viewers about how interrogations work.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV made its mark with gavel-to-gavel coverage of trials
that showed the entire courtroom process. The network has the legal
right to show the confession tapes. But it is regrettable that it
is willing to sabotage its reputation for serious legal journalism
with a lurid show where tales of murder are offered as a night's
entertainment.
