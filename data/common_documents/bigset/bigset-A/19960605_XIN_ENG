<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry has decided to insure the
construction of a private sector-funded power plant in China for
300 million U.S. dollars, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, in southern China, is the first such project
to win Japanese insurance, it quoted ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2-billion-dollar, Chinese-Hong Kong joint venture
involves the construction of two 660-megawatt, coal-fired power
plants by 1999 in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp., which
have 700-million-dollar contracts to supply the plant's power
generators, have been pressing the ministry for insurance
guarantees to reduce the risks, Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Assures Investors Zimbabwe's Land Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe said today
his government's controversial land acquisition policy is not
designed to deter foreign investors, but rather to correct past
injustices against the majority black population.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day trade and investment conference here, Mugabe
said the policy does not restrict industrial and commercial land
ownership and that foreign investors have nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the Standard Chartered Bank, is
being attended by over 200 business delegates from Malaysia,
Italy, the United Kingdom, Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "our laws do not prohibit, neither do they
restrict, foreign ownership of industrial and commercial
properties, including land.
</P>
<P>
"Our detractors may wish to mislead you into believing that we
are bent on dispossessing investors of their property, especially
in relation to the land acquisition act. I would like to dispel
any such misconceptions," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the second phase of the economic structural adjustment
program, which the government is soon to embark on, Mugabe said
the investment environment would be even more attractive.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore invite you to put your investment capital and
expertise in the traditional and non-traditional sectors of our
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added the government would wrestle to reduce the high
budget deficit and cut escalating interest and inflation rates so
as to restore investor confidence in the Zimbabwean economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British Overseas Development
Minister Baroness Lynda Chalker said here today that South Africa
should start cooperating with other southern African countries to
achieve sustained economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chalker made the remarks while addressing delegates to a
two-day trade and investment conference here.
</P>
<P>
She said South Africa should create an open trading
environment with its neighbours by reducing impediments to free
trade, such as import tariffs and export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
She said the European Union was currently negotiating a free
trade agreement with South Africa, which she believed would lead
to new trading opportunities and contribute to sustainable
economic development and political stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
''In southern Africa, South Africa clearly has an important
role to play in constructing an open trading position and in
working with regional partners to boost trade and investment
flows within the region,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
''We are encouraging South Africa to look sympathetically at
the needs of Zimbabwe and other SADC countries for fairer trading
arrangements, in particular by reducing impediments to free trade
such as import tariffs and export subsidies, in the interests of
the long-term prosperity of southern Africa's economy as a
whole,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by over 200 senior business
executives from Malaysia, Italy, the UK, South Africa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, among others. enditem

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Make Progress on Ulster Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland indicated today
that they have made "substantial" progress toward agreeing an
agenda for all-party talks on the political future of Northern
Ireland due to start later this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after meeting Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring this morning, British Ulster
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said it had been a "very good
morning" and "there are certain matters that we wish to refer to
heads of government."
</P>
<P>
Spring, who had to break off his talks with Mayhew to meet
visiting Irish President Mary Robinson, said "we have made
substantial progress."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are expected to hold another round of talks
later this evening.
</P>
<P>
They held their first round of talks hours after Irish
Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas said they were unlikely to call a
new ceasefire ahead of the all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
An IRA source told BBC radio in Belfast that the possibility of
a new ceasefire was remote.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the IRA statement, Downing Street today
reaffirmed the British stand that Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, would not be allowed to attend the peace talks unless the
IRA declared an "unequivocal" ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The IRA broke a 17-month truce in February with the first of a
new series of bomb attacks in London. The British government has
since declared that Sinn Fein would be barred from the all-party
peace talks under the current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments are trying to reach agreement
over the timetable for decommissioning of terrorist arms and also
for the peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.

enable the United Front coalition government headed by Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda to seek a vote of confidence, an official
announcement said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second part of the first session of the 11th Lok

former president Neelam Sanjiva Reddy who died on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The motion of confidence will be taken up on June 11 and
disposed of on the same day, the report said.
</P>

HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- World chief executive of the United
Kingdom-based Standard Chartered Bank said today Zimbabwean
companies should revamp production and marketing standards so as
to compete on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a trade and investment conference here, Williamson
(we just got his first name) said the world is increasingly
becoming a smaller place where quality and uniform standards
would distinguish outstanding players from the rest.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe needed to become an integral part of a global
entity rather than operate in isolation of events in the new global
economic village.
</P>
<P>
He called for a greater emphasis on quality, saying Zimbabwean
companies should realize they have in the past prospered in a
shortage economy where quality has "taken a back seat."
</P>
<P>
The banker also said Zimbabwe has the potential to attract foreign
investment, but stressed the need to level the playing field for
international businesses.

<HEADLINE> Africa Not to Rely on Charity, Says Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Africa could not continue to rely
on charity and aid because donors' conditions would always
compromise the recipients, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here today.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba made the remarks in his speech to a regional
rotary conference here. The speech was read on his behalf by
Mines Minister Keli Walubita.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''National sovereignty and independence of action
will always be compromised if we are seen as perpetual beggars
and recipients of foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa had the means to conquer the economic
malaise afflicting the sub-region and what was required was a
common resolve to tackle the problem at the root.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were no short cuts to national prosperity
but that hard work, thrift, perseverance and sound consistent
government policies were the main requisites.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba promised that his government would work with
the rotary club and other non-governmental organizations that
were concerned with the alleviation of hardships faced by the
people in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by delegates from rotary
clubs of Botswana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mayote, Tanzania and
Zambia. enditem

<HEADLINE> Seles Ousted at French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Three-time French Open titlist Monica
Seles, sharing-top seed here, was eliminated in the quarterfinals
by Jana Novotna 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The American lost her first bid for the championship since
stabbing three years ago and also suffered her first defeat at the
French Open since her 1989 loss to Steffi Graf in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, defending champion Graf easily advanced to the
semifinals with a 6-3, 6-1 win over fifth-seeded Iva Majoli of
Croatia in 53 minutes, and Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario beat
unseeded Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 10-8.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Vovotna, 10th-seeded here, set the pace with Seles,
forcing the American into 29 unforced errors. Novotna was up 3-0
and 4-1 in the second set, but despite her reputation for blowing
big leads managed to close out the match in the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
Serving for the match, the Czech went down 15-40 but saved two
break points as Seles made four straight errors to end the contest.
</P>
<P>
Seles missed nearly four months of play this year with an
injured left shoulder, but she insisted her loss Tuesday had
nothing to do with it. Seles still suffers some pain, but
said: "I've been used to that."
</P>
<P>
Novotna will meet Sanchez for a place in Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, the fourth-seed and a winner here in 1989 and 1994 and
a finalist last year, needed all her legendary fighting spirit to
prevent a major upset against an opponent who had her on the ropes
early in the third set.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the 26-year-old German who is bidding to win the event
for a fifth time, now plays either third-seed Conchita Martinez of
Spain or American ninth-seed Lindsay Davenport.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Discuss Semi-conductors, Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale today
discussed trade issues including disputes over semi-conductors and
insurance, a top Japanese government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During an 80-minute meeting at the premier's official
residence, Hashimoto and Mondale agreed on the need for Japan and
the United States to continue sincerely their talks on
semi-conductors, insurance and other bilateral economic issues,
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
But Hashimoto expressed concern over whether bilateral talks
can resolve the semi-conductor trade dispute, noting that Europe
has also shown a desire to join the talks, Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has rejected a U.S. call to renew their bilateral chip
pact beyond its expiration July 31, arguing that government
involvement is no longer necessary given the growing presence of
foreign chips in the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and U.S. semi-conductor industries are discussing
a private-sector partnership to replace the pact, but there are
differences over whether they need government involvement in one
form or another.
</P>
<P>
Mondale told reporters after the meeting that he and Hashimoto
also discussed the upcoming summit of the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrialized nations in Lyons, France.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment when asked if he made any new proposals
on the semi-conductor row or if there was discussion on the
so-called "third-sector" insurance market dispute.
</P>
<P>
Japan is planning to deregulate its insurance market and allow
companies to enter the third sector of sickness, accident and
nursing insurance products.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants that area, already dominated by foreign
companies, to remain closed until there is an agreement on opening
up other areas of the Japanese insurance market to foreign
competitors.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Cope with Drought Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma
has announced the country's drought stricken and outlined
measures to deal with the situation, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at State House in Windhoek on
Monday, Nujoma said about 180,000 people would need drought
relief food aid.
</P>
<P>
Namibia this year experienced one of its worst rainy seasons
ever, with very few parts of the country receiving 50 percent of
normal rainfall, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said grazing conditions in most sectors are "very poor"
and that serious water problems are being experienced in many
areas, including the capital Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
"The situation can indeed be described as serious and, if not
addressed now, will become more acute and lead to the disruption
of normal economic and social activities," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Among measures to deal with the situation, the Namibian
government would spend 159.34 million Namibian Dollars (about 37
million US Dollars) for drought relief and water provision.
</P>
<P>
However, external financial assistance of about 40 million US
Dollars for additional water projects is needed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers are being encouraged to reduce livestock
and would be assisted financially to restock later.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural bank loans and seeds for the new planting season
for poorer farmers are among the measures to assist during the
drought.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma also stressed that the government is busy with a
program that includes upgrading boreholes, tanker services,
extracting water from an old mine and providing pipelines to
alleviate water shortages.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
increased its financial assistance to Namibia by 15 percent to
286 million Namibian Dollars (about 66.5 million US Dollars) for
the next five-year period, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
EU Ambassador to Namibia Roger Leenders told President Sam
Nujoma in Windhoek on Monday that the assistance, under the
renegotiated Lome iv Convention, had been increased as Namibia
served as a model for implementing democracy and respecting human
rights, said the report.
</P>
<P>
''Namibia did very well up to now,'' said Leenders.
</P>
<P>
He also said the funds for the National Indicative Program
(NIP) excluded those made available under various sub-programs.
</P>
<P>
During the first financing round of the convention, the EU
made about 186 million Dollars available to Namibia, of which
about 57 million Dollars under the NIP.
</P>
<P>
However, Leenders said the new allocation would be for
education, agriculture and production. Additional funds could
also be made available on request. enditem

<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- France's overseas investment in 1995
dropped 21 percent from the previous year to 9.56 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign investment the country attracted -- 12.1
billion dollars -- remained almost the same as in 1994, the Bank
of France said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the decline in overseas investment to
falling investment in the U.S. and European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, French investment in the U.S. slid 62 percent to 1.3
billion dollars, and its investment in the EU countries was 4.06
billion dollars, accounting for 43 percent of the country's total
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France's investment in Asia surged 55 percent to 560
million dollars, and in eastern Europe, its investment rose 266
percent to one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S remained the top foreign investor in France, with 3.58
billion dollars in 1995. It was followed by Britain with 2.92
billion dollars.

today when they crossed the Nepal-India border on their way to
Thimphu, capital of Bhutan, Nepal's official news agency RSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The refugee marchers boarded two buses this morning from an
eastern Nepali border town for an Indian town as they had to go
across the Indian territory to arrive in Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
But they were arrested by Indian police soon after the two
buses entered the Indian territory, the RSS report said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested marchers were among the 209 refugees who resumed
their peace march to Bhutan last week from East Nepal where they
have been living for six years.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Movement Coordination Council (AMCC), a Bhutanese
refugee organization in Nepal, launched the peace march movement
in January appealing to the Bhutanese authorities for free
repatriation of nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the AMCC suspended the march after Indian police
repeatedly intercepted and arrested refugee marchers when they
were trying to cross the Nepal-India border for Bhutan.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Non-Formal Schools Start Functioning in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- One thousand non-formal schools,
out of the target of 10,000 such schools to be set up within five
years, have started functioning in Pakistan, said official sources
here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters, Chairman of Prime Minister's
Literacy Commission Pervaiz Saleh said these schools have been set
up within three months after the hectic efforts of the commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the non-formal schools are economically more
feasible costing only 1,464 rupees (42 US dollars) for each
student as against the formal ones of 6,000 rupees (171 dollars)
for each.
</P>
<P>
The non-formal schools would be imparting education in three
years with a same certificate as the formal ones.
</P>
<P>
As to the quality, he said, initially it would not be at par
with the formal schools but gradually it will be made better.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's literacy rate is 37 percent. The government is
striving hard to improve the country's education level.

<HEADLINE> NATO FMs Meeting Ends With Call for Shaping New NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The spring session of the North
Atlantic Council ministerial meeting ended today in the historic
symbol of a divided Europe with a final communique which calls for
efforts to shape a new NATO to meet post-Cold War challenges.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting of foreign ministers from the 16 NATO member
countries was dominated by the issue of the alliance's adaptation
and reform process.
</P>
<P>
Other main topics were the NATO-led peace Implementation Force
(IFOR) operation in Bosnia, NATO's enlargement, the Partnership
for Peace program and NATO's relations with Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers stated in the final communique that it is
now the moment to take a "decisive step" forward in making NATO
"increasingly flexible and effective" to meet new challenges.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to carry further the ongoing adaptation of the
alliance's structures of which an essential part is to build a
European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to enhance their contribution to
security and stability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area by
broadening and deepening their dialogue and cooperation with
partners through the partnership program.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed NATO's intention to further develop their
important relations with Russia and Ukraine while maintaining
openness to new members through the established enlargement
process.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique, three fundamental objectives were
listed which will guide NATO's actions to improve the alliance's
capability, namely ensuring the alliance's military effectiveness,
preserving the transatlantic link and developing the ESDI within
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the 16 foreign ministers ratified the plan
to establish the Combined Joint Task Forces.
</P>
<P>
Under this new plan, European allies will be allowed to run,
under the banner of the West European Union (WEU), military
operations (peacekeeping or relief missions) in a regional crisis
without U.S. participation but use NATO's command structures,
intelligence, logistics and communications resources.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also approved the establishment of the Policy
Coordination Group for closer coordination of political and
military viewpoints to smooth the way for decision-making.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the IFOR mission in Bosnia, the ministers
stated that the IFOR will be maintained at approximately its
current force levels until after the elections which will have to
take place in September at the latest under the peace agreement,
and will retain its overall capability until December, when the
IFOR's mandate comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that NATO will develop a "strong, stable and
enduring partnership" with Russia. The partnership between the two
sides is an essential element of security in the Euro-Atlantic
area, they said.
</P>
<P>
Other issues such as NATO's relations with the WEU and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe follow-up conference in Vienna
and the dialogue with the Mediterranean countries were also
discussed at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Chips May Thwart US Export Ban: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. has quietly begun selling a powerful computer chip set that
is likely to undermine Washington's efforts to restrict the export
of its fundamental technology for protecting secrets and commerce
in the information age.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the Japanese product
uses much stronger data-encryption algorithms than United States
export laws permit. Computer specialists said by using such chips
and technology, more hi-tech products might be sold on the
international market without the notice of the data surveillance
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The NTT of Japan has already made sales in 15 countries,
including in the United States to IBM. The product is largely used
in local computer networks, the Internet and telephone switching
networks, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The NTT device also underscores fundamental differences that
exist between Japan and the United States on the issue of privacy
in the information age.
</P>
<P>
While United States officials have struggled to maintain their
ability to conduct electronic surveillance, it said, Japan's
Constitution specifically forbids wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese product is believed to be beyond the capability of
the most powerful code-breaking system, it said.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Mayor: Peace Process to Continue despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEBRON, THE WEST BANK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Hebron Mayor Mustafa
Abdel Nabi Natshe said here today that the Middle East peace
process is bound to proceed despite the problems that may arise
due to the forthcoming power takeover by the right-wing Likud
Party in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Natshe expressed his views on the prospect of the peace march in
the long run in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he believes that the peace process will continue
because not only the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, but also the
international community, including the Unites States, wants peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The choice of peace is not only a choice by the Palestinians
and Israelis, but also a choice by the international community,
for they want to see peace in the area," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the interview conducted in his office of the Hebron
Municipality Government, the mayor expressed his belief that the
international community will exert pressure on the forthcoming
Israeli government to continue the process, if it does not want
to do so of its own volition.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton does not want the
peace process to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his estimation of the influence the newly-elected
Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will exert on the
peace process, Natshe said it seems that the new Israeli leader
will put obstacles in the way of peace, and the pace of peace
making is contingent upon the Israeli cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"This depends upon them. If they want peace, they should
respect the peace agreements the Israeli government has signed
with us," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Mr. Netanyahu will not block the progress of the peace
process, and start to make his communications with our President
(Yasser) Arafat," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On comparison between Netanyahu and outgoing Prime Minister
Shimon Peres, the mayor said there are some differences between
the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Labor government has proceeded with the peace
process and signed the Oslo accords with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"He (Peres) did not move at the speed we want, he was slow,
but he moved," he noted, saying that if Peres had won, there
would have been no difficulties to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Mr. Netanyahu wishes to put obstacles and
ignores the Palestinian Authority, our leadership," he
complained. "This is not fair," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his first public speech in Jerusalem on June 2 since he was
elected prime minister, Netanyahu did not mention the PA, thereby
triggering complaints from the Palestinians and local press.
</P>
<P>
On similarity of Peres and Netanyahu, the mayor said that
"both of them are looking at our land, to confiscate it, to build
settlements and make bypass roads."
</P>
<P>
Natshe said he expects difficulties with the Netanyahu
government, because the prime minister-elect made his points of
view very clear in his election campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Mayor: Peace Process to Continue despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the prospect of Israeli troops withdrawal from Hebron, the
mayor said the Peres government has decided to withdraw from 85
percent of Hebron and the pullback was supposed to have started on
March 28.
</P>
<P>
Peres later postponed the pullout due to a series of suicide
bombings targeting Jews in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Natshe said the Israeli government is now going to change hands
and Peres "has escaped from fulfilling his commitment to the
Palestinians ... and left it to Mr. Netanyahu, his successor."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Natshe expected a longer period before the Israeli
withdrawal until "Netanyahu convinces himself that there will be
no other way" but abiding by the agreements and pulling out the
Israeli troops from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has been a hotbed for Palestinian-Israeli conflicts for
the past years.
</P>
<P>
On February 25, 1994, a Jewish extremist sneaked into the
Ibrahimi Mosque in the city and sprayed praying Moslems with a
hail of bullets. The incident, known as "Hebron massacre,"
resulted in killing 29 and wounding more than 100, and shocked
the world and put the peace process at stake for a considerable
period.
</P>
<P>
Today, heavy security measures were seen around the mosque.
Israeli soldiers were posted at many checkpoints with rifles posed
for possible attacks. In major streets and key intersections,
Israeli army vans full of soldiers were parked, maintaining a
close watch of passers-by.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was sure the Israelis will pull out in the
final analysis, Natshe said he was sure. "There will be a longer
period, but they will withdraw finally, because there will be no
peace without the Israeli withdrawal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said Hebron is the biggest city in the West Bank
with a population of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
On how to deal with the Jewish settlements after the Israeli
pullout, the mayor said that the settlements will remain amid the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said there are 200 Jewish settlers in the city and another
200 are students commuting between Hebron and two nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
"They (students) come in the morning and leave in the
afternoon, plus together, there are 400 Jews guarded by 1,500
Israeli soldiers," he noted, saying that these settlements will
remain as they are until the final negotiations of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of reconstruction in the city after the
Israeli withdrawal, Natshe said the government is mapping out
plans to invigorate the economy, adding that the Israeli
occupation has created many problems that severely affected the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The city, of course, has suffered from a very bad economic
situation," he said. "Since the massacre, the Israeli authorities
have taken severe measures against us, the victims -- they closed
streets, they closed markets, and there was a paralysis of economy
in the city."
</P>
<P>
He said that the local people expected a recovery of economy
after the Palestinian National Authority gains full power and
launches a large-scale rehabilitation program to accelerate the
economic construction.

<HEADLINE> Major, Arafat Meet on Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat today expressed the hope
that the Middle East peace process will continue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Major
this afternoon, President Arafat said that the Palestinians "are
committed to the Middle East peace process and respect the
democratic choice made by the Israeli people."
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit came just two days after Benjamin Netanyahu
defeated Israel's Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the general
election to become the new Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Arafat has called on Netanyahu, who
maintained a harder line in Arab-Israeli peace talks, to keep
promises made by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in London today for a two-day visit,
stressed, "We will work with the new Israeli government to
continue the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president also urged the Israeli government to
keep its promise to withdraw its troops from Hebron, the last of

<P>
"I hope that their withdrawal from Hebron will be exactly
according to what has been agreed upon between us and the Israeli
government -- on the 12th of this month," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Major said that very great progress has
been made over the past few years and he hoped peace negotiations
will continue towards a lasting peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Promises Greater Autonomy to States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- India's 13-party United Front
government today promised to grant greater autonomy to states
within the framework of political, administrative and economic
federalism.
</P>
<P>
"During its term of office, the United Front government will
advance the principles of political, administrative and economic
federalism. In each of these spheres powers will be devolved and
authority will be decentralized," the United Front said in its
common minimum program released here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the 25-page program, the United Front believes
that it is possible to take action, legislative and
administrative, on the following matters:
</P>
<P>
1) to give greater autonomy to states in determining their
priorities in development programs
</P>
<P>
2) to give states greater freedom to draw their state plans
within the broad framework of the national five-year plans.
</P>
<P>
3) to transfer most centrally-sponsored schemes to the control
of the state governments, and
</P>
<P>
4) to grant assent promptly to bills passed by state
legislatures on matters which were within the legislative powers
of the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
The front also promised a fresh review of the question of
devolution of financial powers from the central government to the
states.
</P>
<P>
During the April 27-May 7 general elections, regional parties
have won an unprecedented number of seats in the Lok Sabha (lower
house of parliament). The major regional parties, which have
joined the United Front, are pressing for greater autonomy from
the central government.

<HEADLINE> Republican Nationwide Missile Defense Bill Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans in the U.S.
Congress have been blocked by Democrats in their efforts for a
legislation to deploy a nationwide ballistic missile defense
system by 2003, Congress sources said today.
</P>
<P>
By a party-line vote of 53-46 Tuesday, the U.S. Senate fell
short of the votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster against
the missile defense legislation sponsored by Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60 votes were needed to end the debate and bring on
a vote on the Defend America Act calling for the deployment of the
defense system.
</P>
<P>
Republicans argued during the Senate debate that a national
missile defense system is needed now because of the growing threat
of missile attacks on the U.S. targets. But Democrats expressed
their support for the U.S. administration's stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has said that he favors a national
missile defense but does not believe that the system should be
deployed now because the threat of missile attack is remote.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that the missile defense system would be too
costly and undermine the strategic arms treaties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
A recent Congressional Budget Office study estimated that the
missile defense system would cost as much as 60 billion U.S.
dollars at its first stage.
</P>
<P>
The estimate has prompted the House Republican leaders to pull
their version of the bill, sponsored by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the United States
and Russia are limited to build a single ballistic missile defense
system. Russia has deployed its system around Moscow. The United
States has no defense against a long-range missile.

<HEADLINE> China, Sweden Hope to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sweden pays close attention to
China's development and expects bilateral trade and economic
cooperation to expand, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during talks with visiting Chinese Vice
Premier Zou Jiahua, who arrived Sunday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
China and Sweden are ready to further economic and technical
cooperation, Zou said, adding that the strengthening of
cooperation is in the interests of the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Leif Pagrotsky, director of the prime
minister's office, Zou said Sino-Swedish ties have developed well
since the two sides established diplomatic relations over 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, exchanges of high-level visits have been
frequent, while the growth of trade and the pace of economic,
scientific and technological cooperation have been satisfactory,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pagrotsky said Sweden supports the lifting of trade quotas
imposed on China by the European Union, and takes China's side in
its efforts to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier also held separate talks with
Parliamentary Speaker Birgitta Dahl and Junior Minister for
Foreign Trade Bjorn von Sydow on the last day of his visit.

<HEADLINE> McDonnell Douglas Workers Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 6,700 McDonnell Douglas
machinists went on strike Tuesday to protest against the aerospace
company's growing use of non-union workers.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from St. Louis this morning, three
busloads of machinists began marching outside plant entrances soon
after union leaders failed to settle the dispute with management.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the company's St. Louis headquarters, the only plant
affected by the strike, build the F-15 and the FA-18 fighters and
the Navy's T-45 training jet. They also build part of the Air
Force's C-17 cargo plane and are upgrading the Harrier strike
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The machinists overwhelmingly defeated the McDonnell Douglas
company's latest contract proposal on Sunday and federal mediators
had worked all day Tuesday for a deal before union leaders stormed
out.
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the dispute involves outsourcing, the
company's use of subcontractors and non-union McDonnell Douglas
plants for work once done by union machinists.
</P>
<P>
While McDonnell Douglas says outsourcing makes the company more
competitive, machinists regard outsourcing as a threat to their
jobs and point to 1,500 layoffs at the plant in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A similar dispute triggered the strike by General Motors brake
workers last December.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Estonian Ties Model of Equality: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TALLINN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Estonian President Lennart Meri
said today that Sino-Estonian ties could be held up as a model for
an equal relationship between a big nation and a small one.
</P>
<P>
He told Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who is here for a
three-day visit, that bilateral relations are problem-free and as
full of potential as "a boundless clear sky."
</P>
<P>
The two countries respect each other and their relations could
serve as a model for the development of equal and cooperative ties
between large and small states, Meri said.
</P>
<P>
He said China had contributed a great deal to the evolution of
human civilization and would play an important future role in
safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
</P>
<P>
Praising the achievements of China's economic reforms, he said
he believed that China has found its own development path by which
to chart its future course.
</P>
<P>
Li said China attaches importance to developing relations on
the basis of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit and mutual
non-interference in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
China respects Estonia's choice of political system and
ideology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li added that exchanges of visits by leaders of the two
countries have given impetus to the development of good relations.
</P>
<P>
Meri thanked China for its support for Estonia's efforts to
safeguard its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to further promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed Meri on China's views on the international
situation and China's independent foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He gave the assurance that the strengthening of Sino-Russian
relations is not directed against any third country and will not
harm the interests of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is touring five European nations, arrived in Tallinn
Tuesday after visits to Hungary, Poland and Lithuania. The vice
premier is expected to fly to Latvia Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Protect IPR Effectively (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Intellectual Property Right
holders- Chinese or foreign - must themselves bring complaints
before China's courts if they want legal action to be taken
against infringers.
</P>
<P>
Providing the institute proceedings China's legal system will
offer judicial protection and remedies to IPR holders with
complaints, or if their rights are infringed.
</P>
<P>
The assurances were announced by Li Guoguang, vice president of
the Supreme People's Court of China, at a press conference on
judicial protection of IPR in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Attended by Chinese and foreign journalists the press
conference was the court's first ever on IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
"The courts in China apply the same principle of 'No complaint,
no trial' in handling civil disputes on IPR as courts in all other
countries do," Li noted. "If the case is not taken to the court,
it cannot be tried."
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the seeming reluctance of some companies to
seek judicial protection, Chinese courts so far had only heard one
single case of Compact Disc piracy, in which Hong Kong Polygram
and 22 other companies sued Xu Huale, a businessman from Taiwan,
for copyright violation.
</P>
<P>
"The case was judged by the No.2 Intermediate People's Court in
Shanghai in favor of the plaintiffs, who received compensation of
over 6.67 million HK dollars," he revealed.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in recent years, China has attached much
importance to IPR-related legislation and a socialist legal system
for IPR protection with Chinese characteristics has been set up in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, courts across the country have accomplished
remarkable results in the trials of IPR cases with specialized
trial divisions and qualified judges.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the higher people's courts in Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu and Hainan, and the
intermediate people's courts in the capital cities of these
provinces and municipalities and in all special economic zones
have established IPR trial divisions.
</P>
<P>
In the higher and intermediate people's courts in other areas,
he said, panels were set up in the economic and civil trial
divisions to deal exclusively with industrial property and
copyright cases.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese reporter will start a

legends along his way.
</P>
<P>
Bu Fanzhou, a sports reporter for a Beijing-based magazine --
China Sports, said on Wednesday he will begin his tour from

through all of cities which have hold the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>

which will be staging the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
He would continue his journey to Montreal, St Louis, Los
Angeles, Tokyo, Seoul, Moscow, Helsinki, Stockholm, Berlin,
Amsterdam, London, Anterwep, Paris, Munich, Rome, Barcelona,
Mexico City, Melbourne and Sydney, Bu said.

<P>
"The Supreme People's Court has also set up an IPR Working
Office, and is planning to change it into an independent trial
division," he said, adding that more than 3,000 judges have
received special training for IPR cases in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any IPR holders whose rights are infringed
in China can seek justice from the people's courts through three
channels, namely, civil litigation, criminal litigation, and
administrative litigation.
</P>
<P>
"The courts will exercise judicial power independently and free
from interference by any administrative organ, public organization
or individual," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
With regard to infringement damages, he said, the Supreme
People's Court provides three ways of calculation, namely,
plaintiff's loss, defendant's profit, and fee of licensing
contract as a reference.
</P>
<P>
"If the infringement is ascertained, the court shall apply the
principle of sufficient compensation and heavy punitive
fines. Civil and criminal penalties will be imposed on those
infringers causing serious consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, he said, courts in China have
successfully dealt with a large number of foreign-related IPR
disputes through "open, impartial, and serious" trials.
</P>
<P>
"All these trials were conducted in accordance with Chinese
laws, relevant international conventions and treaties, and
bilateral agreements, to which China is a party," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Most eye-catching was the case in which the US Walter Disney
Company sued three Beijing publishing and distributing companies
for copyright violations, and the lawsuit by US software giants,
Microsoft, Autodesk, and Lotus, against Beijing Juren and another
four computer companies.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the courts made judgments against the
defendants, who were ordered to stop IPR infringements immediately
and to make due compensations and apologies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the outstanding achievements of Chinese
courts in IPR protection, he said, Ren Jianxin, president of the
Supreme People's Court, received a gold prize in November, 1994
from the World Intellectual Property Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A major water diversion project to
divert water from the Yangtze River to quench thirsty Shanghai was
completed today.
</P>
<P>
Around 1.3 million tons of water will be pumped daily into
China's largest city, accounting for one fifth of the city's total
water supplies.

To quench the thirst of city dwellers, the city authorities
decided to build the project to divert water from the Yangtze
River, as the second major water source for Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Press Freedom in HK Will Be Guaranteed: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Freedom of the press in Hong Kong
will be guaranteed by law after its return to Chinese rule in July
1997, a Chinese senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law on Hong Kong guarantees freedom of the press,
speech, assembly, association and religion," Lu Ping, director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under China's State
Council, told a press conference in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
But he said Beijing will not allow any actions that aim to
overthrow the Chinese government or to divide China.
</P>
<P>
Lu is on a week-long visit to Japan through Saturday at the
invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The purpose of his
trip is to explain China's policy on Hong Kong to Japanese
political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
He criticized biased reports by some overseas news
organizations, saying, "if you want to quote me, please quote all
I have said instead of just some words or half a sentence."
</P>
<P>
Asked about democracy in Hong Kong, Lu said, "I believe July 1,
1997 will be the start of true democracy in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
During Britain's colonial rule of around 100 years, Hong Kong
has not enjoyed any form of real democracy because its governor is
appointed by the British Queen and its legislators are named by
the governor, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After the 1997 hand-over, all legislators and even the chief
secretary in Hong Kong will be elected, not appointed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu also expressed the hope that Beijing and London will
cooperate closely over Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese
sovereignty and urged foreign countries, especially Japan, to
continue investing in Hong Kong to keep it prosperous.

<P>
AQABA, JORDAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Jordan, Egypt
and the Palestinians today reiterated the necessity of promoting
Arab efforts aiming at maintaining the peace process and ensuring
the implementation of the agreements which have been signed.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat made the remarks in
a joint statement issued at the end of their summit meeting in the
Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba today.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the three Arab leaders also stressed
their support for the Palestinian side during the final-status
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed means of backing the final-phase
negotiations in a bid to enable the Palestinians to achieve their
legitimate national rights on their national soil, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined the legal and historic rights of the
Palestinians to Arab Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders also called for the resumption of
negotiations on both Syrian and Lebanese peace tracks in a bid to
realize just and comprehensive peace based on mutual respect and
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the outcome of the Israeli elections and urged
the new Israeli government to continue the peace process on the
bases of 1991 Madrid conference, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab leaders are convinced that peace is a strategic
option for all parties concerned, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Aqaba Summit, a follow-up of the May 12 Cairo Summit among
the three leaders, was highlighted and spotlighted since Israel's
right-wing Likud bloc leader Benjamin Netanyahu was elected new
prime minister in last Wednesday's first direct election in
Israel's history.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after their summit meeting today,
Arafat said he was not disturbed by Netanyahu's declaration that
he would not meet with the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Likud's opposition to the Palestinians' quest for
independence, "Sooner or later, there will be a Palestinian state
with (Arab) Jerusalem as its capital," said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Netanyahu's campaign slogans, Mubarak said: "The
election campaign was like any election campaign. It involved many
statements. But when someone becomes responsible, things will
change."
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, King Hussein also stressed that Jordan
will never be a substitute homeland for the Palestinians. More
than one-half of Jordan's nearly 4 million population are now
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said the three leaders "are totally convinced that
the peace process is irreversible, that all that has been agreed
upon will be implemented."

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibetan Autonomous Region has
scored high marks for its environmental protection work over the
past year, during which no environmental pollution incidents
occured, according to a communique released today.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that in 1995, the region disposed of
1.85 billion cubic meters of waste gases, 42 million tons of waste
liquids and 5,100 tons of industrial solid waste, all at the same
level as the previous year, or at most rising by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the treatment rate of waste liquids rose 5 percentage
points, with the smoke and dust removal rate reached 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
Water quality in major rivers in the autonomous region is
reported to be quite good, the communique said, noting that the
major environmental index of the rivers met state standards, and
most of the lakes are in their original state.
</P>
<P>
The communique acknowledged that noise pollution in urban areas
is quite severe, and the deterioration of grassland is still on
the increase.
</P>
<P>
Though some natural adversities such as drought, flood and
heavy snow occured last year, the region obtained a good
agricultural harvest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ecological environment has been improved with
local government's efforts in afforestation, building up natural
reserves and spreading the use of new energy generating methods,
such as solar energy and geothermal power.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage of the region was almost ten percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The local government also enhanced law enforcement in
environment protection. During the 1993-1995 period more than
1,000 cases in environment protection were dealt with, the
communique said.

<HEADLINE> China Conducts Health Education Among 900 Million Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 900 million Chinese
farming people are to be taught about health care and disease
prevention.
</P>
<P>
They will be urged to turn to trained medics when they are ill,
rather than feed their superstitions by going to witch-doctors.
</P>
<P>
In the biggest ever campaign of its kind, medical know-how will
be beamed to every remote corner of China through special TV and
radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
The action aims to help rural residents create a "scientific,
civilized and healthy life style", according to officials from the
action group organizing the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Officials from China's ministries of public health, radio and
television, and agriculture have joined forces for the health
drive, which will span several years.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of government officials, health care experts and
workers involved in the action converged on Beijing today to
discuss how to promote the activity
</P>
<P>
US-based Johnson &AMP; Johnson also announced a donation of 200,000
US dollars to fund the action.
</P>
<P>
The action plans health education programs broadcast on 90
percent of provincial, prefectural and county TV and radio
stations, covering most parts of rural areas, within this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms conducted in vast rural areas, where 80
percent of China's population inhabit, have enabled farmers to
earn enough money to afford food, clothing, radios, TVs and even
more expensive commodities in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
But improvement of the farmers' health conditions seemed not
keep pace with their improved living standards.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Public Health said health of
Chinese rural residents is still endangered by infectious and
endemic diseases, causing loss of laborers and hindering economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Because of lack of knowledge and awareness, the sanitary
conditions in many towns and villages has remained poor. Many
superstitious people refuse to go to countryside hospitals, but
turn to witch doctors to treat their illnesses.

</P>
<P>
The education programs cover fields of infectious and endemic
disease prevention, doing away with superstitions, improving
toilet facilities and getting rid of unhealthy living habits.
</P>
<P>
The farmers can also learn about maternal and baby health care,
childbearing and rearing better children, environmental protection
and nutritious diets, through the programs.
</P>
<P>
Workers involved in the health care action have already
broadcast more than 70 programs on many local radio and TV

</P>
<P>
Promoting health care education among Chinese farmers is seen
as crucial, since better health conditions of rural population is

It will become a positive index for measuring the development

<HEADLINE> Manila to Relax Guidelines in Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government may relax
existing guidelines in the registration of power projects to
enable local industries undertaking adjustments to stay
competitive by availing of lower energy cost.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Board of Investments (BOI) said today, "We
are torn between benefits to industries and what is allowable
under the existing guidelines."
</P>
<P>
The Hongkong-based Hopewell Mobile Power Systems Corp. has
proposed to construct a 12 megawatt power plant for a local
textile miller on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Hopewell project proves beneficial to the local industry by
improving their cost competitiveness, but it could not meet the
existing guidelines governing registration of power projects.
</P>
<P>
For a power project to be considered as new and entitled to tax
and fiscal incentives, it must have a minimum capacity of 50
megawatts and be majority Filipino-owned.
</P>
<P>
The Hopewell project, a 12 megawatt plant with investment cost
of 250 million pesos (10 million US dollars), fell below the 50 MW
minimum megawatt requirement.
</P>
<P>
The BOI is expected to resolve the issue and amend the existing
guidelines to accommodate the Hopewell project.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's New Parliament Breaks Up in Discord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The opening session of South Korea's
new parliament broke up in acrimony today after members failed to
elect a speaker and two deputy speakers due to differences between
the ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) led by President Kim Young-sam
had pushed for the election of Kim Soo-han as speaker and Oh
Se-eung as deputy speaker. They were nominated Tuesday by
President Kim.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition boycotted the voting, insisting that a
dispute over the ruling party's majority must be resolved first.
</P>
<P>
The NKP won 139 seats in the 299-seat National Assembly in
April elections, but regained a simple majority with 151 seats by
luring into its fold 12 lawmakers, mostly independents.
</P>
<P>
Acting speaker Kim Ho-nam of the conservative United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) introduced a motion for the election of speaker
and deputy speakers but refused to go ahead with the vote,
declaring parliament adjourned until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 76, was elected acting speaker under parliament law, which
stipulates that the oldest member of a new National Assembly shall
act as chairman of its first plenary session.
</P>
<P>
He warned that there would be a physical clash between the two
camps if the voting were pushed ahead.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics, headed
by Kim Dae-jung, joined the ULD led by Kim Jong-pil in frustrating
the ruling party's plan to form the new parliament with the
election of a speaker and deputy speakers.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the NKP first apologize to the people for
recruiting independent and opposition members to secure an overall
parliamentary majority.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China has introduced its first
no-smoking street - a street where the habit is outlawed.
</P>
<P>
At the major junctions of Pingliang Street in Shanghai stand
two eye-catching signboards with "No Smoking" emblazoned across
them. They indicate that the 400-meter-long street has become a
cigarette-free zone.
</P>
<P>
All 62 shops, hospitals, and schools along the street have
signed no-smoking agreements with the street's governing body. And
a special team, accompanied by police, has been set up to
publicize the harm of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Observers agreed that the effort will help promote awareness of
harm of smoking and help more chain smokers to bid farewell to
their habit.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Smoking and Health Association said that they are
going to cooperate with more street governing bodies to extend the
experience of Pingliang Street.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai began to dissuade residents from smoking nine years
ago. But because of scarce measures to promote the campaign the
number of smokers has rapidly increased in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the local government took a lead in the country by
issuing the first regulation forbidding smoking in public
places. Now Shanghai has added another first by introducing what
may be the first of many no-smoking streets.

<HEADLINE> Merger of Small CPA Firms Encouraged to Increase Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China is to encourage small and
medium-sized accounting firms to merge or form groups to enhance
the competitiveness of certified public accountancy work in China.
</P>
<P>
Cui Jianmin, president of the Chinese Institute of Certified
Public Accountants(CICPA), said that greater efforts will be made
to train qualified CPAs, but the number of accounting firms will
not be increased in next five years.
</P>
<P>
There are less than 60,000 CPAs now working in about 6,400
accounting firms across the country, which means every accounting
firm has less than 10 CPAs.
</P>
<P>
"A too small-scale level of our accounting firms makes business
expansion difficult which is not good for the improvement of
professional skills of CPAs," said Cui at a national CPA meeting
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"And this puts Chinese accounting firms at a disadvantage to
compete with their foreign counterparts with the further opening
of domestic markets."
</P>
<P>
China now has nine Sino-foreign joint CPA firms and three
member firms of international accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
The CICPA plans to increase the number of CPAs to 80,000 before
this century ends and 120,000 by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The imperative task is to enhance the quality of Chinese CPAs
as well as Chinese accounting firms," he said. "We should see that
China has a dozen large accounting firms which can compete with
international accounting firms by the turn of this century."
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by CICPA early this year notes that small and
medium sized accounting firms are encouraged to merge or combine
to form group firms, and large accounting firms will be allowed to
engage in a wider range of businesses, including conducting audits
of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
CICPA is considering classifying the existing accounting firms
so that small firms would be more than willing to merge in order
to get a better grade, according to a CICPA official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that reform on the mechanism of accounting
firms will continue and partnership accounting firms will
gradually become the main trend.
</P>
<P>
To ensure their auditing be done independently and fairly, the
accounting firms will have links severed from the administrative
units to which they are presently subordinated.
</P>
<P>
The reform will eventually enable accounting firms to be free
in making business decisions, deciding wage levels and charges,
and have autonomy in employment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji, China's vice premier, told the meeting that the
dramatic development of CPA is of significance to setting up
socialist market economy, safeguarding normal social and economic
order, and protecting interests of the state and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that CPAs, CPA firms and auditing firms should
effectively do their duty in regulating economic work.
</P>
<P>
"CPAs and their firms should stick to the principles of
independence, objectiveness and fairness and strictly abide by
other professional norms.
</P>
<P>
"CPA associations at all levels should earnestly serve,
supervise, manage and coordinate the CPAs and CPA firms, following
unified legal regulations and professional norms," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that more efforts be made to improve CPA's
professional capabilities and ethics in the bid to train a group
of CPAs in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
"Financial and auditing departments should actively create
better business climates for CPAs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No department, unit, or individual should be allowed to
interfere in CPAs business while they are engaged in financial and
auditing matters and supervision, according to law," Zhu
stressed.

network in order to shorten its distance to the sea and thereby
expand economic development.
</P>
<P>
Though rich in natural and mineral resources, this mountainous
province in southwest China has long been hindered economically by
poor transportation conditions.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, it developed a plan in 1990 to invest
billions of yuan (one billion yuan equals 120.48 million US
dollars) on a modern highway network, and to improve inland river
transport designed to bring itself nearer to the sea and to major
rivers such the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, the distance between Guiyang,
the provincial capital, and the Yangtze will equal half a day's
drive. The driving time to the Beibu Gulf will be eight to ten
hours.
</P>
<P>
The plan has met with favorable response from the central
government, which promises to contribute one third of the
investment, provincial authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Other investments will come from diverse sources, including
overseas bonds and BOT arrangements, according to Lu Wanli,
director of the Provincial Communications Department.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the province will organize a trade talk in Hong Kong
this summer to introduce the transportation plan and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, a 140-km-long high-grade highway linking Guiyang with
Zunyi City, also in Guizhou, is under construction and is expected
to be completed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Also, preparations are under way for the construction of two
highways linking Guiyang with Chongqing in neighboring Sichuan
Province and with Liuzhou in neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixty six people have been killed
and another 162 are missing after two massive landslides in
southwest China's Yunnan province, according to latest information
reaching Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Another 76 people were injured in the landslides which happened
four days apart in Laojinshan Mountain, site of the Daping Gold
Mine in Yuanyang county.
</P>
<P>
The slide buried work sheds at three gold mining sites and 26
gold pits.
</P>
<P>
The wounded are now in hospital receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that heavy rain between May 27 and 30 caused
rocks on the top of the mountain to cascade down, probably causing
the two massive landslides.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1,200 people have joined in a major rescue and
relief operation, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Four people buried in the gold pits were saved yesterday as

<HEADLINE> Home of "Big Foot" Boosting Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Shennongjia area in central China,
home of the country's legendary "Wild Man," also known as "Big
Foot," is finishing work on new scenic attractions that are
expected to develop tourism.
</P>
<P>
Among the most attractive newly-built tourist resorts is a
four-million-yuan "Wild Man" theme museum, which exhibits hair,
footprints and bamboo sheds claimed to belong to the beast.
</P>
<P>
For several hundred years, local residents have reported seeing
a figure that is half-man, half-ape. However, there is no concrete
scientific evidence to support its existence.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the demand of an increasing tourist population,
and to further investigate the mystery of the wild man, the
province has invested more than 20 million yuan to build and
upgrade roads, accommodation facilities, and tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a new travel route will be in operation that links
Shennongjia with other famous scenic spots such as the Three
Gorges of the Yangtze River, Wudang Mountain, and Yichang City.
</P>
<P>
The asphalted road from Yazikou to Xiaolongtan (Little Dragon
Pool) there has opened after five months of construction. Yantian
scenic area, a natural museum, "Big Foot" park, and a botanical
garden were also built.
</P>
<P>
Shennongjia has taken measures to limit lumbering in an effort
to better protect green resources and develop tourism, according
to the provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of more than 2,000 lumbermen at Shennongjia have
been asked to find new jobs, they said.
</P>
<P>
Located in central Hubei Province, the Shennongjia Mountains
are a natural paradise, with more than 500 species of animals, 190
of birds, 35 of fish, 1,400 of butterflies, and more than 2,400
types of plants.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of more than 3,200 square kilometers,
Shennongjia is the highest mountain in central China. Its highest
peak stands at 3,100 meters.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process Not in Danger of Collapse: Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AQABA, JORDAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Jordan, Egypt
and the Palestinians today believed that the peace process was not
in danger of collapse after the victory of right-wing Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections last week.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference jointly held by King Hussein of Jordan,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat after their tripartite summit to discuss
the fate of the Middle East peace process at the Jordanian Red Sea
resort of Aqaba, they said Netanyahu's election victory is a
challenge that requires serious efforts to upgrade inter-Arab
coordination to improve their bargaining stands.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said they all agreed to do their best to "restore Arab
unity, Arab solidarity, which is now very important."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders also called for resumption of negotiations on
both the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in a bid to realize just and
comprehensive peace based on mutual respect and land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein urged Arab states to "look forward, not backward,"
noting that the three leaders are convinced, "totally convinced,
that the peace process is irreversible, that all that has been
agreed upon will be implemented and that work toward a
comprehensive settlement will continue."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Arab states are waiting, adding that they will
not make any judgement until Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Netanyahu forms his government and starts his work.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders all said they respected the Israeli voters'
choice for a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated the the Palestinians' commitment to peace
with Israel and asked Netanyahu to abide by the peace agreements
signed by the Palestinians and the Peres government.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite summit was the latest in a flurry of diplomatic
activity that followed Netanyahu's election victory.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad
held a meeting in Cairo Monday and another tripartite summit will
be held in Riyadh Saturday among leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia
and Syria.

<HEADLINE> China Capable of Offering Sound Protection for IPR: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade minister said in
Beijing today that China is confident that it will be able to
offer a sound and better protection for intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
IPR protection is a long-term and arduous task, and China is
willing to have closer cooperation with foreign countries in this
regard, and actively perform the obligations stipulated in
international IPR agreements, said Wu Yi, minister of foreign
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on China Radio International this morning, Wu said
that as China's economy develops and its economic exchanges with
foreign countries increase, the country's IPR protection has
caused worldwide concern.
</P>
<P>
China's huge efforts in IPR protection have produced good
results and have been well received by the international
community, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
It is a tradition of the Chinese people to respect knowledge
and talents, and vitalizing the nation through science and
education has become China's state policy, she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the minister added, IPR protection is not only a
need in China's reform, opening to the outside world and economic
development, but also the need of its exchanges in science,
technology and culture with foreign countries, as well as its
effort to improve the investment climate and attracting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
"China's policy of reform and opening-up would make no
achievements without IPR protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
China's legislation on IPR protection has made much progress
despite a late start, Wu said, adding that the country completed
the work in a decade that many developed countries had spent tens
of years or one hundred years.
</P>
<P>
China has not only implemented laws concerning patent rights,
trademarks, author's rights and the law against unfair
competition, but also joined almost all international conventions
regarding IPR protection, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
In law enforcement, China has also made great efforts in
cracking down on piracy. According to her, the efforts China has
made include:
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing IPR protection Coordination Institutions. China
has set up conference systems at both state and local levels;
</P>
<P>
-- Routine Activity and Special Enforcement. More than one
million officials from the departments of public security,
industrial, commercial and cultural administration are routinely
fighting against piracy daily, and besides, China launched an
eight-month Special Enforcement Period between January and August
of last year, with similar measures taken this year;
</P>
<P>
-- General campaign combined with specific battles. So far,
China has closed seven factories which have conducted illegal
activities;
</P>
<P>
-- Administrative protection coincides with judicial
protection. So far judiciaries throughout the country have
received nearly 20,000 IPR violating cases, among which 90 percent
have been wound up. Administrative departments have received some
100,000 IPR violating cases and IPR registration applications;
</P>
<P>
Wu also introduced China's recent actions on the attack against
violation of IPR:
</P>
<P>
-- On May 23, the Ministry of Public Security listed the attack
against piracy as an important task of the nationwide anti-crime
crackdown drive;
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Culture has decided to focus on the national
audio, video production market from June to August;
</P>
<P>
-- China Customs is determined to reinforce supervision on the
IPR status of imported items, and especially exported products;
</P>
<P>
-- Relevant departments have started investigations in
factories suspectedly involved in IPR violation cases;
</P>
<P>
-- Heads of CD producers throughout the country gathered in
Beijing Tuesday to hear about further specified measures on
ensuring legal CD production.
</P>
<P>
Wu also talked about the prospects of the country's foreign
trade and economic co-operations in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime Rate Declines in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of violent crimes
scaled down for four consecutive years in Hong Kong thanks to a
substantial drop in robbery cases, according to a report just
released by Fight Crime Committee (FCC).
</P>
<P>
Some 17,000 criminal cases were recorded in 1995, a decline of
0.8 percent compared with a year earlier, said FCC.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the fall mainly to a big drop in the
number of robbery cases last year, which was 11.4 percent less
than that in 1994. Attacks on jewelry and watch shops in
particular fell to 12 cases in 1995, the lowest over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total number of crimes reported in 1995 rose 4.6
percent to more than 91,000 last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, southwestern Yunnan Province, June 5 (Xinhua) --
Chinese Olympic swimming champion Lin Li, who returned to
systematic training only four months ago, was rapidly reclaiming
her form, her coach said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin, a veteran who is preparing for her third appearance at the
Olympic Games in Atlanta next month, was getting faster and faster
times in training and had obtained some of her "best ever training
results", coach Zhang Xiong said.
</P>
<P>
"The 26-year-old former world champion is training diligently,
swimming at least five hours and 13,000 meters every day," Zhang
said, adding that this kind of intensity was quite much for a
swimmer of her age.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who arrived here last week for the three-week-long
altitude training, experienced altitude reactions such as stiff
muscles and exhaustion at the facility which is 1,880 meters above
sea level. But Zhang said she was recovering well with daily
massages.
</P>
<P>
Lin, making her Olympic debut in Seoul in 1988, set the world
record for women's 200 meters individual medley in two minutes and
11.65 seconds at Barcelona, Spain, four years ago.
</P>
<P>
She also won silvers in 200 meters breaststroke and 400 meters
individual medley there.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu native quitted a well-paid teacher's job at a
Taiwan provincial sports school to return in February for the
Olympic preparetion. And she finished second in both 200
breaststroke and 200 medley at April's national Olympic trials in
Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> More Beijing Students Apply to Join Communist Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than one fifth of college
students in the Chinese capital are applying to join the Communist
Party of China (CPC), setting a record for the past two decades,
according to a local report.
</P>
<P>
In 67 Beijing colleges and universities, 32,367 students have
applied to the school CPC committees for membership, accounting
for 23.34 percent of the total college student population here,
and rising about five percentage points over last year, the
"Beijing Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
The students show enthusiasm for special Party schools and
classes, where they study the theories of Marxism-Leninism, the
history of the CPC and Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some of them are expected to be approved to join the Party
before July 1 this year, the 75th anniversary of founding of the
CPC, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, five percent of college students are Communist Party
members, it said.
</P>
<P>
At Beijing University, one of China's leading academies, 473
students and 41 faculty members became CPC members last year, 239
more than the figure for 1994, according to an early report of the
"Beijing Daily".
</P>
<P>
"The student Communist Party members usually have high
political consciousness and good academic performance," the report
quoted Ren Yanshen, secretary of the university's CPC committee,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Because of their outstanding performance, the student Party
members are generally preferred and welcomed by employers when
they look for jobs, which to some extent encourages college
students to join the Party," it said.

<HEADLINE> "Spring Bud" Supports for Tibetan Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Qamsang, 21 years old, never expected
to be a teacher of girls in Tibet Autonomous Region soon after his
graduation from an ethnic teachers' school in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Qamsang took three major courses of Tibetan language,
mathematics, and Chinese phonetics for his 50-pupil class.
</P>
<P>
"I can use well what I have learned," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Qamsang's school has assigned a female teacher to
take care of the girls' daily life.
</P>
<P>
The school was the country's first "Hope Project" primary
school in Damxung County, a three-hour drive from Lhasa, capital
of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The "Hope Project" was launched by the China Children's
Foundation (CCF) with an aim to help school drop-outs resume
education.
</P>
<P>
The CCF also mapped out the "Spring Bud" plan in 1992 to
provide free primary education and room and board for extremely
poor rural girls, such as the 50 Tibetan girls in Qamsang's class.
</P>
<P>
To spend more time with the children, Qamsang seldom goes back
his own home in Lhasa to visit his parents and girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Yuzholma, who was a school drop-out owing to the death of her
parents two years ago, has become an active and good student
thanks to Qamsang's teaching and concern.
</P>
<P>
More than 650 girl drop-outs in Tibet have so far returned to
school with the help of the "Spring Bud" plan, and 14 "Spring Bud"
classes have been set up for them.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jim, chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional Women's
Federation, said that governments at all levels have paid great
attention to the education of the farmers' girls in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Local officials often visit the girls and bring them many
gifts during holidays," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Improper naming of enterprises as a
means of covering up illegal businesses has been looked into and
severely punished in China's capital city.
</P>
<P>
Crackdowns affected 802 cases involving nine enterprises using
names which have not been approved or registered; 389 enterprises
whose names are different from that on the licenses; 42 joint
ventures which only use names of foreign partners and 80 ventures
which use the names of their sub-branches.
</P>
<P>
Some of these firms open singing and dancing halls, saunas, and
massage services that were not licensed, according to today's
"Beijing Daily."
</P>
<P>
Some were ordered to remove their name boards, some were urged
to change names in a fixed period and some were punished
immediately.
</P>
<P>
To curb the occurrence of such cases, local industrial and
commercial authorities have urged their organizations to spread
information about the new laws and supervise the naming
regulations for registration purposes.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises using improper names will not be approved for
registration, according to the regulation.

<P>
According to SBEP, a group of volunteers began a four-day
cleanup on June 5 in the mountaineering camps on Mount
Qomolangma. The mountain peak, known to the West as Mount Everest,
is the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The group of about 20 include three veteran climbers, Wang
Fuzhou, Goinbo, Qu Yinhua, the first mountaineers who climbed
Qomolangma from its northern slope in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the garbage which is difficult to be disposed
of will be packed and carried down the mountain by yaks and men,
and transported to nearby towns for disposal.
</P>
<P>
A monument will be set up to remind future climbers not to
pollute the mountain, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the World Environment Day, China issued its first
ever white paper on its environmental situation, giving a detailed
account of its efforts in the past two decades in environmental
protection and the environmental issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said China's gross national product (GNP) has
achieved a sustained annual growth of around 10 percent over the
past 18 years, while its environmental quality has basically
steered clear of the outcome of corresponding deterioration.
</P>
<P>
SBEP Director Xie Zhenhua said the white paper is designed to
promote the international community's understanding of China's
environmental protection, and expand cooperation between China and
other parts of the world in solving the environmental issues
facing the world.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, China's armed forces, or the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), marked the occasion by holding a report
meeting on world's environmental situation in the University of
National Defense, which was attended by nearly 100 generals
studying at the school.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua was invited to report on the environmental
situation in both China and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has invested about 600 million yuan in the past several
years in environmental protection projects, treating 20,000
sources of pollutants and nearly 70 million tons of waste water.
</P>
<P>
The PLA also formulated its own regulations on environmental
protection and afforestation in the past few years.

<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Priceless cultural relics in
Dunhuang in northwest China's Gansu Province have survived
unscathed after a massive sandstorm hit the region.
</P>
<P>
The Mokao Grottoes, 25 km southeast of the town of Dunhuang,
are the most famous of the many religious shrines built around
A.D. 366. They consist of 492 caves carved in the steep face of a
cliff between Sanwei and Mingsha mountains.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Research Institute has been planting trees around
the grottoes over the past 50 years, and most of these grottoes
have been fitted with sealed doors and windows made of aluminium
alloy, which protected the precious cultural relics in the
grottoes from the sandstorm, according to Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
But tourists were unable to visit the grottoes because roads
leading to them were buried under sand and broken stones, and
power supplies and communication facilities to the grottoes were
seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Relief work started immediately after the sandstorm, with 28
tons of sand cleared away the day after the sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
Power supplies and communications have now been restored and
the grottoes have reopened to tourists.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda today asserted that the ruling United Front would give top
priority to providing a stable government for a full term of five
years on the principles of political, administrative and economic
federalism.
</P>
<P>
Gowda made the assertion while releasing a 25-page document on
a common minimum program for the 13-party United Front government
formed on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the program was "unanimously accepted" by all the
constituents of the front, Gowda pledged that his government would
initiate steps for its speedy implementation.
</P>
<P>
The document, whose release was delayed due to days of
squabbling over its content, outlined the United Front's common
approach to major policy matters and a minimum program setting the
political and economic agenda for the new government.
</P>
<P>
Gowda said the complete consensus on the program and policy of
the front would dispel doubts over the front's ability to reach a
common stand.
</P>
<P>
The front recognized that in any coalition there would be
differences but what was important was the manner in which these
differences were aired, discussed and resolved, said the prime
minister.

The Shanghai-based "Liberation Daily" recently surveyed more
than 800 residents in Shanghai, half were men and half women,
about these issues, It also revealed that housewives in urban
families have more influence over their households than those in
rural families.
</P>
<P>

final decisions about 63.5 percent of the family chores and 69.5
percent of the daily economic affairs, while the figures for
husbands are comparatively low: 12 percent and 9 percent,
respectively. Remaining issues are jointly decided.
</P>
<P>
"With only 400 yuan of monthly income, we two live a decent life
thanks to my wife's careful calculation and strict budgeting,"
said Shen Rongxi, a participant in the survey. "I really couldn't
find any reason to oppose her leadership in the family."
</P>
<P>
Major decisions such as the education of children, choosing a
profession and purchasing durable consumer goods are handed over
to the husbands in 12.5 percent of the families, to the wives in
8.5 percent of the families, and are worked out by both parties in
79.5 percent of the families.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that most of the housewives established
their position in the family on their own, and they claim it is
because their husbands are too preoccupied with their careers.

<HEADLINE> Senior Judge Vows Continuous IPR Protection in Chinese Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Whatever the outcome of talks
between China and the US on Intellectual Property Rights is, the
people's courts of China will press on with the protection of the
legal rights and interests of IPR holders, including the
Americans, a senior judge said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court of
China, made the commitment at a press conference in Beijing on
China's judicial protection of IPR.
</P>
<P>
"Personally speaking, I hope that there will be no
confrontation or trade war between the two countries over the IPR
issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Though China started relatively late in IPR-related legislative
work, he said, the high speed of its IPR legislation was rare in
the history of intellectual property protection, winning worldwide
praise.
</P>
<P>
"China now has a whole range of IPR laws and regulations, which
have provided sound judicial and administrative channels for IPR
protection," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that courts across the country accepted a
total of 15,543 civil cases concerning IPR disputes from 1991 to
the end of 1995, among which 14,950 were dealt with and resolved.
</P>
<P>
These cases included 3,083 patent rights disputes, 2,600
copyright disputes, 907 trademark cases, 6,812 technology contract
cases, as well as 2,141 other cases, including trade secret
violations.
</P>
<P>
"If the IPR infringement is so serious that it jeopardizes
social and economic order and constitutes a crime, the people's
court will also investigate and deal with the infringer's criminal
offenses according to law," Li added.
</P>
<P>
He said that between 1991 and 1995, courts across the country
accepted 1,690 criminal cases of counterfeiting registered
trademarks, of which 1,676 were tried with 1,375 people sentenced
to imprisonment, detention, or other punishments.
</P>
<P>
He cited two citizens from east China's Zhejiang Province as
examples. Found guilty of illegally using the trademark "Santana"
registered in China by the Volkswagen Company of Germany, Jiang
Zhijiang and Yang Xuechun were respectively sentenced by a court
in Shanghai to six years and six months, and three years and six
months in prison, as well as fined at 30,000 and 15,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"This case reflected the firm stand of Chinese courts in
cracking down on crimes and protecting IPR by laws," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that courts in China will work hard to bring
its judicial functions into full play, and to contribute to the
full implementation of relevant international conventions and
treaties, as well as bilateral agreements, to which China is a
party.

<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, today met with Paule Patton, governor of the US State
of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
During talks at the Great Hall of the People, Li said
China is engaged in massive economic construction and has made
progress in many fields, which calls for a stable domestic
situation and a peaceful international environment.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We therefore don't want to have trouble with any
country, but are willing to develop friendly relations with all
countries in the world, the U.S. included."
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people had suffered from aggression and
bullying by foreign powers in modern history, and for that reason
they more than anyone else treasure national independence and
sovereignty, and definitely opposed external interference in any
form.
</P>
<P>
There are some problems between China and the U.S., he noted,
and the key to their solution is mutual respect and reciprocal
treatment on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky and China's Jiangxi have a state-province friendship
link. Li said that many things have to be done in order to develop
Sino-U.S. friendly relations, and increasing exchanges between
states and provinces is an effective way.
</P>
<P>
Growing Closer ties between governments of lower levels have
significance for promoting friendship between the peoples of the
two countries, Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that concrete achievements will be made in the
mutually-beneficial cooperation between Jiangxi province and
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Patton said this is his first overseas visit since assuming
governorship of Kentucky five months ago, recognizing China as a
world power and an economic power.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for developing Sino-U.S. economic and
trade relations, he said, adding that his state will expand
cooperation with Jiangxi province and other areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Patton and his party are on a week-long visit to China at the
invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Nominating Peres as UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran today strongly opposed the
nomination of Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres as a candidate
for U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jomhuri Islamic issued an editorial here
today, saying the nomination of Shimon Peres to chair the United
Nations as its secretary general is the outcome of a collision
between the U.N. and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the nomination of Peres, the loser of the
Israeli elections, for the post of U.N. secretary general would
amount to an insult to the intelligence and honor of the world
community and would be tantamount to ridiculing human principles
and standards in the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
"There is, unfortunately, no congruence between the
U.N. charter and the organization's actual performance," the
editorial argued, adding the U.N. is too distant away from the
principles.
</P>
<P>
The paper criticized the United Nations and noted that the
undue political and financial influence of power nations, which
use this organization as their own executive levers to advance
their regional and global policies, has considerably reduced the
organization's neutrality and effectiveness.

<P>
(by Du Zhenfeng)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A rally was held here this morning
to mark the 24th World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Zambian Minister of Environment and Natural
Resources, William Harrington, was read to the rally.
</P>
<P>
Harrington said the Zambian goverrnment was ''committed to
joining the rest of the world in finding the solutions to global
concerns relating to environmental degradations and atmospheric
pollution so as to make the world, our home a happier and safer
place to live''.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Zambian government had put in place
institutional structures to ''formulate and implement policies
for the environmental protection and pollution control,
conservation and rational exploitation of our natural resources
for the benefit of both the present and future generations''.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ''about 61 percent of the area of our country is
forested but that we are losing close to 300,000 hectares of our
forest area every year''.
</P>
<P>
''As a developing country we depend greatly on our natural
resources for survival. We need trees for the contruction of our
shelter, fuel, tools and a number of artifacts. We need water for
our consumption, energy and agriculture, and we need wildlife for
our food, and animal power, and tourism development,'' the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the wealth of every country lied in its
natural resources and they should be utilized in a sustainable
manner.
</P>
<P>
Harrington urged the people to take the responsibility
individually and severally for environmental protection because
if ''the government alone should be worried about the environment
then we are fighting a losing battle''.
</P>
<P>
Local residents, including primary and secondary school
students, attended in the rally. They carried banners with
slogans stressing the urgent importance for environmental
protection. enditem

eateries that entered Shanghai in the early 1980s, once squeezed
the traditional businesses out of the Shanghai market, forcing
many local shops to close or change into fried chicken outlets or
cafes.
</P>
<P>
"But the complicated flavor of the traditional Chinese snacks,
usually a mixture that is sweet, salty and hot, can never be
replaced by foreign food, thus making the return of local
delicacy," a market analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
The return of the traditional food shows improvements in
quality, the restaurant environment and service, but differences
remain between the Chinese snacks and foreign fast food, the
analyst said, adding that Local snack shops should aim to create
brand names and develop chain stores.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Entrepreneur to Build Israeli-Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's famous entrepreneur
Stef Wertheimer has announced plans to build joint
Israeli-Jordanian industrial parks on both sides of the
border, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday at Tel Aviv University's Management Faculty,
where he won the Outstanding Entrepreneur Award for 1996,
Wertheimer said he is conducting negotiations with Jordan to
establish an industrial park on the bank of the Jordan River's
northern part, modeled on the one he built in Tefen, as well as a
similar park on the Israeli side, the English Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A coffee shop would be operated jointly in between the two
parks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Wertheimer, Chairman of the Board of the Iscar group, said he
intended to execute his plans to establish industrial parks
jointly with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Iscar, a major Israeli exporter employing 1,300 workers,
expects to increase its sales to 350 million U.S. dollars in 1996
from 300 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Plans to build a joint Israeli-Turkish industrial park in
Izmir are already underway, and work is expected to start soon,
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Wertheimer criticized several government
officials for blocking the development of the industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Israeli Lands Authority Director-General Uzi Wechsler
for the real estate market's shortage of land, and the outgoing
Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer for harming industrial
development and export.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneur also criticized the Manufacturers Association
for failure to fulfill its purpose of adequately representing
industrialists, and called on the new government to appoint a
minister for exports.

</P>
<P>
Tanzania Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye made the call on
Tuesday at the opening of a week-long Association of Afro-Asian
Petroleum Geochemists (AAAGP) conference in Arusha, northern

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Endeavors to Curb Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
taking a series of measures to curb child labor, a growing social
problem facing many developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The government is now taking an unprecedented nationwide survey
on child labor, which is expected to be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
Relatively low economic growth and an increasingly exploding
population are believed to be the main reasons for the child labor
problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, with a population of approximately 130 million at
present, is already the world's seventh most populous country, and
with an annual growth rate of about 3 percent, it will rank fifth
by the year 2020 when its total population is projected to reach
262 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the gross national product (GNP), which is running at
an annual growth rate of 3 to 6 percent in recent years, can not
be well-matched with the growth of the country's population. As an
immediate result, more people live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, about one third of the
population in Pakistan still live under the poverty line, and the
country's child laborers are numbered at about eight million.
</P>
<P>
As an active way to save children from hard labor and send them
back to school, the Pakistani government has mapped out a strategy
to develop primary education countrywide, especially in rural and
under-developed urban areas.
</P>
<P>
To help raise the national education level, Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto has promised to make it a law that 3 percent of the
GNP be allocated to the education sector annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is taking every possible steps to
control the country's population, and elaborate arrangements are
being made in this regard under the eighth five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that there are 45,000 villages in
Pakistan with a total population of 85 million. More than 13,060
of these villages have a population of 2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, in every such village, an educated
married woman, who belongs to the village concerned, will be
selected and employed on contract basis to spread the message of
family planning.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to provide more educational facilities and
opportunities to school-age children, a number of laws and other
related measures have been adopted by the government and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, children under the age of 14 are not
allowed to work in high intensity, poisonous or dangerous
industries, such as carpet-weaving, cement, explosive
manufacturing, dyeing, construction and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Concerned laws also provide detailed regulations on the timing,
safety and health standards for adolescent workers and increased
penalties for those breaking the laws.
</P>
<P>
In the past year alone, the government conducted nearly 3,000
inspections, resulting in prosecutions in about 1,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several government organizations, such as the
National Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Pakistan
Commission, have been set up to take care of children's rights,
welfare and development.
</P>
<P>
Some non-governmental organizations, with the help of the
government, have planned to set up 35 rehabilitation centers for
children in areas where child labor are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
These centers will be responsible for imparting primary
education and vocational training to the children.
</P>
<P>
However, to eliminate child labor is not the work of a single
day. Observers here believe that despite all these efforts, the
Pakistani government is still facing a Herculean task in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
More efforts are needed to develop economy, control population
growth and spread education for an eventual solution of the
problem.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Film Star Lends a Hand to Chinese Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese movie star familiar
to Chinese film lovers contributed two million Japanese yen, or
190,000 Renminbi yuan, to build a school for poor students in
north China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Ryoko Nakano, a Japanese actress who is best known for her role
in the detective movie "Pursuit," visited China for the first time
in 1994 at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the victory of the War of
Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, she visited China to
express her desire for peace, and decided to establish a primary
school for China's school-age dropouts.
</P>
<P>
After one year of construction, a 10,000 sq. m. education
building was completed in May in Qinhuangdao, a picturesque city
in Hebei province, as well as a main port in north China.
</P>
<P>
Ryoko Nakano visited the new school on May 22 and donated some
stationery and writing materials on behalf of some friendship
associations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that people in the world will give a warm hand to the
poor children," she said at a ceremony to announce the school's
opening.

<P>
GENEVA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Three delegates of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed when their vehicles
came under fire Tuesday afternoon in Burundi, the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred near the village of Mugina in Burundi's

of drinking water in Cibitoke.
</P>
<P>
The three victims were all Swiss nationals and in their
thirties.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said it is extremely shocked with the tragedy and
strongly condemned the attack that failed to respect the red cross
emblem.

<P>
However, the ICRC had not yet decided whether to suspend the
humanitarian mission in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cibitoke, an area hit hard by fightings in the past few months,
is in great need of humanitarian aid. The ICRC is helping tens of
thousands of people there by providing drinking water, medicines

<HEADLINE> Fortune Seekers Strike Gold in Their Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 job-seeking young
people who rushed to economically prosperous Guangdong Province in
the 1980s have returned home to Guilin Prefecture, south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Now many have made their
fortunes in their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Jiping, one of the returned job seekers, persuaded all
peasants of his village to plant unseasonal vegetables that are
very popular in Guangdong Province. This item alone provides every
peasant of the village an additional 500 yuan in their annual
incomes.
</P>
<P>
Though an important grain production base, Guilin Prefecture has
been comparatively backward owing to its single-product
economy. As a result, a large number of laborers left their
hometowns and headed to Guangdong Province, vanguard of China's
reform and opening-up drive. There they hoped to find their
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
But from the early 1990s the trend of returning was in full
swing, which experts believe, shows that an increasing number of
fortune-seekers realized they could get rich by developing
agriculture in their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 job-seekers have returned home. Some
contracted to plant barren hills, some set up pig firms or chicken
firms, and some devoted their energies to the manufacturing and
marketing of agricultural products -- and many of them have made
the fortune they dreamed about.

achieve."

line with expectations" and that a further decline in inflation is
also expected.

BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Thailand declined to
6.1 percent in May from 6.9 percent in April, indicating that the
country's economy is moving toward a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
The drop might be attributed to measures taken by the Central
Bank of the country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But they added that the government will still have a tough task
in the latter part of the year of lowering year-round inflation to
a revised target of 5.5 percent, as the consumer price index
remained high in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government would have to keep inflation in the coming
months at 4 percent in order to attain the target, which would be
unlikely, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Commerce Ministry, the consumer price
index still averaged 7.1 percent in the first five months of the
year, mainly due to higher education fees and prices of livestock
products.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Arrive in Jordan to Attend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AQABA, Jordan, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Jordan
today to meet Jordanian King Hussein for a tripartite summit to be
held here today .
</P>
<P>
The king received Mubarak and Arafat, who arrived here on the
same Egyptian chartered plane from Cairo, at the Aqaba
International Airport and drove them to the palace by himself.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
also met the two leaders at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The previously-planned mini-summit, a follow-up of the May 12
Cairo summit among the three leaders, was highlighted and
spotlighted since Israeli right-wing Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu was elected new prime minister in last Wednesday's
first direct election in Israel's history.
</P>
<P>
Apprehensions have gripped the Arab world since Netanyahu's
victory, particularly over his campaign promises to take a harder
line in negotiations with the Palestinians and Syria, prompting
close Arab contacts among major Arab countries and the concerned
parties to coordinate their stances concerning the new situation.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad
held a summit in Cairo Monday and another summit will be held in
Saudi capital Riyadh Saturday among the two presidents and King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The summit here today is expected to discuss the latest
developments of the peace process in the region, coordinate their
stands vis-a-vis Israel and seek means to strengthen the
Palestinian position in the final status negotiations with
Israel. They will also deal with the prevailing pessimism over the
prospects for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit will explore avenues to revive the stalled
negotiations on other tracks of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem and redeployment of Israeli troops from
Hebron will also be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Israel had threatened to close the Orient House, the
representative office of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
in east Jerusalem, and not to withdraw from Hebron, the last city
in the West Bank from which Israel has yet to redeploy.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders had planned to invite Israel's incumbent
Prime Minister Peres, an architect of Israel's peace agreements
with the Palestinians and Jordan, to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli election disrupted the plan.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said that the summit had to be held without the
presence of the Israeli prime minister, because the changes taking
place in Israel would not allow Prime Minister-elected Netanyahu
to take up an invitation to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Buy U.S. Satellite Launch Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will import a
U.S. satellite launch vehicle for the launch of a
telecommunication satellite with a loan from the Deutche Morgan
Grenfell.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of the United States has authorized 136
million dollars in financing to support the sale of the vehicle by
Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services to PT Satelit Palapa
Indonesia, a news release of the bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank's financing will also cover satellite launch
insurance by March and McLennan, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had signed contracts to buy two telecommunications
satellites, the Palapa C-1 and the Palapa C-2, manufactured by the
Hughes Aircraft Company with 125.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The bank's long-term guarantee will support the 92 million
dollars sale of a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS launch vehicle for
the launch of the Palapa C-1 satellite, and 59.5 million dollars
in launch insurance coverage by Marsh and McLennan for both
satellites," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The satellites will reach over 50 percent of the world's
population, covering Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, India,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Major applications for the satellites are television, data,
cable restoration, and voice communication.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Toilet Conditions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials here admit that the
country's 90,00-plus public toilets are a headache - not just for
visitors, but for local people as well.
</P>
<P>
Now Beijing is lifting the lid on the problem by staging the
country's first ever toilet show in the Museum of Chinese
Revolution today, the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Lou Xiaoqi, one of the organizers, said the event is aimed at
improving toilet facilities and increasing awareness among the
people for public hygiene and the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
On exhibit are 1,200 pictures, 60 designs of public toilets and
70 paintings charting toilet history in China and in the rest of
the world, and the current toilet revolution in China. It will
also feature the very latest in toilet facilities.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaohong, the first-prize toilet design winner, said, "My
design, with modern, multi-functions and traditional flavor, is to
provide people a pleasant and clean toilet."
</P>
<P>
Huang Manxue, a visitor from northeast China, said that if
there were that many clean toilets in Beijing, he no longer would
fear not finding a toilet while busy shopping and sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
Toilet shows should be held throughout the country, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
Historic records show that China has had private and public
toilets for more than 3,000 years. Before the Qing dynasty
(1644-1911), most people relieved themselves in the wild, as there
were few public toilets.
</P>
<P>
After that, simple mud toilets began to emerge, but many were
not fit for public purposes, leaving wastes uncovered along the
roadside.
</P>
<P>
By 1949, Beijing had only 83 brick public toilets; the rest
were surrounded by straw mats.
</P>
<P>
Li Guangrong, director of the local environment sanitation
administration, said the capital, with a population of 12 million,
has nearly 8,000 street toilets, ranking it first among the
world's leading cities.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Religious Parties Work for Agreement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Religious parties met
Tuesday night in a bid to hammer out a draft agreement to take to
the Likud as a basis for their participation in Israel's next
coalition government, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Religious Party (NRP), Shas and United
Torah Judaism (UTJ), which won a total of 24 seats in the
120-member Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections last week, held
a series of meetings over the past few days, trying to come to the
Likud with a single list of demands.
</P>
<P>
Details of the draft were kept tightly under wraps, with
officials involved in the negotiations saying that they are
concerned that leaks to the press would damage their negotiating
stance.
</P>
<P>
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu defeated Prime Minister Shimon
Peres with a narrow lead of less than one percent in the May 29
prime ministerial election, and will become the first directly
elected Israeli premier.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was reportedly trying to form his new cabinet in
10 days, had ordered Likud Director-General Avigdor Lieberman to
conduct the first round of coalition negotiations in the last two
days
</P>
<P>
Reports said Netanyahu would have no trouble forming a
coalition with the religious bloc, Yisrael Ba'aliya, the new
immigrant party which won a projected 7 seats, and the Third Way,
a new group initiated by hawkish Laborites, with 4 mandates.
</P>
<P>
However, with portfolio allocation in the offing, tension in
all potential coalition partners is rising, especially within the
Likud where no one has a clue about Netanyahu's intentions.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post said that the religious groups were
dealing with appointments to various Knesset posts, the religious
status quo, education, and housing (including housing beyond the
Green Line).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the heads of the three parties, Aryeh Deri of
Shas, Zevulun Hammer of the NRP, and Meir Porush of UTJ, were also
meeting in an attempt to resolve differences between the parties,
primarily over portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that at the meeting, it was decided
that Porush would be named chairman of the Knesset Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NRP's Shmaryahu Ben-Tzur said the purpose of the meetings
is to coordinate positions so that the three parties can go into
the negotiations with the Likud with a united position, which
would also facilitate the talks.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the NRP has shown interest in the education,
religious affairs, and labor and social affairs portfolios, Shas
in the interior and religious affairs portfolios, and the UTJ in
the control of the Housing Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Since both Shas and the NRP are interested in the religious
affairs portfolio, there is reportedly talk of some kind of
rotation agreement between the parties.
</P>
<P>
The three parties also reached a consensus on agreeing to roll
back the status quo to what it was prior to the 1992 elections.
Since then, numerous businesses have opened on the Jewish
Shabbat.

There are more than 4,000 poorly facilitated toilets, and
modern and clean toilets are few, which has prompted many
complaints, Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are only 200 public toilets in the
city's main streets and commercial centers: one toilet for every
15,000 people in main streets and just one for every 100,000 in
busy commercial centers such as Xi'dan, Wangfujing and Qianmen.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jingyuan, environmental sanitation expert of the Ministry
of Construction, said a state-level sanitary city requires 30
public toilets per square kilometer, and one for in every 200
meters in busy streets.
</P>
<P>
However, China, with some 300 million urban dwellers, has only
90,000 public toilets and the average toilet rate for urban
dwellers ranks bottom in the world.
</P>
<P>
She said the number and quality of toilets represent the extent
of a civilization and Beijing has apparently lagged behind in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the capital soon will stage regulations on
management of public toilets, open more toilets within community
premises, and make most public toilets updated by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It will soon build 500 no-flush toilets in downtown areas,
which can transport the excrement to a storage box each time the
toilet is used, and the excreta will be wrapped with plastic
bags.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Building No-Flush Toilets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Environmental Sanitation
Bureau and the Taihetong Company jointly will build 500 no-flush
toilets in the capital city, the "Economic Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The no-flush toilet is a patent product of the Taihetong
Company. It can transport the excrement to a storage box each time
the toilet is used, and the excreta will be wrapped in plastic
bags.
</P>
<P>
This design prevents any smell from spreading and should help
contain contagious disease, making it very practical for the
transportation of excrement.
</P>
<P>
The biggest advantage to this no-flush toilet lies in saving
water. The amount of water used to clean the toilets accounts for
almost half of the total amount of water consumed by Chinese urban
residents in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that each no-flush toilet saves about 90 tons
of water each year, and a no-flush toilet can be installed in
several hours.
</P>
<P>
The no-flush toilets already are in operation in Wangfujing,
downtown Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Potential Food for 1.6 billion Chinese in 21st Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Great potential exists for higher
rice yields and current research into this area shows ever-growing
optimism, said a Chinese expert of hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Longping, known as "the father of hybrid rice" among his
world colleagues, said that some western economists who believe
China cannot feed itself have underestimated the role of science
and technology in increasing grain yields.
</P>
<P>
China now has 1.2 billion people, each of whom has an average
area of cultivation less than 1.4 mu (less than 0.09
hectares). The Chinese population will increase to 1.6 billion in
2030, while the average cultivated land per person will decrease
to less than one mu.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of who would feed China then catches everyone's
prime attention," said Yuan, an academician of the Chinese Academy
of Engineering (CAE) who is attending a national conference of
academicians opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economist Lester Brown offered a pessimistic view of
China's self-sufficiency in grain production, saying China would
have to import a large quantity of grain in the near future,
resulting in a worldwide shortage of grain and a sharp increase in
grain prices.
</P>
<P>
"Brown got some evidence to support his view," commented Yuan,
"but he made one-sided remarks about some key aspects." Most
importantly, Yuan said, Brown downplayed the role of science and
technology in increasing grain yields.
</P>
<P>
Due to the popularization and improvement of hybrid corn and
the perfection of other agricultural technologies, the yield of
corn in the United States has increased to over 500 kilograms per
mu in 1980s from 150 kilograms per mu in 1930s.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Nearly 60 percent of increased grains is due to the
amelioration of the species," Yuan said. Short-stalked rice,
developed in 1960s, increased China's grain production by 20 to 30
percent. The success of hybrid rice breeding in 1970s increased
the grain production by another 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
China now plants 460 to 480 million mu (about 31 to 32 million
hectares) of rice annually, half of which is hybrid rice. The
yield of the hybrid rice, with a growth period of 125 days,
exceeds 600 kilograms per mu.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, who now leads a group of rice experts studying new
technologies, said that within one or two years, a new hybrid rice
with greater potential will be developed. He estimated that the
new hybrid rice will yield 15 to 20 percent more than the hybrid
rice now planted throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
If the new rice is planted in 200 million mu (over 13 million
hectares) each year, 15 billion kilograms more rice -- the amount
a medium-sized province could produce in a year -- will be
harvested annually.
</P>
<P>
The "father of hybrid rice" was even more excited by his latest
discovery: two important genes in a strain of wild rice, which
each may lead to 20 percent greater yields than hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is currently researching this new find. He believes that
significant breakthroughs will be gained in rice breeding
techniques at the beginning of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that China is capable of feeding its people with the
advancement of science and technology, and efforts made by Chinese
people," Yuan said.

SHANTOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Shantou City in southern China's
Guangdong Province has banned the production, sale and use of
styrofoam-made fast food boxes, a source of "white pollution" in

<HEADLINE> Shooting of Abiola's Wife Draws International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The shooting of wife of Nigeria's
opposition leader by unknown gunmen has drawn international
concern and brought shock waves to the local people.
</P>
<P>
Kudirat Abiola, wife of the detained politician Moshood
Abiola, was shot dead by a group of unknown gunmen in her way
home in Lagos on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo described the
killing as a "horrifying event", saying it was "regrettable" that
Kudirat was killed while her husband was still in prison.
</P>
<P>
Moshood Abiola has been detained in prison since July 1994
after he proclaimed himself president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The United State government urged the Nigerian militay
authority to investigate with the "utmost care" the daylight
killing of Kudirat Abiola.
</P>
<P>
"It is just too early to tell whether the killing was politically
motivated. But it does not appear to have been an assassination
and not an intended robbery," said the U.S. State Department
spokesman, Glyn Davis.
</P>
<P>
The British government deplored the death of Kudirat and
described the daylight killing as "another gory landmark in
Nigeria's nationhood."
</P>
<P>
Kudirat was killed at around 9:30 to 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday on
the road.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos police command has announced that investigation into
the murder has been going on.

<HEADLINE> Digital Technology Developed for China's Seismological Observation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a series of
digital seismological warning and observation instruments and
high-tech computer data processing systems, making itself a world
leader in seismological research.
</P>
<P>
"The State Seismological Bureau has developed five kinds of
seismological measuring instruments, three kinds of data
collecting instruments and GPS digital clocks, which are all
advanced in the world as far as their technological levels are
concerned," said Wu Ningyuan, vice-director of the Seismological
Observation Department of the State Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Some of the instruments and software are packaged so that parts
can be interchanged, he added.
</P>
<P>
The JCZ-1 super wide-band earthquake measuring instrument can
distinguish a displacement so small it measures the equivalent of
one meter divided by ten to the eleventh power.
</P>
<P>
When strong shocks rocked Kobe and Osaka in Japan in 1995, many
digital earthquake recording instruments there had difficulty with
automatic positioning. The EDAS-3 data collecting instrument now
produced by Chinese scientists can record such measurements
easily, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
With the help of these instruments, China can determine within
30 minutes any earthquake in the country measuring at or above
five on the Richter Scale, and also determine the time, place, and
Richter Scale measurements of earthquakes anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
China has exported its digital earthquake instruments to Japan
since 1993. The equipment also has been used in foreign
seismological observation stations in the Republic of Korea and
Egypt. Many foreign seismological experts and seismological
instrument producers have expressed interest in these digital
seismological instruments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has accelerated efforts to establish a digital
seismological observation system throughout the country. Units
already have been established in Xian, Beijing, and Nanjing, and
preparations are underway in several of other cities.
</P>
<P>
The use of digital technology in seismological observation has
increased the volume of observation information by more than a
thousand-fold, and data processing itself is now speedier.

<HEADLINE> Likud's Coalition Talks Shift into Higher Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Coalition talks between
the Likud and its potential partners shift into higher gear
today after winding up the first round of contacts.
</P>
<P>
However, with Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu still
refusing to give any hint of his intentions on the portfolio
allocation in the new cabinet, tension among all potential
coalition partners is rising, especially within the Likud
itself.
</P>
<P>
Further in the back ground is the less likely but still
possible option of forming a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday night, The Likud negotiators in charge of the
coalition talks had met with all the potential partners, who
made their initial demands on the portfolio allocation. The
real hard bargaining is expected to begin in earnest now.
</P>
<P>
The potential partners include the four religious parties of
Shas, National Religious Party, United Torah Judaism and
Moledet, and the centrist Yisrael Ba'aliya and the Third Way.
</P>
<P>
The religious parties, the big winners of the elections of
Knesset (parliament), have been holding intensive talks on
coordinating positions in coalition negotiations with the Likud,
and on dividing portfolios among them.
</P>
<P>
According to the laws, Netanyahu is to form the new
government within 45 days after the official publication of
the election results today.
</P>
<P>
Aides close to Netanyahu once indicated that he would form
the new cabinet within 10 days, but Netanyahu himself
tactically denied he was in rush to do so in order to
prevent his partners from making excessive demands.
</P>
<P>
Likud insiders say they have never experienced such a situation
in which nothing leaks regarding ministerial appointments,
attributing this to the fact that Netanyahu holds all the cards in
secret.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's silence has fueled the political rumor mill which
has been in full operation even since he emerged as the
winner of the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
David Levy, Former foreign minister in last Likud's
government and the leader of Gesher, is widely expected to
be renamed, while former Major General Yitzhak Mordechai ticked
to be the new defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, the former Defense Minister and the chief
power broker within the Likud, is expected to be named trade
and industry minister instead of finance minister as initially
indicated. Local reports said that Sharon refuses to join the
government if he is not awarded the finance portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud and Labor members of Knesset have been
in touch on the possibility of forming a national unity
government. But so far Netanyahu has not given any hint about
this issue while the Labor leaders are at odds over joining such
a government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that if Netanyahu fails to form a new
government by June 17 when the new Knesset convenes for the
first time, the chances for a national unity government will
increase.

CHENGDU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Panzhihua Iron and Steel
(Group) Corporation, one of China's major steel producers, has
paid off a debt of 287 million US dollars in principal and
interest on loans from an international bank syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Citibank of the United States, Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole of France, and 22 other foreign banks arranged for loan
of 210 million US dollars to the steel producer in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 million US dollars of loans was used to import
technology and equipment for Panzhihua's second phase of
construction. Some projects have gone into operation, raising the
firm's annual output of steel by 67 percent, enabling it to
produce new products for an eager market.
</P>
<P>
To repay the loans, the company has exported products to over a
dozen countries and regions, including the United States, Britain
and Japan, which earned the company 142 million US dollars in
foreign exchanges in 1995 alone.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Finalizes Common Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda
has finally proved a common minimum program (CMP) for his new
coalition government after days of squabbling among constituents
of the 13-party United Front over the contents of the document,
the Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The program is to be released at 11:30 a.m. (0600 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The drafting of the document has been dogged by problems since
June 1 when the United Front government was installed with various
constituents of the United Front differing on its contents.
</P>
<P>
While the left parties objected to proposals for disinvestment
in loss-making public sector undertakings, the federal front
comprising four regional parties proposed their own agenda,
including more powers for the states and mechanisms for the
resolution of inter-state disputes.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the CMP will send a clear signal to
industry and business, both domestic and foreign, that the
coalition government will not do anything to unsettle the process
of reforms initiated by the Indian National Congress government in
1991.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the document will spell out the areas where
foreign investment is not welcome, such as the consumer goods
industry. This is essentially to satisfy the left parties which
want the participation of foreign capital limited to hi-tech,
infrastructure areas.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to emphasize the resolve against the
indiscriminate privatization of the public sector undertakings and
would propose an expert committee of professionals and trade
unionists to go into the question on a case-by-case basis.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Party Ponders on Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Labor Party is
divided on whether to join a national unity government after being
defeated in the general election.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres Tuesday reiterated that the Labor
should not be the one to suggest a unity government, adding,
however, that if an offer comes from prime minister-elect Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Labor will consider it.
</P>
<P>
Former Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir Tuesday raised such
a proposal but Netanyahu has given no hint to accept it.
</P>
<P>
Labor sources said that if Netanyahu gives the senior cabinet
portfolios -- defense, foreign affairs, and finance -- to Likud
members, that would signal that he is not interested in having
Labor as a partner.
</P>
<P>
Minister Yossi Beilin, who last week opposed the idea, Tuesday
came out in favor of joining a unity government.
</P>
<P>
"Labor can serve in the opposition as the watchdog of the
peace process. If a respectable offer comes from Netanyahu, I
think it would be a mistake to reject it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very detailed timetable for the stages of the Oslo
agreement and if we're in the government, we can see to it that
the timetable is adhered to," Beilin said
</P>
<P>
He said the Labor Party has three goals: continuing the peace
process; strengthening its ties with those sectors of the public
which drifted away from the party, such as the religious and new
immigrants; and rehabilitating the party.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ehud Barak, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat,
and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer reportedly also support
joining a unity government.
</P>
<P>
However, Tourism Minister Uzi Baram strongly opposed the
possibility. "I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed that people in
my party are raising the issue even before the Likud has suggested
it, and before the ink has dried on Labor's main election slogan,"
Baram said.
</P>
<P>
"The proper thing to do is to let Netanyahu form a government
and see how he functions and what his party will be. We don't yet
know who Netanyahu is and where he is heading," the tourism
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We received one percent less votes than Netanyahu and should
be proud of the public which supported us," he said. "Today, we
must organize the opposition and not waste energy in directions
which are wrong and undesirable."

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Appeals to Overseas Developers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by preferential
treatment, foreign real estate developers are vying for China's
vast market, and expect to profit well from their investments.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 5,000 overseas real estate enterprises, or 20
percent of the country's total, have participated in real estate
development in China. One-tenth of the country's total foreign
investment comes from that injected into the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, foreign real estate developers enjoy a series of
preferential policies, including exemption from investment
regulation taxes, easy access to collection of funds, and the
freedom to remit their gains abroad after paying duty taxes.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the investment structure of China's real
estate sector has been greatly aided, and that most of the
overseas funds have been channeled into construction of
residential housing. Projects for building luxury villas and
office buildings have declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
More notably, China has created the Urban Real Estate
Management Law and a series of other laws and rules governing the
sector, which explain and standardize the country's real estate
development.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that during China's economic development boom
over the next 10 to 15 years, the real estate sector will shift
its focus from key cities to small and medium-sized cities, and
from coastal areas to inland regions. Still, equal attention will
be paid to construction volume, quality and economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Real estate development has great potential in China, as it
accounts for only 3 percent of the country's total GNP, far from
the 20 or 30 percent proportion generally listed in that area.
</P>
<P>
In line with the State plan, the country's housing construction
is expected to grow at an annual rate of 15 percent. By the year
2000, China will build additional 230 towns and 4.2 billion sq m
of housing, and rebuild 2.9 billion sq m of old houses.

<P>
GUIYANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province
is increasing efforts to develop energy, transportation and raw
materials industries.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the province invested 55.1 billion
yuan in fixed assets, 2.5 times the figure listed during the
previous five years. Sixty percent of them were poured into basic
industries and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The 1991-1995 period saw the province add 1.97 million kw of
installed electric capacity, with the annual growth rate of
generated electricity reaching 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the previous five-year period, nearly 6.7 million
tons of raw coal were added during the 1991-1995 period, with
annual growth rate reaching 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the province transports nearly 10 million tons of
coal to other provinces and transmits 2.7 billion kw of
electricity to south China, central China, and the neighboring
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Non-ferrous metals mining, smelting and processing industries,
especially the aluminum industry, have become the province's
pillar industries. Last year the province's electrolytic aluminum
output accounted for 10 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the province stimulate local economy, the
state has mapped out a five-year plan for investments in
infrastructure construction, that will aid the improvement of
local railway networks and the building of 1,300 km of
expressways.

LANZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Kaori Koshichi, a Japanese college
student, died in a tragic car accident a few years ago. Her
parents recently donated two million Japanese yen to the Dunhuang
Research Institute where Koshichi had planned to study in
China.

<P>
She wanted to help protect cultural relics in Dunhuang, best

adding that that the donation was the wish of their daughter.
</P>
<P>
Koshichi loved Chinese culture. Hearing that relices in
Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province, were being damaged by
weathering, she often said, "What a pity that these important
ancient relics are being damaged. If only they could be well
protected!"
</P>
<P>
Now a portrait of Koshichi is displayed in front of the Mogao
Grottoes, also called Thousand-Buddha Cave, southeast of
Dunhuang. Building began A.D. 366, with additions from the Sui
Dynasty (581-618) and Tang Dynasty (618-907) down to Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
Art works include sculptures and murals reflecting social life
form the 6th to 14th centuries.

loving beautiful things across the world. Government officials and
ordinary residents alike have expressed their ardent love for the
Dunhuang art, a cultural heritage of mankind.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Keeps Eye on Property Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT) is
closely watching property credit to prevent it from turning into
bad debt, a BOT source said.
</P>
<P>
Property lending has amounted to 10 percent of all commercial
bank lending and 5 percent of the lending from financial
institutions, said Thirachai Phuvanat-Nranubala, director of BOT's
Financial Supervision Department.
</P>
<P>
The property industry in the country is in oversupply and close
supervision of property lending would ensure that credit is not
focused into individual sectors, Thirachai said.
</P>
<P>
After the Bangkok Bank of Commerce woes earlier last month,
many analysts said banking and financial institutions are no
longer safe.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans have risen to 6 percent recently for
financial institutions and many property companies in Thailand
have high levels of debt and negative cash flow, according to the
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions mainly based on collateral before
offering credit rather than looking overall projects, such as
marketing and project viability, they said.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions should give more weight to project
feasibility and marketing, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Detain Electricity Board Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lanka Police have detained
over 50 employees of the Electricity Board who went on strike and
caused a four-day islandwide blackout, according to police
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that they had uncovered several acts of
sabotage by the strikers.
</P>
<P>
The strikers damaged generators by changing wire connections
and removed items such as wire connections and fuses from some
installations.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the delay in restoring power supply was
mainly due to these acts of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Those found responsible for acts of sabotage will be arrested
and prosecuted under the Emergency Regulations now in force, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a massive demonstration was staged in Colombo by
pro-government unions, to condemn the strike. The picketing and
demonstration were led by government Members of Parliament and
trade union leaders, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The main theme of the demonstration was to highlight the
ulterior motives of the saboteurs which was to obstruct the
government's efforts to develop the country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled by power blackouts and water supply
cutoffs since May 29 when employees of the Electricity Board went
on strike to protest the government's decision to privatize the
Ceylon Electricity Board.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Anatoly Karpov is to defend
his International Chess Federation (FIDE) title against American
challenger Gata Kamsky in a 20-game series in Elista on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The series will run to July 14 with the player who scores 10.5
points first becoming the winner.
</P>
<P>
The winner is to pocket a prize money of 937,500 dollars and
the loser 562,500.
</P>
<P>
FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov resorted to his home as the
host after European and American chess federations opposed to an
early proposal of Baghdad being the hosting city.
</P>
<P>
Kamsky who born in Siberia, lived in Brooklyn, New York with
his father as his manager.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his outing for the world championship match, Kamsky,
22, won the candidates matches against Paul van der Sterren of the
Netherlands, Viswanathan Anand of India and Valery Salov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Karpov, 45, world champion from 1975 to 1985, regained his FIDE
title by beating Jan Timman of the Netherlands in 1993 after
Russian Garry Kasparov broke away from the federation to set up
his own Professional Chess Association.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Nations Reject U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of
Paraguay, Mexico, Chile and Bolivia today expressed their
rejection of the so-called Helms-Burton Law which the United
States enacted to tighten the blockade imposed on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, who are attending the 26th General
Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) scheduled to
end this Friday, criticized the U.S. Helms-Burton Law during the
meeting although the issue is not on the agenda of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Dario Melgarejo said that the
Helms-Burton "is a unilateral measure that alters and exercises
influence over other countries," adding that the Rio Group
condemned the law because of its extraterritorial scope.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Gurria described the U.S. measure
as extraterritorial, saying that "if countries want the hemisphere
to be governed by internal laws, it should, in the same way,
govern itself by laws governing the relations between countries."
</P>
<P>
There is "profound concern over the illegal scope of this
measure (the Helms-Burton) since it could have fatal consequences
for the trade of several countries," said the foreign minister of
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza proposed that
other mechanisms be sought to counterbalance the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, Canada and the Rio Group are
preparing a resolution that seeks to condemn the U.S. law directly
at the end of the OAS General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
During the ongoing meeting, the participants from 34 member
countries of the OAS drafted a project of "Consensus of Panama"
which proposes "to overcome the tendencies towards isolationism
and the adoption of individual actions, not negotiated and
contrary to international law."
</P>
<P>
The document points to "multilateralism" as an effective
instrument for "overcoming the challenges that the hemisphere is
confronting."
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Law, which was passed by the U.S. Senate and
the House of Representatives this March and imposed on Cuba on May
29, seeks to frighten away foreign investment from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The law includes sanctions against foreign businessmen and
companies who operate their businesses on properties on that
island that were expropriated from U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> OAS Urges Definitive Solution to Malvinas Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 26th General Assembly of
the Organization of American States (OAS) today called for a
definitive solution to the sovereignty over the Malvinas
(Falkland) Islands.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration approved by the assembly here today, the OAS
expressed its satisfaction over the renewal of diplomatic
relations between Britain and Argentina, which both claimed the
sovereignty over the island, and the will of the latter to solve
the problem by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was sponsored by the Brazilian delegation and
backed by Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and
Panama.
</P>
<P>
In a brief press conference, Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister
Fernando Petrella said that his country's position on the issue
remains firm and that its negotiations with Britain are being
delayed because there are points that cannot be settled and have
to be discussed diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain bases its position on the residents of the
islands which is not shared by his government because of the small
number of inhabitants it has.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain fought a war over the sovereignty of the
Malvinas Islands in 1982 and resumed their diplomatic relations in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Malvinas Islands are situated in the southern part of the
Atlantic Ocean, with an area of 12,000 square kilometers. They are
more than 500 kilometers away from the southern tip of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,100 residents live on the islands, of whom British
descendents account for 90 percent. Rich oil and natural gas
reserves have been discovered there in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Build 5 Million Telephone lines by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans to
install five million telephone lines in the current sixth
five-year Development Plan (1994-1999), the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The government's aim in the telecommunications sector during
the period is to reduce the waiting list of subscribers and expand
the coverage of telecommunication facilities down to rural areas,
Eman S. Sumantri, Directorate General of Post and
Telecommunications, said Tuesday in Yogyakarta, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the aim, he said, 20 percent of the investment in
the construction of telecommunication facilities will be allocated
to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The government has made a number of changes to the monopolistic
system by giving more opportunities for private businesses to take
part in the development of telecommunication facilities in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are now 1.42 telephones for every 100 people in the
country, and this ratio was still very small compared to the other
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
Sumantri said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio in Thailand stood at 2.73 telephones for every 100
people while in Malaysia it is 4.91 and Singapore 39.85, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the sixth plan, the ratio in Indonesia is
expected to reach four telephones for every 100 people, he added.

is populated by 23 percent of Azerbaijanis and 76 percent of
Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has remained neutral in the conflict of its two

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Get Extra U.S. Money For Scrapping Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States today agreed to give
Ukraine an extra 43 million U.S. dollars in compensation for
dismantling thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is an amendment to a tripartite declaration
signed in January 1994 by the U.S., Russian and Ukrainian
presidents on the destruction of nearly 5,000 nuclear weapons
stationed in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to help Ukraine clean up its two former
missile bases and provide housing for demobilized missile forces.
</P>
<P>
The amendment was signed by Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery
Shmarov and his U.S. and Russian counterparts, William Perry and
Pavel Grachev, in Pervomaisk, a former Soviet missile base in
southern Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who arrived in Ukraine Monday for a two-day visit, his
fourth in two years, will fly to Germany to continue his four-day
European trip which will also take him to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said in a statement on Monday
that his country had shipped all nuclear weapons on its soil to
Russia for destruction as stipulated by the 1994 declaration.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, the second former Soviet republic, after Kazakhstan,
to go non-nuclear, inherited about 1,600 long-range nuclear
warheads, 300 cruise missiles and 2,500 tactical nuclear weapons
from the Soviet Union when it disintegrated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Another former Soviet republic, Belarus, is scheduled to move
its remaining 18 warheads to Russia for destruction by the year
end. Russia will be the only nuclear power among the fifteen
former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Pervomaisk has been completely disarmed since January when
Perry and Grachev witnessed the destruction of the first
intercontinental missile launcher. All its missile silos have been
destroyed and covered with fertile earth from central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Shmarov said retired missile troops would settle in Pervomaisk
and build it into a city.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Nuke Weapons Moved to Russia for Destruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 5 (Xinhua) -- All nuclear weapons in Ukraine have
been transported to Russia before June for destruction, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by Ukraine's President Leonid Danilovich
Kuchma said the destruction will be carried out in Russia under
the supervision of Ukrainian officials.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine passed a resolution in July 1991
which declared that the country would stick to the three
principles concerning nuclear weapons -- non-acceptance,
non-production and non-possession.
</P>
<P>
The transport has clearly showed Ukraine's sincerity in the
implementation of the three principles, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming destruction of all nuclear weapons from Ukraine
will pave a way for establishing a non-nuclear zone from the Black
Sea to the Baltic Sea and will also promote mutual trust among
those countries in the zone, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It could help avoid fresh divisions in Europe due to the issue
of nuclear arms, the Ukraine's president said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The president said Ukraine volunteered to abandon the status of
a nuclear state because of its suffering from the Chernobyl
nuclear accident in 1986, in which 4,300 people died as a direct
result of the accident and many of its 350,000 clean-up workers
are now ill. Millions were affected, mostly in Ukraine, Russia and
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine's leader also appealed to all other nuclear
countries in the world to destroy their nuclear arms.

VIENNA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the Austrian government's
job-creating policies, the number of registered job-seekers in May
dropped 12.4 percent over April to 207,879.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's unemployment rate reached 3.7

He said he plans to visit Hungary, Poland, Saudi Arabia,
Malaysia and Singapore with Austrian businessmen in the following

<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China spoke highly of its cooperation
with Norway in environmental protection, but it will depend mainly
on its own strength in this field, said a senior Chinese official
in Oslo today.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of the State
Science and Technology Commission, met Norwegian Prime Minister
Gro Brundtland Monday and briefed her on the latest development of
economic and environmental cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Song said new progress has taken place since Brundtland's visit
to China last November.
</P>
<P>
China, as the largest developing country in the world, has
given great importance to cooperation with other countries in
protecting the earth, said the Chinese minister, who is heading a
Chinese delegation to the Nordic country for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"No one could help us out, if we don't help ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Song praised the two countries' joint efforts made in
environmental protection and said China is implementing their
agreed-upon projects one by one.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Norwegian Environment Minister Thorbjoern
Berntsen, Song appreciated Norway's positive approach toward its
cooperation with China in implementing the priority projects of
the Chinese environmental protection program, outlined in
accordance with the Agenda 21, a United Nations program of action
for environmental protection for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He urged the technologically advanced Nordic state to help
China with its environmental protection undertaking.
</P>
<P>
Telling his Norwegian counterpart that he was impressed by the
country's clean, lush and graceful landscape, the Chinese State
Councillor said he sees a bright prospect for bilateral
cooperation in such fields as the development of power and water
resources.
</P>
<P>
China and Norway also signed a memorandum of understanding
today to boost their scientific and technological ties. The
memorandum provides for increasing exchange of scientists and
research data between their respective research institutions on

The agreement, reached at a two-day meeting of NATO foreign
ministers in Berlin, will allow the setting up of a European
military component under the control of the 10-member Western
European Union (WEU) which will give more independence to Europe
to deal with regional crisis without involving U.S. ground forces
but borrowing U.S. hardware.

Juppe said France, which pulled out of NATO in 1966, has

characteristics of Europe's defense capability and fought for more
independence for Europe to launch its own peace-keeping missions
under the WEU's control and using NATO's military forces.

Juppe said that a new NATO structure is taking shape and France
is moving closer to the military alliance.
</P>

France has been bargaining its return to NATO's integrated

<HEADLINE> Austria Hails NATO's Berlin Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Austrian leaders today hailed NATO's
agreement to boost Europe's role within the U.S.-led military
alliance and give the Western European Union defense body more
power.
</P>
<P>
NATO agreed in Berlin on Monday to form a European wing of the
trans-Atlantic alliance which will be given more independence and
the the chance to undertake its own peacekeeping or relief
missions through the setting up of a Combined Joint Task Forces
(CJTF), but using borrowed American hardware.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said the Berlin agreement shows that
NATO has shifted from the role of protecting its members in the
Cold War to maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin plan is widely seen as the first major step by the
western military alliance, set up in 1949 during the Cold War, to
adapt to the new post-Cold War challenges.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky added that Austria, which is not a NATO member, will
watch NATO's development closely and continue to play an active
role in the alliance's Partnership for Peace Program, a
cooperation program with former eastern bloc countries and other
European non-NATO members on regional defense issues.
</P>
<P>
Foreign minister Wolfgang Schussel said that the long dormant
WEU, the 10-nation European security and defense organization, has
finally achieved a serious role for itself and Europe can play a
greater role in the trans-Atlantic alliance under the new plan.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend said Austria's next step
would be to participate fully in the WEU as a European defense
identity has been created and Europe must share more
responsibility for European defense.
</P>
<P>
The principle of a European-only force was first proposed in
January 1994 by the U.S. at the NATO summit in Brussels to shift
more of the alliance's responsibilities to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The plan once stalled over differences between Washington and
Paris over the influence of the U.S. over NATO staff, equipment
and headquarters. But France's rapprochement with NATO, including
its participation in Bosnia peacekeeping, eased the wrangle and
helped lead to this week's Berlin agreement.

</P>
<P>
QUITO -- Bank savings increased an average of 45.7 percent in
Ecuador between February 1995 and February 1996, the statistics

17 percent to 592 million U.S. dollars during the first four
months of this year compared with the same period in 1995.
</P>

chalked up for the Caracas metropolitan area in May for a total
accumulation of 51.5 percent during the first five months this

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, US Reach Military Cooperation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian parliament today oked
a military cooperation agreement with the United States prior to
the pullout of U.N. peace-securing forces later in the year.
</P>
<P>
The former Yugoslav republic agreed upon the presence of
military forces from the U.S. and other NATO member states after
the 1,100 U.N. troops of preventive deployment withdraw from the
country, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
After the parliament approval, Macedonian Defense Minister
Blagoj Handziski was quoted as saying that the cooperation accord
between his country and the United States marks "a new phase" and
"a new standard" of military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has also approved the possibilities of joint
military exercises between Macedonia and states of the Partnership
for Peace program as well as NATO member nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace-securing forces were deployed in Macedonia three
years ago. The forces include troops from the United States and
some north European countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided late last month that the
presence of the U.N. peace-securing forces will be prolonged to
November 30 this year.

<HEADLINE> Prescription Errors Very Common in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 4 (Xinhua) -- Wrongly prescribed drugs that have
caused death or permanent damage are the commonest cause of
medical negligence claims against doctors, according to a report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Compensation payments worth 3.5 million pounds (5.25 million US
dollars) were paid out to patients by the Medical Defence Union,
the doctors' defence body, over six years because of prescribing
errors.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 21500 claims against GP (general practitionner)
members of the union found 790 in which damages were paid. Almost
200 payments, one quarter of the total, were made because of drug
errors.
</P>
<P>
The commonest mistakes involved giving the wrong drug, the
wrong dose, or failing to note its interaction with another drug
or an allergy. In almost half the cases the damage was permanent
-- causing scarring nerve damage or stroke -- and 18 percent
resulted in death, stillbirth or an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the cases were settled for less than 10000
pounds (15000 US dollars) each but five resulted in damages of
over 100000 pounds (150000 US dollars). A woman who lost the
feeling in her lower back after medical staff injected calcium
chloride instead of sodium chloride (common salt used in a saline
drip) during the administration of an epidural won 308000 pounds
(462000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In another case, a 72-year-old man with a long history of
wheezing, for which he used an inhaler, was treated for high blood
pressure with a beta-blocker, oxprenolol. He collapsed and died
shortly after taking the first tablet.
</P>
<P>
His GP failed to heed warnings in drug directories that the
drug could induced an asthmatic attack in wheezy patients. The
claim was settled for 5500 pounds (8250 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Prescription Errors Very Common in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 4 (Xinhua) -- Wrongly prescribed drugs that have
caused death or permanent damage are the commonest cause of
medical negligence claims against doctors, according to a report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Compensation payments worth 3.5 million pounds (5.25 million US
dollars) were paid out to patients by the Medical Defence Union,
the doctors' defence body, over six years because of prescribing
errors.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 21500 claims against GP (general practitionner)
members of the union found 790 in which damages were paid. Almost
200 payments, one quarter of the total, were made because of drug
errors.
</P>
<P>
The commonest mistakes involved giving the wrong drug, the
wrong dose, or failing to note its interaction with another drug
or an allergy. In almost half the cases the damage was permanent
-- causing scarring nerve damage or stroke -- and 18 percent
resulted in death, stillbirth or an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the cases were settled for less than 10000
pounds (15000 US dollars) each but five resulted in damages of
over 100000 pounds (150000 US dollars). A woman who lost the
feeling in her lower back after medical staff injected calcium
chloride instead of sodium chloride (common salt used in a saline
drip) during the administration of an epidural won 308000 pounds
(462000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In another case, a 72-year-old man with a long history of
wheezing, for which he used an inhaler, was treated for high blood
pressure with a beta-blocker, oxprenolol. He collapsed and died
shortly after taking the first tablet.
</P>
<P>
His GP failed to heed warnings in drug directories that the
drug could induced an asthmatic attack in wheezy patients. The
claim was settled for 5500 pounds (8250 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a third case, a GP's receptionist who wrote out a repeat
prescription for a woman with heart trouble on long-term
anti-coagulation therapy gave the dose as 5 mg per day instead of
1 mg. The GP failed to spot the error when he signed the
prescription and the patient later had an internal haemorrhage and
required a transfusion. The claim was settled for 1500 pounds
(2250 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Dr Stephen Green, head of risk management at the MDU, said it
was the first time the union had made such detailed information
available. "We feel it is essential to highlight potential
pitfalls and to provide our members with as much information as
possible to help them manage their patients safely."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Carmakers Enjoy Brisk Sales in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Overseas car companies with plants
operating in the United States enjoyed brisk sales on the U.S.
market in May.
</P>
<P>
Audi of America, Inc. reported its U.S. sales of 1,914 for the
month, a jump of 52 percent over the same month last year. This
represents the German luxury carmaker's best May results in the
U.S. in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The company has demonstrated this kind of year-on-year sales
increase for 17 of the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
American Honda automobile sales in May totaled 77,607 units, up
10.4 percent. So far this year, the Japanese carmaker sold 350,028
cars in the U.S., up 16.8 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen of America, Inc. reported sales of 13,935 for the
month of May, representing a strong 12.2 percent increase over
1995's May figure of 12,419.
</P>
<P>
This marked Volkswagen's best May sales figure since 1990 and
the best single-month result overall since June 1990.
</P>
<P>
For the year, Volkswagen is up 13.7 percent over the same
period in 1995. May's brisk results bring Volkswagen's 1996
year-to-date total to 51,523, compared to 1995 when the tally was
45,311.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen's sales were again led by its best-selling Jetta
model. Jetta sales for May were 8,660, up 3 percent over 1995 when
they were 8,410.
</P>
<P>
Following a trend of increasingly strong sales results,
Volkswagen's mid-size Passat sedan and wagon sales for May totaled
2,268, up 73.9 percent over 1995's tally of 1,304. This one-month
total was the best Passat month in more than five years since
December 1990.
</P>
<P>
American Honda automobile sales in May totaled 77,607 units, up
10.4 percent. So far this year, the Japanese carmaker sold 350,028
cars in the U.S., up 16.8 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
BMW reported record May sales and the best ever year-to-date
performance for May at 9,458 and 39,031 units respectively. Last
month's figures improved by 6 percent over the May 1995 total of
8,892. Year-to-date sales grew by more than 3 percent over the
37,739 figure reported in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, BMW of North America, Inc. and Land Rover
North America, Inc. are members of the BMW Group.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Report Released for Tethered Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Arcing and burning of the
tether resulted in the failure of the Tethered Satellite
Experiment during U.S. space shuttle Columbia's mission in Feb.25,
according to a report jointly released today by NASA and the
Italian Space Agency (ASI).
</P>
<P>
"The tether failed as a result of arcing and burning of the
tether, leading to a tensile failure after a significant portion
of the tether had burned away," the 358-page document concluded.
</P>
<P>
The arcing occurred because either external foreign object
penetration or a defect in the tether caused a breach in the layer
of insulation surrounding the tether conductor, the report said,
and the insulation breach provided a path for the current to arc
from the copper wire in the tether to a nearby electrical ground.
</P>
<P>
The arcing burned away most of the tether material at that
location, leading to separation of the tether from pulling force,
when about 19.7 kilometers of tether was unreeled,
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two primary causes for the tether break,
the report also cited, as one contributing factor, that the
tether's exposure in flight and the high voltages had made it
more vulnerable to damage.
</P>
<P>
The tethered Satellite is a joint NASA-ASI system that was
flown aboard Space Shuttle Columbia in an experiment to better
understand the electrically charged environment of Earth's
ionosphere, and how tether systems behave in it. The system had
generated 3,400 volts DC and up to 0.5 amps of current before
the tether was broke.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Tax Credits for Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday proposed a 1,500-dollar annual tax credit to help students
pay for the first two years of college as a measure to promote
access to higher education.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the commencement address at Princeton University in
New Jersey, Clinton said his plan was geared toward community
college to realize a standard of 14 years of education in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the clear facts of this time make it imperative that
our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years
of education as universal to all Americans as the first 12 are
today," Clinton told some 1,700 graduates, their families and
faculty at Princeton's 250th anniversary commencement.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, "America's Hope Scholarship", students at
two-year community colleges will get a 1,500-dollar tax credit the
first year and another 1,500-dollar credit if they stay off drugs,
work hard and earn at least a B average the first year.
</P>
<P>
The credit also would be available to students at four-year
colleges, and a 750-dollar annual credit would be available to
part-time students.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the 1,500-dollar credit is 300 dollars
above the average cost of community college tuition, and the
amount would fully cover tuition for two-thirds of all community
college students nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the proposal on the basis of an earlier plan of a
10,000-dollar annual tax deduction for college tuition and job
training. Families would have the option of choosing either
program.
</P>
<P>
The White House estimated the proposed tax credit would cost
the federal treasury about 8 billion dollars over six years, in
addition to the 35 billion dollars already in Clinton's budget for
the tax-deduction proposal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "This is about more than money. This is about
giving every single, solitary soul in this country a chance to be
more fully alive."
</P>
<P>
To offset the costs, Clinton outlined a series of tax increases
on multinational businesses, the communications industry and
airline travelers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal brought an immediate rebuke from Senator Bob
Dole, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Dole,
campaigning in Chester, Virginia, said, "Who knows what taxes he'll
increase if he should be re-elected."
</P>
<P>
But Dole said Clinton made the move because he also was
planning to propose tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Romany Admits Killing Catholic Bishop in Kotor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Veton Rizvani (23), a Romany of
Muslim religion who was arrested today by Montenegrin police on
suspicion of killing Kotor's Catholic bishop Ivo Gugic, later
admitted the crime.
</P>
<P>
Rizvani, born in Pec, a town in southern Yugoslavia, worked as
a street sweeper in the Montenegrin Adriatic resort of Kotor, the
Montenegrin Interior Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Rizvani told police investigators that he had killed the bishop
for gain, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The retired bishop was found dead in the local bishopric on
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic and Minister of Religions
Slobodan Tomovic expressed their condolences to Kotor bishop Ilija
Janjic, the clergy and all Catholics in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"Bishop Gugic was a man who sincerely believed in
understanding, tolerance and love among people not only as a way
of life but also as a way of surmounting all possible conflicts,"
Bulatovic said in a telegram of condolences.
</P>
<P>
"The Catholic church has lost an exalted missionary of virtue
and the people of (the Adriatic bay of) Boka Kotorska have lost a
man who contributed to harmonious relations among people of
different religious affiliations," Tomovic said.

<HEADLINE> Ariane-5 Destroyed After Lift-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Western Europe's newest Ariane-5
rocket was destroyed mid-air by ground controllers about 40
seconds after lifting off today from Kourou in French Guiana.
</P>
<P>
The rocket, together with four identical scientific satellites,
was destroyed as it was veering off course.
</P>
<P>
The rocket exploded in a huge fireball at an altitude of 4,000
meters and a shower of debris fell to the ground like fireworks,
French television showed.
</P>
<P>
It blasted off around 1230 GMT from the launch pad in Kourou,
in French Guiana, on the northeast coast of South America.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the maiden flight is seen as a setback to
Western Europe's space industry, which is struggling to maintain
its lead in the competitive commercial satellite launch market,
observers noted.
</P>
<P>
But the European Space Agency (ESA) said in a statement that a
second launch of the Ariane-5 rocket would be just a few months
away despite today's failure.
</P>
<P>
"The first blast-off of the Ariane-5 launcher did not validate
the new European launcher," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Ariane-5 program cost 12 ESA countries
8.4 billion U.S. dollars and took more than 10 years of work by
about 10,000 scientists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
The Ariane-5 has a brand new design that makes it more advanced
than previous generations of the rocket. It has a single, central
cryogenic motor and two large, solid-fuel strap-on boosters, which
weighs 270 tons each and develops up to 640 tons of thrust at
liftoff.
</P>
<P>
The central cryogenic motor is ignited before liftoff and the
rocket can be stopped in case there are problems.
</P>
<P>
The ESA had been confident of the reliability of the
Ariane-5. The French Space Agency (CNES), which is managing the
Ariane-5 program, had said that the new rocket would have a
success rate of 98.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to be able to launch into geostationary
transfer orbit single satellite payloads of 6.8 tons and double
payloads with a total weight of 5.9 tons.
</P>
<P>
The launch capacity of the rocket was expected to be further
enhanced by the year 2001 so that it could launch two satellites,
each weighing 3.5 tons, at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Arianespace company, which makes and markets
Ariane rockets and is expected to take over Ariane-5 launch
operations in 1997, has more than half of the global market
share.
</P>
<P>
The ESA intended the Ariane-5 -- whose launch cost
would be at least 10 percent lower than the Ariane-4 -- to
maintain Western Europe's lead in launching heavy satellites at
least in the next 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
It faces strong competition from Russia's Proton, the United
States' Atlas and Titan and China's Long March.
</P>
<P>
A first launch had been scheduled for 1995 but accidents
postponed it until today.
</P>
<P>
Two test launches were scheduled this year. Besides today's
launch, another, code-named 502, is expected in October.
</P>
<P>
France is by far the largest partner in the Ariane-5 program
with about half of the company's shares, followed by Germany with
22 percent and Italy with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain had refused to contribute to the program from its
inception.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Torch Relay Reaches Half-Way in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The Olympic flame reached
half-way in the United States when 77 runners carried it across
Chicago to Indiana on Monday, the 22nd of 42 host states prior to
the opening ceremony on July 19 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The flame was carried to Chicago by a special train from
Wisconsin after making brief stops at Waukegan, Lake Forest,
Highland Park and Evanston.
</P>
<P>
Chicago, one of a handful of cities where the torch made more
than one stop, cheered for its arrival on the 38th of the 84 days
scheduled for the relay.
</P>
<P>
The torch arrived at the Northwestern Metra Station, west of
Chicago's Loop, aboard a 19-car Union Pacific train from Milwaukee
shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
It made the way to Grant Park behind schedule under a heavy
cloud, but the final runner was able to light the Olympic Cauldron
before any rains could fall.
</P>
<P>
A few thousand supporters gathered at the band shell to watch
the spectacle, as well as to listen to the Grant Park Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Olympics expert John MacAloon was instrumental in bringing the
torch to the University of Chicago Hyde Park campus, where
University President Hugo Sonnenschein helped light a cauldron in
the center of the Main Quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
From the University, the torch was carried to Gary, Indiana.
</P>
<P>
The torch will pass through over 100,000 hands along its
15,000-mile relay from Olympia, Greece, to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Cut Rice Export Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has decided to cut its rice
export tariff in order to encourage rice export, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry proposed to levy a 1 percent tax on rice
that is 5 to 10 percent broken and grant free tariffs for the
export rice that is more than 15 percent broken.
</P>
<P>
Local rice exporters have complained that they are suffering
losses due to a 4 percent tax imposed previously on their export
consignments.
</P>
<P>
The cut in the export tax on low quality, 25-35 percent broken
rice is expected to help local exporters maintain their market
share.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria to hold Tripartite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian, Saudi and Syrian
leaders will hold a three-way summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on
Saturday to discuss the latest developments in the Middle East
following last week's Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
The summit grouping Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Saudi
King Fahd and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad is aimed at
strengthening Arab coordination to protect the Arab-Israeli peace
process in accordance with the land-for-peace principle and ensure
the implementation of Palestinian-Israeli peace agreements,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The victory of ring-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu in the
Israeli election for premiership has drawn concern from the Arab
world over the future of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said during his election campaign that he would take
a tougher line than incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
Israel's peace negotiations with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, sources in Riyadh said that Mubarak, King
Fahd and Assad will meet next week in the Saudi Red Sea port city
of Jeddah. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have intensified their consultations after
Netanyahu was elected new Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mubarak met with Assad in Cairo for talks on the
fate of the regional peace process. The summit meeting came just
one day after Assad discussed the same topic with his Lebanese
counterpart Elias Hrawi in Latakia, Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi, Egyptian and Syrian foreign ministers met in Riyadh
today to formulate a common stance toward developments in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat are scheduled to meet in the Jordanian Red
Sea resort of Aqaba to discuss the Mideast peace.

<HEADLINE> NATO Ministers Meet Primakov on Improving Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Berlin, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the 16 NATO
member countries met early this morning with their Russian
counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, in Berlin in a bid to improve
NATO-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
NATO sources said there were signs that Moscow might be willing
to improve ties despite its continued objection to NATO's eastward
 expansion.
</P>
<P>
"There are some good signs... Primakov has said he would like
regular contacts," said a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
Russia has signalled recently that while it still opposes NATO
plans on eastward expansion, it realizes that the alliance will
eventually take in several countries in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's major concern, said diplomats, is to make sure the
Baltic republics are not admitted and that no NATO troops or
nuclear weapons be stationed on the land of its new members.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Russia signed the PfP (Partnership for Peace)
Individual Partnership Program with NATO, as well as a program for
a broad, enhanced dialogue with NATO beyond PfP.
</P>
<P>
Since then no major progress has been made on the promise of a
special relationship with NATO to reflect Russia's power, although
Russian troops are serving with the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was due to lunch with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher on Tuesday, on the sidelines of the ministerial
meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council which brings
together NATO members with their former Warsaw Pact foes.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers agreed at a meeting on Monday that plans
to take in new members from Eastern Europe remained in track.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are widely expected to
be in the first wave, although no decisions on "who and when" will
be made before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Before the NATO meeting with Primakov, foreign ministers from
the five-nation "Contact Group" of major powers which coordinate
policy on Bosnia met to review the prospects for the country's
first post-war elections.
</P>
<P>
No details of the contact group meeting were immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
However, it was agreed on Monday by the 16 NATO foreign
ministers that NATO force in Bosnia would not start withdrawing
until after the elections in September.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Activity Remains Weak in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing experienced
its biggest decline for more than 3.5 years last month as
factories, stuck with large stocks and falling orders, cut back on
production and staff.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest monthly purchasing managers' survey,
conducted by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply,
found that the purchasing managers' index, which brings together
information on output, orders, employment, stocks and prices, fell
from 48.2 in April to 47.1 in May. Any reading below 50 indicates
a decline.
</P>
<P>
This represented the fourth consecutive monthly fall in
manufacturing activity and also the largest monthly contraction
since September 1992.
</P>
<P>
The weakness facing most sectors of manufacturing has spread to
consumer goods industries for the first time this year by a sharp
slowdown in output and demand for consumer goods although the
consumer goods sector remained the strongest area of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The employment index shows its sharpest drop since March 1993.
The survey said that pessimism about future demand and concern
over stockpiles of unsold goods were the main reasons for 17
percent of the firms surveyed cutting jobs.
</P>
<P>
In spite of production cutbacks, stocks of unsold goods still
rose in a fifth of all companies, leaving overall levels of stocks
almost unchanged. This suggests that manufacturing, already in
technical recession, could continue to contract until autumn, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices fell for the seventh consecutive month,
underlining the remoteness of any inflation pressure coming from
industry.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weakness of manufacturing, analysts believe that
base interest rates will be left unchanged at 6 percent Wednesday
at the monthly monetary meeting between the chancellor, Kenneth
Clarke, and Bank of England governor Eddie George because of
apparent buoyancy in consumer sectors.

<HEADLINE> First American Oil Company Opens Business in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A major American oil company,
Caltex, opened its first retail station here today after a 20-year
absence.
</P>
<P>
Caltex is the first American oil company to enter the petroleum
retail business in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
John Raeside, general manager of the Caltex Cambodia Limited,
told reporters that Caltex plans to invest 20 million U.S. dollars
in Cambodia in the coming years to build a supply and distribution
system and a retail network of 20 petrol stations in Phnom Penh
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Caltex will take nearly 10 percent of Cambodia's oil market in
a few years, Raeside said.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Caltex's investment is a marine terminal at
Sihanoukville scheduled for completion by mid 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
High-quality products at internationally competitive prices
will be imported through the terminal from Caltex's refineries in
Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia consumes 11,000 barrels of oil daily and 650,000 tons
a year.
</P>
<P>
Caltex, a 50/50 joint venture between two major American
multinationals -- Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc., is one of the
largest producers of petroleum products in the Asia-Pacific
region. It plans to invest up to 8 billion dollars over the next
five years, mainly in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Cotton Output Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cotton crop in
the 1995/96 year is estimated at 214,286 bales, or 57,200 tons,
2.3 percent up on the estimate given this April, the Cotton Board
said today.
</P>
<P>
The estimate released by the board in Pretoria is more than
100,000 bales up on the final crop last season, when the yield was
112,000 bales, or 22,400 tons.
</P>
<P>
Board Secretary Abel Stoltz said late rains, especially in the
Northern Cape area, could affect the quality of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Stoltz said harvesting is now in full swing and 10 percent of
the crop have been ginned.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's local cotton consumption is around 80,000 tons
annually and South Africa has only twice produced enough cotton
for local consumption, during 1989/90 and 1990/91.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Set Up Sport Drug Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) --The South African government is
discussing plans for a statutory body to combat the use of banned
drugs in sport, Sport and Recreation Minister Steve Tshwete said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly's Committee on Sport in Cape
Town, Tshwete said there are reservations about the cost of
setting up the body to be known as the South African Institute
for Drug Free Sport.
</P>
<P>
However, Tshwete said this kind of reasoning is ''out of
order''. The private sector should feel free to contribute in
cash, and if they do, the financial hurdle to the establishment
of the institute could be overcome easily, he added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is one of the few countries that do not have this
kind of state-supported facility.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete said the planned institute, with a staff of about
five, will provide leadership in developing a national strategy
on drugs in sport.
</P>
<P>
It will set up a centralized drug sampling and testing program
to subject all competitors to spot drug testing in and out of
competition.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete hoped that legislation on the new body will be
passed by parliament this year.

<HEADLINE> WHO Announces New Measure to Guarantee Vaccines' Potency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
announced today that a new measure will be introduced to equip
all oral polio vaccines with heat-sensitive labels in order to
make sure their effectiveness at the moment they are taken.
</P>
<P>
The labels, called "vaccine vial monitors," can register a
gradual color change with exposure to heat, the main factor which
effects polio vaccine potency. They will enable health workers to
know whether the polio vaccine has been damaged by heat, and to
decide whether to discard it or save it for further use if still
potent, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge step forward in terms of immunization of
children. Use of polio vaccines with vaccine vial monitors will
hasten worldwide polio eradication efforts," said Jong Wook Lee,
director of the WHO Global Program for Vaccines and Immunization.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the polio vaccine is the first to be
supplied with vaccine vial monitors because it is the most
heat-sensitive of the vaccines. If it goes well, the monitors will
gradually be introduced on other vaccines, beginning with measles
vaccine, possibly as soon as late 1997 or early 1998.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlord Says Power Struggles Lead to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- General Roosevelt Johnson, leader of
the Ulimo-J, one of the warring factions in Liberia, said today
that the cause of the recent fighting in Monrovia was power
struggles.
</P>
<P>
The former agriculture minister, who was later sacked for
disobedience, said the murder charges against him were the
''smoke screens'' by Charles Taylor and Aihaji Kromah, another
two Liberian warlords who have formed an alliance against
Johnson, according to a press release of Johnson issued today in
Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
''To be frank, we never committed any murder, the charges are
made by Taylor and Kromah to get rid of me,'' said Johnson, who
has been prevented from going back to Monrovia '' for security
reasons'' by the Ghanaian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Johnson flied to the Ghanaian capital in early May to attend
the west African mediation summit meeting on Liberia, which was
boycotted by major warlords of the country and shunned by most of
the heads of state and government in the region, at the hight of
the fighting in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The general has since remained in Accra. The Ghanaian
authorities has said this would help the peace process in
liberia.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, instead, accused Taylor and Kromah of committing the
murder crimes against his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
''The people that Taylor and Kromah sent to assassinate us
committed the shooting in which one of their terrorists got
killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''The combined forces attacked my home in central Monrovia as
well as the barracks of my forces at around 3 o'clock a.m. on
April 6 when we were all at sleep," said the general.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said although he had been sacked by Taylor and Kromah,
they could not get him out of the political scene in Monrovia.
Both Taylor and Kromah are vice-chairmen of the Council of State,
the interim government installed last September following the
signing of the Abuja Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
''That's why they decided to use bombs and guns,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Ealier, the general accused the Ghanaian authorities of
trying to hold him hostage by preventing him from returning to
liberia after the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
He declined an asylum offer from the Economic Community of the
West African States (ECOWAS), saying it was Taylor who should
have been given the asylum offer.
</P>
<P>
''I told them I never committed any crime and I feel more safe
back in Liberia then anytwhere else in this world. But they
refused to send me back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the ECOWAS authority had held Johnson in Accra
to avoid further escalation of hostilities in Liberia, which has
been calm down with a new ceasefire installed in mid-May,.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers loyal to Johnson and the alliance of Taylor and
Kromah have withdrawn from the capital, where the west African
peacekeeping forces, the ECOMOG, have taken full control.
</P>
<P>
Military observers are now optimistic about the peace
prospects of the country torn apart by over six years of civil
war. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Chief Negotiator Says Foodstuff Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's chief
negotiator in talks with the U.N. on an oil-for-food deal, said
that Iraq was about to finalize the plan for foodstuff importation
and distribution.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iraqi al-Qadissiya daily today, Anbari
said that the sanctions committee of the U.N. Security Council has
started to prepare the measures required to implement the
oil-for-food memorandum of understanding signed between Iraq and
the U.N. last month.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the sanctions committee would finish the work
within seven or 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil institutions, including al-Bakr and Khour
al-Zubair ports, have prepared all requirements needed to start
exporting oil, he said, adding that the Iraqi pipeline to the
Turkish Yamour Talik port is full and ready to pump oil.
</P>
<P>
He said that the distribution of foodstuffs following the oil
export will be done quickly all over the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the continuation of the U.N. sanctions imposed
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait contradicts with the
economic interests of other countries and the basic principles of
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rasheed left here Monday evening for Vienna to attend the
ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) due to start on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Releases Discussion Document on Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A discussion document on
South Africa's foreign policy to ensure broad consultation and
greater transparency was released today by Foreign Affairs
Minister Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs
Committee in Cape Town, Nzo said members of the committee and
other concerned sectors of the society had been ''clamouring for
the publication of a green paper'' on South Africa's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who has been under increasing criticism for his
department's apparent lack of any co-ordinated policy on
international relations, said the 33-page document had been
correctly designated as a discussion document ''precisely because
foreign policy is not static, it is a process that is in a state
of dynamic motion''.
</P>
<P>
It had to be borne in mind that South Africa is no longer an
island surrounded by a hostile world as it perceived itself in
the past, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1994 democratic elections, South Africa had been
pursuing a policy of good neighbourliness through the South
African Development Community, the Orgnisation of African Unity,
the Non-Aligned Movement, the United Nations and several other
regional and international organisations, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that South Africa intended to do its utmost to
work in concert with these various fora.
</P>
<P>
He said the document had been designed to stimulate a debate
to assist government in the formulation of its foreign policy and
was the result of policy planning sessions both in South Africa
and overseas.

WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Two American Navy fliers
accidentally shot down by a Japanese destroyer in the Pacific
earlier today were in good condition, the White House and the U.S.
Pacific Fleet said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to reporters' question about the accident, U.S.
President Bill Clinton said as he boarded a helicopter on the

<HEADLINE> Release of Opposition Party Officials Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Labor Party today urged
the release of top officials of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) who were detained by police in the past
few days, according to a report of Zambia News Agency (ZANA).
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted the Labor Party Chairman, Chibesa Mfuni, as saying
that police should stop harassing the opposition and treating
responsible citizens as common criminals.
</P>
<P>
Mfuni was referring to the arrests of some UNIP leading
members by police that suspected the former of being in
connection with a secret organization the Black Mamba.
</P>
<P>
The police charged the Black Mamba with responsibility for the
recent bomb blasts in the country. UNIP leader and former
president Kenneth Kaunda has denied any link of himself and his
party with the Black Mamba group.
</P>
<P>
Mfuni said that the arrests of the UNIP officials in
connection with the Black Mamba were highly handed and
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
He accused the ruling movement for Multi-Party Democracy of
using police to fight political battles with opposition, saying
his party was aware that after dealing with UNIP, the government
would target other smaller parties in the country.

<HEADLINE> New MTS Package Offered, US Remains Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States today continued to
refuse to make an offer though 24 parties to the talks on Maritime
Transport Services underway here presented a new package of offers
in an effort to bring the talks to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the talks after a senior-level
meeting at which the package was presented, the U.S. said it was
not impressed by the contents and, after the initial review, it
could not see any reason to recommend a change in its position.
</P>
<P>
At the last meeting on May 24, the United States made a
statement saying it was not satisfied with the offers from most of
the 42 participants (with the European Union as one), and its
market will be kept as open in future just as it is now.
</P>
<P>
The package today under the EU initiative is conditional on a
matching offer from the United States, expiring in 10 days during
which the U.S. is expected to reconsider its position.
</P>
<P>
It contains new and improved offers across all areas concerning
maritime transport services and covers commitments on multi-model
services in response to a U.S. proposal last summer for including
the multi-model commitments in services sector talks.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the meeting stressed the importance of the
successful conclusion of the maritime talks underway, the last of
the three talks on the services sector left over from the Uruguay
Round of multilateral free trading talks under the former GATT.
</P>
<P>
He said very limited progress was made in the first two
negotiations, referring to the partial success in financial and
telecommunications services talks last year due to the U.S.
dissatisfaction with offers from other countries.
</P>
<P>
It was absolutely crucial to overcome the latent, negative
perception held by the services industries that the system may not
be able to address the problems in the services sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the package offered today was a significant development
in the progressive liberalization of the maritime transport
services market.
</P>
<P>
The United States however stressed that the ministerial
decision of the Uruguay Round did not refer to a progressive
liberalization, as several delegations talked about.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, parties joining the package expressed the hope
that the collective move would be matched by a constructive and
concrete response in a formal, comprehensive U.S. offer. They
added that they were looking forward to the U.S. reconsideration
of its position.
</P>
<P>
Japan stressed its new commitments on multi-model services in
its revised offer in the package, and said that it was regretful
that that one major country did not show sign yet to make an
offer.
</P>
<P>
After the EU repeatedly urged it at the meeting to examine the
new package and consider carefully, the U.S. reiterated that it
was extremely unlikely that the package would lead to an offer
from it.
</P>
<P>
It added that it was time to consider the suggestion of Canada,
who said that they should do some contingency planning in case no
expected response would come from the Americans.
</P>
<P>
The maritime transport services talks are scheduled to be
concluded at the end of June. The next meeting is expected to be
held Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 24 parties to the package are: Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Columbia, the Dominican Republic, the EU, Hong
Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Proposes 15-billion-Dollar Fund for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today proposed to
provide 15 billion U.S. dollars in new funding for urban housing
and environmental improvement in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Caio Koch-Weser, the managing director of the World Bank, told
a press conference here that the move is designed to support basic
social services, clean-up the urban environment and ensure local
finance.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank plans to triple spending on the urban sector to
15 billion U.S. dollars over the next five years. But if the
developing countries require more than that sum, the funds
available from the Bank could go higher, he added.
</P>
<P>
Koch-Weser did not elaborate which countries should benefit
from the proposed fund.
</P>
<P>
He added that the World Bank's support will depend on the
developing countries' formulation of the kind of strategic
frameworks necessary to reduce poverty in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent World Bank report, the worst slums in the
world can be turned into far more livable communities with the
combination of community involvement, the right government
policies and investments of about 100 U.S. dollars per person.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the largest international financier of urban
projects, is one of the international organizations attending the
on-going United Nations Second Conference on Human Settlements
(HABITAT II), also known as the "City Summit."

LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A non-government organization of
Zambia called here today for a dialogue between the Zambian
government and opposition parties for the peace of the country.
</P>
<P>
Bishop John Mambo of the Foundation for Democratic Process
(FODEP) said his organization is closely following the political
development in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said there is still time for a dialogue and urged the
conflicting parties to accommodate each other's views for the
benefit of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bishop also called on the government to keep its promise
to guarantee freedom of speech.
</P>

However, the bishop declined to go into detail on what is the
political development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Several senior leaders of the biggest opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda
were arrested on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The police suspected them of masterminding the recent bomb
explosions in Lusaka and the northern city of Ndola and being
behind a secret group called "Black Mamba", which is opposed to
the constitution amendment bill signed into law by President
Frederick Chiluba at the end of last month. The bill bars Kaunda
from contesting the presidency in the general elections to be

OTTAWA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
will visit Canada from June 10 to 14, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien announced today.
</P>
<P>
Describing Mexico as among Canada's closest trading partners
and political allies, Chretien said Zedillo's visit "provides an
excellent opportunity" for both countries to expand their
co-operation and "explore new directions for the future."
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Chretien and Zedillo are expected to discuss the
U.S. Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to impose tough economic
sanctions against the Caribbean island of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The act has incurred strong opposition from Canada and Mexico,
both of which has accused the United States of violating the

The benefits of the NAFTA partnership for the two countries and
their mutual concerns about reform of the United Nations will also
be on the agenda of Zedillo's visit here in the Canadian capital.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Mexican president will also visit
Canada's largest city of Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.

LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A German aid agency today supplied
some 200 tons of relief items to Liberia, Radio Nigeria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The consignment comprising rice and medical supplies, was
offered by the German Emergency Doctors, a newly formed aid
agency.

The agency spokesman, Rupert Nuedeck told Liberian Health
Ministry officials that the people of Germany were concerned over

</P>
<P>
Devastated by a civil war ignited in 1989, Liberia suffered a
further blow this year when security in the supposed safe havens
of the capital, Monrovia, collapsed as factional fighters clashed
throughout most of April and May.
</P>
<P>
The fighting led most foreign aid agencies to drastically
reduce their staff in Liberia or to pull out of the country
entirely.
</P>
<P>
Nuedeck said more personnel from German Emergency Doctors were
expected to arrive in Liberia in the next couple of months to
carry out relief work in the west African state.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syria Intensifies Contacts with Arab States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Soon after the right-wing Likud
leader Benjamin Netanyahu emerged victorious in the Israeli
elections, Syria has embarked on series of contacts with some Arab
states for consultations and coordination of positions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad paid a brief visit
to Egypt where he held talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. The two leaders urged caution toward the result of
Israeli elections and called on Arab countries to seek a united
front in dealing with the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Assad told reporters in Cairo he refused to commit to peace
talks with Israel until he learned more about the positions of the
new Israeli premier.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Mubarak, Assad had phoned his Lebanese
counterpart Elias Hrawi and then the two presidents held talks in
Damascus on Sunday to discuss the latest situation.
</P>
<P>
Serious concern prevails the region since Netanyahu's victory,
particularly over his campaign promises to take a harder line in
negotiations with the Syrians and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Syria's intensive contacts with Arab
leaders were aimed at promoting Arab solidarity in face of the
coming challenges, particularly the prospective stringent policy
to be pursued by the rightist Likud bloc.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Netanyahu has repeatedly said during his
elections campaign that he would trade peace for peace rather than
land for peace and he would refuse to withdraw Israeli troops from
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has always demanded the return of the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as part of any
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Syria's deep concern about the Likud attitude
towards the Golan, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa said
last week that he who claims the possibility of security and peace
while, at the same time, maintaining his grip on the Golan and
other occupied Arab territories, is an advocate of war rather than
peace.
</P>
<P>
"Adoption of such a policy will certainly undermine the chances
of peace in the region," al-Sharaa said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has also strengthened its partnership with Lebanon, whose
negotiation with Israel are also deadlocked, to improve its edge
in the coming talks with Israel, with the ultimate objective of
restoring the Golan, south Lebanon and other occupied Arab
territories.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Make Progress on Ulster Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish ministers have
indicated that they have made "substantial" progress towards
achieving an agenda for the all-party talks on the political
future of Northern Ireland due to start later this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after meeting Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring this morning, British Ulster
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said it has been a "very good
morning" and "there are certain matters that we wish to refer to
heads of government."
</P>
<P>
Spring, who had to break off his talks with Mayhew to meet
visiting Irish President Mary Robinson, said "we have made
substantial progress."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, who met hours after the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) guerillas said they were unlikely to call a new
ceasefire ahead of the all-party talks, are expected to hold
another round of talks later this evening.
</P>
<P>
An IRA source told the BBC radio in Belfast that the
possibility of a new ceasefire was remote.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the IRA statement, the Downig Street today
reaffirmed the British stand that Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, would not be allowed to attend the peace talks unless
there was an "unequivocal" ceasefire by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The IRA broke a 17-month truce in February with the first of a
new series of bomb attacks in London and the British government
has since declared that Sinn Fein would be barred from the
all-party peace talks under the current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments are trying to reach agreement
over the timetable for decommissioning of terrorist arms and also
the peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.

LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat today called on British businessmen to make
much-needed investments to the impoverished West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with British business leaders here this
morning, President Arafat said that since the infrastructure
facilities of the Palestine territory have been utterly destroyed,
"we are staring from below zero."
</P>
<P>
"Our own business people have already started a program of
investment in Palestine. We would like to see you make contact
with them," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here on Monday for a two-day visit to
Britain, that "we need your help and support in all fields, we
need to build the whole infrastructure -- roads, schools,
hospitals, telecommunications and sewage and power plants."
</P>
<P>
The West Bank and Gaza strip might need to build as many as
470,000 new homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in a free market economy, not controlled and
regulated by the state and I am dreaming of a Middle East
Singapore in Palestine," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, President held separate talks with
British Prime Minister John Major and Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine, and exchanged views on bilateral relations and
the Middle East peace Process.

"They share one common feature, whether they come from
developed or developing countries. They present the changes of
the ways in defining problems and search for solutions in true
partnership ..." said Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the U.N. chief, at
the ceremony.

<P>
During the disastrous flood of 1991 in China's Anhui Province,
one-half million families were made completely homeless and a
total of 2.78 million rooms were lost.
</P>
<P>
Anhui Province adopted a unified planning strategy that
incorporated the victims themselves, the wider society and the
state itself in order to accelerate and consolidate the
reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
In terms of project implementations, the construction of
winter shelters was actively tied into the construction of
permanent housing.
</P>
<P>
Steps were also taken to reduce the randomness of traditional
building styles which scattered a few thatched huts over wide
tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
Post-disaster reconstruction has improved the look of villages
and had integrated housing construction with the development of
the "courtyard economy."

The awarding was one of the most important events during
the on-going Second United Nations on Human Settlements (HABITAT
II) in Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> New York City's Private hospitals in Deep Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK June 4 (Xinhua) -- New York City's private hospitals
have plunged into deep financial crisis due to sharp Medicaid cuts
and the rise of health maintenance organizations, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of private hospitals are planning large-scale layoffs
next month, which is described as a concrete signal that the
long-predicted financial crisis for the region's private hospitals
has finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
Some of private hospitals announced this month their intention
to lay off 517 workers, a marked increase over recent rate of a
few dozen a month.
</P>
<P>
Calling the layoffs "early signs" of hospitals in jeopardy,
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York hospital
Association was quoted as saying that some of the city's 80
private hospitals could close in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
According to the mass-circulated newspaper, public hospitals
have also been plagued by two years of 100 million u.s. dollars in
Medicaid cuts and rapid growth of health maintenance
organizations. Public hospitals in the New York City have recently
announced 1800 layoffs of workers next month.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, General Accounting Office warned in
recent report that the stability of the Clinton Administration's
hospital program is at risk because more than 80 percent of its
hospital business is in New York.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Speaker Supports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik said today that the Serb side would do all they
can to ensure that elections in Bosnia are held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official comment from a senior Serb leader on
the Geneva conference on Sunday which set the date of September 14
as the latest date for a general elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Republika Srpska would "do all in its power to make the
elections hold as scheduled" under the Dayton agreement as "there
is no reason to block them," Tanjug news agency quoted him as
saying in Pale, the Serb stronghold near Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting with special U.N. Envoy Igbal
Riza who is visiting Pale for talks with Serb leaders.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik's talks with Riza centered on the holding of
elections in Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb entity, and
prepartions for the conference on Bosnia scheduled for June 13 and
14 in Florence, Italy, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the international community had to have a better
feeling for cooperation and should not make hasty moves without
agreement with the Serbs, "because this could lead to incidents."

<HEADLINE> Medicare Debate Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Democrats and Republicans in the
U.S. Congress Tuesday exchanged rhetoric even before the Medicare
trustees are to report Wednesday that the system's hospital fund
is going broke faster than previously expected.
</P>
<P>
Democrats accused Republicans of "using" the report. House
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt told reporters Democrats know
Medicare needs big adjustments to curb its spiraling growth rate
but have offered "real bipartisan solutions," while Republicans
seek to "raid Medicare to lavish more tax cuts on the people who
don't need them."
</P>
<P>
Republicans have criticized Democrats for politicizing the
Medicare issue with the approach of national elections, and have
devised a public relations strategy designed to scare senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in an appearance Sunday on NBC's
"Meet the Press," accused President Bill Clinton of "scaring"
seniors about "cuts," when the Republican was actually increasing
the amount of money spent per beneficiary leading up to the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat, said Tuesday that
Gingrich was trying to lull seniors into a false sense of
security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking elsewhere in the Capitol, Gingrich said Tuesday he
expected Congress would pass a new Medicare reform bill this
summer that specifically targets waste, fraud and abuse in the
program.
</P>
<P>
"We are very prepared to work with the president on a bill to
save Medicare," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is the federal health care insurance program for
people 65 and older.
</P>
<P>
Dick Davidson, the president of the American Hospital
Association, said that partisan political factions aren't likely
to fix the program and that an independent citizens commission
should be established to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats have been debating Medicare "and
demonizing one another," Davidson said. "That hasn't served the
American people."
</P>
<P>
The new report, he said, "will tell us what we knew last year:
The situation gets worse and worse."
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Medicare trustees predicted the hospital fund
would be broke by 2002. Preliminary reports from the trustees
since then and an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office
now predict bankruptcy by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Medicare costs about 200 billion dollars a year and is composed
of two funds: Part A pays for hospital expenses and is fed by
payroll taxes on working Americans, Medicare Part B pays for
doctors visits. It gets money from monthly premiums paid by
Medicare beneficiaries and the federal Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The problem is Part A. Although it still has a large surplus,
it's expenses began to exceed its income in 1995 because of rising
health costs and a larger elderly population.
</P>
<P>
The White House and Republican-controlled Congress are not far
apart on fixing Part B with budget proposals to reduce spending.
But Part A remains an area of dispute.

LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The police confirmed today the
shooting of Dudirat Abiola, wife of the detained Nigerian
opposition leader, Moshood Abiola.
</P>

A report made by the Lagos Police Command shows that
