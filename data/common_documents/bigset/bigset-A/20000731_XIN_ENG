<HEADLINE> Hasina's Malaysia Trip to Promote Trade, Investment: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina will leave here for Kuala Lumpur Monday morning to hold
talks with Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohammad for enhanced trade
and investment, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told a press
conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, officially disclosing the Hasina's
itinerary, said the prime minister's visit has diplomatic
significance in the backdrop of Malaysian Ambassador to the United
Nations becoming the chairperson of U.N. Security Council in
August and the imminent millennium summit of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Increase of Malaysian investment and expansion of bilateral
trade will figure prominently in the official talks between the
prime ministers of the two countries, Azad said, adding that they
would also emphasize on the export of more Bangladeshi labors to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the third largest investor in Bangladesh, employs
some 150,000 Bangladeshis and the remittance from Malaysia to this
country amounted to 67.52 million U.S. dollars in 1998-1999 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Manpower Minister M.A. Mannan, State Minister for
Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and a 35-member business

<HEADLINE> Dalian Edge Defending Champions Shandong 3-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Shide took a morale-
boosting victory Sunday as they edged defending champions Shandong
Luneng 3-2 in an away match in the 19th round of the Chinese first
division soccer league.
</P>
<P>
Shide, previously known as Wanda, have never lost to Shandong,
who won a double of the league and the cup titles last season,
since the pro league was launched in China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Striker Yan Song hit the target twice in the 45th and 53th
minute of Sunday's game played in Jinan, Shandong Province, to
give Dalian a 2-0 lead. Dalian crushed Shandong 5-0 in their
first meeting earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaopeng put the home team back to the game with a 55th-
minute penalty, and Dalian striker Hao Haidong's miss of a penalty
three minutes later was booed by the 40,000 Shandong fans.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes before time, Miodrag Pantelic sealed the victory
with a fast break goal. Li Xiaopeng converted his second penalty
in the injury time but that was not enough to save the hosts from
a loss.
</P>
<P>
Dalian maintain a confortable seven-point lead over second-
placed Shanghai Shenhua on the standings with 45 points from 14
wins, three draws and two losses. Shandong (11 wins, 5 draws, 3
losses) are third with 35.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua, second on 38 points, remain a threat to Shide
's title bid after a 2-1 home win over Xiamen Xiaxin on goals from
two Yugoslavian forwards, Sasa Racha and Zoran Rankovic.
</P>
<P>
Last season's runners-up Liaoning Fushun failed to break clear
the relegation zone after losing 1-0 to Sichuan Quanxing on the
road. Liaoning are among the bottom three with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other games, Shenzhen Ping'an beat at home Beijing
Guo'an 2-0, Qingdao Hainiu were held to a goalless draw by bottom-
ranked Jilin Aodong in Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Longxin grabbed one point on a 2-2 away draw with
Yunnan Hongta, while Tianjin Taida beat the visiting Shenyang
Haishi 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, U.S. Expected to Sign Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the United States are
expected to sign a free trade agreement by August or early
September, said Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
State for Economic Affairs Mohammad Halayqah on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after meeting with visiting U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefesky, who arrived here on Sunday for
discussions over the free trade pact.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they agreed to pursue efforts to solve
issues regarding the free trade agreement after reviewing steps
taken so far in the field of environmental protection, labor laws,
services and customs reduction.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that they should sign the projected free
trade agreement in August or at the beginning of September.
Halayqah said the agreement will be submitted to U.S. Congress for
ratification, possibly at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to continue discussion with the U.S. experts who
are still in Amman if some issues remain unsettled or might hold
another round of talks either through satellite conferences or
through dispatching a Jordanian delegation to Washington before the
end of August," Halayqah said.
</P>
<P>
The free trade pact is expected to create a qualitative leap in
Jordanian exports as they will be given duty free access to the
huge market in the U.S., Halayqah said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the great economic benefits to Jordan such as
increasing and diversifying exports, improving the trade balance
and developing joint investment, the agreement will be the
strongest possible message to Jordanian and American investors,
Halayqah said.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance is largely in favor of the U.S., but there are
indicators showing an increase in Jordan's exports to the U.S. due
the Qualifying Industrial Zones in the kingdom which enjoy duty
free exports to the U.S. market under previous trade agreements,
Halayqah said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Chile To Carry Out Joint Naval Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The navies of Argentina and

joint naval drill since 1998, when both countries made a vow
towards regional integration.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between Greek-Turkish Foreign Ministers Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A planned meeting between Greek
and Turkish foreign ministers, George Papandreou and Ismail Cem,
late August has been called off.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted diplomatic
circles here as saying late Monday that the cancellation was
attributed to the need for better preparation for the meeting,
which is now expected to take place on the sidelines of the annual
U.N. General Assembly in New York in September.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 26 years over their territorial disputes
in the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two
neighboring countries have since last June taken steps to improve
their strained relations by the holding of several rounds of low-
level talks and the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation
agreements.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Turkish Foreign Minister Cem said
Monday that the rapprochement between the two countries was not
superficial because they had signed nine important agreements
which included cooperation on issues of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey was ready to discuss matters concerning
the Aegean Sea, within the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, the Turkish minister said that he
himself never regarded Cyprus as being a common problem for Greece
and Turkey and he never raised it in his talks with his Greek
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Viewing the Cyprus issue as being an obstacle in the
development of relations between the two countries, Greece has
insisted that Greek-Turkish relations can not be normalized until
the final resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Panos Beglitis
welcomed the statements made by U.N. chief Kofi Annan and U.S.
permanent representative in the U.N. Richard Halbrooke, saying
that they were very important and timely as the talks between the
two communities on Cyprus held under the auspices of the U.N. were
in progress.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican Party Adopts Platform for 2000 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican Party
adopted its platform for 2000 election here Monday at the National
Convention, vowing to win back the White House for "Renewing
America's Purpose Together".
</P>
<P>
Delegates ratified the platform as one of the first orders of
business at the convention that will hand Texas Governor George W.
Bush the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party's platform of policy principles retains
its hard-line positions on abortion, gay rights and sexual
education, but it eases some stands on education and immigration,
dropping calls for abolishing the Education Department and setting
a more welcoming tone for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"To all Americans, particularly immigrants and minorities, we
send a clear message: This is the party of freedom and progress,
and it is your home," The platform says.
</P>
<P>
The platform's preamble says it is the Republican Party's
mission to "advance the founding principles of freedom and limited
government, and the dignity and worth of every individual."
</P>
<P>
Reminding Americans that Republicans are the party of Abraham
Lincoln, the platform describes the party's nominee-to-be Bush as
"a leader who brings people together" and who can meet the
challenges facing the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fighting over the legacy of today's economic development, the
platform claims that "inspired by Presidents Reagan and Bush,
Republicans hammered into place the framework for today's
prosperity and surpluses."
</P>
<P>
The platform endorses the principles of Governor Bush's
education reform and promises to make "dramatic and swift
improvement" in education so that no American is left behind.
</P>
<P>
"Under his leadership, the Republican Party commits itself to
bold reforms in education, to make every school a place of
learning and achievement for every child," it says.
</P>
<P>
"Our platform gives every American the tools to climb the
ladder of opportunity," Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, the
platform chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Republican National Convention opened here Monday
to nominate Bush and former defense secretary Dick Cheney as the
party's presidential and vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Today begins day one of the Bush-Cheney era," declared Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the four-day meeting would be "a different
kind of convention for a different kind of Republican."

<HEADLINE> 1999 United Nations Disarmament Yearbook Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
announced the release of the 1999 United Nations Disarmament
Yearbook, which focuses on the actions and reactions of the world
community to the entire range of disarmament issues.
</P>
<P>
The reference work also provides an overview of regional
developments as they reflect concerns at the global level, said
the U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
The Yearbook, a publication of the U.N. Department of
Disarmament Affairs, includes information on nuclear disarmament
and nonproliferation issues, biological and chemical weapons,
conventional weapons issues and regional disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The 419-page Yearbook, published in English, also offers
information on steps that Member States have taken to confront the
dangerous proliferation of small arms and light weapons, leading
to their decision in the U.N. General Assembly to convene the
United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms in
2001.
</P>
<P>
The Yearbook touches on how different approaches to nuclear
disarmament played themselves out in the Conference on Disarmament
and the Third Preparatory Committee for the 2000 Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference, effectively thwarting
substantive progress in those two crucial forums during the year.
</P>
<P>
The Yearbook includes the guidelines agreed upon by all Member
States of the United Nations Disarmament Commission on the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and on conventional
arms control and disarmament, with emphasis on the consolidated of
peace.
</P>
<P>
The Yearbook is designed as a handy reference book for
diplomats, researchers and the interested public. It comprises a
succinct narrative account of the above-mentioned subjects and
others, a brief account of all explanations of vote in the First
Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which is in
charge of disarmament affairs, an index and extensive appendices.
</P>
<P>
The appendices provide data on the status of multilateral and
regional disarmament agreements and the text of the Convention on
Transparency in Conventional Weapons Acquisitions concluded by the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
They also reproduce the texts of all General Assembly
resolutions and decisions on disarmament, list their sponsors and
indicate the overall voting results and the positions of each
Member State on each resolution.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Begins Public Hearing on Sierra Leone Diamonds (Updated with more information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
committee that monitors sanctions against the Sierra Leonean
rebels Monday began a public hearing from July 31 to August 1 to
probe the link between the illicit sale of diamonds from the west
African nation and arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The two-day hearing, first of its kind, was requested in a
July 15 Security Council resolution imposing an embargo on diamond
exports from Sierra Leone for at least 18 months, unless the gems
are sold under a government certification system.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of interested states and regional
organizations, as well as of the diamond industry, will be invited
to take part in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Interested states listed by the U.N. spokesman, in addition to
Sierra Leone, include all other members of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) as well as Angola, Belgium, India,
Israel, Liberia and South Africa. Sierra Leone is an ECOWAS member.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, representatives of the diamond industry testify
before members of the Sanctions Committee, and on Tuesday, experts
in weapons, aviation as well as government officials from African
nations discuss ways to stop the trade in illicit diamonds and how
to bring peace to the war-torn Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
An extensive U.N. investigation earlier this year found that
Angola's rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) raised millions of dollars through the sale of illicit
diamonds to buy weapons and other war material.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, India and Israel are important diamond-cutting
centers while South Africa is a major diamond producer.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Sierra Leone sanctions committee is
Anwarul Chowdhury, the permanent representative of Bangladesh to
the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends Less in Fiscal 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank committed 15.3
billion U.S. dollars in loans and credits to developing countries
in fiscal year 2000, which ended on June 30, much lower than the
29 billion dollars in fiscal year 1999, the bank announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The global economic recovery contributed strongly to the
trends in World Bank lending over the last year as successful
economic reforms in many emerging markets restored their access to
international capital markets," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the bank's lending to crisis-affected countries --
South Korea, Argentina, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and Thailand --
fell to below 2 billion dollars in fiscal 2000, from 13 billion
dollars in fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank's disbursements in fiscal 2000 stood at 18.5 billion
dollars, down from 24 billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said the quality of lending in fiscal 2000 was
up, with the share of projects that are at risk of not achieving
their development objectives falling to an estimated 15 percent of
the total, or roughly half the rate in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Caribbean gained the largest share of the
World Bank's lending commitments during fiscal 2000, totaling 4.1
billion dollars in loans and credits, followed by the Europe and
Central Asia and the East Asia and Pacific regions with 3 billion
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia each accounted for just above
2 billion dollars, and the Middle East and North Africa for almost
1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> A New Era Begins in Venezuela: President Chavez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
said Monday that there is a change in Venezuela with the beginning
of a new era after Sunday's general elections, in which he is the
winner.
</P>
<P>
ENC, the Electoral National Council, in its Monday morning
report, said that Chavez got 56.59 percent of the votes casted,
that is, 3.134 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's main competitor, his former comrade, Francisco Arias,
got 38 percent of the votes or 2.022 million votes. Abstention
reached a 43.39 percent level (4.273 million).
</P>
<P>
The fundamental alliance of the Patriotic Pole (MVR-MAS), of
Chavez, obtained 60 percent of the National Assembly, but not the
two thirds needed to achieve the majority.
</P>
<P>
Chavez candidates beat nine opposition governors looking for re-
election in July 30 elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the ENC, Patriotic Pole alliance won in the state
of New Sparta and held Barinas, Delta Amacuro, Lara and Aragua.
All in all, Patriotic Pole got 14 out of the 23 governorships
during the elections, not including the metropolitan mayor's
office.
</P>
<P>
Arias, former governor of the state of Zulia, did not rejected
the results nor mentioned the possibility of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who will have a new six-year presidential period after
a year and a half in the Presidency, reached power with a strong
popular support from the poor.
</P>
<P>
Arias's ideas are more moderate and have a stronger support
from the entrepreneurial sector and the rich.
</P>
<P>
Anti-corruption stances and a change in the socio-economic
program to fight off poverty and unemployment, affected people
displeased at former governments and traditional parties,
virtually erased of the political environment.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan leader said that last elections baptized the new
republic born after the popular constituent process. Venezuela has
a new horizon, said Chavez, who considered Sunday elections as the
most important one in Venezuela's history, because a new,
legitimate republic has been born.
</P>
<P>
Chavez made a call to the union and reiterated his promises to
reactivate economy. He made a call to "all Venezuelans of good
will to unite, work, for only united we can recover Venezuela.
Venezuela is of everyone, we all sail in this same ship."
</P>
<P>
In a message to his competitors and to entrepreneurs, Chavez
made a call to them to put aside all lesser interests and to put
above all national interest so that Venezuela can overcome its
problems.
</P>
<P>
President Chavez said that during his next presidential term he
will put aside political confrontation to center his attention in
social and economic recovery of the country.
</P>
<P>
The President's economic recovery plan is ambitious, taking
into account the severe economic recession and the deterioration
of living conditions among Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's main challenge will be the recovery of Venezuela's
damaged economy which, last year ended with a contraction of 7.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Crime and a high unemployment level are the main problems
affecting Venezuelans.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Trade Deficit Grows in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's trade deficit increased by
nearly 20 percent during the first four months of this year as the
growth of imports outpaced that of exports, the central bank said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit climbed to 707.42 million U.S. dollars during
the first four months, 83.9 million dollars or 19.9 percent higher
than the same period of 1999, the central bank said in a bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the period amounted to 1.15 billion dollars as
against 992.6 million dollars in the same period in 1999, while
exports went up to 446.6 million dollars from 416.6 million
dollars, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's exports to Arab countries, its traditional market,
amounted to 181.3 million dollars, with Saudi Arabia topping the
importers' list with 45.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Israel almost doubled in the period, rising to 22.4
million dollars from 11.8 million dollars in the same period in
1999, despite the fact that the Jewish state is still imposing
strict security checks on Jordanian cargo trucks.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's imports from Arab countries during the four months
amounted to 320.2 million dollars, with Iraq ranking first with
goods worth 222.5 million dollars, mostly oil and oil derivatives,
followed by Saudi Arabia with 36.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports from European Union countries amounted to 372.8 million
dollars with Germany ranking first with 107.8 million dollars.

RIYADH, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia stressed Monday that

change the situation of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Saudi News Agency after a cabinet meeting in the

<HEADLINE> Barak Survives Critical No-Confidence Votes EDS - Updates with more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government Monday evening survived three no-confidence
votes in the Knesset (Parliament), which were critical political
tests for Barak after the collapsed Camp David summit with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The development may give Barak more breathing space for forming
a new and more solid majority in the Knesset and keeping pushing
forward Israeli-Arab peace process.
</P>
<P>
All the three no-confidence motions, submitted by the major
opposition Likud, Israeli Arab's United Arab List and Hadash party,
failed to win the law-required minimum 61 votes in the 120-member
parliament to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
All these motions are related, directly or indirectly, to the
summit talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, which lasted
15 days at Camp David earlier this month but finally failed to
reach any agreement on core issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem,
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset voted 50-50, with eight abstentions, on the critical
no-confidence motion brought by Likud, which protested against the
way Barak handled the talks and the concessions Barak reportedly
made at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab List and Hadash motions were filed over the
prime minister's "ignoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people" during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Since the Knesset will begin its summer recess on August 3 and
only reconvene on October 30, Monday's session was regarded as the
last chance in the next few months for the oppositions to topple
the government through no-confidence votes.
</P>
<P>
The only exception is that the Knesset could call for a special
session to vote on no-confidence motions if 61 legislators agree to
do so, which is a hard-to-meet condition because of the recess.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Barak now have three most-needed months to maneuver for
his government's survival and for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to use the time for strengthening his
government, which now is a minority government only controlling 42
seats in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
He could form a so-called national unity government with the
Likud, or resurrect a coalition with Shas, Yisrael Ba'aliya and
National Religious Party, who resigned en masse from the government
ahead of the Camp David Talks.
</P>
<P>
He could also, although less enthusiastically, form a pro-peace
minority government with left-wing Meretz, Shinui and Israeli Arab
parties.
</P>
<P>
Most important, Barak will be free to pursue his peace agenda,
without worrying about parliamentary no-confidence votes, and
maneuver behind the scenes and try to reach an Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement before this September.
</P>
<P>
With a peace accord in his hands, he may have enough confidence
to call for early elections to solve the parliamentary problem once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Barak suffered a severe blow in the Knesset
when his coalition's presidential candidate Shimon Peres was
defeated by Likud's Moshe Katsav in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected defeat made some analysts worry that the no-
confidence votes will also produce dramatic results. Another
failure of Barak will cast more clouds over the troubled Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks after the Camp David summit.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Unbiased U.S. Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday called on the United
States to play an unbiased role in the Middle East peace process,
in response to U.S. President Bill Clinton's expressed desire to
move American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the question of moving
the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem was an extremely thorny
issue. He urged all parties to avoid taking unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is still subject to negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israel, which should not be disturbed, Moussa told
reporters after meeting with U.S. envoy Edward Walker in Egypt's
town of Borg el-Arab, west of the Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the peace process and an unbiased U.S. role
require that no steps be taken which would negatively affect the
process, including what are known as unilateral actions, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Walker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, declined to comment on Clinton's declared intention.
</P>
<P>
He later held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The
U.S. official arrived in Egypt earlier in the day to brief Egyptian
officials on the 15-day talks between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the U.S. Camp David
presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day talks broke down last Tuesday without producing a
peace agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on Israeli television Friday, Clinton
said he was considering moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would imply a U.S. recognition
of Israel's claim to the city as its "eternal and indivisible
capital," a position so far never accepted by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for sustaining efforts to secure the Palestinian
people's aspirations and legitimate rights to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem, seized by Israel in
1967, as the capital of their future independent state.

JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South African Safety and
Security Minister Steve Tshwete Monday ordered two top policemen
from Pretoria to assist Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD)
investigators in their probe into the killing of African National
Congress (ANC) member Bheki Mkhize.
</P>
<P>
Mkhize, an ANC member of the National Assembly, was shot Sunday
morning during a raid on his Mahlabatini home in northern KwaZulu-
Natal by public order policemen who were searching for weapons.
</P>
<P>
A police inspector has been arrested on charge of murder and
will appear in court. The 12 other members of the team are being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
Everything possible would be done to discover the true facts
surrounding Mkhize's death and to ensure that the culprits are
brought to book, Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime I have directed that the police send a top
detective and a forensic expert from Pretoria to assist the ICD in
their investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ICD, an independent body which probes criminal allegations
against members of the South African Police Service, took over the
investigation on Sunday shortly after arriving at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The ANC in the KwaZulu-Natal province Monday morning called for
government assistance in the investigation, saying it is not
enough for the ICD to investigate.

<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah was quoted as saying
in Liberia's capital Monrovia that the government troops are in

Guinea has denied any involvement in the activities of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has declared a state of emergency in the northern region

<HEADLINE> 120 New AIDS Cases Found in Switzerland in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- 120 people were diagnosed with AIDS
in Switzerland in the first half of the year, but the number of
deaths resulting from the illness is continuing to diminish in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Health Office said on Monday that in the first six
months of the year, 89 women and 31 men were diagnosed with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
But statistics show that since 1995, the number of people dying
of AIDS has been falling. The reason for the drop is largely
because of the combination therapies used to treat people who are
HIV-positive, but who have not yet contracted full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that within the same six-month
period, the number of people testing positive for HIV rose by 243.
The total number of HIV-positive cases registered in Switzerland
since 1985 now stands at 25,667.
</P>
<P>
Between 1983 and June 2000, nearly 6,900 people in the country
were registered as having AIDS, with more than 4,900 of the cases
having resulted in death.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
committee that monitors sanctions against the Sierra Leonean
rebels Monday began a public hearing from July 31 to August 1 to
probe the link between the illicit sale of diamonds from the west
African nation and arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was requested in a July 15 Security Council
resolution imposing an embargo on diamond exports from Sierra
Leone for at least 18 months, unless the gems are sold under a
government certification system.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of interested states and regional
organizations, as well as of the diamond industry, will be invited
to take part in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Interested states listed by the U.N. spokesman, in addition to
Sierra Leone, include all other members of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) as well as Angola, Belgium, India,
Israel, Liberia and South Africa. Sierra Leone is an ECOWAS member.
</P>
<P>
An extensive U.N. investigation earlier this year found that
Angola's rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) raised millions of dollars through the sale of illicit
diamonds to buy weapons and other war material.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, India and Israel are important diamond-cutting
centers while South Africa is a major diamond producer.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says "Oil-for-Food" no Substitute for Resumption of Iraq's Normal Economic Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Benon V. Sevan, Executive
Director of the United Nations Office of Iraq's Program, said on
Monday that the "oil-for-food" program is no substitute for the
resumption of normal economic activity in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sevan made the statement prior to his fourth mission to Iraq
which will take place from August 1 to 17.
</P>
<P>
It has been 10 years since the United Nations Security Council
imposed sanctions on Iraq but only three and a half years since
the first oil was shipped out of the country under the term of the
oil-for-food program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first oil shipment, on December 10, 1996, around 1.9
billion barrels have been exported earning just under 29 billion U.
S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rate of approvals of humanitarian goods has far
outstripped the pace of supplies arriving in Iraq except for food
and health where around 75 percent of supplies approved by the
sanctions committee of the Security Council have arrived, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For agriculture 44 percent of approved supplies have arrived,
for education arrivals are 25 percent, for electricity 34 percent
and for water and sanitation 23 percent,and in the oil sector
arrival are 34 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
It adds up to around 8.35 billion arrived in Iraq with around
4.2 billion of supplies and equipment in the pipeline for a total
of 12.55 billion, and then there is the 1.6 billion the Committee
has put on hold, plus more then 200 contracts for which additional
information is being sought, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even with the recent improvements in New York and the new
leadership in Iraq and improved observation methods in Iraq, the
oil-for-food program is no substitute for the resumption of normal
economic activity in Iraq, Benon stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions against Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted until
the United Nations clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations weapons inspectors have been away from Iraq
since the U.S.-led military airstrikes on the country in December
1998.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Establishes Permanent Forum for Indigenous Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
and Social Council on Monday adopted by consensus a resolution to
establish a Permanent Forum for Indigenous Issues, an
unprecedented event in the international community.
</P>
<P>
The action was the latest step in a long process initiated in
1993, when the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights first
proposed such a forum.
</P>
<P>
The permanent Forum will break the ground. Indigenous
representatives, not only representatives of Member States, will,
for the first time, participate in a high-level forum in the
United Nations system.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous people have been seeking representation on the
international level since they first approached the League of
Nations early in the twentieth century.
</P>
<P>
The Forum will be a subsidiary organ of the Economic and
Social Council and will consist of 16 representatives. Eight
members are to be nominated by governments and elected by the
Council, and eight are to be appointed by the President of the
Council following broad consultations with indigenous
organizations and groups.
</P>
<P>
The selection process is to take into account principles of
representation and the diversity and geographical distribution of
indigenous people. Organizations of indigenous people may
participate in the Forum as observers, as may States, United
Nations bodies and organs, and intergovernmental and
nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Historically, indigenous people have struggled to make their
concern heard by governments, the United Nations, and other
intergovernmental bodies. Their circumstances and needs went
largely unnoticed by the international community until a landmark
study was undertaken by the United Nations Subcommission on the
Protection of Minorities and Prevention of Discrimination in the
1970s.

<HEADLINE> French Investigators Cannot Establish Scenario of Concorde Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- French investigators cannot
establish a basic scenario for the crash of the Concorde aircraft
last Tuesday, the president of the commission of investigation,
Alain Monnier, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
``The only certainties or half-certainties which we have now
are the explosion of one or two tires, an intensive fire, problems
of undercarriage and engines. For the moment, we don't know how to
build the least scenario for link these elements one with another,
'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA) said it
has not found any elements which can be the causes of concern
before the take-off of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The BEA has not found the debris of engines on the runway, said
BEA chief Paul-Louis Arslanian.
</P>
<P>
An Air France Concorde crashed last Tuesday soon after taking
off from the Roissy airport in Paris, killing 114 people, 96 of
them German tourists.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Says His Remarks "Misunderstood" by Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 31(Xinhua) -- French Delegate-Minister of
Cooperation Charles Josselin said on Monday that his remarks on
Cote d'Ivore's elections have been misunderstood by the military
authorities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Josselin triggered a wave of protests form Cote d'Ivoire's
military junta and its supporters after calling on the country to
let the opposition leader, Alassane Ouattara, to run for the
president in October while advising the junta chief, General
Robert Guei, not to run.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published by the French Foreign Ministry on the
internet, Josselin said that the anti-French protests ``can only
be explained by a misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
``My remarks were badly understood, badly reported perhaps,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
``I wanted, in the wake of the referendum which was the first
step of the electoral process before Cote d'Ivoire can renew
democracy, to say to the Ivoirians that France considered this
first step was made with success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that France does not want to decide the list of
presidential candidates in Cote d'Ivoire and it is up to the
Ivoirians to decide.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Earmark More Than 2 Billion U.S. Dollars for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government will earmark
750 billion drachmas (about 2.08 billion U.S. dollars) in direct
and indirect support funding to the country's tourism sector by
the year 2006, or 25 percent of the total national and regional
programs for competitiveness and growth.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press conference Monday, Greece's
Development Minister Nikos Christodoulakis said that funding would
be secured from a Third Community Support Framework.
</P>
<P>
The biggest part of public spending for tourism, around 80
percent, would be earmarked for private investments, he said,
adding that the tourism sector would also benefit from investments
in other sectors, such as energy, transport, environment and
culture, that would affect the quality and the composition of the
country's tourist product.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the most important sectors of the Greek
economy, accounting for about 20 percent of total invisible
earnings. The tourist industry provides jobs for an estimated 350.
000 people, or about 9 percent of the employed labor force in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A big increase is recorded in the number of tourists visiting
Greece this year. Over 13 million tourists are expected to visit
Greece by October.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants to Expand Trade with Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday called for greater efforts to expand the
trade ties between Malaysia and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was glad that some Malaysian companies are
already operating in Bangladesh through joint-venture partnership
with their counterparts and that Malaysia was now listed by the
Bangladeshi Board of Investment as the third largest foreign
investor in Bangladesh with total investments of 1.32 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the presence of Malaysian investors reflects the
confidence that they have in Bangladesh's economy arising from the
success of the economic policies pursued by the government," he
said at a dinner hosted by him for his Bangladeshi counterpart
Sheikh Hasina at his official residence in Putrajapa near here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said more interactions should be promoted between the
private sector of both countries.
</P>
<P>
With Malaysia's economic recovery, more Malaysian companies
would venture abroad including to Bangladesh, he said, adding "I
thus regard the continued cooperation and assistance of the
Bangladeshi government as essential to enable them to be more
involved in the socio-economic development of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said it is important that a business-friendly
environment be created in Bangladesh to attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He commended Sheikh Hasina's leadership in solving the internal
insurgency problem and in striving hard to create a peaceful and
stable environment in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia was appreciative of the positive
contribution made by Bangladeshi workers in the development of the
Malaysian economy.
</P>
<P>
He also said that cooperation among Muslim nations is an
important dimension of Malaysia's foreign policy and that much
needs to be done to improve the lot of Muslims worldwide in this
era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia regards Bangladesh as an important member of the group
of eight Islamic developing countries (D-8) and the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) and looks forward to working closely
with Bangladesh in the interest of the Muslims world.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, in her speech, extended an open invitation to
Malaysian entrepreneurs to make Bangladesh their next foreign
destination.
</P>
<P>
She hoped Bangladesh and Malaysia would work together and help
each other in facing the challenges of globalization,
liberalization, information technology and the communication era.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her confidence that her visit to Malaysia and her
discussion with Mahathir will help further strengthen the existing
bonds of friendship, provide new insights and open up new areas of
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina and Mahathir had talks earlier Monday soon after
Hasina, accompanied by a 73-member delegation of senior officials
and businessmen, arrived here for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Mission to Pave Way for Peacekeeping Operation in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday unanimously decided to set up the United Nations Mission in
Ethiopia and Eritrea in anticipation of a peacekeeping operations
subject to the future Council authorization.
</P>
<P>
The decision was contained in a resolution unanimously adopted
by the 15-nation Council on Monday morning following its brief
closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Mission comprises of up to 100 military observers and the
necessary civilian support staff until January 31, 2001, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, the new U.N. Mission is to establish and
maintain liaison with the parties concerned, to establish and put
into operation the mechanism for verifying the cessation of
hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and to prepare for the
establishment of the Military Coordination Commission provided for
in the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea singed the June 18 cease-fire pact in
Algeria under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity (
OAU), ending fighting in a two-year border war in which tens of
thousands of soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
But enmity and mistrust remain high between the Horn of Africa
neighbors. Observers here said that skirmishes along the border
remain a possibility until the planned arrival of some 1,500 U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission is mandated to assist in planning for a
future peacekeeping operation, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution also requests the parties to
facilitate the deployment of mine action experts and assets under
the United Nations Mine Action Service to further assess the mine
and unexpected ordnance problem and to provide technical
assistance to the parties to carry out emergency mine action.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stresses the importance of the rapid
demilitarization and demarcation of the common border between
Ethiopia and Eritrea in accordance with the OAU Framework
Agreement and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted after another 2,500 Eritrean
refugees have left Sudan, bringing the total number of Eritreans
who have returned in the last week to 9,500, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea was an Ethiopian province until 1993, when it became
independent with Ethiopian support. Under the OAU peace plan, an
international peacekeeping force is to patrol a 25-kilometer
buffer zone pending a joint operation to define the border.

Ethiopia and Eritrea singed the June 18 cease-fire pact in
Algeria under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity (
OAU), ending fighting in a two-year border war in which tens of
thousands of soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
But enmity and mistrust remain high between the Horn of Africa
neighbors. Observers here said that skirmishes along the border
remain a possibility until the planned arrival of some 1,500 U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission is mandated to assist in planning for a
future peacekeeping operation, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution commended the OAU for brokering the cease-fire
agreement signed in Algeria. It also asked U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to continue planning for a peacekeeping operation in
the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution also requests the parties to
facilitate the deployment of mine action experts and assets under
the United Nations Mine Action Service to further assess the mine
and unexpected ordnance problem and to provide technical
assistance to the parties to carry out emergency mine action.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stresses the importance of the rapid
demilitarization and demarcation of the common border between
Ethiopia and Eritrea in accordance with the OAU Framework
Agreement and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted after another 2,500 Eritrean
refugees have left Sudan, bringing the total number of Eritreans
who have returned in the last week to 9,500, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea was an Ethiopian province until 1993, when it became
independent with Ethiopian support. Under the OAU peace plan, an
international peacekeeping force is to patrol a 25-kilometer
buffer zone pending a joint operation to define the border.

KIEV, July 31 (Xinhua) -- 18 hostages taken hostage in Kiev by
two mutinous Ukrainian soldiers overnight were freed early Monday
morning by Ukraine's security forces with none injured, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two mutinous soldiers, who escaped from the guardhouse of a
military unit after overpowering a sentry and capturing his
submachine gun, grabbed 18 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The two were placed in confinement because of decamping and
stealing cars, according to the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorist troops from Ukraine's State Security Department
immediately surrounded the building where the two soldiers and the
hostages stayed and had negotiations with the two for some six
hours, but no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
Later, special police officers took resolute measures and
brought the two under control following warning shots from the two
soldiers, the Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican National Convention Opens in Philadelphia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republicans opened their
quadrennial national convention Monday to nominate Texas Governor
George W. Bush and former defense secretary Dick Cheney as their
presidential and vice presidential candidates for this year's
election.
</P>
<P>
Attending the convention are 2,066 delegates and 2,066
alternates. A simple majority is needed to nominate the
presidential and vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The convention will reach its climax Thursday when Bush accepts
the party's official nomination and delivers an acceptance speech
on the theme of "President with a purpose: A stronger leader who
can unite our country and get things done."
</P>
<P>
Bush has been campaigning in a bus tour in six Democrat-leaning
states, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia,
Pennsylvania on his way to the convention.
</P>
<P>
Other keynote speakers in the conference include Cheney, who
was selected as Bush's running mate a few days ago, former Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Colin Powell, Arizona Senator
John McCain, Bush's defeated rival for the Republican nomination.
They will speak on the subjects of education, health care,
strength and security, as well as prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It will be the sixth Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia, America's fifth most populous city.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day conventions, Republicans will adopt a
platform with a kinder, gentler tone on issues such as immigration
and education policy, but the party retains its tough positions
against abortion, homosexuality and sex education.
</P>
<P>
Bush is leading would-be Democratic presidential candidate Al
Gore in national polls after he announced Cheney as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNN-Time poll released last Friday, Bush and
Cheney led Gore 52 percent to 36 percent in a four-way matchup
with the Green Party's Nalph Nader, who was at 5 percent, and
Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan, at 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, released last Thursday, also
found the Republican tickets with an 11-point lead over Gore, 50
percent to 39 percent, among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was encouraged by polls in the presidential race
but he won't become overconfident after he saw his father lose in
1992.

<HEADLINE> Polish Lifter Wrobel Vows to Win Gold at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Polish world record holder Agata
Wrobel vows to beat the expected challenge from world champion
Ding Meiyuan of China in a bid for the gold in the women's above-
75kg category, a Polish newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Republic newspaper said Wrobel successfully lifted 130.5 kg
in snatch and 162.5 kg in clean and jerk to register a total of
293.0 kg in Saturday's Baltic Sea Cup competition in the northern
Polish port city of Gdynia.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the three figures all surpassed the present
world records for the category but the results would not be
officially recognized by the International Weightlifting
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Wrobel is the current world record holder for both snatch (130.
0 kg) and total (290.0 kg) but China's Wang Yanmei claims the
world mark for clean and jerk in 161.0 kg.
</P>
<P>
Wrobel, who regarded Ding as her closest contender, told the
paper: "Since my situation now is not bad, I think Ding is also at
her best. I think anybody who beats the 300 kg mark at Sydney
will win the gold. This is one of the gold medals that Poland is
aiming at."
</P>
<P>
Ding won all three gold medals available in the above-75
category at World Weightlifting Championships in Athens, Greece,
in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Wrobel claimed she did not show all her trump
cards as she gave up her third attempt in Gdynia.
</P>
<P>
Poland is sending four women and six men lifters to the Sydney
Olympic Games.

HOHHOT, July 31 (Xinhua) -- It has not rained much in
Liuhuiliang Village since spring. But Qin Changzai is not worried.
</P>
<P>
With the help of eight water cellars in front of his house, Qin
and his family were able to plant one hectare of maize, kidney
beans, and potato on time in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"We are lucky to have the cellars," Qin said. The annual income

<P>
To collect autumn rains for spring seeding by digging pits has
become a popular way in the drought-prone autonomous region to
fight drought, said Wei Hua, a local official in charge of water
conservation.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region initiated an exemplary
project of rain collecting in Qingshuihe County and Jungar Banner
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today over 40,000 households have built 88,000 water pits or
cellars and water-retention wells to irrigate some 14,300 hectares
of land. Most of the 165,000 people who lived in poverty in 1994
are now leading better lives.
</P>
<P>
The tanks have been praised by the Ministry of Water Resources.
Over 40 counties from northwest China's Gansu and Qinghai

<HEADLINE> Peres' Defeat Is a Signal to Barak: Sharon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Shimon Peres' defeat in Israel's
presidential election on Monday sent a signal to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak that the nationalist camp is not in favor of his peace
policies, said opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
"The election was an expression of dissatisfaction over Barak's
policies and promises which he made and broke one by one...and what
happened today shows that the days of this failed government are
numbered," Sharon told reporters after the Knesset (parliament)
voting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a secret balloting, Likud's presidential candidate Moshe
Katsav beat One Israel's Peres by 63 votes to 57 in the second
round after falling one short of the 61 votes needed for victory in
the first round in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Peres' chances of victory in the secret ballot had seemed to
receive a boost early in the day from the Rabbis of the ultra-
Orthodox Shas party who allowed its Knesset members to vote as they
please.
</P>
<P>
But during the second round of voting, at least two Israeli Arab
Knesset members cast their votes to Katsav, which caused the lose
for Peres, according the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Looking glum, Peres, 77, said in a statement after the voting
that he has nothing to say but to congratulate Katsav for his
success.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, the only thing I have to say is to congratulate
Moshe Katsav on his election as president...I wish him success and
all the best," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Katsav told reporters that he will be the representative of the
Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
Katsav will be Israel's eighth president and sworn in on Tuesday
at the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Central Asia Policy "Mature": Turkish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's policy towards Central Asia
has gone through "the teething stage" and reached "maturity,"
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem was quoted by the Turkish Daily
News as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the interview published on Monday, Cem said that "our Central
Asia policy over the past 10 years have been extremely successful.
We gave much thought to what had to be done, bearing in mind the
characteristics of the region, and we did it."
</P>
<P>
At last month's conference of Turkish ambassadors to Central
Asian countries, the foreign minister said Turkey had put "special
emphasis" on its relations with those Turkic-speaking countries
where Turkish companies were making large investments.
</P>
<P>
He paid visits to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last month amid
rising criticism within Turkey that Ankara has been neglecting this
neighboring region.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that following the collapse of the former Soviet
Union in 1991, there was an important opportunity for Turkey to
assert itself among the newly independent Turkic-speaking countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
They argued, however, relations between Turkey and these
countries have not reached a "satisfactory" level, although it has
been nearly 10 years since these countries gained their
independence. Turkey, the center of the former Ottoman Turkish
empire whose orbit for centuries covered part of Central Asia, has
been competing for influence over the region with Russia since
1991.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hopes a 1,760-kilometer oil pipeline crossing Georgia and
linking the Azeri capital Baku with the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan will be operating by mid-2004. The project was promoted
by the United States but opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Russia sees Turkey as acting here as an instrument
of the U.S., which is quietly wresting for control of the
traditional sphere of influence of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The minister viewed "ethnic separatism" and "radical religious
terrorism" as two major threats in Central Asia and the Caucasus,
calling for increasing cooperation on the security issues among
Turkey, countries in the region and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to enlist Russia to a "Caucasus Stability
Pact," raised early this year by former Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, a vigorous proponent of Turkish interests in the Caucasus
and Central Asia, during his visit to neighboring Georgia. But
Russia has remained cool to the idea.
</P>
<P>
Cem told the Turkish Daily News that there was no conflict, only
peaceful but serious competition between Turkey and Russia in
Central Asia and the Caucasus.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Leaves for India on Official Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Koirala left here Monday for New Delhi, the capital of India, for
a one-week official visit at the invitation of Indian Prime
Minister Atal Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
"My visit will enhance the atmosphere of confidence between the
two countries," Koirala told reporters at the Tribhuvan
International Airport before departure.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that his visit will help further
strengthen the age-old ties of friendship between Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
Koirala is scheduled to have official talks with his Indian
counterpart Vajpayee and discuss bilateral issues such as Kalapani
territorial disputes, the border demarcation and the duty disputes
relating to bilateral trade, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
Koirala is the first Nepali prime minister to visit India since
1996.

continue a cautious opening to Western ways,
</P>
<P>
-- French investigators said Sunday that some debris left on

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Monday met his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, again to discuss
the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said here that the two leaders held a 90-
minute working lunch in Downing Street and talked about the threat
posed by dissident guerrilla groups in the British province that
are opposed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"They will discuss how the two governments can work together to
tackle dissidents," he said.
</P>
<P>
While the Irish Republican Army and other mainstream guerrilla
groups are observing cease-fires as part of the Northern Ireland
peace process, dissident gunmen and bombers have been blamed by
security sources for sporadic attacks.
</P>
<P>
About two weeks ago, before the British government held a huge
royal pageant to celebrate the 100th birthday of the Queen Mother,
British police destroyed an explosive device found in London. It
was accused that dissident Irish republican guerrillas had planted
it.
</P>
<P>
It was also revealed that the missiles, machine guns and
explosives seized in Croatia last week were believed to have been
destined for dissident Irish republican guerrillas.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Eddie Jones has issued an
ultimatum to Charlotte Hornets for a sign-and-trade deal with the
Miami Heat as soon as possible, otherwise he will leave the
Hornets without any compensation.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who may join either the Heat or the Chicago Bulls "at
any time" after August 1, wants to play for the Heat but is trying
to avoid signing for the 2.25 million salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
The exception is the most money the Heat can offer Jones in the
absence of a sign-and-trade, while the Bulls have enough cap room
to offer Jones a maximum contract.
</P>
<P>
If Jones signs with the Heat or Bulls, the Hornets will lose
their top scorer, and the NBA's steals leader without compensation,
Jones' attorney Leon Rose said.
</P>
<P>
Free agents cannot sign contracts until Tuesday, but much of
the salary-cap space for maximum contracts already has been
committed.

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution Reaches Critical Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shen Yunfen, the oceanologist, said largest red tide that ever
occurred in China's offshore areas in the 1990s occurred this year
off the 80 km long of coastline of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
There were few red tide in China's coastal areas before the
1960s, several recorded in 1970s, 20 times in the 1980s, and up to
30 times in the 1990s, Shen told participants to the on-going
international forum on oceanic science-technology and economic
development in Qingdao, a coastal city in east Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of industrial polluted water and waste water from
households is the major cause leading to red tides, posing a big
threat not only to ocean plants and animals, but the ocean's eco-
system as well.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to control water pollution in waters in
China's inland areas, especially the Yangtze River and the Pearl
River, to decrease the occurrences of red tide, says Shen Yunfen,
from the hydro-biological institute at the Academy of Social
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> France Tries to Appease Tension With Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- French Delegate-Minister of
Cooperation Charles Josselin Monday had a telephone conversation
with Cote d'Ivoire's junta leader General Robert Guei in an effort
to appease the tension between the two countries, Foreign Ministry
assistant spokesman Bernard Valero said.
</P>
<P>
Josselin also met Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister Charles Gomis
in Paris last Saturday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Josselin triggered a wave of protests from Cote d'Ivoire after
he called on the junta to allow the country's opposition leader
Alassane Ouattara to run for president while advising General Guei
against running as a candidate in the presidential election to be
held in October.
</P>
<P>
The French delegate-minister also discussed with the Cote
d'Ivoire leaders the economic situation of the western African
state and international aid for the country, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> NE China Collects Money To Fight Against Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Ongoing donation activities in
northeast China's Liaoning Province are expected to reduce
economic losses brought by a long period of drought.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, local governmental officials have donated 3.844
million yuan (about 461,280 U.S. dollars). The Liaoning Provincial
Economic and Trade Committee has called on some 70 local
enterprises with more than 5 million yuan in profits to donate a
total 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, this amount will be rather small in dealing with
drought-stricken farmland, withered crops and dying livestock due
to the most severe drought in the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures and lack of rain in the province are
predicted to reduce the local grain yield by over 5 billion kg, or
10 billion yuan of losses. So far, 2.786 million hectares of
farmland has been affected by drought, or 76 percent of the
province's total. Water shortages have also affected the daily
life of over 2 million local residents and nearly 1 million heads
of livestock.
</P>
<P>
No deaths nor epidemics have been reported in the drought-hit
areas so far.
</P>
<P>
The province distributed donations to the drought-stricken
areas, providing farmers with interest-free loans to grow
vegetables, and setting up temporary water-supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
The drought also forced the province to breed next year's crop
seeds in Hainan province, which will cost another 30 million yuan.

HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced Monday that the total assets of the Exchange Fund
amounted to 956.1 billion HK dollars (122.58 billion U.S. dollars)
as at June 30, up 2.3 percent, or 21.7 billion HK dollars, from a

</P>
<P>
Foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets increased
by 14.3 billion HK dollars and 7.4 billion HK dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign currency assets was mainly attributable
to revaluation effects on foreign currency investments while the
increase in Hong Kong dollar assets was largely due to an increase
in the market value of Hong Kong equities, which was partly offset
by a decrease in placements by other government funds.

<HEADLINE> Supervision Over Internet Domain Name Gets Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The public are generally in
support of the setting up of a new non-profit-making and non-
statutory corporation to assume the overall responsibility for
Internet domain name administration in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They also support proposed registration principles to
liberalize Internet domain name registration and the proposed
alternative dispute resolution arrangements which could help to
address cybersquatting.
</P>
<P>
These views were received during the public consultation on
Administration and Assignment of Internet Domain Names and
Internet Protocol Addresses in Hong Kong held between June 5 and
July 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results of the consultation exercise at a press
conference Monday, Deputy Secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting Alan Siu said a total of 37 submissions were received
in the consultation exercise, of which eight were submissions from
individuals and 29 were submitted by organizations and companies.
</P>
<P>
He said all the comments received had been considered in detail
by the Task Force set up under the Information Infrastructure
Advisory Committee to review the administration and assignment of
Internet domain names and Internet Protocol addresses.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force had made its recommendations which were
subsequently endorsed by the committee, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Hong Kong Network Information Center under the
Joint Universities Computer Center is the organization which
provides registration service for domain names under .hk, i.e. .
com.hk, .org.hk, .net.hk, .edu.hk and .gov.hk.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Task Force Charles Kao said that in view of the
public support for the setting up of a new corporation to assume
the overall responsibility for Internet domain name administration
in Hong Kong, the joint center would be invited to take forward
the proposal on the gradual transformation of the institutional
arrangement for Internet domain names administration as a matter
of priority.
</P>
<P>
A dispute resolution mechanism based on similar practices
abroad would also be set up to provide an efficient and effective
means to handle disputes arising from the registration or use of
domain names.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets FMs of Rio Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang's remarks came during a meeting with foreign ministers of
Colombia, Mexico and Chile of the Rio Group Troika in this summer
resort.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group, as the most important political consultation and
coordination organization in Latin American, is one of the key
political forces among developing countries, Jiang said, speaking
highly of the group's efforts in promoting peace, stability, unity
and economic development in the region, and cooperating in

</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers -- Guillermo Fernandez De Soto of
Colombia, Rosario Green Macias of Mexico, and Maria Soledad Alvear
Valenzuela of Chile, arrived in Beijing Sunday for a visit at the

</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates the Rio Group's positive role in both

<HEADLINE> Right-wing Candidate Elected as Israel's New President 1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Right-wing presidential candidate
Moshe Katsav was elected the eighth president of the State of
Israel in a special parliamentary vote Monday morning, dealing a
severe blow to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak as he supported
Katsav's rival Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, who is from the right-wing Likud faction, won the second
round of the election with a vote of 63-57, which was sufficient
for declaring victory as the law-required vote is 61 in the 120-
member Knesset (Parliament) in the first and second rounds of the
secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the first round, Katsav commanded a lead with 60
votes over the ruling One Israel's candidate and former prime
minister Shimon Peres, who gained 57 votes. Peres indicated before
the vote that he had guaranteed at least 60 votes in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate Peres served as prime minister (1984-1986) in a
national unity government with Likud's Yitzhak Shamir, although he
lost the 1984 general election to Shamir.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he succeeded Yitzhak Rabin's prime minister post after
Rabin had been assassinated by right-wing extremists. However, he
was defeated by Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Katsav, who was once regarded as the underdog in
the race, will be sworn in on Tuesday for a seven-year term as the
highly ceremonial head of state.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, Katsav repeatedly promoted his
slogan that Israel, at this stage, needs a more central president
than Peres for the purpose of uniting the nation in light of a
widening rift between the left and the right, the secular and the
religious in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his efforts to
master-plan the landmark Oslo Accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, is regarded as the most dovish politician in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the election of Katsav is expected to do harm
to Barak's peace efforts to push forward the peace process with
Arab countries, some analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
However, other analysts pointed out that the Israeli president,
who represents the country abroad and at home as the head of state,
grants pardons, receives diplomatic credentials, swears in judges
and signs laws, is a highly ceremonial post.
</P>
<P>
Katsav also repeated many times during the campaign that he will
not be too political and meddle in the government's affairs if he
is elected.
</P>
<P>
The blow dealt to Barak due to Peres's defeat, thus, might be
only at the psychological and morale levels. Barak is facing three
no-confidence votes Monday afternoon, which might be more critical
for his political survival.
</P>
<P>
The presidential inauguration ceremony will begin at 6:30 p.m.
Tuesday in the Knesset Speaker's Office, in the presence of former
President Ezer Weizman, justices of Israel's Supreme Court, members
of the Israel Defense Forces General Staff, senior members of the
diplomatic corps and other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, whose term to end in 2003, was forced to resign early
this month after the revelation of his financial irregularities
with a French Jewish businessman and the subsequent police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Although the police had closed the case without indictment, the
president's involvement in such a scandal forced him to consider
early resignation.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Cabinet Approves New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's cabinet of ministers
on Monday unanimously approved the new draft constitution which
aims at politically ending the 17-year civil war between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels, a government statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the cabinet met and considered the draft
constitution in full and made the decision after a lengthy
discussion.
</P>
<P>
It said the cabinet will present the draft to the parliament on
August 3.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said she was keen to push through the
draft constitution before the dissolution of the parliament on
August 24.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a long-running civil war between
government troops and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels who
are fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils in the
country's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution aims at ending the war by devolving
powers to regional councils including one administered by ethnic
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The government of ruling People's Alliance lacks the required
two-thirds majority for the passage of the reforms and had entered
into bipartisan talks with the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) to reach consensus and obtain the required support in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNP, which holds the balance of power to make or
break the reforms, does not favor a debate on the reforms before
the dissolution of the parliament on the grounds that agreement
had still not been reached on several matters and that a wider
spectrum of society should be consulted.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist clergy, smaller political parties and several
other organizations have protested that they have not been
consulted about the constitutional reforms.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Send Smaller Athletics Team to Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany will send a smaller track and
field team to the Sydney Olympics but hopes to win as many medals.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hensel, a director at the German Athletics Federation (
DLV), said Sunday that about 70 athletes are expected to be
nominated, compared to 91 for the Atlanta Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite few outstanding performances in the German nationals
over the weekend in Braunschweig for cool weather, DLV officials
thought that German athletes still can do as well as in Atlanta
where they won seven medals.
</P>
<P>
"That's a good team, in which almost everyone has a chance of
reaching the finals," said DLV President Helmut Digel.
</P>
<P>
So far, 67 German athletes have passed Olympic qualifying
standards set by the DLV. No more than 73 athletes are expected
to be going to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Athletes who fail to pass the qualifying standard can still get
a place on the team if they had been injured for a long time and
if they are recommended by the DLV to the National Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Germany took 84 athletes to the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and
the Sydney team will be the smallest since the German unification
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Increased Awareness of Coastal Territories In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Central Television is
currently showing a 40 episode documentary called "Walk Towards
The Sea," an effort to raise the people's awareness about China's
oceanic territories.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by Qingdao University in the coastal city of
east China's Shandong Province shows that as many as 90 percent of
respondents only regard the 9.65 million sq km of land areas as
belonging to China, ignoring nearly three million sq km of sea.
</P>
<P>
There are still little available in primary and middle school
books that allows students to learn about the vast oceans that
surround China.
</P>
<P>
Some schools in China have been offering courses on oceanic
territories, according to maritime experts, who attended a two-day
international forum on oceanic science-technology and economic
development which ended today.
</P>
<P>
Gai Guangsheng, president of the Beijing-based "China Ocean
News," says that the international forum in Qingdao is important
in increasing the Chinese people's consciousness of the oceanic
territories in China.
</P>
<P>
Several reasons underlies the lack of awareness among the
general public concerning China's oceanic territories. China also
has an outdated maritime law system.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, China's coastal economy grew by more
than 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated that output value of coastal economies in
China is expected to top 500 billion yuan this year, accounting
for five percent of the country's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals in China's West Regain Paradise (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A forestry official in west China
's Sichuan Province said here today that traces of the Giant Panda
were recently found in the province's Ruo'ergai County.
</P>
<P>
"Giant Pandas have never been found in the area before, and the
finding indicate that the living environment of the endangered
species is improving and their habitat expanding," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from forestry departments of west China's provinces
and autonomous regions show that the number of wild animals in the
region has been on rise in recent years due to the recovery of
forest resources resulting from China's efforts to regreen the
area as well as the country's enhanced measures to protect wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan Province, the number of the endangered golden-haired
monkeys has risen to about 600 from 200, and the Asian elephants
to some 300 from 100; in Gansu Province, the number of white-
lipped deer has increased to more than 1,000 from 300. Meanwhile,
the rampant poaching of Tibetan antelopes on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau has been effectively curbed.
</P>
<P>
China's west cover about 60 percent of the country's territory,
and its mountainous landscape and various types of forest
vegetation provide the major habitat for the country's wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan alone, the number of vertebrate animal species
exceeds 1,700, accounting for 58.2 percent of the country's total,
and the number of rare species ranks first in the country.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals in China's West Regain Paradise (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, however, wild animals in the region have found their
habitat dwindling and many species are on the verge of extinction,
mainly due to reckless logging of nature forest for timber and
farmland.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China imposed logging ban on all natural forest along
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers and
last year, launched the drive to regreen the western regions
featured by turning crops fields on mountain slopes back to forest.
Meanwhile, the construction of nature reserves also speeded up.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan recently announced by the State Forestry
Administration, China will set up 270 nature reserves, covering 65
million ha, in the western regions over the next 10 years, which
together with the current more than 400 ones will make up 13.33
percent of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Forestry experts say the logging ban has brought peaceful
surrounding back to the forest and also the quick recovery of
forest vegetation, which greatly improves the living environment
of wild animals. And farmland-turned forest link up isolated
animal habitat, broadening the scope of their activities.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the well preserved forest vegetation and
ecological diversity in the nature reserves provide more ideal
home for wild animals, they said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Right-wing presidential candidate
Moshe Katsav was elected as the eighth president of Israel in a
special parliamentary vote Monday morning, a severe blow to Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak as he supported Katsav's opponent Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
Katsav won the second round of the election with a vote of 63-
57.
</P>
<P>
A candidate needs at least 61 votes of the 120-member Knesset in
the first and second rounds of Knesset (parliament) secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Katsav, who was once regarded as the underdog in
the race, will be sworn in on Tuesday morning for a seven-year term
as the highly ceremonial head of state.

<HEADLINE> UNIFIL Deployment to be Finished on Monday: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
has said the deployment of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) will be completed on Monday in the entire zone that was
vacated by the May 24 Israeli withdrawal, local media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see any hindrances to this deployment after it is
verified on Monday that all encroachments have been corrected,"
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL has been deployed in four vacated locations over the
weekend, and the operation to deploy U.N. peacekeepers in the rest
of the liberated zone is scheduled for Monday, according to reports
of the An Nahar and As Safir newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Units from UNIFIL's Indian, Ghanaian, Irish, Finnish, Nepalese
and Fijian battalions will be involved in the final deployment once
the Ukrainian contingent completes the dismantling of some 130,000
land mines left behind by Israeli troops, said An Nahar paper.
</P>
<P>
However, French peacekeepers were excluded from the deployment
in the liberated zone, said As Safir paper.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations announced on Saturday the Lebanese government
has given permission to deploy U.N. peacekeepers along its borders
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon blocked the deployment of U.N. troops and its own
soldiers in the south before Israel had ended all border
violations.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official word when a Lebanese task force of 1,
000 army troops and police will be deployed in the vacated strip.
</P>
<P>
President Emile Lahoud Saturday urged government troops and
resistance fighters to remain on "maximum alert and readiness" as
long as no comprehensive peace has yet been attained to ensure an
Israeli withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights and to allow
Palestinian refugees to return to their land.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been under international pressure to approve the U.
N. peacekeepers' deployment and send its own troops to the borders
ever since Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas, who had spearheaded the guerrilla fight
against Israeli occupation, took charge of security in the vacated
area after Israel's pullout.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Israel's President-elect Moshe Katsav </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel's right-wing presidential
candidate Moshe Katsav was elected the eighth president of the
State of Israel in a special parliament session Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic victory of Katsav has been viewed as a coup as his
opponent, the ruling One Israel's candidate Shimon Peres, was
widely regarded before the secret ballot as the leading candidate
who reportedly had guaranteed 60 votes in the 120-member Knesset or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Katsav is expected to be sworn in on Tuesday morning to serve a
seven-year term as Israel's head of state.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, Katsav repeatedly promoted his
slogan that Israel, at this stage, needs a more central president
than Peres for the purpose of uniting the nation in light of a
widening rift between the left and the right, the secular and the
religious in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his efforts to
masterplan the landmark Oslo Accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, is regarded as the most dovish politician in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the election of Katsav, who is from the right-
wing Likud faction which opposes Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
efforts to push forward the peace process with Arab countries, is
expected to do harm to Barak's peace tasks, some analysts
predicted.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli president, who represents the country
abroad and at home as the head of state, grants pardons, receives
diplomatic credentials, swears in judges and signs laws, is a
highly ceremonial post.
</P>
<P>
Katsav also repeated on many occasions during the campaign that
he will not be too political and meddle in the government's affairs
if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
The blow dealt to Barak due to Peres's defeat, thus, might be
only at the psychological and morale level, some analysts argued.
</P>
<P>
Born in Iran in 1945, Katsav immigrated to the newborn Israel
with his parents in 1951. The eldest of eight children in an
Orthodox religious family, he grew up in a transit tent camp for
new immigrants and later in the development town of Kiryat Malachi.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the Ben-Shemen Agricultural School. After
serving military service as corporal in the Communications Corps,
he received a degree in Economics and History from the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In the university, he already began his political life as
chairman of the Gahal Party (Likud's predecessor) student
organization. Later, he served as president of the Young B'nai
Brith organization in his hometown of Kiryat Malachi and wrote for
Israel's leading Yediot Aharonot daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, he was elected Mayor of Kiryat Malachi as a 24-year-old
student, then youngest mayor in Israel. He later was re-elected as
Kiryat Malachi Mayor in 1974 and kept his post until 1981.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he began his parliament career as a member of the
Knesset Committee on Interior Affairs and the Environment, and the
Committee on Education and Culture.
</P>
<P>
He also served as chairman of the Knesset Members' Lobby for
Development Towns. He was Likud parliamentary faction chairman in
the 13th Knesset (1992-1996).
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he joined in the Menachem Begin and later Yitzhak
Shamir government as Deputy Housing and Construction Minister.
</P>
<P>
He later served as Labor and Social Affairs Minister from 1984
to 1988, and Minister of Transport from 1988 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
After Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu won the 1996 general elections
against the then acting Prime Minister Peres, Katsav was appointed
Deputy Prime Minister and Tourism Minster. He also served as
minister in charge of Israeli Arab affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was head of the Israel-China Parliamentary Friendship League
and visited China in 1995 as head of an Israeli parliamentary
delegation, the first such delegation since Israel and China
established diplomatic relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Katsav has five children.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops in Congo to Fly Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 Ugandan soldiers
deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are
expected to fly home this week, Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are organizing a big ceremony at the Entebbe International
Airport to welcome the soldiers who have been assembled in the
Congolese town of Buta," Katirima told Xinhua in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fete involves holding a grand parade before
ministers, diplomats accredited to Uganda and families of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to pull out all its troops from
the DRC, but this has to be under the Lusaka peace agreement,"
said Katirima.
</P>
<P>
Last month the government ordered five battalions based in the
DRC to return home. The soldiers had fought in the Congolese city
of Kisangani with Rwandan troops in May and June, which caused
heavy civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in the DRC to
back rival rebel factions fighting against the DRC President
Laurent Kabila. The two former allies fought three times in
Kisangani since last August.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Party Urges Buyoya not to Bring Country Back to Bloody War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A major Burundian party
involved in the peace talks aimed at ending the seven-year civil
war in the central African country has warned President Pierre
Buyoya that his military government is likely to plunge the
country into a bloody civil war if it refuses to sign the peace
agreement scheduled for August 28.
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper here Monday quoted Joseph
Karumba, national chairman of the Burundian Front for National
Liberation (FROLINA), as saying on Sunday that the rejection by
the government might lead to a civil war because his movement
would not accept proposals made by Buyoya who demands he should be
given another two-year term.
</P>
<P>
"FROLINA will never allow any covert move to give Buyoya two
presidential years who has failed to lead Burundi for 13 years,"
Karumba said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Buyoya reportedly announced in Bujumbura, Burundi,
that his government will not sign a peace deal next month unless
two conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire must enforced before the peace agreement is signed,
and another two-year term must be given to the existing military
government, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Karumba stressed that a cease-fire will only be
meaningful once the signing of the peace agreement is done on
August 28.
</P>
<P>
Burundian parties, including the Bujumbura government, involved
in the peace talks, should understand that they will not find a
durable peace by refusing to sign the peace accord, said the
FROLINA leader.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord mediated by former South African
President Nelson Mandela, the Tutsi minority, which has dominated
Burundi's political and economic life since its independence from
Belgium in 1962, will have to hand over power to a democratically
elected regime in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
During the last round of peace talks held in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha this month, Mandela told 19 Burundian
parties involved in the talks that the signing of both a cease-
fire deal and the peace agreement will be done simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Burundi between the majority Hutus and the minority
Tutsis has claimed at least 200,000 lives, mostly civilians, since
it began in October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the
country's first democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye,
a Hutu.

<HEADLINE> China to Convert Large Research Institutions into Independent Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China will transform more than 100
large state-owned scientific research institutions under the
ministries into independently-run enterprises by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
It is a major step in the reform of China's research bodies,
according to the latest issue of "Beijing Review".
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and fourty-two state-owned research organs were
turned into or merged with independently-operated enterprises in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, vice minister of Science and Technology, was quoted
as saying at a recent national conference that technological
development and research organs attached to the Ministry of
Construction, Ministry of Communications and some other ministries
will be required to become independently-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the research organs of scientific and
technological development must focus on market-oriented projects
if they want to be more successful.
</P>
<P>
Many of the converted organs received more research funding,
either from the local governments or through listings on the stock
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen transformed institutes are preparing to be listed
on the market, he added.

Zhang Guobao, vice minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, was quoted as saying recently that the new policy
fully reflects Chinese government's determination to open wider to
the outside and smooth its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state will not approve solely state-owned
investment in the pipeline project, which is estimated to cost 40
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
There is no ceiling set for the share-holding percentage of
foreign-controlled investment in order to make foreign funds
possible for the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
The West-East Natural Gas Pipeline Project is the most
ambitious effort ever undertaken by the central government to
develop China's west.
</P>
<P>
In addition to incentives given to infrastructure construction,
the pipeline project also enjoys favorable policies specially
designed for the development of the western areas, including fee
reductions and exemptions in mineral exploration and mining, tax-
free imports of related equipment and land use.
</P>
<P>
Natural Gas deposits in the Tarim Basin of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are estimated at 8.39 trillion
cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipeline is scheduled to start next year
and be completed in 2003.

Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The well-preserved coin, weighing 2.4 grams, is 0.9 mm thick

<HEADLINE> ITU to Prepare World Summit on Information Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) has agreed to proceed with the preparation for a World
Summit on Information Society to be held in 2003 in close
cooperation with U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the summit is to develop a common vision and
understanding of the information society, and draw up a strategic
plan of action for its concerted development, the ITU said in a
press released here Monday. In addition, the summit is to define
an agenda covering the objectives and the resources to be
mobilized.
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt that the emergence of the information
society poses new challenges for governments, the private sector
and civil society." said ITU Secretary-General Yoshio Utsumi. "But
the advent of new information and communication technologies (ICT)
can also empower individuals and communities to improve their
lives in ways not possible before."
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore important to define clearly the challenges
resulting from the development of ICT and agree on shared
approaches as society moves from a machine-based to a knowledge-
based society," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have already adopted Information Society
initiatives and the matter is under active consideration in many
others, according to the ITU. But the inherent global nature of
knowledge-based societies makes it vital that international
approaches be considered to avoid the creation of a new form of
division or the emergence of conflicting frameworks.
</P>
<P>
The core issues to be addressed will include infrastructure,
equitable access in a digital global economy, services and
applications and their implications for economic, social and
cultural development, consumer protection, privacy and security as
well as content and the right to communicate.
</P>
<P>
Two countries -- Switzerland and Tunisia -- have already
indicated interest in hosting the event. The venue will be decided
before the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Presidential Election Starts EDS-Update with election procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli legislators on Monday
started to cast their votes to elect the country's eighth
president, also the first one to serve a seven-year term.
</P>
<P>
Two candidates, Shimon Peres from the ruling One Israel and
Moshe Katsav from the opposition Likud party, are competing for the
largely ceremonial post. The winner will be decided in a secret
ballot by the 120 Knesset (Parliament) members (MKs).
</P>
<P>
As the election process dictates, the two candidates voted first
and then retired to separate rooms to await the results.
</P>
<P>
A four-member elections committee, consisting of MKs Dalia
Rabin-Pelosoff from the Center Party, who was assigned to chair the
committee, Chairman of the Likud faction Reuven Rivlin and his One
Israel counterpart Ophir Pines-Paz and Abdulmalik Dehamshe from the
United Arab Party, is supervising the voting process.
</P>
<P>
The members of the committee have signed all of the 120
envelopes into which legislators will cast their ballots. Any
envelope in which two ballots are found will be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
After the voting, the committee is to count the votes in
complete privacy. And Rabin-Pelosoff will open the envelopes and
read out the names, which the other three committee members will
duly record.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, Rabin-Pelosoff will fill out and sign a special form
for the occasion. It will then be signed by the other three
committee members and passed to Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg who
will announce the name of the winner.
</P>
<P>
If one of the candidates gets at least 61 votes, a delegation of
deputy speakers will proceed to the Chagall Hall in the Knesset,
where a ceremony announcing the results of the vote will be held.
The president-elect will then be invited to the Knesset Tuesday for
a swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
If neither of them receives 61 votes, a second voting is to be
held, following the same procedures as in the first round. If the
second round fails to produce a winner, a third round will be held,
which requires a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
Peres, the leading candidate, resigned from cabinet on Sunday as
Minister of Regional Cooperation in preparations for the election.
If he is elected president, his resignation will come into effect
in 48 hours which falls on Tuesday before he takes the oath of
office. If, however, he is not elected, he will have time to
retract the resignation before the 48 hours have elapsed.
</P>
<P>
The new president will arrive at the Knesset on Tuesday at 6:00
p.m. (1500 GMT), escorted by seven police motorcyclists and five
mounted policemen. He will receive a guard of honor and then await
the swearing-in ceremony, which will begin half an hour later in
the office of the Speaker. Former President Ezer Weizman will also
be present.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 guests, including the judges of the Supreme Court,
members of the Israeli Defense Force General Staff, senior members
of the diplomatic corps and other celebrities will also attend the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After the new president takes the oath of office, shofars (rams'
horns) will be sounded and all the MKs will call out, "Long live
the president." The president will then deliver his maiden speech
and the ceremony will conclude with the singing of the national
anthem.

<P>
TOKYO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Nikkei index fell for
the fourth straight trading day in Tokyo Monday, dragged down by
weakness in New York's Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 111.08 points, or 0.70
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 15,727.49, setting
this year's lowest closing for the second straight trading day.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), which covers
all First Section issues, however, turned upward for the first
time in three trading days, rising 0.22 point or 0.02 percent to 1,
453.15.
</P>
<P>
High-priced information technology (IT) issues were dampened by
last Friday's fall in the Nasdaq, which plunged 179.23 points to 3,
663.00.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of scandal-hit Financial Reconstruction
Commission chief Kimitaka Kuze has stirred distrust over Japanese
financial policy, providing investors with another reason to sell
stocks, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 574.58 million
shares from last Friday's 570.12 million.
</P>
<P>
Akai Electric was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
The real estate, construction and air transportation sectors
marked large declines, while the brokerage, land transportation
and rubber industries were firm.
</P>

Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers 1,011 to 294, with 89 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Ocean Pollution in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China's offshore areas are
continuing to get worse, according to a national survey.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuguang, director of the State Oceanic Administration,
said at a forum on oceanic science-technology and economic
development today that pollution in China's offshore areas is
worsening.
</P>
<P>
Most of the river estuaries, bays and sea areas near big and
medium-sized cities have been seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
The survey began in 1997, aiming to gather information
regarding China's offshore area at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuguang said sea areas 10 to 30 kilometers from the coast,
and even as far out as 120 to 200 kilometers from the coast have
been polluted. The major pollutants are azote, phosphor, oil,
organic substances, and heavy metals such as lead and mercury.

<HEADLINE> Cheng Kejie Sentenced to Death for Bribery (1) EDS-Updated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Kejie, former vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, was
sentenced to death today for accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing announced this
verdict in a public hearing here.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's personal possessions are to be confiscated and he is
to be deprived of all political rights permanently, the verdict
said.
</P>
<P>
The court verdict was the ruling at the first instance trial
and Cheng is eligible to appeal to the Beijing Higher People's
Court in 10 days, according China's Criminal Procedural Law.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, 66, was found guilty, in collaboration with his mistress
Li Ping, of having taken 41 million yuan in bribes when he served
as deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and chairman of the people's government of
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court started the legal
proceedings against Cheng on June 26 within the jurisdiction as
designated by the Supreme People's Court, and held open hearings
on July 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
The court has found out that at year-end of 1993, Cheng and his
mistress Li Ping planned to marry after they divorced their
spouses. They then worked out a scheme under which Li would serve
as an "agent" to find bribers for Cheng, so that Cheng would seek
illegal gains for them by abusing his post as chairman of the
people's government of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme, the two accepted bribes and deposited
them in overseas banks for their future use after marriage, the
court has found.

<TEXT>
<P>
From early 1994 to June of 1996, Cheng, with the help of Li,
demanded the regional planning commission, in violation of law, to
grant a major construction project to Yinxing Real Estate
Development Company, instructed the Nanning Municipal Government
to slash the land price, and brokered a bank loan of 70 million
yuan for Yinxing. As a result, Cheng was paid more than 20.21
million yuan by the Yinxing company as commission.
</P>
<P>
From first half of 1996 to the end of 1997, Cheng again abused
his position to help Yinxing contract a project building the
Ethnic Palace in the regional capital Nanning, and brokered 30
million yuan of loans for the company from a state-owned bank. He
also asked government departments to "lend" a total of 75 million
yuan to Yinxing and offer the company 13 million yuan in a subsidy
from the State Planning Commission. Yinxing, as promised, paid
Cheng and his mistress 9 million RMB yuan and 8.04 million Hong
Kong dollars for his "services".
</P>
<P>
From July 1994 through 1997, Cheng and Li also took bribes from
Zhou Kun, head of the Yinxing company, valued at 550,000 yuan,
including 20,000 RMB yuan, 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, 20,000 U.S.
dollars, as well as gold diamond rings, expensive watches and
other valuables.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July to October 1994, Cheng learned from
Li that it was "profitable" to help the Guangxi Investment and
Trust Company get bank loans. He once again abused his power to
secure loans of 16 million yuan for the company from the Guangxi
branches of the China Construction Bank and the Bank of China.
From this move, Cheng accepted a bribe of 600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, Cheng learned from Li Ping that the Guilong
Economic and Trade Co. Ltd. has promised "kickbacks" for officials
who could help it get a tunnel construction contract from the
Ministry of Railways. Cheng instructed related government
departments to intervene in the public bidding of the project and
made the company a successful contractor. Cheng therefore got 1.8
million yuan in "kickbacks."

<P>
From early 1994 to early 1998, Cheng also accepted bribes of
288,000 yuan and 3,000 U.S. dollars from three government
officials for helping them to get promoted. Former deputy head of
Hepu county became deputy secretary-general of the regional
government of Guangxi, head of a police sub-bureau in Beihai city
was made head of the Beihai Police Bureau, and another official
was sent to Beijing as a deputy head of Representative Office of
Guangxi in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's mistress Li Ping and bribers involved in above-
mentioned cases have all been dealt with or are to be dealt with
separately, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
In all, Cheng and Li accepted bribes totalling 41 million yuan
when Cheng served as the chairman of the people's government of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the court has found.
</P>
<P>
Their illicit gains have been deposited in overseas banks by Li
Ping as planned, except for 11.5 million yuan paid to a Hong Kong
businessman who helped them transfer or claim the money. All the
illegal deposits have been recovered by the State after Cheng's
crimes were exposed.
</P>
<P>
During the court hearings, the prosecution officers, Cheng and
his defense counsels fully expressed their opinions and debated on
evidences presented to the court.
</P>
<P>
The court then ruled that Cheng, as an government official, has
been found guilty of taking bribes as he sought illicit gains for
others by abusing his power.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of bribes Cheng took was extremely huge," said the
verdict, adding that "the crimes he committed in the capacity of a
senior leading official has seriously violated the normal working
order of government institutions, tarnished the clean and honest
image of government functionaries, discredited the fine reputation
of government officials, and thus should be harshly dealt with in
accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
The open trial of Cheng, a senior leading official involved in
a serious economic felony, has been a full demonstration of the
principle as prescribed in the country's constitution that "All
are equal before the law" and a full embodiment of the Party and
government's resolute determination and efforts to punish
corruption in accordance with the law, the presiding judge of the
case told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After another crisis meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak failed, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Sunday issued an
ultimatum, demanding that unless Barak takes steps to establish a
national unity government by Wednesday, he would resign.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that if "an honest effort is not made to
establish a unity government by Wednesday of this week, I will
resign from the government and support the bill for dissolving the
Knesset."
</P>
<P>
The dissolution bill is expected to come up in the Knesset
(Parliament) plenum on Wednesday, in the final meeting of the
current Knesset session, but it will be a preliminary vote, with
three more readings necessary before it could become law.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's worsening
political fortunes, he is expected to survive Monday's no-
confidence motion,the last before the Knesset's three month summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
No motion can be filed during the recess, unless 61 Knesset
members petition for such a move.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Likud nor One Israel thought that there would be 61
MKs to topple the government Monday, as Foreign Minister David Levy
did not quit the government on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The campaign staff of Shimon Peres (One Israel) is convinced
that the Knesset will elect him Monday as Israel's next president
by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
They claim to have 60 guaranteed votes even without the ultra-
orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, while 61 votes are
needed for a first-or-second-ballot win in the 120-member Knesset
secret voting.
</P>
<P>
Peres's Opponent, Likud's candidate Moshe Katsav, maintain that
he has the solid support of between 47 and 52 MKs, so that he needs
almost all the 17 votes of Shas to win.
</P>
<P>
Although Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef still did not
announce whether he is endorsing a candidate, several Shas MKs
confirmed he has decided to grant his MKs the right to vote freely,
which will give Peres at least five more votes.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Sunday was the hottest day this summer in Israel, with no
real relief expected until Tuesday. According to the Meteorological
Service, Wednesday should see a significant fall in temperatures as
well as a decline in humidity in the coastal regions. By Thursday,
temperatures will be normal for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
A temperature of 41 degrees Centigrade was recorded in Jerusalem
Sunday, the highest in the city for July in the past 50 years. The
39 degrees recorded at Mount Cana'an, near Safed, was also the
highest there since 1956.

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian FM Denies Candidacy in Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati has denied the report that he will vie with the
reformist President Mohammad Khatami in the 2001 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"I have not decided to enter the campaign of the presidential
election," he told the hard-line Resalat daily published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, currently an advisor of international affairs to
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he prefers his
present job to any others.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani
said on Sunday in a press report that Velayati will probably be a
candidate from the powerful conservative camp against President
Khatami in the 8th presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a close ally of President Khatami, told the
reformist daily Iran News that Iranian political factions have
already kicked off their political campaigns and Velayati's recent
visits to Syria and Lebanon are "highly suggestive."
</P>
<P>
Velayati, 55, served as foreign minister for 14 years till
President Khatami was sworn in office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some reformist leaders also warned that if he chose to run for
presidency, Velayati will suffer a face-losing defeat as former
Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Netaq Nouri did in the 1997
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won over 20 million votes, some 69 percent of the total
votes cast in the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami last week announced his readiness to seek a second term
in office to push forward his reformist programs.
</P>
<P>
But the announcement was criticized by the conservative camp
as "premature" aiming at depriving other possible candidates of any
chance of fair competition.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Indonesian Military Launches Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, 31 July (Xinhua) -- For the third time after President
Abdurrahman Wahid took office in October last year, the Indonesian
Military (TNI) on Monday launched a "minor" reshuffle involving
eight senior and middle officers in the Army.
</P>
<P>
In this reshuffle, Chief of the Army Strategic Reserve Command
(Kostrad) Maj. Gen. Agus Wirahadikusumah was replaced by Maj. Gen.
Ryamizard Ryacudu, the current Commander of the Jakarta Military
Command.
</P>
<P>
Wirahadikusumah took the position as the Kostrad Chief in March
this year. He is a well-known reformist in the TNI and opposed
what he said as "status quo group" in the TNI.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, based on an official letter signed by Commander of
the TNI Adm. Widodo, Wirahadikusumah will take position as a high
ranking officer at the TNI headquarters, while the Jakarta
Military Command will be handed over to Maj. Gen. Slamet
Kirbiyantoro, now a commander of the Wirabuana Military Command
which covers Sulawesi island.
</P>
<P>
The letter also said that the successor of Kirbiyantoro is Maj.
Gen. Achmad Yahya, the current coordinator of advisors to the Army
Chief-of-Staff.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the TNI Rear Marshall Graito Usodo said at a press
conference that "We will not exaggerate this tour of duty, as it
is a normal thing."
</P>
<P>
"I want to underline that the mutation is launched for the sake
of the TNI's organization. The mutation is conducted to build the
organization (of the TNI)," Usodo said adding that the decision
has been discussed comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
Denying there is a political nuance in connection with Monday's
mutation in the TNI, he said "the mutation has nothing to do with
the forthcoming annual session of the Assembly (scheduled on
August 7 to 18)."
</P>
<P>
In mid-June this year, the TNI has launched a major reshuffle
involving 122 personnel in the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Usodo said that the TNI now needs the changes in a bid to make
its internal reform program successful.
</P>
<P>
"We just try to find 'the right man for the right position,'"
Usodo stressed, referring to a speculation that the latest
reshuffle is part of the effort to oust the Commander of the Army,
Gen. Tyasno Sudarto.

<HEADLINE> China in Bid to Control Pollution in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 60 billion yuan (
about 7.25 billion U.S. dollars) in the next 15 years to improve
the Bohai Sea's ecological environment, Deputy Director of the
State Environmental Protection Administration Wang Jirong
disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The government has already worked out a plan for the project in
a bid to control pollution of the sea, said Wang at an
international forum on marine science and economy which ended
today in the coastal city of Qingdao, east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the South
China Sea, pollution in the Bohai Sea is the worst, she said.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the plan which is due to be implemented
in three stages, the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus released
into the Bohai Sea will be cut by 46,700 tons and 15,300 tons
respectively, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, the sea's environment will be greatly improved to
sustain social and economic development of the area.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that over the past years, the government has
spent 25.1 billion yuan on construction of 85 sewage treatment
plants in 11 coastal provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
These plants, with a daily handling capacity of 12.27 million
tons of waste water, have played a decisive role in reducing the
amount of pollutant discharged into the seas, she said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Geneticists to Make Breakthroughs in Research (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geneticists are confident
that they will make another two breakthroughs within one year as
they quicken their pace of genome research, according to the
latest weekly of Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
The first one is finishing their share of work on the
international Human Genome Project (HGP) by June 2001, two years
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The second one is to make China the first country in the world
to decode the super hybrid rice genome which is believed to ensure
China's leading position in hybrid rice research and production.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1990 by the United States, HGP aims to map out the
sequence of all three billion nucleotide pairs, which will help
decode the structure and function of the 100,000 genes in the
human body and thus reveal a mass of information on human genetics.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geneticists got involved in the project last September,
taking on the sequencing of one percent of the human genome and
making China the sixth country to participate in HGP after the
United States, Britain, Japan, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last April, scientists from the Humane Genome
Center of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the National
Human Genome Center in Northern and Southern China had mapped out
the 30 million base pairs on the No.3 chromosome.
</P>
<P>
Conducted simultaneously with HGP, the super hybrid rice genome
project is of special significance to China, the largest rice
producer in the world.

Chinese scientist Yuan Longping, the inventor of hybrid rice,
has developed numerous strains of high-yield hybrid rice over the
years. The best of them is super hybrid rice, with long-grained
non-glutinous rice as its parent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists will map out the rice genome, which has 4.3
billion base pairs, one-seventh of that of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lihuang, director of the CAS Laboratory of Biological
Engineering, said that the project aims to discover what makes
super hybrid rice so highly productive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the scientists will achieve this by
sequencing the super hybrid rice genome and conducting comparative
genome research.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to obtain a genome map of the rice, determine the
specific gene carried by the Chinese hybrid rice that is
responsible for its productivity, and use it to build a gene base
for hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, since the rice genome is the smallest and
most basic among those of crops, the project will also improve the
understanding of genomes of grain, corm and other corps, and will
therefore help launch genetic research on all the arable crops.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Longping, father of hybrid rice in China, said, "The super
hybrid rice genome project is very significant. It is an
effective way to raise productivity by combining crossbreeding
technology and genetic engineering."
</P>
<P>
He said that other breeding technologies, including the most
advanced genetic engineering, all end up focusing on hybridization
while the further improvement of breeding technology will rely on
progress of biological technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, the rice genome project will help Chinese
scientists to apply molecular breeding technology to crossbreeding.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Chinese scientists hope to start molecular
breeding research in three to five years.

<HEADLINE> Feature: French Twins Marry into China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGSHUO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Although French twins Vincenphe
and Vincent aren't identical, both wanted the same two things from
life: a wife and a home. Little did they know the answers to their
dreams were in a small Chinese town.
</P>
<P>
Vincenphe, the younger of the two by moments, visited China's
picturesque Yangshuo in the scenic spot Guilin, south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and fell in love with Chinese
culture, then with a pretty young lady who lived there.
</P>
<P>
Vincenphe used to travel a lot. But his marriage to Zhou Lizhen
and the mixed cultural atmosphere on West Street, where he started
up a restaurant, have settled him down.
</P>
<P>
The street laid with centuries-old stone and nestled between
green limestone peaks and the crystal-clear Lijiang River is now
just as well known for the many foreign tourists who stay there.
</P>
<P>
Vincenphe's enthusiastic descriptions of Chinese scenery and
culture so enchanted his twin Vincent that he left France to visit
Yangshuo in 1997, little dreaming he too would catch the love bug
in China.
</P>
<P>
"I was drinking a cup of tea in a cafe on West Street when I
first saw Qin Xiuming. She caught my eye like a flash," he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
The shy girl from the Zhuang ethnic minority was touched by
Vincent's ardor. She had just graduated from a secondary language
school, where she majored in English, and found a job in a cafe on
West Street.
</P>
<P>
"At first I doubted the sincerity of Vincent's passion, but now
there is no question of it," said Qin with a small smile.
</P>
<P>
She said when Vincent first sent her flowers, she didn't know
if she should take him seriously. Her parents warned her "a
foreigner can't be serious about love, let alone marriage. Stay
away from him." So she did.
</P>
<P>
Vincent continued to woo Qin in a broken version of their
common language -- English. Six months later they married.
</P>
<P>
They moved to France and love got its first big test. Qing, who
did not speak French, found herself idle and alone in a Paris
apartment, wondering if she had made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
A worried Vincent took his wife to his office, where he worked
as a home-appliance salesman, so she could see the demands of his
job.
</P>
<P>
"The most important element for the success of an international
marriage is that the couple should constantly try to understand
each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said she loves France but refuses to become a French
citizen. Vincent respects her choice, and has promised her they
will visit Yangshuo at least once every two years.
</P>
<P>
Vincent is even considering leaving his sales job in France and
settling in Yangshuo to help his brother manage his restaurant.
Vincenphe's Levotre Restaurant Francaise serves authentic French
cuisine and is designed to look like Qing Dynasty imperial palaces
in the Forbidden City of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
When they're all together, the Sino-French brothers and sisters-
in-law like to sit at the restaurant's outdoor tables, where they'
ve become a popular attraction on the tourist street.

The Evening Post Monday quoted the prime minister as saying
that although public opinion has appeared to support Todd going to
Sydney, she has "reservations."
</P>
<P>
"The only issue really is whether he is vulnerable to a
challenge if he were to win a medal. I can only assume the
Olympic committee (of New Zealand) has taken advice on that," the
Wellington-based newspaper quoted Clark as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said it would be "most unpleasant" for New Zealand if Todd
does win a medal but is challenged on the basis of the cocaine-
snorting allegations.
</P>
<P>
Todd, who is Double-Olympic champion and International
Equestrian Federation's event rider-of-the-century, will lead a
six-rider, nine-horse New Zealand eventing team at September's
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, Britain's Sunday Mirror has accused
Todd of taking cocaine and engaging in unprotected gay sex. But
Todd has refused to answer the allegations in Mirror newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Saving Chinese Prone to Spending Lottery Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that saving
Chinese usually become ungrudging after they hit a fortune in a
lottery.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,800 respondents in China's 26 provinces and
municipalities, 72.3 percent said they will spend the money right
away rather than put it into banks, according to the survey
conducted by China Welfare Lottery Issuing Center.
</P>
<P>
The items on the spending priority list of those surveyed
ranges from purchasing of house and cars to house decoration and
wedding, things that are too expensive for ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Some experts were encouraged by the results of the survey,
noting that lottery will be a boost to the country's domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
As they calculated, nearly four billion yuan will be put into
consumption if 10 billion yuan worth of charity lotteries are
issued every year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 39.52 billion yuan worth of lottery had been issued
by the end of 1999 since China began to issue charity lottery 13
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Steps Up Efforts to Crack Down Foreign Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Thai authorities are stepping
up efforts to prevent and suppress increasing transnational crimes
and criminals which may affect the country's security and
stability, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Bureau was among the security organizations
that have increased efforts to gather evidences of leading foreign
criminals on blacklists and sought appropriate measures to tackle
the problems, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Suspected foreign criminals, believed to have involved in
various crimes, had reportedly operated mainly in such major
cities as Bangkok, Pattaya, Hat Yai, and Chiang Mai.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested nearly 2,600 foreigners on various charges
over the past months, the report quoted Assistant Commissioner of
the Immigration Bureau Thepparant Rattanavanich as saying.
</P>
<P>
The charges included falsifying travel documents, visa
violations, running prostitution businesses, drug trade and
trafficking, human trafficking, and abductions for ransom, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The move coincides with Japan's call for closer cooperation
with Thai police to crack down on transnational crimes, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Nobutoshi Akako met Thai
National Police Chief Pornsak Durongkhaviboon recently to discuss
areas of cooperation between Thai and Japanese police forces.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will cover joint efforts to crack down
pickpocketing gangs which have targeted not only money, but also
passports of foreign tourists to collaborate with forgery gangs in
supplying false travel documents to immigration wishing to travel
to third countries.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Nepali FM on Furthering Sino-Nepal Ties  by Zhuang Meijie and Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The historical good relations
between Nepal and China dating back to thousands of years ago will
be further strengthened in the new century, Nepali Foreign
Minister Chakra Prasad Bastola predicted here recently.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on the occasion of the 45th
anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations
between Nepal and China, Bastola said that since the forming of
the diplomatic relations in 1955, the bilateral relations between
the two friendly nations have been developing even faster.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal and China have developed extensive relations at various
levels, especially in political, economic and trade cooperations,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"As close neighbors, Nepal and China don't have any outstanding
problems, and we support each other and share common views on
various international affairs for the common cause of the
developing world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bastola pointed out Nepal-China relations are always in steady
growth and constantly nurtured by the common policy of good-
neighborliness and commitment not to allow the respective
territory to be used for activities detrimental to the interest of
each other.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to work and interact like friends so that we
can solve any problems that may arise between us, and we give such
relations the highest importance," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the cordial political relations
between Nepal and China have made its extension into economic
cooperations, which, in turn, further consolidated the friendship.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, the Chinese government has assisted
Nepal's nation building, through economic and technical
cooperations, notably in building Nepal's infrastructure such as
roads, bridges, sports facilities, hydro-powers and so on, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We Nepalese people dearly cherish and appreciate the political
support and economic assistance extended to us by the Chinese
government and people," Bastola said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bastola spoke highly of the tremendous
progress China has made in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China
has achieved political stability and economic prosperity, which is
a great contribution to the world, especially to the regional
stability and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bastola believes that with the great potentiality and a
disciplined society, China will make a great leap forward in its
development in the future.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister hopes that Nepal and China will further
expand political, trade and economic cooperations, especially in
science and technology, in the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
"We expect big friendship from a big neighbor," he said with a
touch of humor.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Ministers to Be Summoned to Discuss Steps on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is expected to summon her cabinet of ministers on
Monday to discuss steps to be taken in connection with the
proposed constitutional reforms aiming at politically ending the
protracted civil war between government troops and Tamil Tiger
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Island newspaper reported Monday that Kumaratunga is keen
to push through the reforms before the dissolution of the
parliament on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The government of the ruling People's Alliance lacks the
required two-thirds majority for the passage of the reforms and
has entered into bipartisan talks with the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) to reach consensus and obtain the required
support in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNP, which holds the balance of power to make or
break the reforms, does not favor a debate on the reforms before
the dissolution of the parliament on the grounds that agreement
had still not been reached on several matters and that a wider
spectrum of society should be consulted.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist clergy, smaller political parties and several
other organizations have protested that they have not been
consulted about the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The government had in 1997 presented a political package for
the establishment of a Union of Regions, and had subsequently
agreed to considerably change it after discussions with the UNP.
</P>
<P>
Now with the UNP insisting that the reforms be delayed, the
president is contemplating reverting to the original package,
which has the support of the mainstream Tamil political parties.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet of ministers has been summoned mainly to decide on
what stand the government should take on the matter, which it sees
as a lasting solution to the ethnic conflict which has plagued the
country for the last 17 years and during which over 60,000 persons
have been killed.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Steps Up Aid to Displaced Mindanao Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has decided to provide humanitarian assistance to
the families displaced in the war-torn southern Philippine island
of Mindanao, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said the ICRC office in Davao, the largest city in
Mindanao, has been working closely with the Philippine Red Cross
to provide assistance for 10,450 families that have been displaced
within the provinces of North Cotabato, Bukidnon, Maguindanao,
Sarangani and North and South Lanao.
</P>
<P>
An upsurge of fighting between the Philippine armed forces and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the past few months on
the island of Mindanao has caused tens of thousands of civilians
to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, nearly 63,000 people temporarily
accommodated in 48 evacuation centers have thus received food and
other items.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Fourth-seed Michael Chang won
his first title since 1998 on Sunday when sixth-seed Jan-Michael
Gambill was forced to retire with a injury during the final of the
Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gambill began the match with his left knee wrapped. It had
been hurting him all week.
</P>
<P>
Gambill won the first set in a tie-break but injured his right
ankle late in the second, and he could no longer continue after
Chang took the set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Chang said to break through and win a title was
indeed special for him.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old player continued that he got a little emotional
with the victory because the last couple of years have been a
little bit tough.
</P>
<P>
The bad times started in 1998 when he played with wrist and
knee injuries during the year, but he finished outside top 20 for
the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
It was even worse last year. He struggled to enhance his
ranking, but failed to win a tournament, even to reach a final. In
October his ranking plummeted to 76 in the world.

Huangguoshu has worsened. During the outgoing dry period this year,
lots of wells and springs nearby dried up. At the same time,
rubbish accumulated in the past years destroyed the natural beauty,

JAKARTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is among the countries
in the world with the highest prevalence of typhoid fever,
statistics say.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted recently found the disease afflicts between
800,000 and 1.6 million people in Indonesia every year, killing
one percent to five percent of them, the Jakarta Post daily
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The endemic disease is prevalent among children and teenagers
the most, as 80 percent to 90 percent of Indonesians afflicted
with the fever are aged between two years old and 19 years old.
</P>
<P>
The research also showed that the most frequent cases of
typhoid fever were found in the age group of between 10 years old
and 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
Narain H. Punjabi, a medical research scientist said at a
seminar here on Saturday that children were more vulnerable to the
disease than adults because a child's immune system has not yet
fully developed.
</P>
<P>
"Most children also don't realize the importance of good
hygiene and sanitation. So they merely depend on adults to provide
them with food," he said.
</P>
<P>
"so it's best to keep good habits, Always wash your hands
before eating, eat food which has been washed properly and keep
the bathroom clean," said Soedjatmiko, a pediatrician at Cipto
Manunkusumo Hospital here, who also spoke at the seminar.

A survey by the China Consumers' Association and the China

lacked official licences.
</P>

Seventy-three of the tonic ads surveyed from March to June in

The survey covered 121 tonics advertised in introductory
brochures, in the press and on TV or the radio.

readjust the human body," according to a Ministry of Health
regulation.

Chinese consumers have scrambled for so-called tonics which are
described as panaceas, said Jia Yaguang, secretary-general of the

<HEADLINE> China to Rebuild Ancient Imperial Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Yuanmingyuan, China's greatest
ancient imperial palace destroyed by the Eight-Power Allied Forces
in the 1860s, will rise again after long years of white-hot
debates, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebuilt palace will compose of six parts, namely the
Western-style buildings, a cultural relics exhibition, outdoor
relics, a leisure and entertainment area and a service and
administration area.
</P>
<P>
Whether to revive the ruins, which was first raised in 1983,
remains a much-debated topic among experts. Proponents said
renovation will exhibit Chinese imperial culture while opponents
insisted the ruins serve as a good reminder of China's humiliating
past.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge said that the palace to be rebuilt will
not be a simple replication of the original one, which was built
in Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) but was burned to ruins by British and
French troops in 1860.
</P>
<P>
The new construction will make up less than 10 percent of the
ruined one with "most of it are constructions such as pavilions
and bridges", the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The renovation mainly aims to keep the relics and preserve
them in a better way", the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction plan is already on the agenda of the Beijing
Urban Planning and Designing Institute. However the exact date of
ground-breaking is not set yet.
</P>
<P>
Ten institutes and 600-odd families inside the present
Yuanmingyuan Park will be moved out by the end of the year, and
shops that do not square with the style of the palace will be
closed when the work is finished.
</P>
<P>
However, the park will not be closed during the construction
and visitors can see the relics and renovation at the same time.

<P>
This was the first time for Williams to beat the top-seeded

past two finals.
</P>
<P>
Williams, seeded second and ranked third, thus extended her
unbeaten streak to 11 matches after her loss to Arantxa Sanchez-
Vacario in the quarterfinals the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Williams was composed throughout the 79-minute match, while
Davenport, who won the Australian Open this year, appeared slow
and unfocused in the first set.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Davenport mounted a comeback for an early 3-
1 before Williams broke her serve in the following game to narrow
the margin, and tied the set 3-all.
</P>
<P>
Williams broke Davenport again to go up 5-4 before serving out
the championship match with a well-placed forehand.

Making her professional debut in the Bank of the West in 1994,
Williams has played in the tournament six times, but Sunday was
her first title.

<P>
XI'AN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Part of the Yellow River, China's
second longest river and one of the muddiest rivers in the world,
has become clear due to a protracted drought in the middle reaches
of the River.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Shaanxi province in northwest China
has had little rainfall. Local residents were surprised to see
that the usually muddy river had become clear.
</P>
<P>
Because of the drought, local people also have to face serious
water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Historically, northern Shaanxi was rich in forests and water
resources, but the eco-system had got worse due to large
population and over-farming, according to experts.

<P>
NANNING, July 31 (Xinhua) --Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in
south China hosted 21.58 million tourists in the first six months
of the year and earned more than one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, 580,000 overseas tourists visited the
region, generating 130 million U.S. dollars. Both the figures
show marked increases from last year, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the region received 21 million domestic
tourists and earned 7.3 billion yuan (about 879 million U.S.
dollars), up 7.5 percent and 7.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi abounds in tourism resources. It has built more than
700 scenic sites including the Yintan State Tourism and Holiday
Village in Beihai City on the Beibu Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the region's tourism boom to its
efforts to improve publicity in tourism, open up new tourism
markets, and improve services.
</P>
<P>
While expanding tourist markets by attracting more visitors
from Europe and America, the region sent out early this year a
special tourism promotion mission, traveling 12,000 km to other

<HEADLINE> Silkworm Fodder Developed in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Southwest
China Agricultural University recently developed a kind of
silkworm fodder to replace white mulberry leaves.
</P>
<P>
The fodder was made up with bean cake, bean dregs, starch,
sugar, cellulose, vitamins and other similar nutritious
ingredients contained in mulberry leaves.
</P>
<P>
Silkworms fed on the fodder turn out whiter silk than silkworms
that eat mulberry leaves. The output and quality of the silk
turned out by the silkworm fed with the fodder are roughly the
same as that fed with mulberry leaves.
</P>
<P>
The fodder has been put into batch production in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, one of China's leading silkworm raisers.
</P>
<P>
China is a major silk producer in the world. Its silk output
makes up one eighth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Production of the new fodder will make it possible for China to
raise silkworm all year round, and reduce production costs, said
Wu Dayang, member of the China Sericulture Society.

GUANGZHOU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- If Huang Zhijun did not quit his
job in south China's Guangdong Province and go to the countryside,
he would have found himself still struggling with other urban
dwellers for a small apartment after graduating from college
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
But now Huang is an owner of an orchard, which sold more than
30,000 fruit tree samplings and 1,000 kg cash fruits this year.
</P>
<P>
At a conference for ordering non-staple agricultural produce in
Gaozhou in Guangdong, China's major fruit grower, Huang was busy
seeking buyers for his 5,000 kg of longans that are going to be
harvested in October.
</P>
<P>
"The rural sector has provided me better prospects financially
than the cities," said that young man.
</P>
<P>
Like Huang, many young talented people from the city are
looking to China's rural and coastal provinces. These highly
educated people are expected to greatly invigorate the rural
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of 20 townships in the Pearl River Valley
in Guangdong, only 4.2 percent of young people there have obtained
a higher education.
</P>
<P>
"In order to transform the rural sector from traditional
farming to one of industrialized agriculture, talented
professional are in great demand," said Wan Qingliang, director
with the Guangdong Youth Federation.
</P>
<P>
He said that in China's fast developing provinces such as Henan,
Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong, many young people have become
successful in establishing their own farm-related businesses. They
have turned out to be pioneers in introducing advanced elements
into the rural business.
</P>
<P>
In Zhongshan City, six college graduates who went to Zhangxi
Village to seek their fortune bought seven computers and solicited
investments and potential projects via the Net.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government is encouraging the rural sector, more
talented Chinese will make their way to the countryside, said Wang

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Discuss Ways to Support Palestinian Peace Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held
talks on Monday with Jordanian King Abdullah II on ways to support
the Palestinians and their stand in peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries are coordinating their supportive stances for the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state which the
Palestinians have said they will declare on September 13, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after the talks in
Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
There has been an extensive coordination of positions among Arab
states, which is based on a desire for negotiations to continue
towards the establishment of a Palestinian state on the date set by
the Palestinian leadership, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He added that both Egypt and Jordan would recognize such a
Palestinian state whenever it is declared, and stressed the need to
respect the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions in
Palestinian-Israeli peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah, whose countries signed peace treaties with
Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively, focused their talks on the "
very important and sensitive subject of Jerusalem," said Moussa who
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
It was in the interests of Arab countries for the Palestinian-
Israeli peace talks to continue and succeed on the basis of the U.
N. resolutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah arrived in Alexandria from Morocco earlier in the day
and ended the brief visit after the talks. His meeting with Mubarak
came amid intensified Egyptian contacts with Arab countries after
the failure of the Palestinian-Israeli Camp David summit last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had flown to Saudi Arabia and Libya for discussions on
the Mideast peace talks and met with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Muslim countries support the Palestinian stand that
Arab East Jerusalem is part of the territories occupied by Israel
in the 1967 Mideast War and should be returned.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of the
future Palestinian state. But Israel insists that the holy city is
its "eternal and indivisible capital," a claim not internationally
recognized.

JERUSALEM -- Right-wing presidential candidate Moshe Katsav was
elected the eighth president of the State of Israel in a special
parliamentary vote Monday morning, dealing a severe blow to Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak as he supported Katsav's rival Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, who is from the right-wing Likud faction, won the second
round of the election with a vote of 63-57, which was sufficient
for declaring victory as the law-required vote is 61 in the 120-

The development may give Barak more breathing space for forming
a new and more solid majority in the Knesset and keeping pushing
forward Israeli-Arab peace process.

All the three no-confidence motions, submitted by the major

<HEADLINE> Liberia Warned to Face International Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has been warned to face
international sanctions unless it stops supporting Sierra Leone's
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) fighting against the
government, reports reaching here on Monday said.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after a high-level talks in London between
British and Sierra Leone officials.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has also been warned to end its involvement in the
smuggling of diamonds from the RUF-controlled diamond areas in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United Nations Security Council imposed
an embargo on Sierra Leone's diamond exports, but diamonds with
government authorization would not be affected by the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has reportedly been backing the RUF during Sierra Leone
's nine-year civil war and has benefited from the diamond-for-
armament business in the war-torn west African country.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Government Determined to Choke Rebels of War Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone said here
Monday that it is determined to cut off the ability of the rebels
to fuel "their atrocious war against people," and reduce the
incidence of illegal diamond exports.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Alhaji Mohammed Deen, Sierra Leonean
minister of mineral resources, took the floor at the two-day
public hearing on illicit diamonds trade in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
"The Government has made revision and improvements of the
current export practice," the minister said. "The Government of
Sierra Leone is determined to establish a new mining, marketing
and exporting regime for diamonds."
</P>
<P>
The proposed regime will cut off the ability of the rebels to
fuel their atrocious war against the people of Sierra Leone,
reduce the incidence of illegal diamond exports and ensure that
the people of Sierra Leone derive the fullest benefits from their
diamonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regime, if established, will also deter any group with
criminal or otherwise unlawful intent from operating in Sierra
Leone, and encourage the international diamond market to
contribute to peace by refusing to deal in "conflict" diamonds
from Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For nine years, the people of Sierra Leone have suffered the
consequences of the illegal use of the nation's diamonds as a tool
for destruction raped, amputation, abduction, indiscriminate
killings and other atrocities against innocent civilians," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, the Government is determined to use the nation's
diamonds as a tool for development, progress, wealth and
prosperity for its people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Sanction Committee against Sierra
Leonean rebels Monday opened a public hearing on illicit diamonds
trade in the West African country. The hearing is designed to shed
more light on how the gems are traded for arms that have fueled
the civil war in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia started the destruction of
surplus military hardware in Georgia on Monday in the presence of
numerous journalists, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move was made in line with Moscow's commitments to the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
featured the cutting up of a T-72 tank, armored personnel carriers
and armored combat vehicles at the Russian Trans- Caucasian Army
Group's repair plant in Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
A total of 116 pieces of equipment will be destroyed before
December 20, Interfax reported in a dispatch from Tbilisi, the
Georgian capital, quoting Lieutenant Colonel Valery Ishchenko,head
of the plant's repair service.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze praised
Russia for its "constructive position" in negotiations on the
withdrawal of its military bases from the Central Asian republic.
</P>
<P>
The third round of bilateral negotiations, which ended in
Moscow over the weekend, "formed a good beginning, and the
decisions that were reached are quite normal," Shevardnadze said
in a regular radio with national radio.
</P>
<P>
"If the problem of the withdrawal of Russian military bases
from the territory of Georgia is resolved with the Russian
administration painlessly, it will become a huge stimulus to take
relations between the two countries to a higher level, where there
will be more trust, more cooperation," Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in Moscow on Saturday, the two sides agreed
that August 1 Russia will start withdrawing military equipment
from its bases on Georgian territory. By December 31, no more than
153 tanks, 241 armored cars and 140 artillery systems will be left

MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia is considering buying more
long-range bombers and cruise missiles from Ukraine, the Interfax
news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Air Force and the Ukrainian company of
Ukrspetsexport will soon start negotiations in Moscow on the
purchase of Tu-160 and Tu-95MS strategic bombers and cruise
missiles, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Russia obtained eight Tu-160s, three Tu-95MSs and nearly 600 X-
22 cruise missiles from Ukraine last year. By delivering them to
Russia, Ukraine paid 285 million U.S. dollars of its debt for fuel
supplies, which amounted to 1 billion dollars, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted experts as saying that Kiev may offer three Tu-160s
and seven Tu-95MSs that are in good repair and it wants the talks
to cover the purchase of four disassembled Tu-95MS bombers, some
80 airborne long-range cruise missiles and equipment for the
planes.
</P>
<P>
Before the planes were sent to Russia, Ukraine had 19 Tu-160
bombers and 21 Tu- 95MS bombers. The planes are equipped with
cruise missiles that can carry nuclear warheads.

<P>
Restoration of the unified electricity system in the Trans-
Caucasus and parallel operations with Unified Energy Systems of
Russia would make it possible to export Russian electricity to
Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The issue can me studied as an element of bilateral
cooperation and with attracting third countries," Gavrin said.
</P>
<P>
Bitaraf noted that Iran's electricity consumption is rising by
8-10 percent a year and that it is interested in electricity
cooperation with Russia.

<HEADLINE> Bush Nominated As Republican Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
was formally nominated to be the U.S. Republican presidential
candidate for the 2000 election here Monday at the party's
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
Bush was put into nomination by Texas Lt. Governor Rick Perryun
in the opening day session. He won the nomination unopposed, with
no other names being offered.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, directing the convention
proceedings, said the roll call of the states would begin Monday
night and go through Iowa, then continue on subsequent nights to
conclude Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bush campaigned in Ohio Monday as part of his bus tour of six
Democrat-leaning states, including Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky
and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor will arrive in Philadelphia on August 3 to
formally accept the presidential nomination on the final night of
the convention.
</P>
<P>
Bush, 54, is the eldest son of former President George Bush. He
defeated Arizona Senator John McCain in the presidential primaries
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
If he wins the November 7 election, Bush would be the first
presidential son since John Quincy Adams in 1825 to follow his
father, John Adams, into the White House.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Bush was elected governor of Texas, the second largest
state in the United States. He won reelection in a landslide
victory in 1998 and emerged as the Republicans' best hope of
winning back the presidency in 2000 after eight years' rule of a
Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
Bush stepped onto the presidential campaign trail in 1999 with
an appealing message of inclusion and racial healing twined with
tax cuts and a call for a stronger defense. His "compassionate
conservatism" was echoed in the Republican platform adopted Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bush gained a bachelor's degree from Yale and got an MBA from
Harvard Business School. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and the
couple have twin daughters.

<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's newly elected Members
of Parliament should contribute positively and constructively to
the economic and social problems facing the country, Zimbabwe's
Deputy Speaker of Parliament Edna Madzongwe said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Closing an induction seminar for parliamentarians, Madzongwe
said legislatures should remember that they are mandated to
influence the decision-making process towards human development
and the improvement of quality of life for Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
"A lot is demanded of you by the present as well as future
generations, such as ensuring good governance through well thought
out policies, laws and priorities," she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Members of Parliament to utilize the knowledge
they have gained to effectively discharge their duties, saying she
is looking forward to positive, constructive and courageous
exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences in all parliamentary
debates.
</P>
<P>
The induction seminar, sponsored by the United Nations
Development Program, is aimed at equipping new parliamentarians
with skills for effective participation in debates in the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dollar Depreciated by 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Tuesday
devalued its currency by 24 percent, from 38 Zimbabwean dollars to
the U.S. dollar to 50 Zimbabwean dollars to the U.S. dollar, in an
effort to promote export competitiveness and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As part of a package of short-term economic stabilization
measures adopted by the cabinet to arrest the current economic
decline, the new decision will also help unlock foreign exchange
resources and enable the economy to begin to recover, said
Zimbabwean Finance and Economic Development Minister Simba Makoni
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter the exchange rate will be managed within a 10
percent band in line with inflationary developments, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would not allow a massive free fall of
the currency because of the implications it would have on prices
of commodities on the market, stressing that a competitive rate
should be established for building up foreign currency reserves
that have dropped to unsustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate has been maintained at 38 Zimbabwean dollars
to the U.S. dollar through an informal arrangement between the
Reserve Bank and the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was meant to minimize exchange rate volatility
and to contain speculative behavior in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The informal arrangement, however, began to show cracks during
the second half of 1999, following continued increases in
inflation and persistent downward trend in export performance.
</P>
<P>
Makoni is expected to present to the parliament on Wednesday
the full package of short term economic stabilization measures
adopted by the cabinet.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will invite
bidders for the concession of operation of the Zambia Railways
Limited (ZRL) as part of the ongoing privatization program,
according to the latest issue of Privatization News magazine.
</P>
<P>
ZRL is part of the former Rhodesia railway system, with the
main line of the railway running from Victoria Falls Bridge on the
southern border with Zimbabwe to Lusaka, Kapiri Mposhi, junction
with Tanzania-Zambia Railway and then to the Copperbelt Province
with a total track length of 1,273 kilometers. All lines are
single track.
</P>
<P>
The concession of ZRL offers an opportunity for the government
to remove itself from the delivery of primarily commercial
services while retaining ownership of the key infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) will advertize both
locally and internationally the concession of the ZRL from July
2000. Adequate time will be allowed for potential bidders to carry
out due diligence investigations before a bidders' conference.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that the concession transactions will be
achieved by June 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Family and
Woman Promotion Candida Celeste has stressed the great importance
of women in African societies, the official Radio Nacional de
Angola (RNA) said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The female stratum is the fundamental element for the
construction of societies", Celeste said when addressing a
ceremony for the 38th anniversary of the establishment of the Pan-
African Women Organization (PAWO), which was held here on Monday
in commemoration of the African Woman's Day, July 31.
</P>
<P>
"Woman is with no doubt the fundamental element of societies,
besides her mission of man's companion in the battles for self-
determination of the African people," Celeste said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she appealed to the feminine stratum to double their
efforts with a view to achieving peace in order to "fight for
development and progress of the African continent".
</P>
<P>
Niapou Traore, secretary of Information of the PAWO, said that
there exists a big gap between the legitimate ambitions of women
and their achievements, and called on the African governments to
take measures to allow women to accomplish their duties.
</P>
<P>
She also praised the institutions of the Angolan government for
the actions they realize towards gender equality and encouraged
them to stick to determination and positive efforts which are
their absolute tool of fight on the road for equality and
emancipation.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-African Women Organization was founded on July 31, 1962
in Tanzania by a group of African women from some independent
countries and representatives from liberation organizations.

Mbeki will be accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana

The source said it is purely coincidental that Mbeki's visit is

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Unions to Hold One-Day Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Acting President of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Isaac Matongo said Tuesday that
the proposed three-day strike will now take place on Wednesday
only.
</P>
<P>
The stayaway scheduled for Wednesday to Friday was intended to
force the government to restore law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
Matongo told the Zimbabwe News Agency that ZCTU had decided
that the stayaway be held for a day only as a warning to the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a firing shot to the government to reconsider
restoration of law and order in the country," said Matongo, adding:
"If the government does not do that we will go back to the drawing
board for more days."
</P>
<P>
He urged the workers to stay at home, saying it would distance
itself from those who would demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
He said action by ZCTU was not politically motivated to support
white commercial farmers, who are allegedly harassed by war
veterans occupying farms.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said Tuesday that the police
would maintain a high level of alertness and visibility to protect
law abiding citizens from undue harassment by those orchestrating
the stayaway.
</P>
<P>
He said members of the public were free to go about their usual
day-to-day activities and must immediately report to the nearest
police station should they be forced to join in any activity they
did not want.
</P>
<P>
President of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change
Morgan Tsvangirai endorsed Wednesday's strike and urged all
Zimbabweans to support the move if they are to "restore peace and
order in this country".
</P>
<P>
He said the rule of law must be restored if the country was to
make any meaningful progress.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Continue Protecting Elephants: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
continue its efforts to protect elephants in the country until
their population returns to 280,000, Zambian Tourism Minister
Cecil Holmes told the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has no plans to crop elephants in the country
because the population of the jumbos is already small; instead it
is putting in place more measures to protect the elephants from
poaching, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said at present the elephant population in the country
stands at about 35,000, a drastic reduction from the elephant
population in the 1960s and 1970s when the population was about
280,000.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambian Vice President Christone Tembo, the
elephant population has declined as a result of rampant poaching
in the country.

LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo will flag off a national tree-planting campaign on August
6, Nigerian press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Environment Alhaji Adamu who disclosed this in
Abuja on Monday, reaffirmed the government's commitment to
checking desert encroachment, soil erosion and land degradation
through its forestation program.
</P>
<P>
He said the theme of the campaign would be "Poverty,
Environment and Forests" in recognition of the roles forests play
in poverty alleviation among the rural populace and in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The campaign would be managed by governors at state and local
council levels by their chairmen, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that states had been urged to designate
sites of not less than 50 hectares in each local council area
where yearly continuous tree-planting exercise would be carried
out until the site was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Above 70 percent of Nigeria's territory was covered by forests
in the 1960s. But with the booming of oil and manufacturing
industry, many parts of the country's ecological systems have been
damaged and the forestation rate degraded to some 30 percent now.

has showed strong opposition to Prime Minister Carlos Veiga's
decision to step down to prepare campaign for the country's
presidency in 2001, the Portuguese News Agency Lusa reported here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the African Party for the
Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV) Monday said that it would seek
a meeting with the prime minister to express its "perplexity and
indignation over the prime minister's decision".
</P>
<P>
Veiga announced last Saturday that he had the intention to run
for president in 2001 and would not continue to act as the country
's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Antonio Gualberto do Rosario, who replaced Veiga as
leader of the ruling Movement for Democracy (MPD) on July 1, was
nominated as acting prime minister of the west African island
country.
</P>
<P>
PAICV's leader Jose Maria Neves said the decision made by Veiga
showed "profound disrespect for the rules of the democratic game",
adding that Veiga should continue as prime minister as he has only
stated his "intention to run".
</P>
<P>
Neves said that under Cape Verde's law, a citizen is only a
candidate for president when the respective candidacy application
has been publicly accepted by the country's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
PAICV was Cape Verde's ruling party in 1975 to 1991. The
country has since then been governed by the MPD.

JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from 20 African
countries gathered here Monday, attending a two-week course aimed
at training African trade negotiators for the next round of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) talks, South African Business Day
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The course, which is funded by the Australian Agency for
International Development, was announced by Australian Prime
Minister John Howard last year at the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"As both South Africa and Australia know, winning concessions
from such tough negotiators as the European Union requires a
highly professional trade negotiation team with an in-depth
knowledge of many complex issues," Australia's High Commissioner
to South Africa David Connolly said at the opening ceremony of the
course.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the last WTO round in Seattle showed, there was
growing disquiet among some members of the international community
about where international trade liberalization was taking them.
</P>
<P>
"Questions of equity and the share of the developing world in
the opportunities offered by globalization are increasingly being
asked," said Connolly, adding: "As far as developing countries are
concerned (about the answers), it depends on how successfully they
argue their respective cases during negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that developing countries need representatives
capable of effectively delivering their message to better secure
their key trade interests in negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Central Bank Takes Measures to Protect Local Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- To restrict illegal purchase of
foreign currencies and protect the value of local currency naira,
Nigeria's Central Bank has ordered the country's banks to reject
collecting import duty of transactions without form "M".
</P>
<P>
Form "M" is a document required by importers to provide
information on the nature of goods being imported and guarantee
that the importer has the necessary funds to back up the foreign
currency value to pay for the goods.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Tuesday quoted the Central Bank of Nigeria as
saying that the move was in response to the persisting high demand
for foreign currencies at the Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market (
IFEM) by banks.
</P>
<P>
The move was also meant to make it easier for the apex bank to
detect illegal foreign exchange purchases, especially those
without the prescribed imported items, according to local
newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry has been inundated recently with reports
of illegal foreign exchange dealings by banks through their
clients which caused the persistent high demands in IFEM that have
continued to depreciate the value of naira against major foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's currency naira has seen a quick depreciation from a
former rate of 100 naira to one U.S. dollar to that of about 115
naira to one dollar within last month alone, causing fears that
the country's fragile economy basing on imports may be damaged.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Ruling Party Denies Rumors on Savimbi's Capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Angolan Ruling Party has denied in Luanda rumors that the Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi had been captured by the government
troops, the official Radio Nacional de Angola (RNA) reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a comment to RNA, Joao Lourenco stressed that the goal of
the government troops was not to eliminate Savimbi, but the rebel
army of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (
UNITA).
</P>
<P>
This objective is "being reached", as the "basic work has been
done", said Lourenco, adding that Savimbi's conventional army has
been broken up and the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) are making
sure there are conditions to assure that Savimbi has no chance to
continue the guerrilla actions.
</P>
<P>
In the Angolan capital city Luanda, rumors on Savimbi's capture
have been circulating in the past several days. After a government
offensive at the turn of the year, coded as "Restauro Operation",
the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi have been expelled out of major
cities and towns in most provinces of the southern African country
except the Moxico Province, where there are some regions still
under the control of the rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) has
received a credit facility of 31 million U.S. dollars from seven
international banks to support the bank's export and import
business department, the East African Standard newspaper reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KCB Chief Executive Gareth George said Monday at the signing
ceremony in the capital Nairobi that the syndicated loan comes
into effect after the expiry of a credit line of 15 million
dollars and it will be available to customers involved in import
and export business in the country.
</P>
<P>
He described the new credit as a sign of confidence in the bank
despite the problems the bank is now facing.
</P>
<P>
The providers of the credit include the African Export-Import
Bank, the Rabobank International of Netherlands, DG Bank of
Germany, Nedcor Bank of South Africa, among others.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the International Monetary Fund approved a three-
year loan amounting to 198 million dollars for Kenya under the

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Service to Improve in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's first mobile phone
company Safaricom Ltd said it will offer better service and
competitive tariffs for its customers by implementing a major
expansion scheme, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The target of the expansion scheme was to ensure at least 15
percent of Kenya's population to have access to quality mobile
phone services in three to four years," the company's managing
director Michael Joseph said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Within the next two weeks, Safaricom will rapidly expand its
coverage in Kenya's capital Nairobi and its major port Mombassa,
according to the managing director.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the move taken by Safaricom Ltd is to
prevent losing customers to rival company, Kencell.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday the second mobile operator in the country Kencell
announced that the connection fee for a cellular phone would be 3,
000 shillings (40 U.S. dollars), 40 percent to 60 percent cheaper
than the current market prices.
</P>
<P>
Compared with neighboring countries of Tanzania and Uganda, the
charges for mobile phone services in Kenya are rather high.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring down the tariffs and create a conducive
investment environment, the Kenyan government broke the monopoly
of the Safaricom last year by allowing competition in the field.

LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has called on its member states to uphold
self sustainability in social and economical development, The Post
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sindiso Ngwenya, acting Secretary-General of COMESA, said at
the ongoing Logical Planning Workshop for COMESA Cargo Tracking
System held here, facilitation of traffic and management of
information system was another way to achieve sustainable economic
and social progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the workshop, which drew participants from different
countries within the region, the European Union and the Economic
Commission for Africa, was aimed at speeding up the preparation of
a successor project to the current Advanced Cargo Information
Systems.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said the original project could not continue because it
was not properly designed to deal with the issues of cargo
transportation and tracking.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said the objective was to come up with a project that
would provide an efficient management of transport logistics and
tracking cargo consignments for the benefit of the transport and
trading community.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as far as transport was concerned, tracking
information is important to compile a data base of transport-
related statistics and performance indicators for the purpose of

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-president George
Saitoti has cautioned employers not to discriminate against those
infected with HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
"We need to protect the democratic and human rights of people
living with HIV/AIDS on issues like health, security, and freedom
from inhuman and degrading treatment," Saitoti was quoted by
Tuesday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti also appealed to insurance companies and travel agents
not to be biased against such people when addressing the opening
of a three-day conference on Monday with about 200 HIV-positive
Kenyans attending in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president welcomed the formation of a national network
of people living with HIV/AIDS, praising their courage in
admitting their HIV status.
</P>
<P>
"This can be an important way of breaking the silence
surrounding the pandemic and breaking down barriers between those
living with HIV/AIDS and others," said Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
He also urged HIV-positive Kenyans to fight the scourge
actively on an equal basis with other people.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-sponsored by the Kenya's National AIDS
Control Council and the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, was
aimed at encouraging HIV-positive people to be open about their
status and advocating greater involvement in the national crusade
of the epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Double Assistance May End Africa Aid Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- African countries can end
their dependence on international aid next decade if the current
amount of assistance is doubled to give a push to their economies,
a U.N. report has said.
</P>
<P>
The report, released recently by the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development, said a study on capital flows and growth
in Africa suggests that the only feasible way to end aid
dependence is to launch a massive aid program that will allow
domestic savings and external private flows to gradually replace
official flows, the independent Guardian newspaper here reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An increase in official flows to 20 billion U.S. dollars could
trigger a virtuous circle of rising national savings and
investment and faster growth in sub-Saharan Africa, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, sustainable and rapid growth should attract
external private capital flow. Donor fatigue would thus give way
to investor enthusiasm and private capital would gradually replace
official flows, it explained.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. economists draw their conclusion on lessons from
experiences in Asia and Latin America. They assume that a 6-
percent growth target, with domestic investment rising at 22
percent, would increase savings and capital consumption by some 30
percent at the end of the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the net total capital inflows to sub-
Saharan Africa, excluding Nigeria, have declined over the past
three decades. Private flows today represent less than 2 percent
of GDP for the region, which is half the average in other
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Identifies More Land for Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
identified another 3,041 farms, measuring about five million
hectares, for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Msika, chairman of the National Land Acquisition
Committee, said Monday night in a statement that the farms were
now at various advanced stages of processing for gazetting,
acquisition and resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Msika said that "the whole exercise is being undertaken against
the government goal of acquiring about five million hectares from
the commercial farming sector for distribution to the landless
people for fairness and greater productivity."
</P>
<P>
He said it was the government's belief that the latest exercise
would go a long way toward meeting the huge land demand in the
communal sector, as well as lay a firm and durable basis for
stability in the country, local newspapers reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is also the government's expectation that all stakeholders,
including political groups and the commercial farmers, will come
in full support of the exercise, which is national in intention,
scope and benefit," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"To facilitate the implementation of this program, the National
Land Acquisition Committee will henceforth meet everyday to ensure
the success of the implementation process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already identified 804 farms, which were
gazetted for acquisition at the beginning of last month.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Army to Spearhead Land Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army has now
taken center stage in the land resettlement program, having been
brought in to help with the logistics of the massive movement of
people to the acquired farms before the onset of the rains in
November, The Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 families are ready to be resettled on the land
that has been acquired by the government under the fast-track
resettlement program, which is designed to bring stability to the
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The army will provide logistics and set up communication
centers countrywide as the government speeds up the land
redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Land Ignatius
Chombo, who is also Minister of Local Government, Public Works and
National Housing, said in an interview on Monday that the army
would take care of the relocation of thousands of land-starved
people by providing transport.
</P>
<P>
"The involvement of the army is to do with the sharing of
transport and personnel. It has the vehicles needed to move
people from one point to the other. It will also establish a
communication center to ensure decisions are made fast and
implemented," Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
The government has to date acquired 211 farms, measuring 560,
000 hectares, on which more than 37,000 families will be resettled
on plots of at least 15 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Resettlement Joseph Made
told The Herald newspaper that it was no secret that white
commercial farmers use only 30 percent of the arable farming land
they have.
</P>
<P>
"This means two-thirds of the 12 million hectares they have
should find its way to the majority of the people," Made said.

<P>
The last five government changes in Mexico have been

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rebound From Selloff Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rebounded
Monday as investors returned to the market for bargain-hunting
after a big selloff last week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 10.81 at 10,521.98.
The blue chip index fell 2 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 103.99 at 3,
766.99, recovering from a big loss of 431.45 points or 10.5
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 10.94 at 1,430.83.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose as investors moved in the market to search for
stocks in lower prices following last week's decline. Hewlett
Packard and American Express led the Dow's advance and chip makers
and Internet and computer companies, which include Oracle and
Yahoo!, drove the Nasdaq index higher.
</P>
<P>
But traders remained nervous about higher interest rates when
they went hunting bargains.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged Friday after a government report said the U.
S. gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in
the second quarter. The stronger-than-expected growth renewed
fears of higher rates because it runs against a majority belief
that the U.S. economy is slowing after six hikes in rates in the
past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE rose 1.47 at 640.63 and the American Stock Exchange
index rose 3.64 at 906.44. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 10.42 at 500.64.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,723 up, 1,172 down and 505
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 925.23 million shares from 974.62
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> British Army Dismantles Security Post in N.Irleand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain began to dismantle an army
observation post in an area of Northern Ireland, police said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fortified observation tower dominates the center of the
town of Crossmaglen, in South Armagh.
</P>
<P>
It was built in 1976 in the strongly republican area and was
being taken down in line with Britain's program of
demilitarization of Northern Ireland as part of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Police said in a statement that after talks with the army,
Northern Ireland's chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, "has
today announced that work will immediately commence to demolish
the observation tower situated in the square in Crossmaglen".
</P>
<P>
The South Armagh countryside bordering the Irish Republic was
dubbed "bandit country" during 30 years of guerrilla conflict over
British rule of Northern Ireland because of the high level of
attacks on British forces.
</P>
<P>
The British government hoped to take "substantial measures"to
normalize security arrangements by June 2001, the new deadline by
which both London and Dublin aim to secure full implementation of
the Good Friday Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Demands Open Markets to Complete Cocaine Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia will make a call to
the United States and the European Union to open their markets to
Bolivian products as a way to compensate its efforts made to
eradicate coca production.
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Lupo, minister of economic development, said at a
press conference in the capital city of La Paz Monday that Bolivia
must substitute an economy based on the growth of coca for another
one based on alternate development, exports and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that when the "coca-zero" goal by the year 2002, there
won't be a further need for foreign assistance. There will only be
a need for open markets in the United States and Europe as a
compensation for the economic loss of tons of drugs prevented from
going out of Bolivian territory.
</P>
<P>
Lupo said that there is not a formal draft of this plan yet.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the coca leaf eradication program, along
with other steps considered in the Customs Law, has had a "
devastating" effect on the Bolivian commercial sector, which in
some regions has suffered a fall of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia has cleared during the last three years over 30,000
hectares of coca leaf crops. Nonetheless, there are still other 5,
000 hectares more to clear.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Guillermo Fortun said that Bolivia will have
eradicated all of the illegal crops by the end of 2001, that is, a
year ahead of the schedule set by the Dignity Plan, elaborated to
wipe out illegal crops.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with foreign journalists, Fortun warned that
without an economic alternative, peasants will go back to coca
leaf production.
</P>
<P>
He added that the eradication should be carried out through a "
nation-wide state policy" and a "permanent labor" to be observed
by future governments.

<HEADLINE> Germany Auctions Frequencies For 3-Generation Mobile Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Berlin, July 31 (Xinhua) -- German post-and-telecommunication
authorities on Monday started an auction to allocate radio
frequencies for the third-generation of mobile telephone.
</P>
<P>
The auction is participated by seven companies or consortiums,
consisting of mostly big European telecommunication firms, which
are bidding for four to six licenses on the use of frequencies for
the so-called UMTS, the universal mobile telecommunication system.
</P>
<P>
Umts can transfer data theoretically hundreds of times faster
than the currently used GSM-moded mobilephones and when such
system is put in use as planned in 2003, Germany will be one of
few countries which lead in application of advanced mobile
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
The auction is also expected to bring billions of Deutsch
Marks in revenue to the Federal government.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 12.5 Million U.S. Dollars Disbursement to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) has completed the first review of Rwanda's second annual
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and
approved a 12.5 million U.S. dollars disbursement under this
program, Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a press release from the IMF as saying
that the newly approved amount brings the total disbursements
under the three-year program to about 56.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The (IMF) directors commended the Rwandan authorities for their
success in maintaining macro-economic stability with solid growth
and low inflation," said Shigemitsu Sugisaki, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chairman of the IMF, in the press release
after the Executive Board's discussions on Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"They welcomed the strong measures the authorities have taken
to address the difficulties in the fiscal area faced in 1999, and
to accelerate structural reforms where progress has been slower
than envisaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this has provided a basis for the completion of the
review and a consolidation of Rwanda's good track record of policy
performance.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities were encouraged to vigorously implement the
recently initiated measures to improve revenue collection,
including the strengthening of tax and customs administration and
envisaged introduction of the Value Added Tax in early 2001," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shigemitsu highlighted that the domestic resource mobilization
is essential for ensuring the sustainability of Rwanda's social
and other anti-poverty spending programs in the medium term while
allowing a decline in its heavy dependence on external aid over
time.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials noted with satisfaction that the Rwandan
authorities, when faced with revenue shortfalls, has protected the
envisaged increase in recurrent social spending and has been able
to reduce expenditure in non-priority areas.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the importance of putting in place a medium-term
expenditure framework-linking budget lines more directly to
envisaged outcomes as well as adequate expenditure tracking
systems and beneficiary surveys to monitor the impact of spending.
</P>
<P>
The IMF directors encouraged the Rwandan authorities to further
enhance the level and efficiency of social and other anti-poverty
spending and to identify such priority spending items in the
budget, starting with mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
They also encouraged the Rwandan authorities to continue their
efforts to enhance the transparency of the budget preparation and
execution process, systematically produce public accounts and
submit government financial operations to audits by the Auditor
General.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Finance Donald Kaberuka hailed the support
by the IMF which he said will balance the deteriorating terms of
trade and high exchange rates of the Rwandan currency against
foreign currencies.
