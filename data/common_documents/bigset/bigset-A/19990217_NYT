<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- O.J. Simpson's Heisman Memorial Trophy fetched
$230,000 at an auction Tuesday intended to raise money for the
families of his ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount raised by the sale of 74 items was $430,000,
but the families of the two slaying victims will receive only about
$382,000 once auction house fees and other costs are subtracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount collected today won't even put a scratch in the
$33.5 million judgment,'' said attorney Michael D. Myers, the state
court receiver appointed to oversee the liquidation of Simpson's
property.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was intended to partially satisfy the civil judgment
owed by Simpson to the families of Goldman and his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   A civil jury held Simpson liable for their stabbing deaths in
February 1997, two years after Simpson was acquitted by a criminal
jury on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer of the Heisman Trophy, an East Coast collector, did
not want to be identified, said officials with the Butterfield and
Butterfield auction house in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for the Heisman started at $75,000 and quickly rose
above $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cohen of Cleveland came close to getting the trophy with a
bid of $220,000, but decided to hold off when he realized that the
East Coast collector would top his bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to put it in my house and let it collect dust
and say, ``God! I'm a Heisman Trophy winner,'' said Cohen, a real
estate developer who last played football in the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Another private collector, Randy Burkett, said he also wanted a
Heisman, but did not want to spend more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bidding went by us in a shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett did spend about $10,000 on several trophies and artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of history. We just wanted a piece of it,'' said
Burkett who came from Amarillo, Texas, for the auction of items
that were seized from Simpson's Brentwood estate in March 1997 by
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The most coveted item and the last to be auctioned was the
Heisman Memorial Trophy awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a
senior at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statute, the most prestigious award in college
football, is the only one ever auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the overall result (of the auction),''
said Ira M. Friedman, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown
Simpson. ``Anything is better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Brown Simpson's estate is expected to receive one third
of the auction proceeds, while Goldman's family should receive
two-thirds, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people including a crush of media attended the
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they did not know if O.J. Simpson had a
representative there.
</P>
<P>
   The professional football Hall of Fame Award that had been
presented to Simpson went at auction for $10,000 to representatives
of a computer Web site who said they plan to destroy the
certificate and some Simpson football jerseys on Wednesday to
protest failings in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to destroy this O.J. Simpson property on the steps
of the L.A. (Criminal) Courthouse (Wednesday) at noon,'' said Bob
Enyart, a representative of the Web site, shadowgov.com of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Enyart said the group, which spent $4,750 for two football
jerseys, had planned for two weeks to buy and destroy these items.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mohr, 43, of North Hollywood said it appeared many people
were drawn to the auction by morbid curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of people who bid from the heart and not the
mind,'' said Mohr, a U.S. Postal Service worker and collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a hold of O.J., but you can stand next to O.J.'s
Heisman,'' Mohr said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some of the items went for far more than their estimated
value, especially the football jerseys and golf bags.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpson golf bags with clubs went on average for about
$2,200.
</P>
<P>
   A simple white football jersey with red stripes and the number
32 estimated to be worth at least $400 went for $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   A Hall of Fame commemorative football valued at $200 to $300
went for $2,250.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the artwork also brought high bids.
</P>
<P>
   A Tiffany-style leaded glass lamp shade valued at $600 to $900
went for $7,000.

difference between a delicate shellfish appetizer, hard-wired for
chablis, and a lusty, truffly main course that has red Burgundy
written all over it. For two diners, a bottle each of red and white

   NEW YORK _ Jeff Gordon's daring pass of Rusty Wallace last
Sunday will be remembered as the defining moment of one of the most
thrilling Daytona 500 races ever. The maneuver, at 190 mph, showed
the fearlessness and talent that has enabled Gordon to win three
Winston Cup championships, including the last two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had so many people say: `Man, what a great race.
That was best race I've ever seen,' '' Gordon said Tuesday in
Manhattan. ``Everyone from David Letterman to the guy who runs the
elevator here at the Waldorf-Astoria has been talking about it. It
was absolutely the biggest win of my career by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was in Manhattan celebrating his second Daytona 500
victory, his 43rd career Winston Cup victory. On Monday, he made a
guest appearance on Letterman's show and received an ESPY for the
1998 driver of the year at ESPN's award ceremony, where Gordon was
congratulated by George Steinbrenner and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really cool for me to be a part of a race like that,''
Gordon said of holding off his biggest rival, Dale Earnhardt, over
the final laps. ``And especially to be the one to win a race as
exciting as that. This was like Jordan vs. Magic. And Jordan hit a
30-foot jumper to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've done something like that. This year's win definitely
tops 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nascar season could not have got off to a better start for
Gordon: winning 1999's first race in his sport's biggest event. But
it has also seen the return of the same old questions. Is Gordon's
success a reflection of an outstanding driver, or does he simply
have the best equipment?
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that won't go away, in part, because not
everyone is convinced that Gordon's skill is the biggest factor in
his team's victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a better driver than Mark Martin or Dale
Earnhardt,'' Jack Roush, the owner of Martin's Valvoline Ford
Taurus, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that his program is better. Jeff may break all of
Richard Petty's records, but the reason Mark isn't beating him more
is because I haven't given Mark a good enough program.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush, who accused Gordon of driving on illegal tires last
season after he outran Martin at Pocono, said: ``I don't think Jeff
has ever been in a bad race car. He's in a great, great position.
If I put Mark in the type of program Jeff has, I think Mark would
beat Jeff more than Jeff would beat Mark. Jeff is not as involved
with the hardware as Mark and Dale have been. So it makes you
wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was involved in a 12-car wreck that eliminated him
from contention last Sunday, was the runner-up to Gordon in 1998.
Martin figures to be there again when this season's championship is
decided this year. Some have called Roush a sore loser. Some agree
with him. Gordon says, ``that's just racing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Gordon often has the top car in the field.
He also has the best team, headed by one of the best crew chiefs in
the business, Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had one of the best cars,'' Gordon said. ``I had
some problems with the handling. I think because I did not have any
help, I was never in a position to show how good my car was until
the last 10 laps. I had to do it by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Gordon did not get any aerodynamic assistance from
his competitors _ it rarely pays to help the fastest car in the
field _ until he got a push from Earnhardt on the final laps,
supports the argument that Gordon does play a major role in getting
the No. 24 DuPont Chevy to Victory Lane, somewhere his car figures
to be parked very often this season.

JIMMY DUDLEY, 89; BROADCAST 20 YEARS OF INDIANS BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ariz., Va., Ill., Wash., Md.)  (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Dudley, who joined the Indians' broadcast booth in 1948,
their memorable pennant-winning season, and became the highly
popular radio voice of Cleveland baseball for two decades, died
last Friday in Tucson, Ariz. He was 89 and a member of the
broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   A gifted storyteller with a soothing delivery, Dudley, like his
contemporaries Red Barber and Mel Allen, was a professionally
trained broadcaster in an era when former ballplayers were flocking
to play-by-play jobs. And like the voices of Dodger and Yankee
baseball, he was a Southerner who gained acclaim far from his
roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our accents appealed to people _ they were sort of
graceful, they fit in with the game,'' Dudley, a Virginian, said of
the popularity experienced by Southern-bred broadcasters. ``Dixie
speaking is slow, leisurely. And baseball is that kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in an interview with Curt Smith for ``Voices of the Game''
(Diamond Communications, 1987), Dudley observed how ``the
professionals _ the Allens, Barbers, Lindsey Nelson, me _ we were
Southern, yes, but even more, we were trained.'' Broadcasting,
Dudley said, ``was our life, not something we just stumbled onto
when we threw down our bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon joining the Indians' pitching staff in 1986, knuckleballer
Phil Niekro, recalled how he had grown up listening to Indian games
in Lansing, Ohio, and remarked: ``Jimmy Dudley was the first Indian
hero I had. Then came Wynn, Feller and Boudreau and Garcia.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, when Niekro was inducted into the Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, N.Y., Dudley was enshrined as well. Earlier that
year, Dudley received the Ford C. Frick Award for contributions to
baseball broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Alexandria, Va., Dudley played baseball, football
and basketball at the University of Virginia, and worked for DuPont
after graduating with a degree in chemistry. But in 1937, he turned
to broadcasting, taking a job with a radio station in
Charlottesville, Va. By the early 1940s, he was doing some
play-by-play of Chicago Cubs games on WIND as an assistant to
broadcaster Hal Totten.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a pilot in the Army Air Forces during World War
II, Dudley became an Indians broadcaster in their thrilling 1948
season, when they beat the Boston Red Sox in a playoff, then
defeated the Boston Braves in the World Series. ``It was like
living a dream,'' Dudley recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Over his 20 years on WJW and WERE Radio, Dudley was remembered
for his game sign-off: ``Lotsa good luck, ya heah?''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley also broadcast for the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore
Colts of the National Football League and worked Ohio State
football. He was dismissed by the Indians after the 1967 season _
without an explanation, he said _ then broadcast for the expansion
Seattle Pilots in 1969 before retiring to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Angie; a son, Douglas of Carol
Stream, Ill.; a daughter, Barbara Wolf of Pittsburgh; a brother,
Warren of Dallas, and two grandchildren.

THOMAS W. MATTINGLY, 92, EISENHOWER'S DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Md.) (nk) 
By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Thomas William Mattingly, a retired cardiologist who
treated President Dwight D. Eisenhower during several of his
illnesses, died on Friday in Davidson, N.C., where he had lived for
the past decade. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly, a former chief of cardiology at Walter Reed Medical
Center in Washington, cared for Eisenhower from the time he entered
the White House in January 1953 until he died, in 1969. When
Eisenhower suffered a coronary thrombosis in 1955 _ and during
other acute illnesses _ Mattingly led the physicians providing
day-to-day care.
</P>
<P>
   He counseled the president and kept the country abreast of his
condition and of his doctors' prognoses. In retirement, Mattingly
compiled a detailed medical history of the president for the
National Archives at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   That work illuminated the facts and speculations regarding
Eisenhower's health before and during his presidency. It also
became a reference for scholars and legislators concerning medical
disclosures, the health of presidents and other high officials, as
well as the matter of presidential succession.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly spent 24 years in uniform, rising from first
lieutenant in 1934 to brigadier general before retiring from the
Army Medical Corps in 1958. He then became a consultant in
cardiovascular diseases at Walter Reed, the Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology and Children's Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He served as director of medical education and as a consultant
in internal medicine and cardiology at Washington Hospital Center
from 1958 to 1962 and as chairman of its department of medicine
from then until 1967. He also served as a consultant to the Surgeon
General, the State Department and the president's personal
physician at the White House until 1972.
</P>
<P>

CARL ALLY, ADMAN, DIES AT 74; A SHAKER OF MADISON AVENUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill., Mich., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Ally, a hard-hitting, high-flying advertising man who
helped show Madison Avenue the error of its genteel ways through a
series of blunt ads that turned upstarts like Federal Express and
MCI into industry giants and him into an industry legend, died on
Monday. He was 74 and the founder of Carl Ally Inc. and its
successor agency, Ally &AMP; Gargano.
</P>
<P>
   His family said he died after suffering a heart attack near his
home in Rowayton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a tempestuous career in which he alternately dazzled,
delighted and alienated clients, employees and ultimately his own
partners, Ally remained an outsider by birth, by choice and by
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Italian-American mother and a Turkish immigrant
who changed the family name from Ali, Ally, whose father worked on
Great Lakes ore ships and later as a tool and die maker, grew up in
a blue-collar household in Detroit before joining the Army Air
Corps in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who knew him on Madison Avenue years later would have
doubted that he had been a ferocious fighter pilot who won both the
Distinguished Flying Cross and a Presidential Citation. (Although
many, including, it turned out Tuesday, the author Joseph Heller,
scoffed at Ally's oft-voiced claim that he had been the prototype
of the character Yossarian in Heller's novel ``Catch-22.'')
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1948, Ally,
who later got a master's degree there, spent two and a half years
in Schenectady, N.Y., in a General Electric training program he
later likened to a Harvard MBA in advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   After working a while at a small Detroit agency, he joined the
Detroit-based Campbell-Ewald, a regional giant, and did so well
that in 1959 he was sent to the New York office, where his
enthusiastic conviction, as he later told it, that he was smarter
than his bosses led to his dismissal eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he joined Papert, Koenig &AMP; Lois, where, in a
subtle preview of his later penchant for debunking clients'
competitors by name, he produced a memorable campaign for the old
New York Herald Tribune. (``Who Says a Good Newspaper Has to be
Dull?'')
</P>
<P>
   Ally, who always chafed at what he saw as the dull, insipid
advertising produced by old-line agencies and their old school
network of button-down executives, got his chance to do things his
way in 1962 when a former Peugeot advertising manager who had taken
a similar job with Volvo asked Ally to take on the account.
</P>
<P>
   Since Papert, Koenig already represented Peugeot, Ally had to
form his own agency, which he did with two of his former
Campbell-Ewald colleagues, Amil Gargano, an art director, and James
Durfree, a copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   Television rules of the day barred an advertiser from mentioning
its rivals by name, but Ally, who was later credited with helping
win a relaxation of those rules, got around that with an aerial
commercial, shot at a Connecticut airport, showing a Volvo, its
name emblazoned on its roof, leaving five familiar but unlabeled
rivals far behind in a 10-second race. That _ along with a later
commercial demonstrating Volvo's superior braking power and ads
noting that in Sweden, where many roads were unpaved, Volvos lasted
an average of 11 years _ helped establish the car's reputation for
safety and durability and led to a significant increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years the fledgling Carl Ally Inc. and its
founder's ``grab 'em by the throat'' advertising philosophy had
attracted a dozen other clients and cemented its reputation as a
hot agency.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose love of flying led him to pilot the agency's plane,
Ally had a weakness for aviation and automotive clients, among them
Scandinavian Airlines System and a company that had virtually no
name recognition and no advertising history until Ally introduced
it to the world (``America, You Have a New Airline'') as Federal
Express.
</P>
<P>
   The agency later had a similar success with another upstart, MCI
Communications, but over the years Ally's always passionate,
sometimes abrasive ways, took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, with the agency renamed Ally &AMP; Gargano, he turned
day-to-day control over to Gargano, and a decade later, after
selling to his partners, he retired.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which underwent a series of reorganizations, finally
succumbed several years ago. By then Ally, a self-styled grenade
thrower, had been inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Ally, who was married and divorced four times, is survived by
five children: Christopher, of San Francisco; Patricia Leebaert of
Fairfield, Conn.; Matthew, of Manhattan and Rowayton; and Jo Ellen
and Catherine Ally, both of Weston, Conn., and four grandchildren.

USC HURT BY SOFT SCHEDULE, NOT ENOUGH USE OF TURNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even after USC offered a teasing glimpse of its
potential by upsetting sixth-ranked Stanford at Maples Pavilion,
coach Henry Bibby refused to concede that the Trojans should have
been playing this way all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations of everyone else have been unbelievable,''
Bibby said. ``And that's not a concern of mine. I haven't really
been disappointed in this group. But I've been realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby tried to take a young team (two seniors, two juniors, four
sophomores, four freshmen) and build its confidence with a
relatively easy nonconference schedule before the rigors of the
Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a good plan, but it hasn't worked out. After
starting 8-1, USC has managed just a 4-9 Pac-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't pieced everybody together at the same time,''
Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   That means while center Brian Scalabrine has often been
brilliant, many of the other players have only intermittently made
contributions. If you listen to Bibby, he isn't surprised. He's
more shocked that some USC fans have been underwhelmed after the
promising start to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would not like to finish in the top one or two in the
Pac-10?,'' Bibby said. ``But I knew what I was getting into when I
took this job. I've talked about it with (athletic director) Mike
Garrett and how it's not going to happen overnight and he's giving
me time to build the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations become a problem when people watch USC upset
Stanford, or remember that the Trojans defeated No. 2-ranked
Arizona last season.
</P>
<P>
   While defeating Stanford was memorable, something considered
barely noteworthy turned into the single-most important event of
the season. When sophomore point guard Kevin Augustine quit the
team in December, USC's Pac-10 hopes basically evaporated.
Augustine might not be better than starter Brandon Granville, but
he provided solid play last season and would have seen an increased
role when Granville slumped in January.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine might have even surpassed Granville in the lineup and
possibly prevented USC's January swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Trojans had no other point guards to spell
Granville, and the offense became stagnant when either shooting
guard Quincy Wilder or power forward Jarvis Turner were forced to
play out of position.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, USC's outside shooters (Elias Ayuso,
Adam Spanich) have been wildly inconsistent. And the Trojans'
defense has been shoddy at times. Those are the primary reasons USC
has struggled during Pac-10 play.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Bibby's decisions could also be questioned. The idea
to shelve Turner, a team leader and expected to be one of the
Trojans' go-to guys at the beginning of the season, has been a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has been robbed of his confidence after having
back-to-back games in which he might play 15 minutes one night,
then fail to come off the bench during the next game.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of freshman Sam Clancy has been a promising aspect
of this season, but there should be enough minutes for Turner to
get into games. Turner is considered a leader by his teammates and
his disappearance might have hurt USC more than its soft
nonconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Forward Adam Spanich returned from his one-game
suspension against Stanford and will play tonight against UCLA.
Spanich was suspended after having an argument with some academic
officials at USC. &QL; 
USC REPORT CARD &QL; 
_ Guard: Brandon Granville has been a pleasant surprise, but Kevin
Augustine's departure has haunted Trojans. Elias Ayuso finally
recovered from a slow start. _ C &QL; 
_ Forward: Jeff Trepagnier blossomed into the team's most athletic
player, and after a typical freshman start, Sam Clancy has shown
glimpses of becoming a dominating player. _- B- &QL; 
_ Center: Where would the Trojans be without Brian Scalabrine? He
could lead USC in scoring for three years. _- B+ &QL; 
_ Bench: Adam Spanich has occasionally provided spark, and David
Bluthenthal might start next year. However, two players with
experience _ Jarvis Turner and Shannon Swillis _ are nearly
invisible. _ C &QL; 
_ Coach: Henry Bibby has tried to mold a team with three freshmen
and two JC transfers playing major roles. But keeping Turner on the
bench hasn't helped. _ C+

COMMENTARY : HILLARY THINKS, RUDY WAITS, PUNDITS YEARN
</HEADLINE>
  (See related NY-MRSCLINTON) 
 (nk) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York, at least, has figured out how to fill the
post-impeachment political gossip void. Hillary Clinton for Senate!
</P>
<P>
   ``She says, `Charlie, I just want you to know I'm considering
this very, very seriously,''' reported Rep. Charles Rangel of
Manhattan, chief broker of the idea that the first lady might run
for the seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000.
``She says that in all kind of different and charming ways.''
</P>
<P>
   There are probably a number of states in which party regulars
might be offended by the idea of turning over a plum so sweet as a
nomination for an open Senate seat to an outsider. But New York
Democrats have a different mentality. Rangel, in fact, was outraged
when he heard a rumor that Mrs. Clinton might run in Illinois, a
state where she has actually lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to her and said: `You can be senator from Vermont or
Rhode Island or Illinois, but being senator from New York is
different,''' he explained. ``Equal isn't always equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of running Mrs. Clinton for the Senate while her
husband is still in the White House was born of a mixture of great
production values and political desperation. Democrats believe that
New York City's Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, is eyeing
Moynihan's seat. To win statewide races, Democrats generally have
to roll up huge majorities in New York City and avoid getting
beaten too badly in the surrounding suburbs. Giuliani is the
darling of Long Island and Westchester County, and he might be
expected to hold on to at least his core constituency in the city's
white ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the one person better known and perhaps better liked than
the fractious Giuliani is the feisty Ms. Clinton. The president and
first lady may be controversial in some parts of the country, but
in New York their approval ratings are at levels normally reserved
for politicians who have won a world war. True, Mrs. Clinton does
not live in New York, but then the first lady, whose voting address
is her mother's home in Arkansas, does not seem to specifically
live anywhere. ``She lives on TV,'' says one local political
consultant. Her endless trips to New York to campaign for Charles
Schumer for Senate (and against her old nemesis Alfonse D'Amato)
have probably involved more overnight stays than Connecticut's
James Buckley logged when he successfully ran for the Senate here,
explaining that his Manhattan office was also his home.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel proudly announced that the contentious and near-bankrupt
New York Democratic Party had ``pulled together an offer that the
first lady can't refuse,'' including a guarantee that the
nomination would be hers for the asking, without a primary. Later
he explained that the party's power to insure Mrs. Clinton a free
ride was based on the theory that ``you can always promise no
primary to an 800-pound gorilla.'' So far, everyone seems to agree,
including the Democrat regarded as the most likely Senate candidate
presently residing within the confines of New York state. ``If the
first lady decides to run, she'll clear the field,'' said Rep. Nita
Lowey of Westchester, demonstrating her own political skills
Tuesday by conducting an interview via cell phone while walking
through airport security.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a race between Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Clinton
is so tasty that even the first hints of a speculation of a
possibility created headlines. Now that Mrs. Clinton is officially
considering the idea, political junkies are in a full-blown frenzy.
This is the sort of contest that election aficionados live for. It
could actually overshadow the presidential contest. (Which debate
would you listen to, Clinton-Giuliani or Gore-Bush?)
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels that have been thriving on all-Monica formats
for the last year could easily divert their talking heads to a
discussion of who would have more trouble adjusting to the Senate _
the authoritarian Giuliani or the wife of the man half the senators
voted to toss out of office. On the campaign trail, the first lady
might have to face some embarrassing questions about the state of
her marriage. But Giuliani, whose wife declined to say whom she had
voted for in the last mayoral election, has pretty much broken the
New York press corps of the habit of trying to poke into a
politician's private life.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, a lifelong New Yorker and the state's best-known
resident, is by no means as assured of his party's nomination as
Mrs. Clinton would be of hers. Allies of Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican, are not necessarily entranced by the idea of having
Giuliani as a candidate, and he might have to run a primary for the
nomination, possibly against the moderate but more housebroken
Republican from Long Island, Rep. Rick Lazio. In fact, the
Clinton-Giuliani race that New Yorkers were imagining Tuesday could
morph very quickly into Lowey vs. Lazio on Wednesday. And then what
will the cable channels do?

IMPEACHMENT FADES FAST  
 WILL THE ROLE FIT?

   Being one of President Clinton's personal lawyers was not enough
to get David E. Kendall into Comedy Cellar, a club at 117 Macdougal
Street, less than 12 hours after the Senate trial ended on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were late,'' said Kendall, who had taken a Metroliner to
New York from Washington on Friday, ``and our reservations were
gone.'' He and the friends with whom he had seen ``Rent'' earlier
in the evening ended up at a nearby club, Cafe Wha.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to get out of Washington and not be here,'' he
said Tuesday from his desk at the law firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly,
adding that he was ``blasting through the paper that's piled up.''
</P>
<P>
   The main White House counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff, was also at his
desk Tuesday. ``He's going to see some spring training in March in
Vero Beach,'' a White House spokesman said. ``The only possible
time off.''
</P>
<P>
   With the trial over, what about late-night talk shows that made
the president and Monica Lewinsky a long-running punch line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have three months of jokes already on the
cue cards,'' quipped Rob Burnett, the executive producer of ``Late
Show with David Letterman,'' ``so we have to keep going until at
least May.''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, now: What will Letterman lampoon from now on?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Burnett said. ``We have to sit back and wait
until the next bone-headed thing happens. That should only take 24
to 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the Role Fit?
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. has a new client, Annie Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, who defended O.J. Simpson and is one of the lawyers
representing the family of Amadou Diallo, the African immigrant
killed by plainclothes officers in the Bronx on Feb. 4, is
scheduled to join Ms. Dutton's legal team at a taping of ``The
Guiding Light'' Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that she is a soap-opera character charged with
stealing a corpse, among other things. And never mind that some
viewers might say he is blurring the line between fiction and
reality. ``I don't think anybody believes I'm going to be doing
that for any period of time,'' he said. ``I've got so much real
work to do I can't do this very often.''
</P>
<P>
   All he will have to do is follow the script, which is probably a
good thing, considering that he was in Los Angeles on Tuesday and
was scheduled to catch a 10 p.m. flight to New York. ``I'm going to
try to stay awake for the taping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Racket
</P>
<P>
   The word on the street _ Grand Street, in SoHo _ was that John
McEnroe had decided to shut down his art gallery. But McEnroe says
that is not exactly so. It is not going to be open to the walk-in
trade any longer, which will make it off limits to weekend browsers
who might want to see what a celebrity like McEnroe considers good
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, I kept winning on the senior tennis circuit,''
he said yesterday. And, as he noted, ``Art hasn't done
one-thousandth of what tennis has done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McEnroe said he planned to ``scale down, re-evaluate and
figure out my game plan'' so he could ``level the playing field''
and compete with art dealers who may or may not pepper their
conversations with sports metaphors the way he does.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked, politely, if there had been any tantrums over the
idea that he had been anything less than successful in the art
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've been unsuccessful,'' he said. ``I just
haven't been able to find the younger artists to bring along like
you'd coach a young tennis player.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHEN EVERYONE'S A STAR, IT MUST BE CARNIVAL IN
RIO
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ In the plaza of Largo da Prainha do Sao
Francisco, where slaves were once sold, a huge wall painting shows
a samba singer holding sheet music for the first recorded samba,
``On the Telephone,'' from 1916. It was in downtown neighborhoods
like this, where Africans and Afro-Brazilians from Bahia met Rio
society, that samba took hold in Brazilian culture. On Thursday,
the eve of this year's Carnival, Eliane Costa looked up at the
mural and said: ``Samba is still very similar to when it was born.
In its essence, it has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing sunglasses and a headset microphone, she plugged in an
electrified cavaquinho _ the small samba guitar _ and began
strumming and singing with her group, Slaves of Maua. One member
gave out copies of the lyrics. Soon the musicians climbed onto a
sound truck, a dozen drummers fell in line behind them, and a small
parade wound its way through back streets up to the plaza of Maua.
</P>
<P>
   As followers shimmied and strutted and quickstepped, while
people on the sidewalk waved and let loose steps of their own, the
parade snagged traffic on one of downtown Rio's busiest streets,
Rio Branco. ``Whoever thought the fire would go out,'' sang the
Slaves of Maua, ``can still hear our voice.''
</P>
<P>
   During Carnival, which ended Tuesday, the Tuesday before Lent,
the samba takes over Rio on levels great and small. There are
neighborhood groups or blocos, like Slaves of Maua, and casual
brass bands called bandas. There are blocos de enredo, groups that
mount small costumed processions in official all-night parades on
avenues like Rio Branco. And there are the spectacular, gargantuan
sambas de enredo, pageants that play for paying audiences and
television cameras at the Sambodromo, the concrete street flanked
by bleachers that presents the image of Rio's Carnival to the
world. The Sambodromo is near Praca Once, where ``On the
Telephone'' was written.
</P>
<P>
   Four nights after the Slaves of Maua took to the streets,
Mangueira, the oldest and most traditional samba school in Rio,
mounted its parade at the Sambodromo. Its song proclaimed ``A
Century of Samba'' and paid homage to ``On the Telephone.'' Floats
four stories high had towering statues depicting major figures in
Brazilian music, and between them came thousands of shimmying,
costumed dancers in sequins and feathers. The bateria, a group of
hundreds of drummers playing with exact discipline, pounded out the
combination of heartbeat and march and chattering cross-rhythms
that is samba. It might have seemed an odd place for a history
lesson. But samba is as much about historical memory as it is about
spectacle. ``Human intelligence has the capacity to create many
layers,'' said Joaosinho Trinta, the carivalesco _ conceptualizer
and director _ for the Viradouro samba school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, as the samba was becoming Brazil's national music, the
revolutionary turned dictator Getulio Vargas decreed that official
carnival sambas should be based on historical, didactic or
patriotic themes. It is a practice that has carried through the
decades: At this year's carnival, there were songs extolling the
state of Minas Gerais and the cities of Natal and Joao Pessoa;
there were also tributes to people, including a communications
magnate and a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The samba school Imperatriz Leopoldinense commemorated a Dutch
naturalist who cataloged Brazil's flora and fauna. Rosa Magalhaes,
the group's carnivalesca, summed up her hopes for the audience: ``I
want them to be happy,'' she said. ``I want them to think it was
beautiful. And I want them to know the story.''
</P>
<P>
   When the samba schools parade, pedagogy turns into delirious
spectacle, with images multiplied and repeated by the huge forces
that the samba schools can muster.
</P>
<P>
   Mocidades turned its tribute to the classical composer Heitor
Villa-Lobos, who drew on Brazilian folk and popular music, into a
celebration of Brazil's wildlife and folklore: parrots and leopards
and butterflies, demons and skeletons. And as the samba by
Caprichosos de Pilares praised the plastic surgeon Ivo Pitanguy,
members paraded with giant syringes and oxygen tanks attached to
their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the subject, sambas de enredo are about abundance, with
thousands of dancing people wearing acres of shiny material and so
many feathers it's hard to believe an unplucked peacock survives
anywhere. During the samba parades, there are moments when the
2,000-foot-long parade ground is an uninterrupted sea of people.
Tributes to places invariably celebrate the local resources and
cuisine, from seafood to coffee to guava paste. And the historical
sambas are variations on a complex story: what happened when
indigenous tribes, Europeans and Africans ended up in the same
tropical landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Indian costumes are a good excuse for
feathered headdresses. The Viradouro school used a tribute to Anita
Garibaldi, the Brazilian wife of the Italian patriot Giuseppe
Garibaldi, to praise the contributions of native Brazilians,
Africans, Europeans and Asians, with floats depicting everything
from the Hindu deity Ganesh to a Roman colonnade. Viradouro's
carnivalesco, Trinta, said before Carnival, ``We are a culture of
mixing, and this mixing is very positive. The collective
unconscious of Brazil is made of the experiences of all the peoples
that arrived here. Imagine that human DNA is like a memory chip.
Brazil has so many different chips that it is like a
state-of-the-art computer.''

   Of course, the abundance being celebrated is paradoxical. The
core members of the samba schools are the urban poor who live in
the hillside slums called favelas. Samba is a celebration of their
resilience and energy, and carnival's exuberance presents a spirit
undaunted by Brazil's recent currency devaluation or other crises.
``We rise above these problems,'' Trinta said. ``And we show that a
population without education or technology is capable of producing
a work of art like a samba school.''
</P>
<P>
   The sambas de enredo, nearly a year in preparation, are not
topical like carnival songs are in places like Trinidad or Haiti.
Yet the venerable samba school Portela, paying tribute to the state
of Minas Gerais, had a touch of topicality when a character on a
float brandished a briefcase that read ``Moratorio'' _ a pointed
reference to demands by the governor of Minas Gerais for a
moratorium on his state's debt repayments to Brazil's federal
government, which helped trigger the currency devaluation.
Street-level sambas showed a touch of protest; one group sang about
the national debt, declaring, ``Bring the bill that I won't pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The blocos de enredo, pulling small homemade floats, were more
hopeful; one had a sign that thanked everyone struggling for world
peace. And without television cameras or stadium lights, they still
belted out the songs and danced with pure elation.
</P>
<P>
   When the top carnival groups were moved to the Sambodromo, part
of Rio's carnival was taken out of the streets. But a neighborhood
group can draw the same frenetic, joyful response as the
razzle-dazzle productions in the Sambodromo. Samba demands audience
participation, and a band, a song and a beat can start a street
party almost instantly _ a shouting, singing, dancing mass of
people that spills onto sidewalks and engulfs passers-by. Confetti
and streamers are tossed; spray cans of white foam are spritzed
into the air, and there's the jumble of masquerades everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Certain groups have themes. Carmelitas' followers, male and
female, danced in the headgear of Carmelite nuns. The Banda de
Ipanema has a large transvestite contingent who this year dressed
like anyone from Carmen Miranda to Monica Lewinsky. Across the
city, many people joined carnival processions dressed as Tiazinha,
a masked, whip-wielding young woman who hosts a variety show on
television. When Tiazinha herself appeared at the Sambodromo with
the school called Tradicao (Tradition), the audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   But in or out of the Sambodromo, carnival wasn't about watching
stars _ it was about being one. In the samba-school parades, masses
of people group themselves by costume, but coexist in happy
anarchy. Without rows or ranks or assigned steps, people strut or
twirl, let loose with fancy footwork or throw kisses to the crowd.
And on the streets, wherever the samba beat started, it was an
invitation to turn tradition and history into pleasure.

BIG BERMUDA INSURER ACQUIRING U.S. INSURER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.) (nk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda _ XL Capital Ltd., one of the leaders in
providing insurance against huge corporate losses, announced here
Tuesday that it was buying the NAC Re Corp., an insurer based in
Greenwich, Conn., greatly expanding its reach into the American
market.
</P>
<P>
   The price, XL Capital officials said, is $1.25 billion,
including $200 million in NAC Re debt.
</P>
<P>
   NAC Re, with big corporate as well as small-business clients,
offers both reinsurance _ insurance that backs up the coverage of
other insurers _ and insurance sold directly to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   XL Capital, a 13-year-old company, has grown rapidly through
acquisitions and offerings of high-level coverage. Its clients
include some of the world's biggest corporations whose executives
either travel to the insurer's Bermuda headquarters to conduct
business or work through subsidiaries in London.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is buying what Ronald W. Frank, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney, called an ``extremely well-run, first-rate company''
that broadens its customer base and enables to it to work more
closely with customers throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brian M. O'Hara, chief executive of XL Capital, said, ``NAC Re
will become our platform for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the benefits of operating an insurance company here in
Bermuda is that there is no corporate income tax. NAC Re, which had
revenue from premiums last year of $704 million, will continue to
pay taxes in the United States, O'Hara said, adding that additional
business that the Bermuda corporate parent expected to conduct in
the United States through NAC Re would also qualify for U.S. taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of NAC Re enables XL Capital to begin dealing with
some smaller but substantial companies in the United States that
have been unwilling to come here to do business _ because of
inconvenience and because they did not need the highest levels of
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Lusardi, XL Capital's chief financial officer, said
the acquisition would enable his company to do more business
involving complex financial arrangements that require close,
day-to-day work with clients, as well as to begin providing some
coverage that can prudently be offered only after detailed studies
of clients and their potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   XL Capital was created in 1986 when other insurers, hurt by big
asbestos-related lawsuits, backed away from offering certain
liability coverage or sharply raised prices. It began to diversify
as competitors re-entered the field, driving premiums down.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth S. Zuckerberg, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods,
said NAC Re neatly complemented XL Capital and the reinsurance
business it acquired a year ago. While XL specializes in property
and liability coverage that kick in when claims exceed, say, $100
million or when a hurricane destroys great stretches of homes and
businesses, NAC Re has avoided that coverage. It has instead
emphasized reinsurance of liability coverage with frequent, but
less costly claims. And it has been selling direct coverage to
groups of small- and medium-sized businesses like auto dealers and
trucking companies, drugstores and florists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great fit, strategically and financially,'' Frank said,
adding that the combination would reduce some overhead costs. And,
as a unit of XL Capital, with $4.8 billion in equity, NAC Re will
be able to reduce the amount of reinsurance it has been buying to
reduce its own risk.
</P>
<P>
   XL Capital plans to issue $1.05 billion in new stock to pay for
NAC Re, not including the $200 million in debt. NAC Re equity
holders will receive 0.915 XL Capital share for each NAC Re share.
XL Capital closed Tuesday at $52, up $2.1875, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, who began trying to expand in the United States with the
purchase of an inactive New York insurer, Folks America, late in
1997, said he had been interested in NAC Re for a couple of years,
but had hung back until negotiations by competitors fell through.
``I didn't want to get into a bidding war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay A. Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said XL Capital paid
a ``very fair price'' _ 1.35 times NAC Re's book value at a time
when similar companies were trading at an average of 1.5 times
their book value.

DAVIS LACKS SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ After four months, 24 games and close to 100
practices, how good is UCLA? It depends on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Bay Area trip showed the No. 16 Bruins at their best
and their worst. Thursday, in a spirited loss at Stanford, they
displayed the patience and discipline necessary for a furious
finish. It wasn't hard to imagine this UCLA team winning a few
games in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-point loss Saturday at Cal probably erased any chance of
UCLA earning a No. 3 seed in the tournament and it raised one
important question: Have the Bruins gotten better in the last month
or has only Baron Davis gotten better?
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a sophomore point guard, was masterful in the Bay Area,
combining for 50 points and eight assists and at times playing one
against five. He is averaging 20.5 points in his last five games,
beat Oregon at the buzzer and kept the Bruins breathing at Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Given modest support, Davis is talented enough to carry UCLA in
the stretch run, which begins tonight against USC. But for the
Bruins to flourish in the NCAA Tournament, Davis needs help, and
because of injuries, fatigue and poor play, he isn't getting any.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (17-7, 8-5) made significant progress in the middle weeks
of January, culminating with the victory at Louisville. Since then,
the Bruins have stayed on a plateau.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie big men, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, have
regressed. Moiso is UCLA's most polished interior scorer. Three
weeks ago, he developed tendinitis in his right foot and has lost
confidence, conditioning and timing. He has not scored in double
figures this month, stripping the Bruins of an entire offensive
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Without Moiso, the frontcourt scoring burden has shifted to
Gadzuric, and he is not ready for it, physically or otherwise. He
cannot practice or play for long durations because of tendinitis in
his knees. Without that foundation _ and considering his fledgling
skill level _ he's ill-equipped to handle the load. The Bruins went
to him early and often against Cal and the Bears pounced with
double teams each time. The result: Gadzuric had seven turnovers in
21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The substitution pattern is as inconsistent as the on-court
performance and that lack of stability seemingly has prevented
roles from developing. How can Travis Reed and Matt Barnes, the top
frontcourt reserves, gain rhythm and confidence when they play for
60 or 90 seconds at a time? Not surprisingly, they have stagnated
in recent weeks. Reed has scored two points in his last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward JaRon Rush was improving rapidly until the Cal
game, when his patience and jumper vanished. Rush deserves every
minute he gets; no one plays harder. But he needs guidance. He was
not a 3-point shooter in high school and he isn't one now. He is a
midrange shooter who's best when slashing to the basket. Yet he
continues to launch 3-pointers. The coaches must realign his
offensive priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's mystery was sophomore guard Earl Watson, who made 5
of 15 shots in the Bay Area. Perhaps he has hit a February lull and
is refueling for the stretch. Whatever the reason, Watson must
regain his January production for UCLA to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their injuries and inconsistencies, the Bruins
appear headed for 20 to 22 victories _ a few more than even Lavin
expected. And as they proved last year, two wins in March Madness
can turn questions marks into exclamations points. &QL; 
UCLA REPORT CARD &QL; 
__ Guard: Baron Davis is playing like a pro, with solid defensive
support from Earl Watson. __ Grade: A &QL; 
__ Forward: Bruins would be in great shape if Jerome Moiso and
JaRon Rush ever played well in the same game. __ Grade: B- &QL; 
__ Center: It's Dan Gadzuric against inexperience and tendinitis;
so far, Gadzuric is losing. __ Grade: C- &QL; 
__ Bench: Ray Young, Matt Barnes, Travis Reed and Ryan Bailey have
been as inconsistent as their playing time. __ Grade: C &QL; 
__ Coaching: The good: Bruins are two or three wins ahead of
schedule. The bad: The Bruins have lost three of their past five
games. Final exam is next month. __ Grade: B &QL;

   NEW YORK _ ``I wanted to embrace America,'' Jade Jagger said as
she laid out emerald, aquamarine and pink-topaz rings; plaques with
Indian motifs, and stones strung on citrus-colored thongs, along a
bed of black gravel _ against a backdrop of arty photographs of
herself by her boyfriend, Dan Macmillan.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a very New York happening for the 25-year-old
artist-turned-designer, whose fashion jewelry, with its rivulets of
beads and striking color combinations, is already on sale at
Barneys New York and stylish European stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not part of the fashion world _ but I realize that there
is a collective consciousness,'' says Jagger, who is a muse and
consultant to the British designer Matthew Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   She wore his flower-decorated top and flimsy tangerine skirt to
her party on Sunday to launch the fine jewelry, while friends and
fans favored Jagger's own design of a teeny pashmina halter top
with appliqued beads on the bodice.
</P>
<P>
   The actress Liv Tyler, the artist's daughter Lola Schnabel, the
rocker's son Marlon Richards and Jagger's mother, Bianca (wearing a
jet-and-crystal beaded waterfall necklace), were among those who
showed up at the Chelsea art space hung with Damien Hirst's coin
dot painting.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger's love affair with India started when she ``went with my
father (Mick Jagger) when I was about 9.'' But, as she says, the
jewelry is influenced by other things, with a touch of punk in the
jewel-studded dog-collar chokers and the juxtaposition of
traditional emerald-cut stones with modern settings.
</P>
<P>
   An average price of a spiral gold ring or gold wire and gem
bracelet is under $1,000 with the prices rising for the more
precious stones.
</P>
<P>
   Why jewels?
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to jewelry from painting,'' she says. ``They kept
saying that my paintings were so decorative. I wanted to get out
there _ and I really felt it was an opportunity to be more
creative.'' &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ If you listened to the album ``From There to Here''
(Columbia) not knowing what it was, you'd be surprised to learn
that the bass player was the leader and that he was Clint
Eastwood's son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kyle Eastwood says the name has disadvantages as well
as advantages, the fact remains that it's not a bad name at all.
What he means is it balances out _ good luck and good genes on one
hand, questionable authenticity on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Without the name it would have been a lot more difficult for him
to reach, let alone persuade, such musicians as Billy Childs, Oscar
Brashear, Plas Johnson (the saxophonist who played the ``Pink
Panther'' theme), the percussionist Peter Erskine (Weather Report)
and Joni Mitchell (singing Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man'') to record
on his debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Remember though: Name or no name, people of such reputation and
caliber would not lend their own names to a faulty project.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the contrabass is far from the easiest way to capitalize
on the name of a nabob film-star father. As a child, Kyle played a
role in his father's movie, ``Honkytonk Man,'' and it would have
been easier and more lucrative to follow that career than learning
how to play the jazz bass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-risk job, a lot of responsibility and potential
grief _ there's a special circle in hell reserved for bad bass
players.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ambitious for fame or fortune, the odds are against
you. People go to the restroom during a bass solo. But there's a
lot of pride involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bass players are aware, even if the average listener is not,
that they have the real power and that the musicians know it. They
play the only truly essential instrument in the band. Without a
sturdy bass line, the center will not hold.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is confident enough to lay back on his first record
under his name. True to the nature of his function, he has been
careful not to put himself in front of the other players. There is
a modest number of bass solos, and his walking is not
ostentatiously mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation is varied _ standards, originals, instrumentals,
vocals (by Julia Fordham and Diana King as well as Mitchell), a
combo, and the big band version of Tom Waits's ``I Beg Your
Pardon,'' featuring Mark Isham and David Sanchez, sounds like a Gil
Evans/Miles Davis collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The casting is intelligent, the style consistent, the pattern
obviously cut from one piece of cloth. It's more than a merely
respectable first record.
</P>
<P>
   He feels no pressure to prove anything to anyone. He speaks
slowly, shyly, convincingly: ``If I let it bother me every time
people asked me about my dad then I'd be bothered a lot. He's
always been my dad, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is do the best I can and people either accept it
or they don't. If they don't, there's not much I can do about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz was always in the house. He and his parents listened to
Charlie Parker records together. When his father was producing a
jazz documentary called ``Straight No Chaser,'' they sat around for
hours watching a stack of Thelonious Monk videotapes. Quality
time. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bass caught his ear early on. He found that he was usually
paying attention to the lower register. One thing he likes about
the bass is that its role is essential for both rhythm and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   He started on the electric bass-guitar in Pebble Beach High
School, near Carmel, Calif., of which his father was the mayor for
a while. Once he learned basic tuning, scales and chords it became
fairly easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   He learned R&AMP;B, Motown and reggae tunes by ear. He had friends
who played jazz and they were always looking for a bass player.
Everybody needs a bass player. They'd ask him if he knew this or
that standard. If not, he figured it out quickly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Growing up with Clint Eastwood, you meet interesting people. The
young Kyle met the legendary Ray Brown, Ron Carter and Lennie
Niehaus, who wrote the score for his father's movie ``Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus introduced him to Buell Neidlinger, the virtuoso
contrabassist who had worked with Ornette Coleman and the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. Kyle studied with Neidlinger (he had also
learned from the hot French fusion bass-guitarist Bunny Brunel).
Mostly, though, he figured things out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   When he switched to the contrabass, he began to practice all day
long. It is both a mentally and physically difficult instrument.
Whole days would go by and he wouldn't leave the house. He
practiced bowing, improved his intonation, learned the repertoire,
got more comfortable with improvising.
</P>
<P>
   His father likes to play Fats Waller tunes and boogie woogie on
the piano. He has a good left hand and he showed his son how it
worked. Maybe that had something to do with Kyle's original choice
of instrument _ with paying attention to the bottom in the first
place. They still jam together. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting off his career, Kyle moved down to Los Angeles for
eight years. He got the opportunity to play with Jack Sheldon,
Mundell Lowe, Teddy Edwards and Clark Terry. But time began to be
on his hands there, and he moved to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes the ``craziness'' in New York. There was more
of an opportunity to play there and ``along with my family, playing
music is the only thing that is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in TriBeCa with his wife, the Spanish actress Laura
Gomez, and their 5-year-old daughter, Graylen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the album was released last autumn, his quintet has worked
fairly steadily. Leading a working band means that the music has
the opportunity to evolve. It has come together in only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long European tour in April will include France,
Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It's his band: He hires the guys, directs the rehearsals, picks
the tunes, accepts the gigs. All in all, he says with a grin, it's
a ``fairly democratic'' group. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As far as the future is concerned, he is sure of one thing _ he
wants to continue making music one way or another. Along the line,
he'd like to learn arranging.
</P>
<P>
   He feels at home being part of the expanded family of musicians.
``The musicians have been pretty accepting. When they first hear
the last name they get a weird look sometimes. Once they hear me
play, though, it's usually O.K.'' &QL;

   PARIS _ If you listened to the album ``From There to Here''
(Columbia) not knowing what it was, you'd be surprised to learn
that the bass player was the leader and that he was Clint
Eastwood's son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kyle Eastwood says the name has disadvantages as well
as advantages, the fact remains that it's not a bad name at all.
What he means is it balances out _ good luck and good genes on one
hand, questionable authenticity on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Without the name it would have been a lot more difficult for him
to reach, let alone persuade, such musicians as Billy Childs, Oscar
Brashear, Plas Johnson (the saxophonist who played the ``Pink
Panther'' theme), the percussionist Peter Erskine (Weather Report)
and Joni Mitchell (singing Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man'') to record
on his debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Remember though: Name or no name, people of such reputation and
caliber would not lend their own names to a faulty project.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the contrabass is far from the easiest way to capitalize
on the name of a nabob film-star father. As a child, Kyle played a
role in his father's movie, ``Honkytonk Man,'' and it would have
been easier and more lucrative to follow that career than learning
how to play the jazz bass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-risk job, a lot of responsibility and potential
grief _ there's a special circle in hell reserved for bad bass
players.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ambitious for fame or fortune, the odds are against
you. People go to the restroom during a bass solo. But there's a
lot of pride involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bass players are aware, even if the average listener is not,
that they have the real power and that the musicians know it. They
play the only truly essential instrument in the band. Without a
sturdy bass line, the center will not hold.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is confident enough to lay back on his first record
under his name. True to the nature of his function, he has been
careful not to put himself in front of the other players. There is
a modest number of bass solos, and his walking is not
ostentatiously mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation is varied _ standards, originals, instrumentals,
vocals (by Julia Fordham and Diana King as well as Mitchell), a
combo, and the big band version of Tom Waits's ``I Beg Your
Pardon,'' featuring Mark Isham and David Sanchez, sounds like a Gil
Evans/Miles Davis collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The casting is intelligent, the style consistent, the pattern
obviously cut from one piece of cloth. It's more than a merely
respectable first record.
</P>
<P>
   He feels no pressure to prove anything to anyone. He speaks
slowly, shyly, convincingly: ``If I let it bother me every time
people asked me about my dad then I'd be bothered a lot. He's
always been my dad, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is do the best I can and people either accept it
or they don't. If they don't, there's not much I can do about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz was always in the house. He and his parents listened to
Charlie Parker records together. When his father was producing a
jazz documentary called ``Straight No Chaser,'' they sat around for
hours watching a stack of Thelonious Monk videotapes. Quality
time. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The bass caught his ear early on. He found that he was usually
paying attention to the lower register. One thing he likes about
the bass is that its role is essential for both rhythm and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   He started on the electric bass-guitar in Pebble Beach High
School, near Carmel, Calif., of which his father was the mayor for
a while. Once he learned basic tuning, scales and chords it became
fairly easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   He learned R&AMP;B, Motown and reggae tunes by ear. He had friends
who played jazz and they were always looking for a bass player.
Everybody needs a bass player. They'd ask him if he knew this or
that standard. If not, he figured it out quickly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Growing up with Clint Eastwood, you meet interesting people. The
young Kyle met the legendary Ray Brown, Ron Carter and Lennie
Niehaus, who wrote the score for his father's movie ``Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus introduced him to Buell Neidlinger, the virtuoso
contrabassist who had worked with Ornette Coleman and the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. Kyle studied with Neidlinger (he had also
learned from the hot French fusion bass-guitarist Bunny Brunel).
Mostly, though, he figured things out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   When he switched to the contrabass, he began to practice all day
long. It is both a mentally and physically difficult instrument.
Whole days would go by and he wouldn't leave the house. He
practiced bowing, improved his intonation, learned the repertoire,
got more comfortable with improvising.
</P>
<P>
   His father likes to play Fats Waller tunes and boogie woogie on
the piano. He has a good left hand and he showed his son how it
worked. Maybe that had something to do with Kyle's original choice
of instrument _ with paying attention to the bottom in the first
place. They still jam together. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting off his career, Kyle moved down to Los Angeles for
eight years. He got the opportunity to play with Jack Sheldon,
Mundell Lowe, Teddy Edwards and Clark Terry. But time began to be
on his hands there, and he moved to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes the ``craziness'' in New York. There was more
of an opportunity to play there and ``along with my family, playing
music is the only thing that is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in TriBeCa with his wife, the Spanish actress Laura
Gomez, and their 5-year-old daughter, Graylen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the album was released last autumn, his quintet has worked
fairly steadily. Leading a working band means that the music has
the opportunity to evolve. It has come together in only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long European tour in April will include France,
Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It's his band: He hires the guys, directs the rehearsals, picks
the tunes, accepts the gigs. All in all, he says with a grin, it's
a ``fairly democratic'' group. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As far as the future is concerned, he is sure of one thing _ he
wants to continue making music one way or another. Along the line,
he'd like to learn arranging.
</P>
<P>
   He feels at home being part of the expanded family of musicians.
``The musicians have been pretty accepting. When they first hear
the last name they get a weird look sometimes. Once they hear me
play, though, it's usually O.K.'' &QL;

   AMMAN _ It's not so long ago that a well-known Israeli
politician _ now a declared enemy of the Oslo peace agreement _ was
publicly advocating the expulsion of Palestinians from their West
Bank and Jerusalem homes to an exile in Jordan. Jordan, he said,
would become Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   That man, Ariel Sharon, is now foreign minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah of Jordan might do well _ while watching the
treacherous Saddam Hussein on his east and the silent Hafez Assad
on his north _ to keep a close eye on former General Sharon as
well. &QL;

   Microsoft is exploring the possibility of forming a strategic
alliance with Orange, a British mobile phone company, according to
industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance would strengthen Microsoft's grip on another
platform of the converging computer, telecoms and broadcast
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft entered the UK cable TV sector on Jan. 25 when it
invested in NTL, Britain's third-largest cable TV company, and a
tie-up with Orange would be seen as another step down the same
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not come off, but the Orange thing is part of a
larger picture,'' said a London banker. ``The idea is Orange and
NTL will link up, with Microsoft as the big brother.'' &QL;

   BEIRUT _ The Kurds' most radical leader, Abdullah Ocalan _ whose

no Robin Hood... &QL;

   The Kurdish PKK party, which organized the mass takeover of
Greek embassies around Europe Tuesday, is a hard outfit. No one
should be in any doubt about that. Nor should there be any doubt
about the party's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, whose rapid ejection
from the Greek embassy in Nairobi and extradition to Turkey has set
off this explosion of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is a terrorist with an appalling record of murder and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the IRA, the PKK is a mirror image of the forces that
have suppressed it. These are peoples for whom history has shown no
remorse... &QL;

   And it is in foreign policy that he needs to work hardest in

distractions of the impeachment process have had surprisingly few
ill effects in domestic affairs, damage has been done to America's
moral authority abroad.

fast-food joints _ even the toilet.

   Microsoft is exploring the possibility of forming a strategic
alliance with Orange, a British mobile phone company, according to
industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance would strengthen Microsoft's grip on another
platform of the converging computer, telecoms and broadcast
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft entered the UK cable TV sector on Jan. 25 when it
invested in NTL, Britain's third-largest cable TV company, and a
tie-up with Orange would be seen as another step down the same
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not come off, but the Orange thing is part of a
larger picture,'' said a London banker. ``The idea is Orange and
NTL will link up, with Microsoft as the big brother.'' &QL;

   BEIRUT _ The Kurds' most radical leader, Abdullah Ocalan _ whose
capture Tuesday set off a wave of simultaneous embassy takeovers
throughout Europe _ is, even in many Kurdish eyes, a psychopathic
killer. Ocalan is no political innocent, no abider by human rights,
no Robin Hood... &QL;

   The Kurdish PKK party, which organized the mass takeover of
Greek embassies around Europe Tuesday, is a hard outfit. No one
should be in any doubt about that. Nor should there be any doubt
about the party's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, whose rapid ejection
from the Greek embassy in Nairobi and extradition to Turkey has set
off this explosion of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is a terrorist with an appalling record of murder and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the IRA, the PKK is a mirror image of the forces that
have suppressed it. These are peoples for whom history has shown no
remorse... &QL;

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich is expected to be named to coach the
next Olympic Dream Team, which will represent the United States in
Sydney, Australia, in 2000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement could come as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that if NBA players are
used, then Rudy is going to be the coach,'' said a source at USA
Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Senior National Team Committee, headed by Rod Thorn, the
NBA's senior vice president of basketball operations, will meet
today in Chicago to discuss coaching and player candidates. Utah
coach Jerry Sloan, an assistant on the 1996 Olympic Team that won a
gold medal in Atlanta, also is said to be a candidate to coach the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Several NBA players reportedly have been informally contacted
about possibly participating in the qualifying tournament and the
2000 Olympics. Sources say the qualifying team and the Olympic team
will be identical or very close in makeup, ensuring continuity
through the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Should NBA players agree to participate, the selection committee
will establish a list of candidates and send off written agreements
for the players, lawyers and agents to sign and return.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich leads the coaching pack because of the job he did in
leading the United States team to a bronze medal in the World
Championships of Basketball in Athens, Greece, last summer.
Tomjanovich was supposed to coach a team of NBA players, but the
league's labor problems resulted in their honoring a union request
not to participate in the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich's team, composed of college and Continental
Basketball Association players, defeated Greece 84-61 to capture
the bronze, even though most experts predicted Team USA would be
quickly eliminated from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that Rudy is the leading candidate,'' said Russ
Granik, president of USA Basketball and deputy commissioner of the
NBA. ``When you look at the job he did with the team he took to
Greece, it was remarkable. While I don't know if you can say that
the committee owes Rudy a spot, there is the consideration that the
team he was originally supposed to coach and the team that he
actually took to Greece were vastly different. There is a lot of
sentiment that Rudy should be rewarded for the time and effort he
put in with that team.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee will consist of Thorn, a non-voting
member, and 10 voting members _ seven NBA appointees, one NCAA
appointee and two former athletes. The seven NBA appointees are
Wally Walker of the Seattle SuperSonics; Wes Unseld of the
Washington Wizards; Kevin McHale of the Minnesota Timberwolves;
Ernie Grunfeld of the New York Knicks; John Gabriel of the Orlando
Magic; Wayne Embry of the Cleveland Cavaliers; and C.M. Newton, the
athletic director at the University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, a past president of USA Basketball, replaced Mike
Dunleavy of the Portland Trail Blazers. The NCAA appointee is Mike
Krzyzewski of Duke. The two former athletes are Billy King, now the
general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, and former Rocket Clyde
Drexler, now the men's basketball coach at the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The chief concern of the selection committee is whether the
candidate would be willing to commit to both the Olympic qualifying
tournament, to be held this July in Puerto Rico, and the Olympics,
which will be held in Sydney from Sept. 15 through Oct. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Tomjanovich would make himself available to coach
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players support the idea of Tomjanovich's coaching the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like playing for Rudy, first of all because he has
(championship) rings,'' said the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, an All-Star
last season. ``He has won (NBA titles). But he runs a lot of
isolations, and I really like that. Under any circumstances,
myself, I definitely love to go one-on-one, so I would love to play
for Rudy T.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's teammate, Eddie Jones, who also made the 1998 All-Star
team, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play for Rudy,'' Jones said. ``Rudy is one of
those coaches where he's not like your average NBA coach. He's one
of those guys who lets you do what you do best. He gives you that
green light to do your job. When a coach gives you the green light
to do your job, that's nothing but confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I mean? That's confidence for a player, and
confidence that the coach has in you. He puts a lot of trust in his
players, and I think that's what players want in this league.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tiger Woods and David Duval lead the charge. Or
David Duval and Tiger Woods, depending on which week you calculate.
Add Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson and Justin Leonard _ all five entered
in this week's Nissan Open at Riviera Country Club _ and you have a
fistful of twentysomethings with more combined punch than the PGA
Tour has seen since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a generation ago, Johnny Miller, Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw,
Lanny Wadkins and Tom Watson graduated from Qualifying School
within four years of each other and went on to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   All won majors _ three in their first six years, two others
after turning 40 _ while combining to produce 117 tour victories,
three Ryder Cup coaches, a career money leader, a 47-year-old
Masters runner-up and 46- and 48-year-old tour winners.
</P>
<P>
   Their early efforts were overshadowed by the considerable
presence of Jack Nicklaus, arguably the greatest golfer of all time
and then in his prime. But Watson, Wadkins, Crenshaw, Miller and
Kite, the young guns of the '70s, won 50 times while in their 20s,
then demonstrated a staying power that has secured their positions
among the greats of the game.
</P>
<P>
   How do their 1990s counterparts compare?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so capable,'' Crenshaw said of Woods, Duval, Els,
Mickelson and Leonard. ``They really are a strong group.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the current young guns are off to a fast start is almost
an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, 27 and ranked No. 2 in the world, is playing ``the best
golf of anybody on the planet the past two years,'' in the opinion
of Els.
</P>
<P>
   A record-setting tour money leader in 1998 with $2,591,031,
Duval has won nine times in his last 30 starts, punctuating that
streak with a tour-record-equaling 59 in the final round of the Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic. As did Nicklaus, Duval challenges as often
as he wins, finishing second eight times in his four-plus years on
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, just 23 and ranked No. 1 in the world, won as a sponsor's
exemption in his fifth tour start after turning pro in 1996. He has
eight victories already, including a record 12-stroke win in the
1997 Masters. Last week, he set a course-record 62 while winning
the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines, coming within three
lipped-out putts of his own 59.
</P>
<P>
   Els, 29, counts two U.S. Open titles among his six tour
victories. Mickelson, also 29, has won 13 times as the longbeard of
this group, with eight seasons of tour tenure. Leonard, 26, has
four wins, including the British Open and Players Championship, in
his six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That's 40 wins and four majors already, and the peer-group
competition of this youthful group could contribute to continued
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw felt that attitude helped fuel the inner fire during
the 1970s, when he, Wadkins and Kite (all playing at Riviera this
week), Watson and Miller provided regular performance feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good group, we really did,'' Crenshaw said. ``We
stayed competitive among each other a good while. You knew if you
could handle those fellows week to week, you were going to do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who arrived on tour with the stated intention of winning
as often as he could, said last week he doesn't need peer pressure
to make him want to perform at his highest level:
</P>
<P>
   ``David is playing well, but I'm not working harder because of
his success,'' Woods said. ``Nothing has changed in regards to my
approach. I'm still intense as always.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval seems less intense than intensely focused, and never more
so than during his remarkable round of 59 at the par-72, 6,950-yard
Arnold Palmer Private Course in the final round of the Hope last
month. Starting the day seven strokes off the lead, he birdied four
of his first five holes, finished the front nine at 5-under 31,
then birdied six of his first seven holes on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Needing to birdie his final two holes to match the tour record
set by Al Geiberger in 1977 and tied by Chip Beck in '91, Duval
could do no better than par on No. 17. Then he got the record and a
one-stroke victory with a dramatic eagle on the 18th after hitting
a 5-iron, 218 yards over water to within six feet of the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's effort to describe what he had accomplished rivaled his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will,'' he said afterward when asked if the
reality of a 59 had downed on him. ``You might get some wild hair
out there one day when you shoot 63, you know, but to do it _ it is
just not something, I am sure, I expected to do in my career.
Certainly not in tournament golf.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with these latest young guns. Duval ties a tour
record, Woods breaks a course record and Leonard opens with three
straight top-five finishes _ all within 14 months of Mickelson's
two wins and two runner-up finishes in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Els said Tuesday he just hoped he could stay up with them _ this
from a man who won his second major two years ago at age 27.
</P>
<P>
   Great golf, to be sure, but let an earlier-generation young gun
put it in a fortysomething perspective:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing well, playing very well,'' said Kite, who
finished second in the 1997 Masters at age 47. ``But there are a
lot of guys in their 20s playing well. A lot of guys in their 40s,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of guys out here to push you _ plenty of
guys, that's for sure.''

   Silly, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A league where a President's Trophy accompanies the highest
score . . . A league that makes it a point to tie . . . A league
where the second-best team can be rewarded with the fourth playoff
seed?
</P>
<P>
   Silly, yes, but no one in the Coyotes organization is very much
amused. Not when all the posturing and point-fishing might land
Ducks and not minnows.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, one of those nights when you stick a
thermometer inside your hockey team and gauge the temperature, the
Coyotes came up raw. Manhandled and dwarfed, smothered and stifled.
Swatted away by the team that lives in corners and hits for
distance.

   The Flyers looked very much like Stanley Cup material. The
Coyotes looked very much like an over-matched, mistake-prone outfit
that turned over the puck with alarming regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Just as profound as the difference between the two teams could
be the fate awaiting the top two outfits in the Pacific Division.
One likely gets the eighth seed, the other a first-round roll of
the dice. If the postseason started today, the Coyotes would draw
the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   A mighty rival full of bad blood, insults and one-sided results.
At least this season, when the Coyotes are 0-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the kind of pairing you envisioned during a 17-3-3
start.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have a player, Ruslan Salei, who has delivered a
concussion to Daniel Briere and facial surgery to Mike Stapleton.
They eliminated the Coyotes two years ago. And they have a coach
who has already gotten under the skin of Coyotes boss Jim
Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   After a 5-1 spanking at America West Arena on Sunday, Ducks
Coach Craig Hartsburg claimed the Coyotes may have been too intent
on retribution to focus on winning. That prompted Schoenfeld to
declare that maybe the retribution isn't over, and after
disappearing into the locker room, he popped his head out once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike them, we're in a position where we can waste a few
points,'' Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   No, they're not.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first season that expansion has sprouted three
divisions, and already, there is room for grumbling. The three
champions are assured a 1-3 seeding, even if the Coyotes out-point
everyone but the Stars. Sort of like baseball allowing the wild
card to host three games in a five-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing says the Coyotes can't revert to their
unbeatable ways. Against the Flyers, they were without Dallas Drake
and Jyrki Lumme, and the Coyotes don't have much margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current trend, there's also a chance both the
Avalanche and the Red Wings will ultimately pass the Coyotes in the
ledger, making the scenario moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to step back a little bit and re-focus,'' Jeremy
Roenick said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a seven-game tour of the east in the next 14 days, a
victory over the Flyers would've been a wonderful catalyst. Except
the Coyotes never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the shot total bulged in the Coyotes' favor during the
first 10 minutes, they were only playing a game of soft toss with
the opposing goalie. And before the period ended, the Flyers simply
muscled away control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   John LeClair scored twice, and has 37 goals. Eric Lindros is
devastating, Dick Butkus on skates. Together, they have combined
for 69 goals. Tkachuk and Roenick have 39.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Coyotes still trail the Dallas Stars by six points in
the race for the Western Conference's top seed, and no ground has
been gained over the past two home games. What was once a two-point
deficit and a race to the finish is beginning to smell like
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have played three fewer games. The Coyotes are packing
for a seven-game trip and no one can find their offense. Plenty of
time for another push, but the signs are ominous:
</P>
<P>
   Second place, fourth seed, another first-round fight for
survival. &QL;

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Suns could blame their lackluster performance in a
109-92 beating they took Tuesday night from the Houston Rockets on
the NBA schedule makers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was their third game in four nights and the
Rockets were coming off four days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns could say it was inevitable after the energy they spent
Monday night overcoming a 19-point deficit in Denver. Or they could
just chalk it up to a bad night.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no excuses to fully explain their third-quarter
fold, which saw the Rockets turn a four-point lead into a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flat at both ends of the court,'' center Luc Longley
said. ``Houston did some good things to keep us out of what we
wanted to do offensively. There are some excuses out there, but
I'll let someone else throw them out and see if they stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what will stick:
</P>
<P>
   The club's starting backcourt of Jason Kidd and Rex Chapman
combined to make only 9 of 33 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's starting frontcourt of Hakeem Olajuwon, Othella
Harrington and Scottie Pippen combined for 55 points and 36
rebounds while limiting Longley, Tom Gugliotta and George McCloud
to a combined 28 points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen finished within one assist of a triple-double for the
Rockets, finishing with 19 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets didn't even have Charles Barkley. The league's
leading rebounder and the Rockets' leading scorer through five
games is out after having arthroscopic knee surgery. His
replacement, Othella Harrington, scored 17 points and took down 13
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we just couldn't get going,'' Suns Coach Danny
Ainge said. ``We had some long shots, and we didn't get back in
transition. Offensively, we dug ourselves a hole we couldn't get
out of.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get any easier, either. The Suns close out their
three-games-in-three-nights road trip tonight against the San
Antonio Spurs, who dumped them out of last season's playoffs in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has struggled to find his niche within the Rockets'
offense, but there never has been any question about his defense.
He started on on Kidd, who made only six of his 19 shots after
shooting 47 percent through the first six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all over the place in the second half,'' Houston Coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``On the offensive boards, on the break,
making passes. He is just a versatile player, and he gives me the
opportunity to play so many combinations of players.''
</P>
<P>
   And Chapman, who sat out the victory at Denver because of back
spasms, continued to look for his shooting rhythm. He came into the
game shooting only 26 percent and made three of 14 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little frustrated because our shots wouldn't go
down,'' Kidd said. ``We got some good looks, but we couldn't get
them to go. They were coming up short, so maybe our legs were
tired, but you've got to fight through those things. There's
another game (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   But it was evident the Suns, who beat the Los Angeles Clippers
Saturday night in overtime, then traveled to the Mile High City
Monday, were running on fumes. They had 11 fast-break points at
halftime. They had zero points from the break in the decisive third
quarter, in which the Rockets pushed their 45-41 halftime advantage
to a a 79-62 advantage going to the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to fast break when the other team is shooting 65
percent (as the Rockets did in the third quarter),'' Ainge noted.
``And a lot of their easy shots were the result of our bad
shooting. They definitely looked like the fresher team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way it goes. Everybody in the league has to go
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd said none of the Suns found an offensive rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a chance to run like we have,'' he said. ``It
wasn't a typical Suns game. We didn't get going up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   But veteran forward Clifford Robinson said the collapse can't be
blamed on what happened in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a challenge, you better step up and meet it,''
he said. ``If you don't, you're going to get beat.'' &QL;

BENES  WELCOMES ADDITIONS TO STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Say, didn't you used to be Andy Benes?
</P>
<P>
   Weren't you the guy who gutted out 231 innings for the
Diamondbacks in 1998, won seven of your last nine games, including
a near-no-hitter, to record an expansion-record 14 victories?
</P>
<P>
   The one and the same. But there's no ``used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of starters Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre
and Armando Reynoso via free agency over the winter, it might seem
as if Benes is an afterthought entering the club's second season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6, 245-pound right-hander is here to assure everyone
that he is alive and well and ready again to be a valuable member
of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   He reports today with 28 other pitchers and six catchers to
Tucson Electric Park as spring training officially begins.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a three-year, $18 million free agent contract with
the Diamondbacks on Feb. 3, 1998, Benes barely had time to catch
his breath before reporting to Tucson. He welcomed the challenge of
being the No. 1 man on the staff, but it also brought its share of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   He traditionally had been a slow starter, and he wasn't as
consistent early in 1998 as he would have liked. A loss to Colorado
in the franchise inaugural amid the hoopla at Bank One Ballpark,
followed by the club's first victory after an 0-5 start. Win-loss.
Loss-win. No-decisions thrown into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the year, and especially any time you come
into a new situation, you feel like you have to prove yourself,''
Benes said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor acknowledged that Benes
probably felt that way, ``even though he had our (manager's and
coaching staff's) confidence. He's the kind of guy where it just
takes him a while to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes admitted his attention may have been diverted somewhat in
the early going.
</P>
<P>
   By advising the young pitchers on the staff, ``I almost felt
like one of the parents. I don't mean that in a negative way
because I wanted to help them, provide encouragement. But it also
can make you lose track a little when you're getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-June, Benes had slumped to 4-7. On June 12 at Bank One
Ballpark, he faced his old St. Louis Cardinals teammates and lost
to Stottlemyre as Mark McGwire launched a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Benes also began to experience discomfort in his abdominal area.
It later was diagnosed as a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some pain. But it was more irritating than
anything,'' Benes said. ``I could have surgery then and miss at
least two or three weeks, or just deal with it. I decided to deal
with it and wait until after the season, unless it got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Warmer weather and Benes' resolve took over, and he began to
pitch better. He won seven of his last nine, and on Sept. 13 at
Cincinnati's Cinergy Field, he came within two outs of a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched better in the second half, but I really couldn't
tell you why,'' he said. ``You just keep going out there and trying
to be consistent, locating your pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something just comes over you. You focus on one spot and
you're just peppering it. You have such a clear focus. There's no
greater feeling than when you're in a groove like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He wished he could have pitched like that earlier in the season,
and he vowed to place more emphasis on conditioning and preparation
in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Diamondbacks pitchers Willie Blair and Omar Daal lamented
the rarity of offensive help in many of their outings. Benes had
similar feelings, but he didn't place all the blame on the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score enough runs on some occasions, but some of the
time I put us in a position where we ``had'' to score a bunch of
runs. I put too much heat on the offense,'' Benes said.
</P>
<P>
   The hernia surgery was done in early October and Benes became
what Manager Buck Showalter called ``a consistent soldier'' in
workouts with strength and conditioning coach Jeff Forney at Bank
One Ballpark. That's in addition to being an important member of
his kids' carpool rotation for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've done what I set out to do,'' Benes said. ``I've
dropped a lot of body fat, and I feel my arm is in better shape
than it has been and I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes is looking forward to working with the new pitchers. He
was a teammate of Johnson's in Seattle for part of the 1995 season
and was Stottlemyre's teammate in St. Louis in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The trio will be housed in a portion of the Bank One Ballpark
clubhouse that could be termed ``Intensity Corner.'' On game days,
enter at your own risk. Cordon it off with yellow police tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed last season, being with the younger guys, but
there's also something to be said of hanging around with guys who
you are closer in age with,'' said Benes, 31. ``We're all pretty
intense. Everybody goes out and pushes the next guy. That's why
Atlanta's so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our experience and ability, we'll be capable of throwing
a shutout every night. And though the offense wants to score as
much as it can, it won't feel like it has to score 8 or 9, maybe
only 4 or 5, to have a chance to win. Looking at our division,
we're capable of competing with anybody.'' &QL;

SLASH ON STAPLETON DOESN'T VEX NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 and TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anaheim's Ruslan Salei escaped Sunday's game against the Coyotes
without getting penalized for a slash to the face of Phoenix center
Mike Stapleton. Two days later, he also managed to escape a
suspension from Colin Campbell, the NHL's chief disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   A source in New York said that if Campbell hadn't made a ruling
by Tuesday, it was likely Salei wouldn't be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so afraid they were going to give me a penalty on that
play,'' Salei said. ``I was trying to block his shot by hitting him
in the stick, but my stick went up and I saw blood. I wasn't trying
to hit him in the face but I was lucky they didn't give me a
four-minute penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   After slew-footing Daniel Briere in the preseason and then
carving up Stapleton, Salei has become public enemy No. 1 with the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. I don't think those guys like me,'' he said. ``But it's a
game and I try to (tick) them off. Especially guys like (Keith)
Tkachuk and (Jeremy) Roenick. If you (tick) them off, they're going
to take a couple penalties and then you get them off their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Coach Jim Schoenfeld's post-game comments about
the Coyotes perhaps not being done settling the score with Salei
and the Ducks and how Phoenix can ``waste a few points'' through
possible retaliation, Salei said Schoenfeld can say what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he is thinking. I play for this team and I
don't know what their coach feels,'' Salei said. ``I'm sure they've
got a lot of extra points. They're not worried about those points
like we are.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Close call &QL;  &QL; 
The 27-stitch gash that caused Stapleton to miss Tuesday's meeting
with the Philadelphia Flyers came within a fraction of an inch of
costing his left eye. At that, it's uncertain whether there was
damage to the tear duct. The cut went to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   The swelling effected Stapleton's downward vision, which forced
him to sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of water around my eye,'' Stapleton said. ``I'm
going to go on the trip and we'll see if the tear duct works and I
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton refused comment on the play after that game, but had a
little to say Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the nasty part of the game,'' he said. ``Has any
suspension or anything been issued yet? It's unfortunate.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Keith-in-the-box &QL;  &QL; 
Anaheim wing Jim McKenzie, a former Coyote who was traded in the
summer, had several animated moments on the ice during Sunday's
game, including a jawing session with Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie got the last laugh, though, scoring his third goal of
the season late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, we go back and forth a lot,'' McKenzie said. ``Keith's got
a pretty good endorsement deal going with Jack in the Box. That's
pretty much him with that giant pumpkin for a head.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Star search &QL;  &QL; 
Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith is in Calgary, where he
attended Tuesday's Top Prospects Game, a scouting combine of sorts
featuring the top 40-rated juniors in North America eligible for
the June entry draft. &QL;  &QL; 
Help on the way &QL;  &QL; 
The Coyotes begin their seven-game trip Friday at Tampa Bay knowing
help is on the way. Right wing Dallas Drake, who has missed the
past seven games because of a shoulder separation, and defenseman
Jyrki Lumme, who has missed the past three games because of a groin
strain, will be making the trip.

IT'S CLEAR UA DIDN'T `STEAL' WIN FROM ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A statistical oddity in the Sun Devils' 86-80 loss to Arizona in
Tucson last week was that the winning Wildcats did not record a
steal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 268 games an ASU opponent did not steal
the ball. It last happened against Washington on March 8, 1990, in
the Pac-10 Tournament. Never before in Rob Evans' career as a head
coach, including six seasons at Mississippi, has an opponent gone
steal-less.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the first time the Wildcats have not had a steal
since 1993, despite their career steals leader (and No. 6 in Pac-10
history), Jason Terry, playing all 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ASU, which had 10 steals, has been careful with the ball lately,
averaging only 10.3 turnovers in the past five games. The Sun
Devils are third in the Pac-10 in fewest turnovers at 14.9 a game,
and have a total of 13 in their past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that is because they've had a chance to play with each
other for a while,'' Evans said. ``Guys know each other a lot
better. They know where they're gonna be, they know where they like
the basketball. We've gotten a lot more sound offensively and on
the floor in the last five, six, seven ball games.'' &QL; 
Attention, committee &QL; 
Although ASU's chances of getting into the NCAA Tournament remain
slim, Evans would like the selection committee to be aware of the
fact his team played the first eight games without one of its best
players, senior forward Mike Batiste.
</P>
<P>
   ASU was 4-4 with Batiste academically ineligible. Included were
defeats to Northern Arizona and New Orleans at home and to Kansas
State in overtime in the Maui Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste has averaged 16.8 points and 7.1 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that if Mike Batiste had
been here the whole year, we'd be very close, if not already in the
NCAA Tournament,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (13-11, 5-7 Pac-10) must win five of its six remaining games
and finish 10-8 in the conference, 18-10 overall to be considered.
Since 1990, 35 of 36 Pac-10 teams that won 10 conference games and
18 overall have gone to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which team didn't? ASU, which went 18-9 and 11-7 under
Bill Frieder in 1993. That also was the only Pac-10 team out of 33
this decade to win 11 conference games and not make the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Then-ASU Athletic Director Charles Harris was on the tournament
selection committee that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable, isn't it?,'' Frieder said. ``But that's ASU.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Stanford, Arizona, UCLA are in, and Washington is
close. In the latest Ratings Percentage Index, the Sun Devils were
64th. It hurts that two of their victories were over NCAA Division
II opponents, Chaminade and Alaska-Anchorage, and don't count.
</P>
<P>
   ASU could have avoided playing Chaminade in Maui, had it beaten
Kansas State. But the Alaska-Anchorage game was just bad luck.
Alaska-Anchorage upset Southern Methodist in the first round of
ASU's holiday tournament to earn a date with the Sun Devils in the
championship game. &QL; 
Just ducky
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils can forget about the NCAA Tournament and perhaps
even the NIT if they don't beat Oregon on Thursday at Wells Fargo
Arena. This will be the return of Oregon assistant and former ASU
interim head coach Don Newman to Tempe, but that's the last thing
on Evans' mind.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern is the performance of his team, and
the improvement of the Ducks since they lost to the Sun Devils,
64-60, in Eugene on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon has won three in a row, including a 94-81 victory
Saturday over Washington, which was the hottest team in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing with more confidence,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who have lost seven Pac-10 games by four points or
fewer, or in overtime, don't have a single go-to guy, but they are
balanced. In the Washington game, five players scored in
double-figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have anybody head and shoulders above anybody
else,'' Evans said, ``but when you get that kind of balance, that's
the best type of basketball team to have.'' &QL;

   He is the sixth offensive lineman and 11th junior college player
to commit to ASU.
</P>
<P>
   York was a three-year starter at Forney High School. During his
senior season, the Jackrabbits went 9-3 and two of their running
backs each gained more than 1,000 yards. Several recruiting
publications listed York as one of the top 100 seniors in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Washington an oral commitment in 1997 but had a change
of heart and signed with Baylor. He redshirted his first season and
then transferred to a Mississippi junior college, where he played
football this past season before transferring to a junior college
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Sun Devils' six offensive line recruits are 6-5 or
taller, and all weigh in at 300 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight players have signed letters of intent, and ASU may
add another soon. &QL;

FLYERS' UNSUNG HERO  
 ASSISTS BY JONES PROVE KEY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 42 points Keith Jones has scored for the Philadelphia Flyers
this season would make him the Phoenix Coyotes' No. 2 scorer.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Flyers, Jones is merely known as the right wing who
does all the dirty work for high-scoring John LeClair and Eric
Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair, the league goal-scoring leader with 37, had two goals
and Lindros added an assist, but Jones' work Tuesday night in the
Flyers' 4-1 win over the Coyotes was a perfect example of what he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   He assisted on the Flyers second, third and fourth goals, but it
was his role on the Flyers first goal in the first period that
typifies his play.
</P>
<P>
   Jones kept the puck alive behind the Coyotes and kept digging
until Lindros was able to pass it to the point to defenseman Chris
Therin, whose slap shot was deflected off LeClair's foot at the
faceoff circle and handcuffed Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonesey has been a tremendous help to us,'' said Lindros, who,
combined with LeClair, has produced 150 points this season. ``He's
a fireplug out there. He's always talking and communicating on the
ice. He has fun out there aggravating people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we sure are happy to have him on our side. He's always
contributing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros will get no argument from LeClair about Jones' value.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has brought us a lot of grit, especially on the
forecheck,'' LeClair said. ``He has a nose for the puck and has
been a real bonus. He came in, and the chemistry was great right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the key to the first goal, in there digging hard for
the puck. And on the second goal, he picked off the pass and dug it
out of the corner and fed it to me in front of the net. He's great
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is moves like acquiring Jones from Colorado after 12
games this year that have the Flyers and Lindros thinking this
could be the year that the organization's string of disappointments
in the Stanley Cup playoffs finally ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organization has recommitted itself to going out and
getting great players,'' Lindros said. ``Getting a goaltender like
John Vanbiesbrouck, then going out and getting Mikael Renberg back
and a guy like Daymond Langkow in the same deal has just been a
tremendous boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization has made the moves we needed to get back on
track. Combined with the fact everybody is having fun, it has made
for a lot of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence isn't something the Flyers lack. Perhaps the NHL's
biggest club, they've lost only eight of their past 40 games but
limped into Phoenix with a 1-2-2 record in their past five,
including blowing two-goal leads in Los Angeles and Colorado in
their past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something every team goes through during a season,''Jones
said. ``You're going to have your ups and downs. Fortunately, we've
had a lot of ups and very few dips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel this is the year the (Stanley Cup) disappointment
can end. We feel real good about our team, but there are a lot of
things to feel good about around here. But to do it we have to keep
focused on what the goal is, and at the same time, make it a fun
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been impressed with the leadership Lindros has
displayed this season, despite the fact Lindros has been made the
perennial fall guy in each of the Flyers' playoff collapses in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've played with him, but from what I've
seen, he seems comfortable with where he's at in his career and
wants to establish himself as one of the all-time greats _ and he
is,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to do that, he has to win Stanley Cups. Hopefully,
we'll help him do it and achieve all of our goals.''

FLYERS SPELL DOOM  
 STRENGTH LEAVES COYOTES FEELING DE FENSELESS
 &HT;     FLYERS 4, COYOTES 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were whispers around America West Arena before Tuesday's
clash between the Coyotes and the Philadelphia Flyers that the game
might be a preview of the Stanley Cup Finals in another four
months.
</P>
<P>
   If it was, the NHL could be staring at its fifth straight Finals
sweep, something the suits at the league office must be sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia pounded Phoenix, 4-1, to sweep the two-game season
series and drive home the point that they are the Beasts of the
East to contend with in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dominated us,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked whether they are the best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure looked like it tonight,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like his team, Philadelphia's John LeClair continued his
dominance over the Coyotes, scoring two goals, his league-leading
36th and 37th, and adding two assists. During the Flyers' 4-2 win
over Phoenix earlier this season, he had two goals and an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can skate with anybody, and we proved it tonight,''
said LeClair, who pulled to within one goal of catching former
Flyer Rick Tocchet for ninth place on Philadelphia's career
goal-scoring list (215).
</P>
<P>
   Flyers captain Eric Lindros, meanwhile, extended his
league-leading point-scoring streak to 17 games with a first-period
assist. If he scores a point Thursday at home against Montreal, he
will tie Flyers General Manager Bobby Clarke's franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow linemate Keith Jones, obtained earlier this season from
Colorado, produced three assists, giving the Flyers' No. 1 line a
total of eight points on the night. They also were a combined
plus-12. A Legion of Doom, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a really good team,'' Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick
said. ``That first line of theirs is just sheer power and strength,
and they move the puck very well. The defense is very stable _
they're so big, it's tough to get around them _ and they're all
really strong, which makes it tough to outmuscle them.''
</P>
<P>
   With a win, the Coyotes (29-15-10) could have overtaken the
Flyers (29-12-13) for the second-most points overall in the NHL
with 70. But now Philadelphia, which snapped an 0-2-1 skid, has a
three-point edge on Phoenix, which begins a seven-game, 14-day trip
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros didn't have to wait long to get his point. Midway
through the opening period, he set up the Flyers' go-ahead goal
with a feed out to Chris Therien at the point. Therien's blast was
deflected and rerouted past an upright Nikolai Khabibulin by
LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   Jones should have received an assist for pinching Coyotes
defenseman Teppo Numminen out of the play, pinning him against the
glass while LeClair set up shop in the slot area.
</P>
<P>
   With Therien in the box for kneeing, the Coyotes momentarily
thought they tied the score at 1. Oleg Tverdovsky sent a pinpoint
pass to the right of John Vanbiesbrouck (32 saves) to Roenick, who
hesitated before firing a shot between the goalie's pads. It
appeared as if he were waiting for rookie Daniel Briere to get out
of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, making a rare appearance on the first-unit power play
alongside Roenick and Tkachuk, didn't make much of an effort and
the goal correctly was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Coyotes could have used a few more players in the
crease. Defensively, that is. With little help in front of him,
Khabibulin was tagged for two more goals in the second period as
the Flyers prepared for a rout.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair camped on Khabibulin's doorstep, and with mild
resistence from defenseman Deron Quint, was allowed to take two
easy shots. The second one went in for his second goal of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Just 56 seconds later, Khabibulin was victimized again. This
time, Dmitri Tertyshny sent in a long shot from the point. It hit
off the right post and went underneath the goalie. When he fell on
it, the puck trickled in behind him. Nobody was there to try to
clear it out before it crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, for one, would love another shot at the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be wonderful,'' he said. ``If that were to be the
case, that would mean we'd be playing for the ultimate goal, and
that would be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   But would it be a perfect sweep?

WIFE MAKES OWN MARK  
 NIKKI GUGLIOTTA CONTENDS FOR 2000 TRIALS AS CYCLIST
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NikkiGugliotta likes being in her husband's athletic shadow, an
ever-lengthening one now that the 6-foot-10 Suns forward is away
from Kevin Garnett and a shared stage with the Minnesota
Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless someone asks, I don't want the attention, I don't need
it,'' Gugliotta said. ``I'm a mom first, there's no question.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a soon-to-be 2-year-old and wife of an NBA
All-Star is a runner turned duathlete turned road cyclist. Those
who have seen her ride say she has potential to make the 2000
Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   While not the highest-paid athlete in the household, the
30-year-old holds her own with husband in ability.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the testimony of Hugh Walton, a 1976 Canadian Olympic
cyclist and general manager of the Hind athletic apparel company,
who befriended Gugliotta when she and Tom lived in Boulder, Colo.,
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty apparent to me that she had an extraordinary
level of raw talent in terms of her strength and heart-lung
capacity,'' Walton said. ``The only thing holding her back from
winning virtually any race she entered would be experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience that Gugliotta hopes to gain beginning this weekend,
when she debuts with the Cox Atlanta Velo team at the Valley of the
Sun Stage Race, Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The women's development road team is a new direction for Cox
Atlanta Velo, which formerly focused on men's track cycling. The
team coach, Bobby Livingston, said Gugliotta, Kimberly Bruckner,
Shannon Greenhill, Marjon Marik and others are not seasoned enough
for one of the major cycling teams like Saeco-Timex or Saturn, but
have enough talent to break through in the buildup to the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on this team brings something different that will
help the team as a whole,'' Livingston said. ``I was coaching a
girl in Colorado (Bruckner) and wanted to get her on this team, and
Nikki was winning some of the races that she was finishing second
and third in.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton said during the Saturday morning elite rides in Boulder,
Gugliotta had some of the top professionals in the country asking,
``Who's the chick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these folks are deeply into cycling, and they're
clueless about the NBA and don't know who Tom Gugliotta is. But
they wanted to know who Nikki is.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd be the only woman in the top 20 (out of 100 in the group
rides), and that's saying something. She'd be sitting at the front,
taking her pulls, and there are only a couple of women around here
who can do that. Plus she'd be kind of popping around, talking a
lot. I told her, `Nikki, when you get in a race, you can't be
talking so much. You've got to mind your business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So just who is Nikki Gugliotta, and how is she able to move in
one of America's fastest cycling circles and chit-chat at the same
time?
</P>
<P>
   She is the former Nikki Cormack, a perennial state runner-up in
cross country and track while growing up in Grand Junction, Colo.
And partly because of a hamstring injury that became a stress
fracture, she is someone who never fully succeeded at North
Carolina State, where she met her husband 10 years ago when both
were freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had really peaked out in running, and not peaked out where I
had maybe hoped I would,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she gave in to friends, including Jim Kennedy, chairman-CEO
of Cox Enterprises Inc., who had been pestering her to try cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seemed like there was so much stuff involved,'' she
said. ``Running is so pure. But from the first ride, I thought it
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Gugliotta progressed from a beginning cyclist in April
to the World Duathlon amateur champion in November, winning the
U.S. Duathlon amateur title in between.
</P>
<P>
   Her 10K run, 40K bike, 5K run time at the World Championships in
Tasmania was faster than all the pros, who admittedly competed
later under different weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Worlds was awesome,'' said Gugliotta, who was successful
even though receiving the news that Tom had been traded for the
first time from Washington to Golden State 48 hours before her
race. ``It was almost incomprehensible to me that happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nationals was almost more emotional because Tom was there,
and I knew I had won. I had never won the big race. It was like,
Wow I did it. It's a small sport, and it's amateur, but I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, motherhood and the Minneapolis winters
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   She gave birth to Cameron Greer, who goes by her middle name, in
March 1997. Gugliotta started back into cycling on an exercise
bike, then progressed to a trainer before the move to Boulder,
where she raced well enough unattached to earn a spot with
Kennedy's recommendation on Cox Atlanta Velo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some help,'' Gugliotta said. ``There's a lot to learn
in cycling. Having teammates right there who can tell you don't do
that or go or whatever will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't had a full season to where I can judge if I
can reach an elite level. If I can, then I want to continue and
really strive to at least do the races to qualify (for the
Olympics). Then I've thought I want to have another child. Tom's
not ready for that yet, but I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things that you sacrifice, and I'm willing to
do it for a certain goal. But I'm not willing to do it just to go
around and travel every week to these races and drag my bike across
the country. It's a hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who still lives in Grand Junction, and her nanny,
who has moved three times with the Gugliottas, will help
uncomplicate what figures to become a jumbled schedule should
Nikki's career take off like in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she was to step back in (to duathlon) today, she's be one
of the top Americans competing in the sport,'' Tim Yount of USA
Triathlon said. ``That's how scary her talent is.''
</P>
<P>
   Too great to hide in the shadows. &QL;

 JOYNER-KERSEE BUSY AS SPEAKER, HELPER TO FLOJO'S DAUGHTER

<P>
   Did Jackie Joyner-Kersee, gone from track for all of six months,
think we'd actually forget?
</P>
<P>
   That arguably the greatest female athlete of the 20th century
would become a footnote so quickly in this pre-millennium year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there wouldn't be an interest,'' said Joyner-Kersee
of her post-retirement opportunities. ``It's been quite the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has a way of going with the flow. What I tried to
do when I was competing was to pair it with something bigger and
better when most athletes say they're too tired to do this. That
sacrifice and making those connections, I can see now it's paying
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Free from the consuming rigors of heptathlon training,
Joyner-Kersee is in high demand as a Nike spokeswoman. She will be
in Scottsdale on Sunday for the Lady Foot Locker 5K, the third of a
three-city race series dedicated to helping women break the cycle
of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   The event benefits the Chrysalis Shelters for women and
children, many of whom are victims of abandonment or abuse, and the
Arizona Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee has remained physically active, but at a more
relaxed pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to train, but I find myself giving workouts for
my friends and working out with them,'' said Joyner-Kersee, who
turns 37 on March 3. ``I do biking, I walk, a lot of jump-rope and
lift weights now and then. When it's cold (in her native St.
Louis), I do a lot of walking on the treadmill and sit-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to stay fit and keep my healthy lifestyle going. I
don't have to train to peak at a certain time or be at a certain
level, just a level of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The joy of motherhood is another emotion she's hoping to
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we have a family,'' said Joyner-Kersee, whose husband
and former coach, Bobby Kersee, continues to train sprinter Gail
Devers, high jumper Amy Acuff and some men in the major
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   After the Goodwill Games, at which Joyner-Kersee won the
heptathlon with 6,502 points, a score that was second best in the
world in 1998, she announced: ``Anybody wants to start talking to
her about how to make babies, you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee already is a mother of sorts due to the death in
September of her sister-in-law, Florence Griffith Joyner, a
three-time track gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics.
Joyner-Kersee's brother Al has been raising his daughter,
8-year-old Mary, since FloJo's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al is grieving every day, but I think his strength is seeing
his daughter,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``I knew Al would do everything
he could in his power to make sure his daughter is raised the way
Florence wanted her to be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary's a bundle of joy for him as well as she was for
Florence. They gain strength from one another, and it's hard for
them to be separated. Every time her dad leaves, she feels he might
not come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee said Mary Joyner started in gymnastics when she
was 18 months and now is getting into running. The child is
something of a tomboy yet reflects her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the strength of Florence, the creative side and
the nurturing side,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``At times, Florence was
very shy in a way that was probably misunderstood because of her
flashy uniforms. Sometimes you can see that within Mary, but she
has no problems making friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see Mary breaks my heart because one of the things Florence
wanted was to have a child and raise her. I was on the playground
one day and I just broke down thinking this is what Florence would
be doing.'' &QL;

NETS DEFEAT PISTONS, 97-82 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For the third consecutive New Jersey
Nets game there was a noncompetitive fourth quarter filled with
stylish dunks and celebration, second-string ballplayers and
vacating fans. The difference on Tuesday night, however, was that
the Nets were the ones flying toward the rim, exchanging high-fives
and basically partying on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Putting to a halt their humiliating three-game losing streak,
the Nets routed the Detroit Pistons by 97-82 before 15,633 at the
Continental Arena. The blowout came less than 24 hours after an
embarrassing 23-point loss at Miami provoked the team into having a
players-only meeting three hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the discussion centered around returning to what
Coach John Calipari and his players call ``Nets basketball'' _
playing fast, furious and free on both ends of the court. After the
team showed it had returned to its preferred style of play, Keith
Van Horn was one of many Nets (2-4) who made the announcement
afterward in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we were very down on ourselves and we just needed
to get that loss out of our heads and come out as a new team _ a
team that plays with passion and loves to play,'' Van Horn said.
``And now it's like we feel renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival started with Van Horn, who had his way with
Detroit's Don Reid and Jerome Williams in scoring a career-high 35
points. After averaging 16.3 points in his last three outings, the
Nets' leading scorer looked like the best player on the court on
Tuesday night, even with the superstar Grant Hill, who scored a
lonely 22 points, thrown in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith Van Horn is a heck of a ballplayer,'' said Pistons Coach
Alvin Gentry, who watched his team (3-4) drop its fourth straight
from the locker room after being ejected for earning back-to-back
technicals in the third quarter. ``He can be one of the elite
players in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplementing his typical spins and slashes to the basket with
jump shots, the 6-foot-10-inch power forward scored 30 or more
points for the first time this season and the sixth time in his
two-year career. He tied his previous high of 33 (scored on April
12, 1998, at Toronto) within three quarters and even made a rare
3-pointer from 33 feet as the shot clock neared zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just heard that the clock was running down so I said, `Oh
well, I'm feeling good tonight,' so I just tried it,'' said Van
Horn, who made 11 of 18 shots and grabbed 6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Horn did not carry the Nets alone. He was aided by four
other players scored in double figures, including the reserves Eric
Murdock (13 points) and the surprising newcomer Damon Jones (10).
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn credited Murdock's solid play on the offensive end with
helping him play his career game. The 6-foot point guard's ability
to run the pick-and-roll enabled Van Horn to break free for open
jump shots, something he had not been able to do without a true
point guard to run the play effectively. Calipari raved about
Murdock's offense and defense, noting that in addition to giving
the Nets a semblance of order he made five steals.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was Jones, the 6-4 guard who was playing
for the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association
less than five days ago. After the Nets had a 69-55 lead chopped to
69-62 heading into the final period, Jones scored 8 straight points
for New Jersey to set the rout in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Nailing two 3-pointers and a 20-footer, Jones bumped the lead
back to 77-64 two minutes into the fourth, and Detroit never
challenged again. The rookie who was playing only his second
National Basketball Association game said Calipari's insistence on
shooting open shots gave him the courage to launch jumpers in a
critical situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made me feel more comfortable than probably any coach
would with a player in my situation,'' Jones said. ``It was just
great to be able to go in there and knock down the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles (15 points) and Kendall Gill (11 points) also
added offensive support, but the two starting guards made their
impact on the defensive end. Gill made his fourth and final steal
with 4 minutes 40 seconds to play and capped nicely with a
fashionable reverse dunk that made it 94-72 and kicked off the
parade of second-stringers.
</P>
<P>
   The slam came less than a minute after Kittles had elevated from
the baseline for a thunderous windmill dunk over Jerry Stackhouse,
leading the crowd and his teammates on the bench to rise to their
feet. For the first time since returning from a bruised right knee
three games ago, Kittles was pleased with his performance. Though
he made only 6 of 15 shots, he had 6 assists and 3 steals.
``Tonight I made a conscious effort to have fun,'' Kittles said.
``I've been out of rhythm since coming back and the team has been
out of rhythm, but tonight we just wanted to smile and laugh and
play loose.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHARLES who?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Chuck, just kidding. We love you, and we wish you a speedy
recovery. Get that ol' knee well, fella, and don't you worry about
a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, it seems, are in good hands without Charles
Barkley. Soft hands. Confident hands. While nobody relishes losing
a legend who is averaging a mere 19 points and 17 boards per night,
the pain is lessened when you can replace him with somebody capable
of scoring 17 points and hogging a game-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, boy. Oh, my.
</P>
<P>
   Othella.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``O'' as in OK. ``O'' as in offense, too, of course.
Othella Harrington never met a shot he didn't cherish. He thinks he
can score anytime and on anybody. With his sizzling shooting
percentage _ .636 _ through six games, five of which the Rockets
have won with significant contributions from the formerly
unheralded ex-Hoya, he should just keep thinking exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can get mad at you when you make 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ```O' didn't do anything different tonight,'' Rudy Tomjanovich
argued, acting surprised that some folks were surprised by
Harrington's multifaceted performance in a 109-92 thrashing of the
Suns at Compaq Center on Tuesday night. ``The guy's always ready.
He's got a great attitude. Does he get mad (when he doesn't play)?
Doggone right he does. But he does it the right way. I don't care
if he sits down for two weeks. `O' is always ready when we need
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Except sitting isn't an option anymore for Harrington. He's in
the Rockets' mix to stay, whether it's pinch hitting for Barkley
over the next three to four weeks or reverting to his role as the
first frontcourt substitute. When Kevin Willis was dispatched to
Toronto after last season, a world of O-pportunity opened up for
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the mad scramble to build a team after the lockout
ended, ``O'' was a late signee. But don't equate that to his being
a low Tomjanovich priority. The delay was the result of the
salary-cap complications, not disinterest on the part of the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way he wasn't going to be with us,'' Rudy T said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I was praying for,'' Harrington said. ``Since we
weren't able to talk, I didn't know for sure. But Houston is the
only place I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He has picked a nice way to show his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Harrington's ``worst'' shooting night has been a
5-for-10 against Denver on Feb. 8. Since that game, he's a sizzling
17-for-24, scoring 39 points in 58 minutes. He hit seven of 10 from
the field at Phoenix's expense and ultimately received the highest
of NBA compliments. Danny Ainge ordered the Suns to double down on
him, like he was Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   His final points came on a six-foot jumper with 2{ minutes left
in the third quarter, and he put his feet up for the game's final
11:29 with the outcome no longer in question. He might be hungry to
play, but he will need his full reserve of energy with the Rockets
embarking today on a 12-day, eight-game wings-over-America ordeal
that will test everyone's fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, the lucky dog, will miss the trip, a harrowing prospect
if not for Harrington's newfound prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ```O' is as productive as anybody in the league right now,''
Tomjanovich said. ``But we saw it in him coming out of college. He
had his `basic,' a shot we knew he was going to score with no
matter what the level of competition was. We never doubted his
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, so he doesn't pile up a lot of assists (he has two
for the season). They'll come, though, as he learns to cope with
the double teams, which he's going to see more of unless opposing
coaches aren't paying attention to what he's capable of.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you can't double him on the fast break, and he's certain to
get his share of layups and dunks on the run with Scottie Pippen's
textbook outlet passes. Harrington's young legs are made for those
Pippen strikes, which contributed to Scottie's accumulating nine
assists against the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get wide and take off _ and always keep your eyes on
Scottie,'' Harrington said his blow-and-go philosophy has become.
``I'm too small to slow down. I've got to get to the basket
first.''
</P>
<P>
   A conditioning regimen over the long, long offseason rid him of
what was left of his baby fat. There's nothing soft or undeveloped
about his 6-9 physique. His arms are sinewy and his midsection
trim. ``O'' has, before our very eyes, acquired the look of a
thoroughbred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much weight he's lost,'' Tomjanovich said.
``All I know is he's moving well and playing at a level we always
thought he could reach. We drafted him believing he'd be a solid
NBA player.''
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, Harrington might become an NBA star. People with
short memories might even take to calling him the Big O.

HORRY TAKES A TIMEOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ For Robert Horry, the diagnosis is now less
troubling than the cure.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers forward learned Tuesday that his
irregular heartbeat is probably a result of his recent respiratory
infection and should disappear with rest. That was the good news.
But rest meant sitting out another two games, last night's and
tonight's, doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be reevaluated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I want to play,'' Horry said. ``I kind of hated lying in
a hospital bed, watching us play Indiana (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Things, of course, could be much worse. Horry's irregular
heartbeat gave him and everyone else a scare, but doctors say the
condition, which was still present Tuesday, is not serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the heart muscles are fine, the blood flow to it is
fine, it's just I've got an extra beat,'' Horry said. ``They said I
have nothing to worry about, I'm healthy. . . . You're dealing with
your heart, so I've got to take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out two more games is a precautionary measure and there
is ``an excellent chance his heart rhythm will return to normal
when he is completely healthy,'' according to a statement from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Horry began to feel pain and tightness in his chest Saturday
night and was sent to the hospital Sunday when the pain increased
on his way to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary,'' he said of the experience. ``You start
thinking about it (mortality), you (think about) what have you
accomplished, what have you done for your family. I tried not to
think about it. I tried to make myself think everything is fine and
that it's just one of those freak situations that will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The irregular beats continue whenever Horry exerts himself, but
the pain has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a whole lot better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wormwatch: This should come as no surprise: Dennis Rodman
still is not a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   The Worm was reportedly going to sign a contract Tuesday, just
as he was reportedly going to do for the preceding three days, but
he was instead in Las Vegas. Insiders now say he is waiting until
Thursday, in order to make his Lakers debut in Friday's nationally
televised game against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing-wise, that would probably be a good thing to do,''
said Shaquille O'Neal, who has heard the same rumors. ``He has, I
don't want to say negative marketing, but . . . it's
negativity-positivity marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Rick Fox returned to action after recovering
from an upper-respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, meanwhile, is showing no sign of being affected by a
groin strain that could be with him for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to go away. I'll have this problem for the
rest of my life,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not heeding advice from his abdominal specialist, Alex
McKechnie, to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex told me yesterday, `Don't dunk hard.' Me not dunking hard
is just me playing in my last years. And I can't play like that,''
he said. ``So whenever I step on the court, I go all out.'' &QL;

KNICKS DEFEAT RAPTORS, 95-85 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were giving Marcus Camby grief. The lanky young
fellow was just trying to put his coat on, collect his CD's and
exit discreetly after an emotional night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But there was the chatty Chris Childs, poking at Camby's bright
yellow suit and ribbing him for mumbling his rap lyrics. And there
was a chuckling Larry Johnson, trying to straighten Camby's rumpled
collar like a father before his son's senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but post-game grief. And that's when you knew: Camby has
been accepted by the very teammates who once wondered if he was a
tough enough to replace the scratch-resistant Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Camby's skin was thick enough to withstand Tuesday night, when
fan sentiment was with a former Knick who was clad like a Crayola
in Raptor purple. The indignity of it all for Oakley. The crowd was
with him and teetering in their opinion of Camby until Camby barged
his way into their hearts by scoring 11 points and grabbing 12
rebound in the Knicks' 95-85 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a whole lot of hoopla with Charles's return,'' said
Camby, who was acquired for Oakley on draft night last summer.
``I'm glad it's over for now. It felt real good to get the win. I
know Charles was really good for the time he was here. I knew the
crowd would be with him. I was just trying to play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley (11 points, 7 rebounds) decided on a peaceful
demonstration, and did not extract a pound of flesh from any member
of a Knick organization that makes him percolate with bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's former partner, in good times and in bad, would not
allow sentiment to overcome the evening and provide the stage for
an upset by Toronto. Instead, Patrick Ewing shook off the fatigue
of back-to-back games and scored 11 of his 16 points during a tight
fourth quarter. Allan Houston, mired early with faulty aim, also
found his second wind to deliver a team-high 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird seeing him over there,'' Ewing said. ``We chatted
for a minute and then he tried to take my head off.''
</P>
<P>
   As the buzzer sounded, Oakley shuffled off without looking at
his former team. Ewing playfully popped him in the back with a
towel, but Oakley kept walking. Perhaps he expected more. Two hours
earlier, Oakley made a grand entrance by leading his team on the
floor for warm-ups and ran right into the warm embrace of the early
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   The same hospitality was not offered by the organization.
Instead of playing a minutelong video tribute to Oakley in
appreciation of his decade of plow-horse-type effort before the
game, the Knicks showed the salute at halftime, when Oakley was in
the locker room and half the fans were at the concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was embarrassing,'' a dejected Oakley said. ``If they
wanted to do it, do it before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' management responded by claiming there was no other
time to show the video. The timing might have had something to do
with Mark Messier's return to the Garden last year. Messier was
moved to tears at the pre-game tribute. The Rangers were
emotionally drained as well and went on to lose that game to
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakley would most likely not have have teared up. He came to
the Garden bitter and angry at the Knicks' president, Ernie
Grunfeld, for his handling of the trade. So there were no
handshakes as he passed Ewing, the player he protected for a
decade. And there was no holding back. In a montage of Oak moments,
he hit the floor, crashed into the baseline seats and launched his
classic 18-foot jumpers. All this in the first half. As a topper,
Oakley defied his vertically challenged body and drove by Camby for
a layup and drew a foul. The fans lighted up.
</P>
<P>
   Camby could have blended into the background. He could have
given in to the pressure to be like Oakley and buckled under the
circumstance. But with a new-found edge, Camby shook off his
fragile wrap and stuck his neck inside the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's finishing his plays around the basket, and that's good,''
Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He tried to finesse a couple in the
last game. This time, he went with strength. We talked about that.
One thing about Marcus, you talk to him about something and he
tries to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby listens well, plays hard. And he has found acceptance from
the toughest crowd of all: his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how it is when you face your old team; you want to beat
them so bad,'' Johnson said. ``Marcus, he's coming around. He's
really looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for the yellow suit.

DODGERS HAVE ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There will be no search for a front-line starting
pitcher. Los Angeles Dodgers general Kevin Malone won't be burning
up phone lines in an attempt to add a bat to the middle of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   No, there won't be much drama in Dodgertown this spring. Panic?
Only if one of the offseason acquisitions _ Kevin Brown, Todd
Hundley or Devon White _ pulls up lame.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't have questions. They have answers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and catchers voluntarily report Thursday, signaling six
weeks of soul-searching and gap-plugging at many major-league
camps.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with the Dodgers, however, installed here as
favorites to win the National League West and battle the Atlanta
Braves (who else would it be?) for a trip to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves, but that's what the
Dodgers did in the offseason, getting ahead of nearly everyone in
the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions don't have to do with whether a guy can play at
this level or not,'' said first baseman Eric Karros. ``You know
Devon White can play center field. You know Jeff Shaw is a
major-league closer.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the issues facing the team seem daunting, but there are
a few things that need to be ironed out before the Dodgers face the
Arizona Diamondbacks in the April 5 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   __ The shortstop situation: The Dodgers want to know if Mark
Grudzielanek has improved enough defensively to play in the middle
of a championship team, or whether Jose Vizcaino's glove is enough
to offset his weak bat.
</P>
<P>
   __ A fifth starter: Figure Brown, Darren Dreifort, Chan Ho Park
and Carlos Perez as the top four. But will it be Dave Mlicki or
Ismael Valdes as the fifth starter? Or will one of the two be
traded or moved to the bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll work itself out,'' Malone said. ``I don't have to do
anything at any time. I think it's better to be safe than to making
a deal and then someone gets injured.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Raul Mondesi: Reports are that he is not in great shape, but
he has the ability to drop weight quickly. And will the acquisition
of White, reunited with former Florida Marlins teammate Gary
Sheffield in the outfield, be a positive influence on Mondesi?
</P>
<P>
   __ Future of Dodgertown: Dodgertown has been the club's
spring-training home since 1948, but it's looking more and more
like the team will be headed to Arizona next season. Not only would
it be fiscally advantageous for the Dodgers to leave Vero Beach, it
would allow them a better opportunity to scout divisional teams
during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't expect an announcement regarding future plans
until after spring training. Many people close to the Dodgers
expect the change, but it could turn into a public relations fiasco
if it were announced with the team still in town.
</P>
<P>
   __ Todd Hundley's elbow: The former Mets catcher's surgically
repaired right elbow will be monitored closely. How it responds to
the rigors of catching can't be determined in six weeks of
Grapefruit League play. Consider it an ongoing situation that won't
have a resolution until July or August.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, and the Fox group, constructed the Dodgers so questions
wouldn't be prevalent in spring training, and they've succeeded.
Even to the point where Malone admits there's not a lot of
shuffling to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some things I would definitely like to continue to
improve,'' Malone said. ``We have to emphasize our defense. We have
to improve there. Other than that, we have to stay healthy and get
everyone on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's about fine-tuning and not a major overhaul
or rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from years past, but you can't compare it to
years past because you're comparing apples and oranges,'' Karros
said. ``You're comparing a club with a $90-million payroll to a
club that had some fiscal parameters. To compare this ownership
group to previous ownership groups, it's an injustice. It's not
fair.''

 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the actress Jane Horrocks.  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1973, Risa Bramon Garcia turned her first
nobody into a star. His name was Martin, and she didn't care that
he had no acting experience. Ms. Garcia's instincts told her that
he could play the kind of guy you'd want to wash right out of your
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that he had (italics)presence,''(end italics)
said Ms. Garcia, who was then 16 and directing a high school
production of ``South Pacific.'' ``He had a beautiful singing
voice. I knew that because he used to sit behind me in history
class and hum.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 42, Ms. Garcia still has ears and eyes for talent. Over the
past 15 years she has become a top casting director in Hollywood,
where it is part of her legend that she persuaded the director John
Hughes to give Macaulay Culkin his first job in ``Uncle Buck'' and
nagged Jan De Bont until he let Sandra Bullock drive the bus in
``Speed.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``200 Cigarettes,'' which opens on Friday, Ms. Garcia had
only herself to hector. The 94-minute romantic comedy marks her
debut as a feature film director, a career consolidation that, for
her, is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of casting as my wait-ressing job,'' said Ms.
Garcia ``I spent years discovering people so that everyone else
could make money and become successful while I got to go home and
wonder, `How do I fulfill myself creatively?' Maybe that sounds
horrifyingly selfish or self-serving, but it's really not the case.
I got tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by Shana Larsen, ``200 Cigarettes'' is a comedy about
young partygoers variously making their way to a downtown loft to
celebrate New Year's Eve, 1981. The film opens with a couple
squabbling in the back seat of a garishly decorated taxi as it
whizzes by their destination.
</P>
<P>
   Even with eyes closed, any self-respecting teen-ager will know
that the rasping voice of one passenger belongs to the rock star
Courtney Love, who is following up her knowingly raunchy turn in
``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' by playing a talkative coquette who
hollers to the cabbie: ``Hey! You missed St. Marks!''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the video-clip generation, though, will no doubt
become aware that Ms. Love appears in ``200 Cigarettes'' weeks
before they pay their $8.50. ``200 Cigarettes'' was produced not
just by Dogstar Films and Lakeshore Entertainment but also by MTV
Films, a division of MTV: Music Television, which is a unit of
Viacom (the parent company of Paramount Pictures, which co-financed
the project with Lakeshore Entertainment).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Ms. Garcia's movie was made and will be promoted
in a manner that is straight out of the vertical integration
handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1995, MTV Films develops projects that tap into the
tastes of 15- to 25-year-olds. Be it a mega-hit like ``Beavis and
Butthead Do America'' or a blink-and-you'll-miss-it flop like
``Dead Man on Campus,'' everything on MTV Films' slate is given the
blitzkrieg promotional treatment on the MTV channel.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the half-hour special for the ``200 Cigarettes''
red-carpet premiere is shown on both MTV and its older-skewing
cousin, VH-1, regular viewers will have no doubt become familiar
with a pair of ``200 Cigarettes'' signature rock videos (by Debbie
Harry and the band Harvey Danger) and committed to memory the
series of 30-second ``200 Cigarettes'' spots combining interviews
and behind-the-scenes footage.
</P>
<P>
   That will help them sort out the 16 principal ``200 Cigarettes''
players, including Ms. Love, the teen crush-magnet Ben Affleck and
his brother, Casey, the indie favorite Christina Ricci and her
real-life best friend Gaby Hoffman, Janeane Garofalo, Martha
Plimpton, Paul Rudd and Goldie Hawn's 19-year-old daughter, Kate
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Few movies made in 33 wintry evenings for a paltry $6.5 million
can flaunt so much hipster star wattage. But Ms. Garcia's ability
to fill up the movie theater marquee, after all, was one of MTV
Films' prime incentives in agreeing to take a chance on the
fledgling filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risa's passion for the material attracted us to her,'' said
Van Toffler, MTV Films' executive vice president. ``The other thing
was her relationship to the talent. She's given a lot of people
their first jobs. And through her relationships she could just call
them up and say, `Hey, I need you for a couple of days on `200
Cigarettes.' '' On a side note, Toffler admitted to doing some
casting of his own, talking the singer Elvis Costello into putting
in a cameo appearance in ``200 Cigarettes'' and serving as musical
consultant. ``I think it's called begging,'' Toffler said.
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on her connections, Ms. Garcia went about
structuring a star-seducing production schedule that kept no
performer from more lucrative commitments for more than two and a
half weeks. (``A revolving door of actors, coming in and doing
their bit and leaving,'' is how she described it.) But all the
preparation in the world couldn't guarantee that things would go
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutal,'' Ms. Garcia said about the reception she received to
her first official offer: she had wanted Jenna Elfman, of the
sitcom ``Dharma and Greg,'' to be Cindy, the chaste sweetheart of
``200 Cigarettes.'' ``Her manager said, `She only wants to work
with A-list directors and do leads in movies now,''' Ms. Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Ms. Garcia's favor calls paid off, and last March
she and her husband of 10 years, the film executive Rene Garcia,
packed up their two children, Sam, then 20 months, and Gracie, who
was barely 10 months old, and moved from their sprawling home in
the hills of the San Fernando Valley to a two-story brownstone on
the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next thing she knew, Ms. Garcia was on location at the Ace
Bar on East Fifth Street in the wee hours of the morning, standing
behind the camera, cajoling Ben Affleck into improvising
self-mocking soliloquies for scale wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every take, Ben would say: `Risa! Please! Say `cut'
already! I'm making such a fool of myself,'' Ms. Garcia said,
laughing. To directors like Jan De Bont, it is no news that Ms.
Garcia got Affleck to throw himself into his part as an oafish
bartender. Having often employed her during her casting-director
days, De Bont knew what Ms. Garcia could do with even an unknown
quaking before her at an open cattle call audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd pull things out of them that they'd never do for me; she
has this uncanny way of playing with actors, getting them to open
up,'' said De Bont, who recalled how Ms. Garcia would spend her
down time hanging around the sets of his action thrillers, quizzing
everyone on the crew about the technical end of making movies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everyone on the block where Ms. Garcia grew up in
Montreal could tell you that she behaved like a hot-ticket director
from a very early age. The daughter of a print shop owner, George
Bramon, and his wife, Sarah, Ms. Garcia was known for staging plays
in her garage, and charging admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother would get these calls from other mothers saying,
`Risa is taking all of our kids' money,' '' said Ms. Garcia, who
added that she was ``never interested in being in the one in the
limelight.'' ``It has always made sense for this to be my job.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 21, after graduating from York University in Toronto with
a degree in drama, Ms. Garcia moved to Weehawken, N.J. She held
every labor-of-love position at Manhattan's Ensemble Studio Theater
_ including answering the phones. From the early to mid-80s she
produced the company's annual marathon of one-act plays and worked
with writers like David Mamet, Christopher Durang and John Patrick
Shanley. But it didn't pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 she decided to quit waiting tables to make ends meet and
figured out another way to subsidize her love for directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew all the actors,'' Ms. Garcia reasoned when she
and Billy Hopkins, another Ensemble Studio member, resolved to give
the casting business a try. ``People were always telling us, `You
can make a living at this.' And I thought, `You know what? They're
right.' '' Their maiden assignment was Susan Seidelman's 1984
comedy, ``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' the coup of which was
picking a New York club diva named Madonna to expertly play, well,
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in ``200 Cigarettes,'' a young blond ingenue makes her
entrance wearing a demure all-pink outfit and an expression of
guileless uncertainty. For a few moments, she simply darts between
her apartment building doorway and a taxi idling curbside and then
back again. The actress, Kate Hudson, isn't as instantly
identifiable as Ms. Garcia's first choice for the part, Ms. Elfman
(or, for that matter, most of her ``200 Cigarettes'' co-stars).
</P>
<P>
   But there is something winning about how Ms. Hudson sails
through this bit of daffy business, managing to evoke her mother,
Goldie Hawn, yet also seem nothing like her at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate's getting discovered from this movie _ and I love that,''
said Ms. Garcia, who can recall every detail about Ms. Hudson's
audition. ``I swear to God, after she said three words, I knew she
was exactly right.'' Can she explain what it felt like to know that
she was the director who would benefit from precision casting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Delicious,'' Ms. Garcia replied.

THIS SPRING, THE SEASON SPEAKS WITH AN ENGLISH ACCENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREA STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 10 weeks between now and the cutoff date at the end of
April for Tony Award nominations, a crowd of visitors from the
British Isles will be taking their places on New York stages.
</P>
<P>
   Last season around this time, theatergoers were anticipating a
similar Anglo-Irish delivery of plays, performers and directors.
And next season is already shaping up as a busy one for London
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Is it all one way? Not quite. Currently on the boards in London
are some familiar-sounding shows: ``Annie,'' ``Chicago,'' ``Beauty
and the Beast'' and ``Rent.'' The productions incorporate the
American creative teams to some degree, while in the case of the
National Theater's acclaimed ``Oklahoma!,'' the American material
gets a British gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the path to New York this season has already been
taken by Harold Pinter's ``Ashes to Ashes'' and David Hare's ``Blue
Room,'' among others. The first of the newer arrivals opens this
Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES' The story of how this recently
discovered early play by Tennessee Williams found its way to the
stage is a drama in itself. A cooperative effort by the Royal
National Theater in London, the Moving Theater (founded by Vanessa
Redgrave and her brother, Corin Redgrave) and the Alley Theater in
Houston, the drama is set in a brutal American prison in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave, as the corrupt warden, leads a company of 18 British
and American actors, directed by Trevor Nunn, the artistic chief of
the National Theater. Now in previews at Circle in the Square on
Broadway, it opens on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   `VIA DOLOROSA' This is so much the playwright David Hare's
season on Broadway that he will be performing himself. The author
of the current ``Blue Room'' and the arriving ``Amy's View'' made
his acting debut in London in this one-man examination of the
Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a first-time visit to Israel in 1997, Hare's story
of his journey received very favorable reviews in London. The play,
directed by Stephen Daldry, begins previews on March 5 at the Booth
Theater, where it opens on March 18.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `CLOSER' Several seasons ago, Patrick Marber's dark comedy
``Dealer's Choice,'' about poker, competition and fathers and sons,
made an appearance in New York. This time, the playwright, who
again directs, examines sexual competition (and jealousy) among men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   The four people involved are portrayed by Natasha Richardson,
Rupert Graves, Anna Friel and Ciaran Hinds. ``Closer,'' which won
the 1998 Olivier Award for best play (the British equivalent of the
Tony), begins previews at the Music Box Theater on March 9 and
opens on March 25. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE WEIR' The young Irish playwright Conor McPherson arrived
Off Broadway last season with his quirky one-man narrative ``St.
Nicholas,'' about a theater critic amid a houseful of vampires.
Performed by Brian Cox, it won a handful of glowing reviews.
</P>
<P>
   This season, McPherson's tale of five people in a rural Irish
pub opens on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theater on April 1. The
all-Irish cast includes Brendan Coyle, who just won an Olivier
Award for best supporting performance as the bartender. ``The
Weir'' itself took the Olivier for best play. Previews begin on
March 23.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ICEMAN COMETH' Kevin Spacey, the star, and Howard Davies,
the director, have won the triple crown for this four-hour-plus
visit to Harry Hope's bar by Eugene O'Neill. The two recently
walked away with the Oliviers for best actor and best director.
They had already won the Evening Standard and London Critics Circle
awards.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the cast will include a number of actors from the
Almeida Theater production in London, as well as such new arrivals
as Robert Sean Leonard, Tony Danza, Paul Giamatti and Jeff Weiss.
Previews begin March 29 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, where the
play opens on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   `MARLENE' Sian Phillips will be repeating her London role as
Marlene Dietrich in Pam Gems' musical play. Backstage in a Paris
concert hall in 1969, Dietrich prepares for her final farewell
concert tour. If that means scrubbing the floor herself, so be it.
Directed by Sean Mathias. Previews begin March 30 at the Cort
Theater. The show opens on April 11. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `AMY'S VIEW' David Hare's play about the disjunction between
what life should be and what it is brings Judi Dench back to
Broadway after 40 years. In this valentine to the stage, Dame Judi
plays an actress who is passionate about the theater, and the
mother of Amy, portrayed by Samantha Bond. Directed by Richard
Eyre, the play begins previews on April 3 at the Ethel Barrymore
Theater and opens on April 15. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Off Broadway, McPherson's play ``This Lime Tree Bower'' opens in
May at Primary Stages, the same month that the New Group presents
Ayub Khan-Din's bittersweet comedy ``East Is East,'' about growing
up in an Asian family in the north of England. This summer, Lincoln
Center Festival will present a lineup of Irish theater.
</P>
<P>
   And what of next season? ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the stage
version of the 1977 movie and a hit in London, is heading to
Broadway, as is Peter Hall's current revival of ``Amadeus'' by
Peter Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   Yasmina Reza, the author of ``Art,'' will be back in New York
with ``The Unexpected Man.'' The hope is that Michael Gambon and
Eileen Atkins will repeat their London roles.

A REDGRAVE MOVES UP IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for NIGHTINGALES-THEATER)  
 (af)  
 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There will be two unfamiliar entities onstage when
``Not About Nightingales'' opens on Thursday at Circle in the
Square on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, will be Tennessee Williams' fierce, lyrical
prison play, having its belated New York premiere 61 years after it
was written. And second, playing the central role of the warden,
will be Corin Redgrave, who has not been on Broadway since 1963 and
who is the least known of the famous acting Redgraves.
</P>
<P>
   With the imposing demeanor of the politician he has often played
and might have been, Redgrave, 59, is the middle brother to Lynn
and Vanessa, the son of the late Sir Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave made his initial trip to Broadway as an aristocratic
young pilot in ``Chips With Everything,'' Arnold Wesker's play
about class divisions among a group of Royal Air Force cadets.
After that transfer from the Royal Court Theater in London, he
dropped from the view of New York theatergoers, devoting much time
at home to left-wing politics.
</P>
<P>
   He was often joined in his crusades by Vanessa, who is two years
his senior. But whereas Vanessa Redgrave has fought to advance both
her political views and her eminent career, Redgrave could for many
years be found beating the drum for the Socialist Labor League or
the Workers' Revolutionary Party, rather than playing Hamlet,
Antony, Vanya or any of his distinguished father's other signature
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has his acting elicited more attention than his
activism. In addition to what Ben Brantley, writing in The New York
Times, called an ``outsize, satanic'' performance as Boss Whalen in
``Not About Nightingales,'' Redgrave has been acclaimed in
productions of plays by Martin Sherman (``Some Sunny Day''),
Richard Nelson (``The General From America'') and Noel Coward (``A
Song at Twilight''), as well as onscreen as Sir Walter Elliot in
``Persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   As Redgrave describes it, chatting amiably in the front room of
his South London home, the uptick in his career has more to do with
external factors than with any change in himself. ``I would have a
lot of complaints if I ever sat down and thought about it too
much,'' he said, sounding less angry than regretful about all the
work he has never been offered. ``There are parts for a long time
in your life you can play, and then suddenly you know you're not
going to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave did what he could to create his own opportunities,
founding the Moving Theater with his older sister. (It was the
Moving Theater that co-produced the world premiere of ``Not About
Nightingales'' at the Royal National Theater last year, in
association with the Alley Theater in Houston.) But, he said, for
24 years, ``I didn't work in BBC television, which is one of the
major employers then and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, he drove into a BBC parking lot, on the way to
film a production of ``Measure for Measure'': ``I remember saying
to myself, `How strange: here I am again, and it's 1994, and I was
last here in 1970.' I had one or two avenues like the Young Vic,
doing usually one play a year. But even there, the theater got a
little bit of a backlash for employing people like me. They were
told, `You've got to stop being so political a theater.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, others see in his recent success an actor newly
invigorated in his art. ``Corin is like a man who has suddenly
decided to cultivate his garden, having let it run down,'' said
Simon Callow, who appeared with Redgrave in the film ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral'' in 1994 and then directed him on the West
End last year in ``HRH,'' a play by Snoo Wilson about the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `It's not that Corin has mellowed,'' Callow said. ``He's still a
very clear and convinced Trotskyist. But whatever it is that has
relaxed in him, has enabled him to release all these
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hall, the veteran theater director who has known the
Redgrave family more than 30 years, said about Redgrave: ``He was
always a very sound actor; he has become a great one. What has
happened now is that he seems to have inherited the mantle of his
father in a major way.''
</P>
<P>
   That inheritance, paradoxically, may result in part from
Redgrave's ability at last to step away from the shadow of his
father, who died in 1985. (The son has movingly examined his
father's legacy in a 1995 book, ``Michael Redgrave _ My Father''
and a subsequent television documentary.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's a power in knowing that what Corin does onstage is
his own thing,'' said his sister Lynn. Four years younger than he,
she has herself recently re-energized her career, winning an Oscar
nomination for her performance in the film ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to see him as Rosmer,'' Ms. Redgrave said, about a
Young Vic production of Ibsen's ``Rosmersholm'' in 1992, ``and
there were all those things again that he was wonderfully as a
young actor; suddenly, he was free.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Michell, who has directed Redgrave in three different
disciplines in as many years _ the play ``Some Sunny Day,'' the
film ``Persuasion'' and the television documentary about Michael
Redgrave _ favors a political explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the renaissance of Corin's career coinciding with the
fall of the Berlin Wall,'' Michell said. ``I don't think the battle
was lost, but the dogmatism was put to bed perhaps. Corin is
flexing different muscles, and I'm thrilled for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Redgrave also spoke about the toll politics took on her
brother's career. ``There was a period when Corin was
blacklisted,'' she said. ``There was a period when I was
blacklisted. It's very frustrating if you can't get work and you're
out of work. How do you pay your bills? It's not a question of
frustration; it's a question of being demented.''
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave said that the instability of his career had caused
periods of financial difficulty. Yet there was some respite in the
fact that because of the varying ages of his four children from two
marriages, he was never responsible for all of them at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   For 22 years, he has lived on an unprepossessing street in an
area known as Balham. The actor said dryly that the neighborhood
``has virtually no distinguishing marks at all.'' He first moved
there to join Kika Markham, an actress he married 13 years ago.
Their older son, Harvey, 20, is in his first year at Manchester
University; the younger, Arden, 15, attends a nearby high school.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave's daughter, Jemma, 33, is an actress; his oldest son,
Luke, 30, works on movie sets as a focus-puller. Redgrave and their
mother, Deirdre Hamilton-Hill, who died just over a year ago of
cancer, were divorced in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1986 memoir, ``A Family and Its Fortunes,'' Redgrave's
mother, the actress Rachel Kempson, who is 89, suggested that the
intensity of Redgrave's political life contributed to the
dissolution of his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Redgrave is still more passionate when riffing
on the privatization of Britain's railroads or on the Clinton
impeachment hearings (``that ghastly and absurd trial'') than when
he is reflecting upon, say, a past movie role.
</P>
<P>
   But he will allow himself some gratified murmurings about the
current state of his professional life. And, indeed, that evening
he would be taking the stage in ``A Song at Twilight,'' for which
he received excellent reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to a certain time in your life,'' Redgrave said,
``which is probably the most productive and creative time in your
life, nevertheless it's also a time when you have to both make
opportunities and seize them because you know they're not
necessarily going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   So is he in his prime?
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall see,'' Redgrave said, ``whether, after all, this is
one of those plateaus where you've climbed a great height, and yet
there's always something beyond. Hopefully, there's always
something beyond.''

A WORK TWICE LOST, NOW TWICE FOUND?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of music is filled with accounts of major new works
that received prominent premieres only to languish thereafter and
sometimes virtually disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Even when everything breaks right in the beginning, it is
difficult for a work to achieve wide exposure, let alone repertory
status. Take the Symphony for Classical Orchestra by the respected
American Neo-Classical composer Harold Shapero.
</P>
<P>
   Shapero was 27 when he completed this 45-minute work, which was
given its promising first performance in January 1948 by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra and Leonard Bernstein, who was then 29. Two
months later, George Szell conducted it with the Cleveland
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   And on one hectic day in 1953, Bernstein and the Columbia
Symphony Orchestra recorded the piece in New York, producing a
remarkable performance that circulated for years and won the
symphony admirers among musicians and composers sympathetic to
Neo-Classicism. That recording, long unavailable, has now been
reissued by Sony Classical in its Bernstein Century series (SMK
60725; CD).
</P>
<P>
   The symphony, meanwhile, gradually fell into oblivion, until
Andre Previn and the Los Angeles Philharmonic performed it to
acclaim in 1986. They brought it back the next season in another
critical and audience triumph, but the piece has since been
languishing again.
</P>
<P>
   How can a major work, introduced so auspiciously, get lost for
more than three decades, then come back and get lost again? The
answers speak to the difficulty all new music faces in gaining an
audience, and whatever the reasons, this is a dismaying and
cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   Shapero, who was born in Lynn, Mass., in 1920, studied piano as
a young man. He played jazz for fun and for profit, and later did
arrangements for Benny Goodman's band. One of his first composition
teachers, Ernst Krenek, tutored him in 12-tone technique, but at
Harvard University Shapero fell strongly under the influence of
Igor Stravinsky, who presented the Norton Lectures there in the
1939-40 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Copland, too, became an important mentor and friend to
Shapero. Impressed with the young composer's early Woodwind
Quintet, Copland sent a teasing note to Bernstein, who was two
years ahead of Shapero at Harvard: ``Look to your laurels! There
may be another composer in your neighborhood!''
</P>
<P>
   When Shapero started composing his symphony, he thought he was
writing a divertimento of, say, 20 minutes. ``But I had wildly
miscalculated my materials,'' he said recently from his home in
Natick, Mass. ``When I measured out the slow movement, I was
shocked. It was 15 minutes. I stopped working for a month. Then I
tried to cut the thing. But it fought me and won. Slowly I became
aware, with horror, of what I was writing: a long and difficult
symphony. I thought I'd never get it performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shapero received a modest award from the Koussevitzky
Foundation. ``When my friend Copland heard the news,'' Shapero
said, ``he kidded me: `You're the only jerk who would write a piece
like that for $500.''' But it was enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bernstein got interested. He and Shapero had become good
friends at Harvard. In 1947, Bernstein had a guest stint with the
Boston Symphony, and seeing the newly completed manuscript of the
symphony one day, ``he kind of scooped it up and took it away,''
Shapero said.
</P>
<P>
   The work is indeed long and difficult. But it has many admirers,
including the critic Alan Rich, who, after Previn's performance,
called it ``the greatest American symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, Neo-Classicism, an attempt to reinvigorate
Classical forms and procedures with innovative harmonic and
rhythmic techniques, was a vital movement in American composition,
and Shapero believed intensely in the creative value of looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   The imitation of a model, he argued in a 1946 article in the
journal Modern Music, could bring about the discovery of personal
materials in a musician's own voice. Stravinsky, he noted, was fond
of repeating a remark of his own teacher, Rimsky-Korsakov: ``I
don't like that which resembles nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The models for Shapero, in this work and in general, were
Stravinsky, who was then in his prolonged Neo-Classical period, and
Beethoven, who remains Shapero's hero. Indeed, the Symphony for
Classical Orchestra is in some ways a soul mate of Beethoven's
Seventh Symphony, which it slyly quotes.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Beethoven, the first of its four movements opens with
an Adagio that shimmers with flickering colors and sustained
harmonies, leading to a long, bustling, contrapuntal Allegro. The
second movement is a wistfully lyrical yet rhythmically restless
Adagietto; then comes a misbehaving Scherzo, which hurtles toward
the imposingly structured but spirited Finale.
</P>
<P>
   Shapero, however, fractures the Classical models while paying
homage. The piece is essentially tonal, with the outer movements
hewing to B flat; but the harmonic language contains elements of
polytonality, and the music is spiky with dissonance, rhythmically
shifty and utterly fresh. Phrases are filled with surprising
asymmetries.
</P>
<P>
   There is a youthful challenge in Shapero's tribute, as if he
were saying, ``Take that, Beethoven!'' It's the same quality that
you hear in early Beethoven: ``I'll show you, my revered teacher
Haydn, how to write a piano sonata.'' Or that you see in early
Picasso: ``Take that, Cezanne!''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's premiere performance received mixed reviews, and an
unfavorable one from Cyrus Durgin, of the Boston Globe, who was
still fighting modern music, Shapero said. ``He once wrote that
Stravinsky should study Rachmaninoff to learn how to write for the
orchestra.'' But there was a buzz about the piece among musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The experience with Szell in Cleveland was exasperating. ``Szell
was a fabulous musician who hated modern music,'' Shapero said.
``He summoned me, asked me to play the piece on the piano, then
told me I didn't know how to modulate and should study Richard
Strauss.'' Under pressure to perform works by Americans, Szell
agreed to present the symphony. The reviews were equivocal at best,
hostile at worst.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With further support from the Koussevitzky Foundation, Bernstein
recorded the work in New York with the Columbia Symphony, a
freelance ensemble drawn for recording purposes from the best
musicians of the area. On the day of the recording, Bernstein had a
temperature of 102, Shapero said. ``During one break, he took a cab
uptown to get his doctor to shoot him full of penicillin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the performance is bracing, rhythmically vivid and full of
character. It spread the gospel of the work for the moment. But
performances failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   As years went by, the symphony fell victim to the polemical
battles that flared in the 1960s and 70s between atonal and
Serialist composers, on one hand, and Neo-Classicists like Shapero,
who adhered to some semblance of tonality, on the other. Many of
Shapero's works were deemed conservative by those who advocated
12-tone procedures and claimed the intellectual high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Shapero, who had been teaching at Brandeis University since
1950, was stung by the criticism, and his compositional output
declined severely in the 1960s and after. Asked about the falloff,
he answers only with self-deprecating barbs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains curious that Bernstein, who had been such a
champion of the symphony, later neglected it, since he continued to
conduct Neo-Classical and neo-Romantic symphonies of less merit by
composers like Roy Harris, David Diamond and others. Occasionally
Bernstein would perform the slow movement on a program. But all in
all, it was discouraging, Shapero said. ``Once he told me, `I could
play the whole thing, but why should I knock myself out for you?'
Was he kidding? I couldn't figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1986, John Harbison, an admirer of Shapero's music and
at the time composer-in-residence at the Los Angles Philharmonic,
brought the symphony to Previn's attention. The conductor was
completely taken with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the blue one day,'' Shapero recalled, ``I got a call,
saying: `This is Andre Previn. I want to perform your symphony.' I
thought it was a hoax and nearly hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Bernheimer, then the critic of The Los Angeles Times and
never one to mollycoddle contemporary works, made a point of
shaking Shapero's hand after the performance and wrote a glowing
review. The response was so enthusiastic that Previn brought the
work back in 1988. A recording, drawn from two of the performances
that year, was released by New World Records and is still
available.
</P>
<P>
   Previn took the work on guest-conducting appearances over the
next two years with the major orchestras in Pittsburgh, Cleveland
and Boston. He was scheduled to perform it with the Chicago
Symphony as well, but took ill. The concert was covered on short
notice by Christopher Keene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor fellow,'' Shapero said of Keene, who died in 1995. ``He
was so scared by it, he could not be talked out of taking the outer
movements at almost half the proper tempos.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains a challenging work for players, as was clear when
Previn conducted the work with the Boston Symphony in 1990. The
shape and character of the piece came through, and the audience
gave it a prolonged ovation. But the playing was tentative and
rough.
</P>
<P>
   Shapero is indebted to Previn, whom he calls ``the most
excellent and self-effacing conductor imaginable.'' Since those
performances, apart from a few in 1994 and 1995 by Roger Nierenberg
and the Jacksonville Symphony in Florida, the symphony has again
disappeared from major concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted for this article, Shapero was not aware that Sony
had reissued the Bernstein recording, which he had not heard in
years. He recalled it as being a bit driven and hyperactive. He
admires Previn's recording greatly.
</P>
<P>
   That account is strong and clear, to be sure. But Previn tends
to milk the patches of sweet lyricism, the moments that recall the
bucolic quietude of Copland in his Americana vein. Bernstein lets
the lyricism of those passages take care of itself and concentrates
on rendering the rhythms with crispness and energy. And he projects
a visceral sense of the work as an architectonic whole.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernstein recording, called ``Modern Masters,'' also offers
shorter works by Luigi Dallapiccola and Nikolai Lopatnikoff in
stirring performances that indicate how involved Bernstein was with
new music in this important first stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Shapero, who has been retired from Brandeis for 10 years, does
not discount the degree to which a certain lack of initiative may
have contributed to the neglect to his symphony and his other
works. ``I'm not good at pushing, or at cultivating people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Previn has been an invaluable champion. But it is time for
someone else of his stature to take up the fight. Maybe it will
happen, especially now that the contemporary-music scene has become
less fractious and more open-minded. And the historic and
electrifying Bernstein recording, again available, could make a big
difference.

BLONDIE PROVES (AGAIN) IT'S A GROUP, NOT A GIRL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you really want to know the whole odd story?''
asked the guitarist Chris Stein, peering skeptically across the
coffee table in a midtown hotel suite. He was explaining why
Blondie, the punk era's best-selling group and, later, one of its
many train wrecks, has regrouped after 16 years to record ``No
Exit,'' an album of new studio material.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged to tell all, Stein dived into an anecdote that was
typically Blondie: very New York, marked by surprising connections
and full of charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in TriBeCa, which is being horrifically gentrified,''
he began. ``My neighbor was getting kicked out of his loft. I was
trying to raise money for his legal fees, but I don't really have
any money. So I was going to sell a couple of my gold records. I
called up a rock-and-roll collector who turned out to be the
husband of Jackie LeFrak, the daughter of the housing developer.
And her sister was the girl `Denise' was written about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Denise,'' a hit for Randy and the Rainbows in 1963, is a
catchy throwaway written by the veteran songwriter Neil Levenson in
honor of the fair Miss LeFrak, whom he spotted at a Long Island
swimming pool. Thirteen years later, Blondie remade the song as the
gender-bent ``Denis,'' and it became an international hit.
</P>
<P>
   A blonde had conquered twice with ``Denise,'' first as muse and
then as singer. Stein, 49, felt lucky when the two blondes
converged again, and at the urging Denise LeFrak's brother-in-law,
he started organizing the band's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have to have humor in what we do,'' said Deborah
Harry, 53, whose lustrous voice and famous fondness for peroxide
gave her band its name. ``Everything is so totally absurd. You have
to start recognizing and cherishing the absurdities in life because
you can't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   All four original Blondie members _ Ms. Harry, Stein, the
keyboard player Jimmy Destri, 44, and the drummer Clem Burke, 43 _
had reason to listen to fate and consider a comeback. (The band
will perform on Tuesday at Town Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   Blondie's success had been the high point of their public lives.
At the turn of the 1980s, the group sold more than 40 million
copies of its six studio albums. Songs like ``Heart of Glass'' and
``Rapture'' broke ground by mixing rock with disco and rap, while
the modernized girl-group style Blondie also perfected became a
blueprint for other female-fronted bands. With her sweet-and-sour
voice and comic sex bomb persona, Ms. Harry was both an embodiment
and a parody of mass-marketed desire.
</P>
<P>
   But Blondie's wild ride ended badly, with the players at one
another's throats. Tax problems and legal wrangles with former
associates drained away much of the group's profits. (The lawsuits
keep coming: Frank Infante and Nigel Harrison, who played with
Blondie during the salad years, sued for $1 million when they were
ignored for the reunion. Their suit is still pending.)
</P>
<P>
   Stein endured a near-fatal skin disease; his long romance with
Ms. Harry ended after she nursed him through it. Destri briefly
became a contractor in Brooklyn to support his family.
</P>
<P>
   Burke flourished as a drummer for hire in Los Angeles, and Ms.
Harry continued a lower-key career, acting in independent films and
expanding her vocal style with the Manhattan-based Jazz Passengers.
But the temptation to rekindle Blondie was great enough for these
veteran rockers to take another chance on one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we talked about doing a compilation with a couple of
new songs,'' said Destri. ``Then I saw the Sex Pistols' comeback
tour and got really depressed. I didn't want it to be like that,
just rehashing the old material.''
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in the next day from his Los Angeles home, Burke said:
``We were all adamantly against that. We all agreed that if we were
really going to get back together, we would just become a band
again. It didn't feel like a business venture.''
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative nature of ``No Exit,'' which is apparent from
the evenly distributed writing credits, highlights the danger that
haunts Blondie even more than the risk of becoming desperate
denizens of the revival circuit. The group's great triumphs had
come at a cost: Ms. Harry's enormous attractiveness obscured not
only the talents of her bandmates, but her own. ``Blondie is a
group,'' one publicity campaign declared, but few seemed to believe
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really paid attention to Debbie's singing style and how
great a writer she was, because they couldn't get past the image,''
said Destri. The idol worship disenchanted the band; at times, Ms.
Harry must have felt a bit like Denise LeFrak, the object of
someone else's profitable fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I feel more in control of what I do,'' said Ms. Harry.
``What keeps me happy is focusing on the music. I lost that focus
at some point or another; all the attention pushed me away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harry's fans, and perhaps she herself, could not always see
that Blondie's charisma was not just a matter of her good looks.
``The Blondie character,'' as Ms. Harry always called it, embodied
female sexuality as part threat, part unattainable goal, part
parody.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harry turned the process of confronting her own appeal into
performance, and her bandmates made it into music. Together, they
created songs that captured exquisite longing, expressing the same
emotions their singer aroused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie put on that sexy persona with kind of a wink, saying,
`This is what you want from me, I'll kind of give it to you, but
I'm also going to give you what I want to give you,' '' said Cathay
Che, whose book about Ms. Harry, ``Platinum Blonde,'' will be
published in May. ``I think, just by virtue of her getting older,
and the fact that we know more about her because of her acting, we
see through that persona now.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By making music that examined desire, instead of simply
declaring it, Blondie invented a particularly mature form of
rock-and-roll. The group modernized the innocent expressions of the
girl groups and garage bands by investing them with greater
self-awareness. Each member added to the formula: Burke brought an
archivist's knowledge of classic rock; Destri's Farfisa organ
resurrected the street dreams of the Shangri-Las, and Stein, a
former art student and dedicated bohemian, connected these elements
to the Pop Art avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   Their music supported Ms. Harry's tricky artifice, apparent in
her voice as well as her style. Jumping from a murmur to a howl,
boiling over with emotion and then going icy cool, Ms. Harry played
with the range of cliches about emotional women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a weird stage in my early 20s when I was really
all bottled up,'' she explained. ``I found it very difficult to
sing. Little by little, I just kept working. I just listened to
everything; I would imitate all the singers. I found a way that
goes along with the style of Blondie's music. I developed a certain
tonality from working with the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Blondie, as Blondie, Ms. Harry becomes the voice her
bandmates hear in their heads, their muse talking back to them.
``It's almost like translation, like speaking another language,''
said Stein. ``I have to hear her singing in my brain.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it Debbie they hear, or is it ``Blondie''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Debbie-Blondie,'' said Destri. ``Like Batman-Bruce
Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maria,'' the single from ``No Exit'' that has already scaled
the charts in Europe, is a prime example of this superheroine-style
switch. A bouncy ode to infatuation written by Destri and roughed
up by the one-two punch of Stein's guitar and Burke's drums,
``Maria'' gains depth through Ms. Harry's singing, which mimics the
path of a crush from casual interest to swooning anticipation to
desperate insistence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have declared ``Maria'' to be ``pure Blondie,'' but its
creators protest against such categories. ``I don't think it sounds
like classic Blondie at all,'' said Destri. ``It's an unapologetic
attempt at writing a pop song. I don't think we're a pop band,
unless you take pop in the broader sense.''
</P>
<P>
   His bandmates pointed out the eclecticism evident on ``No
Exit,'' from the title track, a rap duet with Coolio, to the
ska-inflected ``Screaming Skin,'' the jazzy ``Boom Boom in the Zoom
Zoom Room'' and ``Night Wind Sent,'' which is almost an art song.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Blondie has never had an American hit with its
girl-group sound. The band's adventurous forays into disco and
hip-hop with ``Heart of Glass,'' ``Rapture'' and ``Call Me'' not
only gained it fame, but introduced those genres to new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Performing ``No Exit'' on the American Music Awards, Blondie was
joined not only by Coolio, but by members of the Wu-Tang Clan and
Mob Deep. ``We were surprised when some of the rappers said
`Rapture' was the first rap song they ever heard,'' said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   But those experiments also developed Blondie's perennial theme
of eroticism as a hunger that is both real and manufactured.
Blondie's music continues to revolve around such romantic
mysteries. ``No Exit'' even includes a version of ``Out in the
Streets,'' the Shangri-Las' ultimate expression of yearning, a love
letter from a gangster girl to her restless rebel boy.
</P>
<P>
   Blondie first recorded that song in 1974 when these four love
junkies were first discovering their mutual affection for both the
Velvet Underground and the Shangri-Las.
</P>
<P>
   The new recording's hip-hop beat reveals that Blondie the band
still knows what it takes to be modern. But Ms. Harry's haunted,
haunting voice captures what the band taught the world the first
time around: that love's elusiveness is an intriguing puzzle that
never resolves, and that pop is an ideal way to enter into it.

 Deborah Weisgall's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on
the biennial exhibition at the Portland Museum in Maine.  
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Until 1986, Abelardo Morell worked as a street
photographer. He stalked the quick shot, a fleeting conjunction of
action, form and light. But when his son, Brady, was born, he says,
``I started taking pictures from the point of view of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Morell stayed home and played, photographing what he
encountered: a playground slide, a paper bag, pots and pans
refracted through the lenses of a pair of eyeglasses. His notion of
time slowed, and he made exposures lasting for several minutes.
Like a child, he explored the world around him, but his abrupt
change of focus served as a means to reveal an interior world of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition ``Abelardo Morell and the Camera Eye,'' at the
Museum of Fine Arts through April 11, documents these
investigations with 70 images. It was organized by Diana Gaston,
curator at the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had wanted to do this show for several years,'' Ms. Gaston
said. ``Abe Morell is one of the most important photographers in
the country and has been in lots of group exhibitions, but he has
never had a one-person show.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years the show is to travel to eight
museums. In the spring, Morell's work will also be shown at the
Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, and last month, Dutton published an
edition of ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' illustrated with
Morell's photographs, which juxtapose Tenniel's original drawings
with real objects: playing cards, books and water.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was artist-in-residence at the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum here, and some of his witty views of the museum's
paintings hang in the current show.
</P>
<P>
   Although all this visibility seems sudden, Morell has been
emerging, like a slow exposure, for much of this decade. The Museum
of Modern Art first bought his work in 1991, and now he is
represented in the collections of more than 40 American museums,
including the Metropolitan, the Whitney and the Art Institute of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has accumulated enough work so that people really know
him,'' says Anne Havinga, assistant curator of prints, drawings and
photography at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. ``It's appropriate
to have a retrospective now. Abe takes pictures of the everyday
world, yet they're full of fantasy. With a straightforward
technique, he achieves special effects of magic and wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Success at the age of 50 perplexes him, Morell said in a recent
interview. His hair is turning gray, but his unlined face makes him
look young. ``Maybe it's my need to work hard, coupled with a sense
of urgency,'' he says. ``I had angioplasty last year and realized
I'm not a little boy any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   He chooses his words precisely and speaks with a barely
perceptible Cuban accent. Morell was born in Cuba in 1948; in 1962,
his parents fled to New York. His father found a job as
superintendent of an apartment building, where the family lived in
a basement unit.
</P>
<P>
   Morell learned English, he says, by reading Hemingway. At
Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, which he attended on a full
scholarship, he set out to study engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was failing physics, so I dropped it and took a
photography course,'' he said, smiling. ``That was much better.''
He pauses. ``From Cuba to New York to Maine. What a change: all
that gray light.'' He works only in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Some images _ ``Slide,'' for example, dating from 1988 _ are,
like Hemingway's sentences, deceptively simple. Below its top step,
where the embossed name of the manufacturer has been erased by
generations of children's feet and bottoms, the metal slide
shimmers like a waterfall spilling forever in dread and delight.
But an awareness of gravity, of how short the drop really is,
haunts the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   In Morell's work, the intersection of the playful mind and plain
facts seems almost a physical place, an image achieved by simple
means: light, length of exposure and sometimes the old magic trick
underlying the physics of photography. After he received a master's
degree from Yale, he joined the Bowdoin faculty; a year later he
became a professor of photography at the Massachusetts College of
Art in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For his students, he constructed a camera obscura, a device
invented over four centuries ago, literally a dark room, or box,
with only a pinhole. Light entering through the pinhole projects on
the inner walls of the box an inverted image of what lies outside
it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Morell decided to photograph those illusions. He
started at home, using his bedroom in Brookline. The photograph,
resulting from an eight-hour exposure, shows neighbors' houses
hanging upside down over the bed and shadowy leaves dappling the
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morell took his camera on the road. In a Times Square hotel
room, cars on Broadway streak along the ceiling, and signs
advertising musicals and credit cards blaze upside down and
backward on the walls. The spire of the Empire State Building
drapes like a silver robe across a quilt in a friend's midtown
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1997 vacation in Wyoming, Morell revealed outdoor
furniture and the Tetons hovering like ghostly stalactites in his
motel; the tip of the Grand Teton tickles a souvenir plastic elk
standing on a table. Translucent exteriors, hazy as memory, settle
over the rooms. The elk, bed posts, a coffee mug: long exposures
have burned these presences into the film, intensifying their stark
solidity. The space is both crowded and empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``These photographs show that even when you are alone in a room,
you are not alone,'' Morell says.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of place, the tension between affection and
detachment, informs Morell's work. He left his childhood home
behind at 14, and his early efforts reflected, he says, this lack
of connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an anonymous person looking at an anonymous situation.
But you can't be anonymous with your family. You can't give babies
baths without touching them.'' His photographs express this sense
of tender surprise, a pure astonishment at connection. ``Now, what
I'm feeling and what I'm seeing are one,'' Morell said. ``I've got
a lot of inventive energy now, but I won't have it forever.'' And
every photograph also records the short span of the conjuction of
eye and heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady Looking at His Shadow,'' from 1990, shows his son, in
silhouette, facing his shadow on a wall. The source of light is
low, in angle and in wattage; both the boy and his tall shadow are
blurred, both equally insubstantial. Brady could not keep still for
the long exposure. Only a child's chair against the wall emerges
clear and immutable, immune to time.

 Leslie Camhi's most recent article for the Arts and Leisure section
was about the French director Benoit Jacquot.  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the summer of 1997, in a poor district in southern
Tehran, the authorities learned that a 65-year-old man, together
with his blind wife, had kept his 12-year-old twin daughters locked
inside their house since birth.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers intervened; the girls, unwashed and barely
intelligible, were temporarily removed to a child welfare agency;
their parents were taken in for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Close by, in another neighborhood, an 18-year-old girl and her
father, a prominent filmmaker, watched these events unfolding on
the evening news and discussed it excitedly. Within days, the girl
had borrowed her father's movie camera and the film stock for his
next feature (a precious commodity, controlled by the government).
</P>
<P>
   With her father's help, and a minimal crew, she began shooting,
on location, the real-life characters in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apple,'' an astonishing directorial debut by Samira
Makhmalbaf, written and edited by her father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf,
won praise when it screened at the Cannes International Film
Festival last spring, but it also provoked a certain confusion.
``One critic asked: `What kind of country is Iran?' '' Ms.
Makhmalbaf recalled, speaking animatedly in a mixture of English
and Farsi. `` `Is it a place where 12-year-old girls are
incarcerated, or where 18-year-old girls make movies?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened in New York on Friday after screening in
the New York Film Festival last fall, is both a realistic
recreation of surreal events and a subtle allegory about the need
for liberty. It mixes simple, potent symbols _ a mirror, a watch,
an apple _ with surprisingly natural performances and cinematic
sophistication, yet its true charm stems from the extraordinary
gentleness and humor with which it surrounds the frail participants
in this social tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, though largely mute and physically impaired from
years of confinement, nevertheless illuminate the screen with their
awkward intelligence and palpable delight in freedom. Their
impoverished, elderly father quotes from an antiquated parenting
manual, describing girls as flowers, easily faded by the ``sun'' of
strange men's gazes; his wily, hard-headed simplicity, which
produced such calamitous consequences, is also touching and funny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film's most painful and haunting presence is the girls'
blind and severely disturbed mother, a spectral figure who prefers
to remain locked in her home, wrapped in her chador and continually
muttering curses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is useless to try to find someone to blame for her
condition,'' said Ms. Makhmalbaf, sitting in the Manhattan offices
of her distributor, New Yorker Films. ``Who is to tell whether it
was her husband's wish for her to be incarcerated, or her own? By
the time society intervenes, she has so radically internalized this
norm that even when the door is opened, she doesn't know what to
do. The veil has become her entire universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I noticed about those two girls is that, the more they
came into contact with society, the more complete they became as
human beings. For me that became a metaphor for all women. The
other women in the neighborhood all have bars in front of their
houses. They're all wearing chadors. They live in the same prison,
just a little better. It doesn't mean they are as free as men, to
have a role in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes I think that women in Iran are like a spring.
When you push them a lot, when they are under pressure, they are
closed. But if they want to be free, and if they try, they burst
out with a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Articulate and vivacious, aware of her youth yet utterly
self-assured, it's tempting to see Ms. Makhmalbaf as the embodiment
of a new generation. In fact, her precocious emergence as a
filmmaker coincided with the promise of social change in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997 Mohammad Khatami was elected president in a
landslide victory; he pledged openness, tolerance and concern for
the aspirations of young people and women. (Recent assassinations
of dissident intellectuals, though officially condemned by the
government, have dampened those hopes considerably.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important that Khatami talked about young
people,'' Ms. Makhmalbaf said, though she declares herself largely
uninterested in politics. ``For 19 years, nobody cared about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Makhmalbaf's startling cinematic vision is also the
product of a unique education and circumstances. Among Iran's New
Wave of filmmakers, Abbas Kiarostami may be the darling of Western
critics, but Mohsen Makhmalbaf (known in this country for
``Gabbeh'') is more widely admired at home. Ms. Makhmalbaf
practically grew up on sets where she watched her father direct
more than a dozen features.
</P>
<P>
   At age 15, Ms. Makhmalbaf informed her father and other family
members that she wanted to quit high school to devote herself to
cinema. ``It took some time to convince them,'' she said. ``That
was my first practice in directing.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to her requests for guidance, Makhmalbaf suggested
books and films; friends and other family members soon joined their
discussions. ``Gradually, our meetings became more systematized,
like lessons in a school,'' she said. ``We studied the history of
art, music, architecture, film, video, photography, literature and
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Ms. Makhmalbaf made two video shorts, a
documentary about styles of European painting and a fiction about a
frustrated young artist.
</P>
<P>
   Home schooling also sparked the cinematic ambitions of Ms.
Makhmalbaf's siblings. Her 19-year-old brother Messam, who worked
as a still photographer on ``The Apple,'' is interested in editing;
her little sister Hanna made her first short film at the age of 8.
(``The Day My Aunt Was Ill'' was selected to screen at the Locarno
Film Festival.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely parallels between the destitute family in ``The
Apple'' and this highly cultivated but incongruous household of
auteurs were not lost on the film's Iranian viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Makhmalbaf also kept his children at home,'' said Jamsheed
Akrami, an Iranian film critic who teaches at William Paterson
University in Wayne, N.J. ``Not as prisoners, of course. But his
logic was, I'm not happy with the educational system, I'm going to
educate them myself. Well, it struck me that the actions of the
father in the film were something like his. One act produced very
interesting results. The other resulted in a tragedy. But their
nature was not so different.''
</P>
<P>
   How closely did Mohsen Makhmalbaf orchestrate his daughter's
emergence as a director? Reached by fax in Tehran, Makhmalbaf did
not return repeated requests for comment on their collaborative
process.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its debt to her father's esthetic legacy, ``The Apple''
is guided by Samira Makhmalbaf's spirit of youth and independence.
Yet ``The Apple'' also builds upon the contradictions of a country
that since its Islamic revolution has supported a flourishing
professional class of women while enforcing their hijab, or ritual
veiling and seclusion; a country that has seen one of the world's
great contemporary cinemas flower amid strict government
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women directors in Iran have more chances than outside
Iran for professional advancement,'' asserted Malak Khazai, an art
director and director who divides her time between Paris and
Tehran. ``Discrimination comes not from the authorities but from
constraints placed upon them by personal relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Raksheen Bani-Etemad, the most prominent of the half-dozen women
directors currently working in Iran, agrees. Ms. Bani-Etemad's last
three films have centered on subjects of particular concern to
women, and she finds Iranian filmgoers increasingly interested in
these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month she presented her most recent work, ``The May
Lady,'' at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. Its heroine,
a divorced filmmaker, is researching a documentary on ``the
exemplary mother'' while her own maternal duties create conflict in
her private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things people wouldn't even talk about among
themselves,'' she said in Rotterdam. ``So when they're shown on
screen, they have a tremendous force.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian film censors require women's figures to be veiled; male
and female actors are prohibited from touching, and the use of
close-ups is discouraged. Paradoxically, by making naturalistic
depictions of romance difficult for directors to achieve, these
restrictions have contributed to the development of a cinema
uniquely engaged with social reality. With its focus on children
and socially dispossessed people, and its self-conscious mixing of
documentary and fiction styles, ``The Apple'' draws upon several
prevalent Iranian film genres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the experience we were having while shooting very
seriously,'' Ms. Makhmalbaf said when describing her method of
eliciting remarkably spontaneous performances from the film's cast
of nonprofessionals. ``I had only one camera, and very limited film
stock. So I couldn't ask the father to act in a fictive way, and
have 10 takes, and choose one of them. I had to recreate the real
conditions that would generate his dialogue and his hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being created, in effect, is a Third World, neither
real nor documentary; a conversation, a give-and-take, between my
imagination and their reality. I didn't take my camera and intrude
into the family's privacy. Instead, I generated an atmosphere of
trust, in which we made the film together, collectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Makhmalbaf laughed but acknowledged a reporter's suggestion
of yet another family parallel. Her father also made an early
public debut. When he was 17 and a fervent revolutionary, he
attacked one of the Shah's policemen, and spent five years in
prison for his crime. (The policeman survived and went on to become
an aspiring movie actor 20 years later. When he showed up for an
audition, Makhmalbaf decided to restage the attack in ``A Moment of
Innocence,'' a brilliant and poignant work of documentary/fiction.)
</P>
<P>
   The difference between these two gestures _ the father's act of
revolutionary violence, and his daughter's embrace of esthetic
freedom _ may also mark the distance Iran has traveled in a single
generation.

CHARLOTTE FEELS LAKERS' STING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Del Harris would have preferred a magic wand
to a gag order, but he couldn't make the distractions swirling
around his team disappear with a simple flick of his wrist. So the
Los Angeles Lakers coach ordered silence off the court, and hoped
for more noise on it, figuring it might get his wayward team back
in a winning groove.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' order _ no more chatter about trades or cross-dressing
power forwards _ was timely, considering the still-unresolved
Dennis Rodman situation and Tuesday night's opponent: the Charlotte
Hornets, who may yet ship injured forward Glen Rice to the Lakers
for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it's see no trade, speak no trade, hear no
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling my players that I would prefer they not give any
more answers to trade rumors or acquisition rumors,'' Harris said
before the Lakers ripped the Hornets 116-88 before 14,093 at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel it's healthy for the team when they're put in a
position where they feel like they have to talk about someone
else.... It'd be like asking the interviewer, `What would you like
in your next spouse?' We're a team, it's like a husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, still married to the Lakers, scored 19 points in three
quarters to lead team when they're put in a position where on 1
line 2506; jumphed hs42 2506-2 &QL; 
his current team past his potential new employer. Shaquille O'Neal
also sat out the fourth after scoring 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The 116 points was the Lakers' highest output this season, only
their second time over 100 points, and this was certainly their
most dominant game, though the Hornets _ sans Rice and Anthony
Mason _ were hardly an equal opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But after struggling to a 3-3 record through injury, illness and
uncertainty, the Lakers needed a game like this _ one in which they
could play their rookies for the final nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Rick Fox back from a respiratory infection (and scoring 20
points), the Lakers were nearly back to full strength Tuesday, with
one exception _ Robert Horry, sitting out two games as a
precautionary measure after experiencing an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent, healthy rotation, more than a trade or signing,
could be the Lakers' best hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been playing that well,'' said Horry, who could be
back in the starting lineup Friday night. ``We have flashes where
we play well together. We haven't really adjusted, we have
different guys in the starting lineup. We really haven't put a
product out there we can count on yet. Everything's up and down for
us. Hopefully now everything settles down and we can start playing
well as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a healthy roster won't end the possibility of dramatic
change, including the presumed signing of Rodman and the possible
trade with Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall having anything quite like this. Having a good
team and with so many potential changes,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Changes, he said, that are best left undiscussed unless and
until they happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be positive,'' Harris said. ``If it's not positive,
we should try to diminish it as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the components of the potential Hornets-Lakers swap put
on quite a tryout session. Charlotte's J.R. Reid scored 11 points
in the first nine minutes of the game, and B.J. Armstrong had 12
points by halftime, while Jones had his best first half of the
season with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell gave a less-impressive show to his potential future
employer, missing five of his first six shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a 62-50 halftime lead behind Jones, and 14
points each from Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. They shot 47
percent as a team in what was by far their highest-scoring half
this season.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember the scene in ``Jurassic Park'' when the T.
rex is chasing the car and the side mirror carries the warning
about reflected objects being closer than they look? Some designers
seem to be riding along oblivious to how close and how fast the new
millennium is approaching.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain why Marc Jacobs, one of the brightest and
most lauded American fashion stars, should troll the 1970s and
beyond for the fall 1999/winter 2000 collection he showed Monday
night?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the clothes didn't look great. There were cozy
hand-knit cashmere sweaters, graceful calf-length skirts worn with
glossy leather boots, well-cut coats, and capes with a military
air. But they represented a style that might have been worn a
generation ago by the mothers of the young fashion editors seated
at the show. Even the men's clothes, classy and classic styles like
cashmere sweat shirts, corduroy jeans and double-face cashmere
coats, looked familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, however, must get credit for showing more variety than
he has in some past seasons. Skirts were cut like aprons or had low
pleats or ruffles at the hem attached with cartridge pleats. Tops
with tucklike folds were worn over thin wool camisoles or cashmere
T-shirts. A wide stole was held closed with a large button. And
there were alternatives to trousers and jeans in the form of
cropped pants that Jacobs called breeches.
</P>
<P>
   The pretty cerulean blue of last season gave way to muted
heathery shades and earth tones, with deep purple and black velvet,
and metallic tulle for evening.
</P>
<P>
   And Jacobs can certainly not be faulted for concentrating on
knitwear, which has dominated fashion for the last year. Hand-knit
turtlenecks and chunky fishermen's knits have turned up on many
runways and are sure to make even more appearances before the fall
show season ends in Paris next month.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best knits seen so far were in the Tse New York show
designed by Hussein Chalayan. He called the collection the Bed and
presented it on a large square runway with a cube suspended from
the ceiling, like a fireplace in a modern winter cabin, with
simulated blazes crackling and the scent of a homey hearth
permeating the air.
</P>
<P>
   Big labels like those on blankets were prominently placed on
some skirts and dresses, and hems were sometimes finished with
blanket stitching, to stress the notion of warm clothes for a cold
winter. Fabrics were mainly cashmere, boiled wool or felted wool in
white, black or neutral grays and shades of brown from beige to
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Neat, simple shapes were made interesting with hand-knit cables
or novelty stitches, with tiny knot prints, with blocks of
contrasting fabric or color, or with connect-the-dot embroidery.
Mr. Chalayan also showed jackets and coats with modifications of
the asymmetric necklines and closures he featured in his signature
collection last season. This provocative, much-scrutinized designer
has succeeded in adapting some of his extreme notions for a more
commercial client, and giving the results a signature that sets Tse
New York apart from just another knit collection.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen DiGeronimo also concentrated on knits for fall, in a
collection that included similar styles for men and women. Both
sexes sported rugby-striped cashmeres in yellow and camel,
loose-fitting fishermen's knits, hooded pullovers with kangaroo
pockets, and pea coats. The collection wasn't one to break new
ground, but it was also nothing for the designer to be ashamed of.
It worked just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cowboy boots, gaucho pants and square-dance music at
the BCBG Max Azria show, the clothes were not gimmicky in the
least. Azria showed hand-knit sweaters (what else is new?), long
skirts and wide-leg pants of wool felt or mohair plaid, hooded
coats of shearling or mohair, and sheer evening dresses accented
with sparkling beads.
</P>
<P>
   There were apron dresses with cutouts in back, including one in
black leather, and jackets and coats with invisible closures and
unexpected touches like bright red shearling. From a purely
commercial line that in past seasons has adapted all the trends of
the moment, BCBG has developed into a line with character.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McFadden has always had a signature look that includes
embroidered and beaded tunic jackets, pleating and references to
exotic cultures that only someone as steeped in research as Ms.
McFadden herself could differentiate. But no matter. She has a
following that appreciates the timelessness of her designs, the
flattery of the colors and decorations, and the beauty of the
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she looked to ancient Mongolia, adapting 13th-century
block prints and 17th-century Buddhist paintings, opening her show
with a Mongolian wedding coat of white with an intricate design in
red and black, and ending it with a bride in a coat covered with
green and gold embroidery and topped with a towering gold hat.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta may be best known for extravagant evening
creations, but he keeps up with the times and the preferences of
his customers, who now range from the likes of the elegant Judy
Peabody to the young Aerin Lauder. So, in addition to satin ball
gowns that can be adorned with a woman's precious jewels, he also
provides beaded cashmere twin sets and turtlenecks with a row of
discreet beading at the hem, and satin anoraks and parkas. For day,
there are brushed wool coats and jackets, some in blousy shapes
with zippers, to team with camel wool pants and cashmere
turtlenecks. Some of the day clothes have couture touches like
crewel embroidery, which adds dimension and texture to tweed skirts
and cardigans.
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Westwood brought her Red Label collection to Seventh
Avenue for the first time on Tuesday, to celebrate the opening of
her New York boutique. The show was held in the Celeste Bartos
Forum at the Public Library on 42nd Street, which Ms. Westwood had
decked out with a stage set of a gray brick wall covered with
flowering vines. Models entered by ducking through a too-low Gothic
archway and descending a few steps to a red-carpeted runway.
</P>
<P>
   The iconoclastic designer has obviously decided she wants to
sell clothes seriously, so most of the styles were quite normal,
running to patterned knit dresses, plaid jackets, kilts and even a
ladylike gray princess-shaped coat. But the accouterments tended to
the outrageous, with models' faces painted blue or red, and with an
abundance of accessories like leg warmers, blankets worn as shawls,
scarves, hats, bags, gloves and oversize jewelry, with some
necklaces made of beads the size of Christmas ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   It was all good fun, and so was Betsey Johnson's show Monday
evening in a Mercedes-Benz warehouse in mid-Manhattan. The green
neon sign with the designer's name and the three cars on display
where the models came out were just background for a wacky show
that she called ``7 Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Her program notes defined them as spooky sisters ``with very
witchy lives.'' They included Morbida the oddity, who wore florals
and flounces; Infantina the baby, who wore baby doll dresses;
Lascivia the sybarite, in muslin and gauze, and Urchina the
wanderer, whose get-ups included sequined ski vests and corsets.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the action was on the runway, however. Before the show,
photographers were in a frenzy over Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Lou
Reed, Tia and Tamera Mowry of ``Sister, Sister,'' Debbie Harry,
Dylan McDermott of ``The Practice '' and Amanda Lepore, a
transsexual with flaming red hair and lips, who was totally nude
except for multiple strands of gold beads.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Scottie Pippen, goofing through a particularly entertaining run,
made a sleight-of-hand, three-card-monte fake for a layup. Matt
Bullard went up for an Air Jordan-logo dunk. Othella Harrington was
so unstoppable, the Suns gave him the Hakeem Olajuwon defensive
treatment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Rockets tried it in Tuesday night's second half at Compaq
Center, it worked. They laughed when Bullard went up for his
ridiculous dunk attempt. They were in awe of Pippen's mastery of
the open court. They were relieved by Harrington and Olajuwon's
combined excellence inside in the absence of Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets whipped the Suns in the second half to begin the
toughest part of their schedule with a 109-92 rout and even got
some rest for their regulars in their most complete performance of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had five players in double figures, made 51.9
percent of their shots, outrebounded the Suns by 10 and made up for
the absence of the injured Barkley with huge games from Olajuwon
and Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen dominated everywhere, coming within an assist of a
triple double. He finished with 19 points, 12 rebounds and nine
assists.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rockets (5-1) head off to the road portion of a stretch
that will have them playing five games in six days, there are just
two concerns that will come along for the ride. With Barkley and
Antoine Carr already out with injuries, the Rockets lost backup
center Stanley Roberts for two weeks with a strained right
hamstring. And when Phoenix hit an early wall, the Rockets had to
wonder if by the weekend they would end up looking as worn as the
Suns did Tuesday, when they played the second game of a
back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   But those things aside, the Rockets had a locker room full of
contributors and their first runaway win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great time tonight,'' Bullard said. ``I really love
our team this year. All the guys get along great, and we play well
together.''
</P>
<P>
   They had never played as well as in Tuesday's second half, when
they took a tied game and turned it into a chance to save strength
for games to come. And unlike previous wins when Barkley was forced
to carry them for key stretches, the Rockets had more scorers than
the Suns knew what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   That became most obvious when, filling the wing on a fast break,
Bullard found his path to the basket blocked and decided to leap
for a be-like-Mike dunk. ``I was flying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He never got to the rim, Chris Morris having come over to pull
him back down. Bullard got up to hit both free throws, then 16
seconds later took a fast-break pass from Pippen to nail a 26-foot
3-pointer for a 79-62 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard added a fourth-quarter 3 and finished with 14 points in
21 minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But his scoring, as well as Michael Dickerson's 18 points and
Cuttino Mobley's seven, was actually set up long before when the
Suns could not begin to stop Harrington and Olajuwon inside.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, starting for the three to four weeks of Barkley's
knee rehabilitation, made seven of 10 shots for a season-high 17
points and added a career-high 13 rebounds. He had been second in
the NBA in field-goal percentage before the game but had taken on
enough added responsibility for Barkley to tell him, ``Now, we'll
see what kind of a player you really are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my first couple of shots, and Rudy (Tomjanovich) kept
calling my plays,'' Harrington said. ``But I was surprised when
they finally decided to double-team me. When I hit Mike for an open
jumper, that felt so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had already given up on the plan to defend Olajuwon
with Luc Longley. And when Joe Kleine had even less success,
Olajuwon was on his way to 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting to go with
11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were then forced to double-team the post in every
half-court set. That left shooters open, and they and Pippen,
playing perhaps his most complete game of the season, blew the game
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably our best shooting team,'' Tomjanovich said.
``A lot of guys are just now getting their rhythm. We've got
Michael, Cuttino, Matt (Maloney), Brent (Price), Bull. Those things
just break the game wide open. I liked the way things were going
when they weren't doubling, because `O' (Harrington) was scoring at
a very high rate.''
</P>
<P>
   To all that, Pippen added a dominant second half in which he
practically toyed with the Suns. Pippen had 13 points, including
his full-speed fake to Dickerson to open the lane for a layup. He
added five assists and 11 rebounds in the second half, while
leading the Rockets' suddenly effective fast break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more comfortable offensively now,'' Pippen said.
``We are trying to focus on distributing the ball well on offense,
and we are doing a good job of passing out of the double team. I
never thought I would play with such a dominant center. This is
such a great team to play for.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was Tuesday. Tomjanovich was quick to point out
that his team had four days of rest while the Suns played in Denver
on Monday night. The Rockets will face a similar hardship the next
two nights, but they did provide themselves a particularly amusing
send-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great start for a real tough stretch in our
schedule,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Our defense carried us, and
everybody played really, really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning about this team. I had a real good feeling
after that game.''

CLIPPERS ROAR BACK BUT LOSE IN DOUBLE OT

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM &UR;  &LR; Calif. _ Still gagging on life as the NBA's only
winless team, the Los Angeles Clippers conspired to be rescued by
the Anaheim-lich maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   So before a lively 9,626 at The Pond on a Fat Tuesday that had
nothing to do with the presence of Clipper Rodney Rogers or Bryant
``Biggest'' Country Reeves of the Grizzlies, they coughed up a
double-overtime thriller with Vancouver before losing 93-89.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers rallied from an 11-point, fourth-quarter hole, lost
a 73-70 lead with 3:02 left to play, and were temporarily saved on
a 3-pointer by Lamond Murray with 18.5 seconds remaining in the
first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The end was compelling, but this one began as little more than a
Clippers' signature push for another draft lottery Ping-Pong ball.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Sam Mack combined for 13 Vancouver
points in the game's first 3:34. The Clippers' starters responded
by combining for zero. Their offense featured more standing around
than you'd see from a pack of junior high boys at their first
dance. They were murder in transition, too, going from bad to
worse.
</P>
<P>
   This rare level of ugly reached its zenith with 4:56 left in the
first quarter, when Abdur-Rahim's 18-foot jumper gave the Grizzlies
a 20-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Clipper coach Chris Ford refused to quit, and his team
eventually ratified the philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Maurice Taylor climbed aboard by deciding to save the
franchise from the threat of ticket-price refunds. Bulling his way
to the hoop and rebounding like somebody else, Taylor dragged his
team back into the advancing rout. As proof that Ford is capable of
having a near-depth experience, center Lorenzen Wright and point
guard Sherman Douglas arrived as reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers roared back with a 13-0 run of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ripped down his 12th rebound of the game, a career high
and season- best for the team, made an outlet pass to Douglas, and
the veteran playmaker fed Murray for a fast-break layup that tied
the score at 34 with 4:24 left before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie center Michael Olowokandi contributed a free throw at
1:21, and the Clippers had their first lead of the game at 37-36.
But in six games this season, any Clippers lead is as precious and
precarious as a loved one on life support. Grizzlies rookie Mike
Bibby promptly answered with a drive, and Vancouver held a 42-39
advantage after the first 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Wright finished the half with 13 points, Taylor had 9 and
Douglas pitched in with 7 points and 2 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim and Bibby greatly abetted the Clippers' cause by
spending large portions of the second quarter on the Grizzlies'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim was scoreless in the third period, but Bibby and
Reeves equally split a dozen points as the Grizzlies won the
quarter, 19-16, and took a 61-55 lead into the final stanza. Taylor
had five points and three more rebounds to keep the Clippers close.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas started the fourth quarter on the bench and remained
there, thanks to a strained left groin. Martin returned from a
lengthy ride on the pine, exposed Bibby as a defensive liability
and helped lead the Clippers back.

THE QUESTION IS, WHO'S ON THIRD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There is one word that will be associated
with the Anaheim Angels throughout spring training, which begins
today when pitchers and catchers report to camp in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The word is expectation, and the Angels have some high ones.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when a team spends $80 million on one free
agent _ first baseman Mo Vaughn, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Many pick the Angels to win the American League West, even
though they haven't won the division since 1986. The Angels, who
return all of their key players plus Vaughn and pitcher Tim
Belcher, nearly did it last year, battling the Texas Rangers to the
final week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vaughn will accept a leadership role, he is not a
one-man team. The Angels have a number of players just coming into
their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is eager to get started. Many players, including
Vaughn, have been in Arizona working out to get a jump start on
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   While things look good for the Angels, they aren't printing
playoff tickets just yet. There are areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   __ Starting rotation: Pitching is always an issue and this year
is no different. The Angels added Belcher, which should help,
considering his experience and durability.
</P>
<P>
   With Belcher joining Chuck Finley and Ken Hill in the rotation,
the Angels have three solid starters. However, Hill is coming off
elbow surgery and Finley is 36. Steve Sparks, Jarrod Washburn, Omar
Olivares, Mark Petkovsek and Scott Schoeneweis are competing for
the other two spots in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bullpen: The Angels lost Pep Harris, who blew out his elbow
in Winter League, and Mike James, who is coming off surgeries on
his elbow and shoulder. They have Rich DeLucia and Shigetoshi
Hasegawa to set up Troy Percival but are otherwise thin. Percival
is one of the game's best, saving a career-high 42 games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Third base: Don't insert Troy Glaus' name into the lineup
just yet. The Angels brought him up late last season, out of
necessity more than anything else. He held his own defensively but
hit just .218 and struck out 31 percent of the time in 48 games.
Last year was his first full season of professional ball and it
might not be far-fetched to think he'll spend some time in the
minors this year.
</P>
<P>
   So who plays third?
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hollins suffered through an injury-plagued 1998, playing in
only 101 games and hitting just .242. But at age 32, and with a
hard-working attitude, the Angels hope he can return to the form he
showed in 1997, when he hit .288 with 16 homers and 85 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The only other alternative would be to trade for a third
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   __ Second base: The Angels re-signed Randy Velarde, who almost
retired after a slow recovery from reconstructive elbow surgery.
But he returned late last season and hit .261 in 51 games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Angels' offseason goals was to get a speedy leadoff
hitter who could play second, but they were unable to land one.
They thought they might have one in Justin Baughman, but he broke
his leg in Winter League and isn't expected back until June.
</P>
<P>
   __ Outfield: Talent isn't the problem here. Unless the Angels
trade one, the plan is to rotate Tim Salmon, Jim Edmonds, Darin
Erstad and Garret Anderson through the DH spot.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds and Anderson, both the subjects of trade rumors during
the offseason, hit .307 and .294 last year, respectively, and might
yet be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also could be worked into the DH rotation because Erstad,
who is coming off his first All-Star season, can play first base.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how the players will accept it, although there
seem to be few ego problems. And it might be a good idea to give
Salmon some time in the DH spot, considering his offseason foot
surgery limited him to the spot most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Catcher: Todd Greene says he can catch now, that his shoulder
is almost 100 percent. But he won't catch every day, and the Angels
don't have anyone they feel comfortable with doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin, Matt Walbeck and Charlie O'Brien all put in time
behind the plate last season, but at least one of them won't be
around this year.

SIMPSON ITEMS ARE AUCTIONED FOR $382,075 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two years after the courtroom drama ended, the
O.J. Simpson case moved to the auction block on Tuesday as dozens
of Simpson's belongings, including his Heisman Trophy, were sold to
help pay the wrongful-death verdict against him.
</P>
<P>
   The auction brought $382,075 for the families of Simpson's
ex-wife wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman.
Simpson was acquitted of their 1994 slayings, but in 1997 he was
found liable for their deaths. Their estates were awarded $33.5
million. The sale on Tuesday night of about 70 items, including
sports trophies, jerseys and art work, will hardly put a dent in
the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's Heisman Trophy, which he won in 1968, brought
$230,000. The winning bidder was an East Coast collector who
entered his bid by telephone and asked the auction house,
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, to keep his identity confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Goldman, Gary Caris, said Simpson had been making
small payments on the verdict but, citing a confidentiality
agreement, declined to be specific. Caris said the Goldman family
would get about two-thirds of the auction's proceeds and the Brown
family would receive one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Bids on most items were well over maximum offers anticipated by
the auction house. A commemorative football given to Simpson when
he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985, for
example, which was expected to attract a bid of no more than $300,
was sold for $2,500, and two autographed jerseys from when Simpson
played with the University of Southern California and with the
Buffalo Bills, valued at a maximum of $900, went for $4,750.
</P>
<P>
   Ghoulish paradox seemed to drive the price up on many items,
including six golf bags embossed with Simpson's name, which sold
for as much as $2,250. On the night of the deaths, he brought golf
clubs with him on a plane flight.
</P>
<P>
   Two trophies other than the Heisman, a plaque Simpson got when
he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, which was sold for $10,000,
and a pair of jerseys were bought by a Denver group that runs a Web
site called Shadowgov.com. The group said it would destroy the
items at a Los Angeles courthouse on Wednesday. ``We're here to let
our criminal justice system know it is a complete failure,'' said
Bob Enyart, who said he was a leader of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson lives with his two children in Pacific Palisades and is
fighting with Mrs. Simpson's parents for their custody.

HOME LENDER EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE JOINT VENTURE WITH U.K. FIRM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., the nation's
largest independent home mortgage loan provider, will announce
today a joint venture with a British company to provide service
throughout continental Europe, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The move into the European market is further evidence of the
company's efforts to expand beyond its core mortgage business into
new products and services. The joint venture with London-based
Woolwich PLC will be the first international foray for Countrywide.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide, which is based in Calabasas but has major
operations in Simi Valley and Pasadena as well, employs
approximately 8,000 people. Countrywide generated $1.5 billion in
revenue during its more recent fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Woolwich is one of the United Kingdom's leading providers of
personal financial services and products. It has 400 branches in
England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, France and Italy and
more than 7,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under the joint venture expected to be announced early today,
Countrywide will provide fee-based services for Woolwich. Also, the
joint venture will market its services to other lenders throughout
the European Union, according to sources. Countrywide will
contribute systems and expertise to the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide and Woolwich are each expected to own half the joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   The European pact is the latest example of Countrywide's
aggressive expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, the company embarked on a high-profile,
aggressive campaign to offer a full range of insurance coverages --
homeowners, life, disability and auto -- even to consumers who
aren't Countrywide mortgage holders.
</P>
<P>
   The company isn't underwriting the policies, but is an agent for
major insurers including Aetna, Safeco and American International
Group Inc., the nation's largest publicly traded insurer. AIG is
the majority owner of Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance
Co., one of the West's largest auto and home insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance initiative was the company's first major effort at
reaching non-Countrywide loan customers, company officials said in
November.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ You may soon stop wondering why you didn't miss the
NBA. The Celtics and Kings made it hard Tuesday night not to pay
rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   In a truly entertaining game featuring two teams who like to run
and score, the Kings outlasted Rick Pitino's desperadoes, 101-98,
with Corliss Williamson's 3-point play with 7.5 seconds left
determining the outcome. That hoop and subsequent freebie snapped a
98-98 tie and sunk the Celtics in their first game of a four-game
road trip, which continues Wednesday night in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had a chance, sort of, to tie the game at the end.
But Antoine Walker, who struggled most of the game, rimmed out a
running trey. The Celtics continued their yin/yang season, losing
their third game in five. They've gone loss-win-loss-win-loss so
far, and with the Grizzlies on tap Wednesday night, well, you get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor-of-the-month Kings, meanwhile, who had lost a tough
overtime decision to Utah the night before, are now 3-3, including
2-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Boston got a big game from the returning Ron Mercer (24 points
in 43 minutes) and the now-obligatory 19 from rookie Paul Pierce,
who also had 7 rebounds, 5 steals, and 3 blocks, two of them
dunk-rejectors. Walker added 17, but was 7 for 21 from the field
and had 5 turnovers. He was in a funk for most of the game,
awakening in the third quarter, when he scored 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics got themselves in an early hole, even though they
had not played in six days and the Kings were coming off the tough
road loss in Utah. Boston fell behind by 9 early, trailed by 13 at
the half, by 15 early in the third, and by 3 entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who got big games from Williamson (22) and Chris
Webber (22 points, 15 rebounds, 3 blocks), hung on until 4 straight
Boston points gave the Celtics a 96-93 lead with 2:59 to play. The
Celtics then came up empty on five of their last six possessions
while Sacramento, with Williamson scoring 5, finished strong with
an 8-2 victory kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose this game would have been disastrous,'' said Kings
center Vlade Divac, who had 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists.
``I don't think I could have slept for five days if we had lost.
Especially after coming so close (in Utah).''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, big guy. After Boston took its 96-93 lead, the
Kings tied the game on a free throw by dynamo rookie Jason Williams
and a Williamson layup from Divac. Then old friend Jon Barry, who
is with his fourth team in the last four years, banked in a short
jumper after a Walker miss/turnover to give Sacramento the lead.
Kenny Anderson (12 points, 8 assists) quickly tied it, setting the
stage for the big play.
</P>
<P>
   After Webber was called for an offensive foul, Mercer missed, as
did a couple of Boston tips. (The Celtics were outrebounded,
50-43.) The Kings got the ball on the break and Barry hit a driving
Williamson, who tossed in a scoop. He was fouled by Walker, made
the shot, and the Kings then held on.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino pointed to Boston's poor shot selection (41.7 percent)
and lack of transition defense (epitomized by the Williamson
basket) as primary reasons for the loss. But he also said the
Celtics' flat play in the opening quarter was something from which
they did not recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was lost in the first quarter,'' Pitino said. ``We
didn't come out with the offensive or defensive fire that we should
have. We made some good plays, had some good looks, but we weren't
ready to play and that hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first quarter, the teams had combined for 13
points, with Sacramento shooting 3 for 12 and the Celtics 2 for 14.
Walker, who had some big games against Webber last year when Webber
was a Wizard, looked as if he had spent too much time in Old
Sacramento. Pierce made some nice defensive plays but couldn't find
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Pitino went to his bench that a 19-10 Sacramento
lead started to deteriorate. Two late hoops by Dana Barros got the
Celtics within 22-18 at the end of the quarter, even though Boston
shot 32 percent, was outrebounded, 17-11, and did not attempt a
free throw.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mercer, who hadn't played since the Feb. 5 opener, he
looked pretty crisp after a slow start. He ended up with 8 rebounds
to go along with his 24 points, although Pitino said he probably
played too many minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Mercer said. ``I needed to get a lot of minutes. I
just wasn't as explosive as I usually am, but I'm fine.''
</P>

JEWELRY GIANTS MERGER REJECTED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Jewelry maker OroAmerica Inc. was rebuffed
Tuesday in its attempt to acquire Michael Anthony Jewelers Inc.,
based in Mount Vernon, N.Y., in an all-cash transaction that would
have been worth more than $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   OroAmerica officials said early Tuesday that they had sent the
Michael Anthony board an unsolicited offer five days earlier to
purchase all the company's 6.86 million common shares at $6 each.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony's board unanimously rejected the offer Tuesday,
according to a written statement issued after U.S. stock markets
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials could not be reached for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   OroAmerica officials would not comment on the rejection.
</P>
<P>
   According to OroAmerica officials and analysts, however, the
company could have realized a host of cost savings and
substantially boosted its annual revenues if the acquisition had
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   OroAmerica stock closed up 25 cents at $9.75. Michael Anthony
closed at $4.8125, up $1.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony is the nation's second-largest jewelry maker,
just behind top-ranked OroAmerica, according to Bill Gibson, a
senior analyst with Crittendon Roth Inc. in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson expects OroAmerica to end its fiscal year with $180
million in revenues. Michael Anthony officials say that, when they
release their company's year-end results, they expect them to be
``substantially better'' than the previous year's $130 million in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time a merger of the two companies had
been proposed. About three years ago, Michael Anthony failed in its
bid to acquire OroAmerica, said Sheldon Grodsky, director of
research for Grodsky and Associates in South Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two companies danced together before and went home from
the dance alone,'' he said.

JAZZ REMAIN NBA CONSTANT UNDER SLOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since we last rested eyes upon the Jazz, back when the
NBA still had a shred of dignity, a number of things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The club's once-virtuous home state has suddenly become a hotbed
of inequity that may someday challenge the other sin capital of the
desert, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Olympics scheduled for Salt Lake City in 2002 has
brought with it more corruption than a Republican or Democratic
national convention. At one time or another, it seems like every
Utah resident has been accused of being either a geisha or a pool
boy for Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the Jazz heroes, Bryon Russell, had the unfortunate
experience of becoming part of the world's most widely distributed
poster _ the flailing victim of the final game-winning jumper of
Michael Jordan's career.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter that he was big part of a valiant Jazz effort
against the Chicago Bulls for two straight Finals. All that any kid
from Rome to Nome will remember is Russell falling and Jordan
lingering, making sure the humiliation was complete.
</P>
<P>
   And then some wise guy in the front office decided to change the
primary road uniform color to oh-so-trendy black, with some
side-panel splash of colors not found in nature. Aside from the
choices being a screaming fashion cliche, the attempt to make the
Jazz hip is like putting tail fins on a potato.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the more things change, as they like to say in the
valley of the Wasatch, the more they stay Jerry Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever tumult occurs in the NBA, around the Jazz, or the
surrounding environs, the Utah coach is as steadily relentless as a
dial tone. Some would say about as colorful, too. But entertainment
value in a coach can be overrated, as some University of Washington
football fans might be prone to saying these days.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach who has been twice denied the NBA pinnacle, thanks
largely to the bad timing of having Michael Jordan already at the
summit, Sloan would be entitled to feel a bit torqued over what
fate has dealt him. In the same position, ex-Sonic coach George
Karl would have offered up unending months of his tortured soul for
public display, so much so that more squeamish observers would feel
compelled to request that he put it away.
</P>
<P>
   But Sloan has a hard time even wondering what any fuss might be
about being twice denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't bother me,'' he said before Tuesday night's game.
``Oh, sometimes you think about a mistake here and there, where you
could have done something different. But I can't do anything about
it now. You coach, or you play, and you go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, it's really not important. Just basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Just basketball. Boy, wait until Commissioner David Stern hears
about this. Sloan will be staying after class for weeks, writing
thousands of times ``I love this game'' on the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sloan does love the game, as anyone who has played
with or against him (they're the ones with the broken noses), or
played under him will attest. He has an intense working
relationship with the game, not a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much around people who care about this,'' Sloan said.
``I go back to Southern Illinois (where he has a farm) every
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't bring it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach is part of why Sloan is the longest tenured coach
in the NBA by a wide margin, while his more neurotic rivals such as
Karl and Chicago's Phil Jackson require change. Sloan is the NBA
master at concerning himself with only those things he can
influence, and letting the rest go either to hell or the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example was over the summer, when the franchise
bulwark, Karl Malone, suddenly starting talking as if he spent July
going forehead-to-bumper with his semi-trailer truck. Malone's
chief looniness was his claim that he would never again play with
the Jazz, for reasons that are still not known even to NASA
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Malone recanted his statement, as well as numerous
others that drove many Jazz fans to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   What did Sloan think about all of this? Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his motive was,'' Sloan said. ``Karl always
says things in the summer that he wishes he hadn't said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I care about is whether he comes to play. And
he always comes to play. I have no gripe about anything else he
does. A lot of times the coach has it the other way around: He has
to deal with the player's problems with management. But Karl has
never brought it to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was tested again Tuesday night. While it looked like
almost the same team that has been coming to Seattle for what is a
decade-long rivalry, it's doubtful the Jazz have ever played worse
here.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat anticipated meeting between the winners of the
last three Western Conference championships, the two unbeatens
pulled a Clippers-Kings stagger-a-thon that was the NBA's worst
nightmare in a lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' 71-56 win was a scar across the heart of basketball
_ the fourth-lowest combined score in NBA history. Because it was
Utah's fourth game in six nights, including an overtime win the
night before against Sacramento, the Jazz missed 13 of its 17 shots
in the first quarter, and remained inert.
</P>
<P>
   True to Sloanian form, however, the Jazz, while embarrassed, was
neither distraught nor whiny, even though they were missing starter
Jeff Hornacek (funeral) and reserve Thurl Bailey (injury).
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, really?'' said Malone, when told of the four-games-in-six
business. ``I didn't know that. I promise you, I didn't know that.
Hey, it doesn't make a difference. I felt fine, and I prepare for
each game the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it sounds nice, playing that many games. You can say
that, if you want to. But we're not that kind of team. In sports,
you see that excuse used all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, nobody really cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's thoughts were the only clear moment in an otherwise
absurd evening.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was another one, also in the Jazz quarters, when an
irked Sloan addressed the fact that in the second half he benched
his all-stars, Malone and John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't playing very well,'' he said. ``My job is to win.
If that hurts their feelings, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it works for the steadiest franchise in sports. Check
your feelings, and your excuses, at the locker room door.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz play. Sloan coaches. They go home.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing.
</P>
<P>
   They come back.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch is Saturday in Salt Lake. Bring a lunch, Sonics. And
a snack. And a good dental plan.

SONICS HOLD JAZZ TO NEAR-RECORD LOW SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Sonics are the last undefeated team in the NBA,
and the Utah Jazz are squirming under their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sonics were hardly dominant in many aspects of
Tuesday night's game, this much has become abundantly clear: If all
else fails _ and just about everything did for both teams _ these
Sonics apparently will flatten you with defense.
</P>
<P>
   In trampling the Jazz 71-56 at KeyArena, the Sonics improved to
6-0 and handed Utah its first defeat of the season while holding
the Jazz to the second-lowest point total by any team in an NBA
regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the lowest point total ever by any team against
Sonics, who are off to their best start since the 1993-94 season.
That year, they won their first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't their night,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said
of the Jazz. ``But we won't give back the win. We're glad we got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton led all scorers with 17 points, 11 rebounds and
eight assists. The only other Sonic to score in double figures was
Dale Ellis, who added 11 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics shot just 40 percent from the field, but they held
Utah to 30-percent shooting. Karl Malone had 15 points and was the
only Jazz player to score in double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like we never played a basketball game together,''
Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ``They did a great job of taking us
out of our offense, which they've done before. Every time we would
try to figure out something to do, they had an answer for it. They
were all over us like a dirty shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were fortunate to catch a weakened Utah team. The
Jazz, coming off an overtime win against Sacramento on Monday
night, was playing its fourth game in six days.
</P>
<P>
   Utah also was without starting shooting guard Jeff Hornacek, who
was attending the funeral of a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, meanwhile, had two days' rest, and were fired up.
</P>
<P>
   They pounced on the Jazz in the first quarter, and never let up.
Although both teams shot poorly from the outside, the Sonics got to
the basket relatively easily. They led 19-12 after the first
quarter and went ahead 39-25 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give us all the credit,'' Westphal said.
``Utah was flat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics took the Jazz out of its patented pick-and-roll. The
most effective strategy was pressuring the ball at half court to
eat away at the shot clock. The Jazz operated with less than 10
seconds by the time it managed to run its offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team that uses excuses. They just won the game,''
Malone said. ``They throw a lot of different defenses at you. Even
though they have new coaches, they still throw good defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics never gave up an easy basket and finished with nine
block shots. Center Olden Polynice rejected three shots and grabbed
10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to give up anything easy,'' Polynice said.
``We're going to make everybody work for what they get. It starts
with me on down. I was pumped up for the game because I knew I had
to guard Karl.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice defended Malone most of the game, a move the Sonics
tried so that Vin Baker could expend more energy on offense. Baker
is still looking for a breakout game after finishing with six
points on 3-for-9 shooting and, for the second straight game, no
trips to the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, though, continues to carry the load. He scored seven
straight points during a run midway in the third quarter that put
the Sonics ahead 51-31 _ their biggest lead of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes plays, and he makes it tough for the other teams to
make plays,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Utah made a run at the Sonics and cut the deficit to 11 points
with 5:43 left in the game. But Payton responded with a layup and
fed Polynice for a score under the basket. The sequence eventually
put the Sonics ahead 67-51 with less than three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has led the Sonics in scoring in every game so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know we can play bad and still win,'' Ellis said.
``It was nice to see Gary come alive in that third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to take care of our home. We wanted to take
advantage of a weak schedule early, and now we've gotten off to a
good start to a tough week.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule presents plenty of challenges this week.
</P>
<P>
   After tonight's game against Sacramento, the Sonics play at Utah
on Saturday before returning home to face Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complaining about anything right now,'' Westphal said.
``Our balance is good.''

<P>
   Death is part of the landscape of Northern Ireland, the
British-ruled province where a fragile peace agreement has tempered
longstanding sectarian differences.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, and in Belfast in particular, a generation of
violence has claimed 3,600 lives since 1969. About 2 percent of
Northern Ireland's 1.6 million people have been killed _ which
statistically compares to 500,000 deaths in the United States,
nearly 10 times the number of American soldiers who died in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of fighting, the Good Friday peace agreement
signed last year has brought a halt to violence and has inspired
hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   In stories written by Paul Grondahl, the Albany Times Union
explores the death, the destruction and the promise of peace in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst News Service will move the following stories in the
International news (``i'') category for release Sunday, Feb. 21.
The accompanying photographs by Steve Jacobs are available through
the Wieck database.

   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-LANDSCAPE (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Death is deeply
embedded in the landscape of Northern Ireland and the psyche of its
people, as ever-present as pubs, grazing sheep and ocean views. And
nowhere better symbolizes the sectarian divide than Belfast, a city
split into Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods now made peaceful
by a fragile peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-BOMBING (Omagh, Northern Ireland) _ It killed 29 people
and wounded 400, many of them women and children. The bomb blast in
the peaceful town of Omagh last August was the deadliest single
episode of sectarian violence in 30 years in Northern Ireland. It
also was a terrifying watershed that spurred the peace process in
the British-ruled province.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-TITANIC (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ It isn't much to
look at nowadays, this forlorn patch of asphalt. But this is the
birthplace of the RMS Titanic, the mythic ship that became the
subject of a blockbuster movie. Now some of the workers here see
capitalizing on the movie as the only way to save what remains of
the shipyard and its crucial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-McALEESE (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Mary McAleese
returned to her old neighborhood as president of the Irish
Republic, north Belfast's most famous native daughter. Remembering
the pain of the past, she sees the promise of peace in
British-ruled Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-AID (Colonie, N.Y.) _ Paul and Jean Murray live in a
plain ranch house in a plain suburban subdivision. They are members
of the Shaker Ridge Country Club, but they also were leaders

Ireland. ``We were known as the terrorists at the club,'' Paul
Murray recalls of his days as head of Irish Northern Aid.

DEATH HAUNTS THE UNEASY PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Death is deeply embedded in the
landscape of Northern Ireland and the psyche of its people, as
ever-present as pubs, grazing sheep and ocean views.
</P>
<P>
   Gravedigger David McDonnell, up to his armpits, shoveled sopping
mounds of soil as fast as he could, each thrust making slurping
sounds as water quickly seeped into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical Irish weather,'' McDonnell said with a grunt on this
gray and raw November morning. Howling winds drove sheets of cold
rain across the crumbling, working-class Catholic Milltown
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't bury ya here in Ireland,'' McDonnell said. ``They
drown ya.''
</P>
<P>
   The fabled hunger striker Bobby Sands is buried here. So are
nine of his Irish Republican Army compatriots. They starved
themselves to death in 1981 in the notorious Maze Prison _ known
locally as Long Kesh _ for the right to call themselves political
prisoners and to wear their street clothes instead of prison
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Milltown is the final resting place for the most hardcore of
IRA families, for whom death through armed struggle is preferable
to living under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of violence and retaliatory killings in the early
1970s, soldiers filled a British Army post at the entrance to the
cemetery. Today, the post remains lightly staffed but on alert,
ringed by concertina wire and bristling with surveillance cameras
and high-tech listening devices.
</P>
<P>
   Across Northern Ireland, and Belfast in particular, a generation
of sectarian violence has claimed 3,600 lives since 1969. About 2
percent of Northern Ireland's 1.6 million people have been killed,
which statistically compares to 500,000 deaths in the United
States, or nearly 10 times the number of American soldiers who died
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of fighting, the Good Friday peace agreement
signed last April has brought a fragile cessation of violence and
hope for the future, despite sporadic outbursts. In August, the
deadliest episode of the sectarian violence _ known here as ``the
Troubles'' _ took place when a car bomb planted by an IRA splinter
group killed 29 and wounded 400 in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   In this austere landscape of death and myth, history often has a
stronger pull than the present. People know the undertow of past
hatreds could pull the province into a vortex of violence once
again.
</P>
<P>
   The militants are increasingly relegated to the margins of
Northern Ireland society. Today, in Belfast _ a city of 500,000
where Protestants are soon to be at equal numbers with Catholics _
there are prosperous communities from downtown to Queens University
and in the suburbs ringing the city core. The fight has gone out of
those middle-of-the-road masses who see a better future, a chance
at a good education and a decent career.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to continue to live by the gun and the bomb as a
way of making political change are growing more isolated, their
paramilitary groups ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand
members. They are confined mostly to a patchwork of urban ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those neighborhoods of Belfast _ a 10-block Catholic
district known as New Lodge, a center of IRA activity _
battle-scarred red brick walls separating welfare tenements from
streets are pocked with bullet holes. Firebombed rowhouses here
were never rebuilt, leaving rubble-strewn vacant lots like so many
missing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1969, 62 residents of New Lodge have died. Many were
civilians, simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   The Shankill, the Loyalist Protestant district that abuts the
New Lodge, has known its share of death, about three dozen
residents since 1969. Those who live in the Shankill bury their
relatives and loved ones right across Falls Road from the Milltown,
in the Protestant City Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   J. Bowyer Bell, who has studied political turmoil around the
world, concluded that Northern Ireland was unlike any traditional
battle zone because the violence was sporadic and chaotic without a
recognized front and no rules of engagement. It was gang versus
gang in a style of urban guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, so sadly, even the decent have rarely accomplished much
good and have at times contributed to the turmoil,'' Bell concluded
in his monumental 872-page history ``The Irish Troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more scared stationed in the farmland of south Armagh (a
county of Northern Ireland) than the time I served in the Gulf
War,'' said Lee Lavis, 27, a former British Army soldier who now
lives in Belfast and works as a department store security guard.
``In the Gulf, we attacked trenches and we knew where the enemy was
coming from. In Northern Ireland, an attack can come from anywhere,
anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavis lives in a Loyalist Protestant district he wouldn't name
for fear his past would be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stuck in the middle trying to keep peace and neither
side liked the British Army,'' Lavis said. ``It's a frustrating,
Catch-22 situation. I just go day to day now, watching where I go,
what I say. You live in Belfast, you learn to keep your mouth
shut.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those killed during the Troubles were
civilians. They had no allegiance to the stew of acronyms of
Loyalist and Republican paramilitary groups who painted murals and
slogans and graffiti across Belfast celebrating their desire to
destroy one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a scorecard to keep track of all the groups,'' said
George Mitchell, the former senator from Maine who spent three
years brokering the historic Good Friday accord.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loyalist Protestants and Republican Catholics live tightly
packed, separated by corrugated iron and concrete ``peace walls''
that keep opposing sides apart.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Dean, a 14-year-old from the Shankill, a Loyalist
Protestant district, lives along the peace walls in a brick
rowhouse and has no contact with Catholic youths, save for furtive
whispers after dark through heavy-duty swinging entryways known as
``peace gates'' that are locked at 9:30 p.m. and reopened at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid to come over to our side, but the ones I've
talked to at the gate seem all right,'' said Dean, whose dream is
to become an archaeologist and live in Washington, D.C. But her
neighborhood is mired in poverty and higher education is not a
common path. Recruitment by paramilitaries, teen pregnancy, a life
of unemployment and welfare: those are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   More common than the conversations that might reconcile the
warring sides are the epithets, stones and the occasional Molotov
cocktail hurled over the peace walls _ violence akin to a child's
low-grade fever. Dean's friends have never met their enemy
face-to-face, cannot see who they are battling, and yet the
conflict continues as if on auto-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Winstone is a celebrated former Loyalist paramilitary leader
who spent 17 years in Long Kesh prison for killing an IRA member in
1974. He's now involved in efforts to prevent violence between the
paramilitary groups. He may be a peacemaker, but he still hasn't
made peace with his former enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a class struggle, an economic fight, and I
don't regret what I've done,'' Winstone said. ``For me, I chose to
be a Loyalist because I'm British, I have a right to remain here
and I won't be run off by the IRA. They killed three dozen people
with a dozen bombs on the Shankill Road but didn't scare us off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans mostly just hear one side, that old downtrodden
Catholic story,'' Winstone said. ``They're professional victims.
They're good at making excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA slogans and tri-color Irish flags of Catholic New Lodge
give way just across a street to the Loyalist graffiti and British
Union Jacks of Protestant Shankill. Otherwise, neighborhoods are
the same depressing brick slums, and the future promises continued
high unemployment, chronic poverty and a cycle of welfare
pathologies _ peace accord or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a kind of madness, isn't it?'' said the Rev. Des
Wilson, 73, a Catholic priest in west Belfast who has gone to the
United States numerous times to raise funds for his Springhill
Community House programs for job training and continuing education.
Unemployment in his district fluctuates between 40 and 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The easy shorthand of Catholics versus Protestants is not what
The Troubles are all about, according to Wilson, a
cleric-without-parish censured by the Roman Catholic Church for his
outspoken criticism of its hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an economic struggle, not a religious one,'' Wilson said.
``The Protestant ghettos have the same problems as the Catholic
ones. It's unemployment and poverty and a lack of hope they're
fighting against. The British government and the Church on both
sides are the problem. Ireland has a brutal and bloody past, but
the people will not give up to make a better future for their
children.''

OMAGH BOMBING: A TRAGIC WATERSHED IN PEACE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL

<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ The bandages are gone, and her eyes
are painful to look at. The bridge of her nose is scarred, and the
eyes themselves are watery and bloody and adrift.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb that stole 15-year-old Claire Gallagher's sight also
drained the color from her eyes. Operations to repair her vision
haven't worked. ``I'm hoping with technology, maybe they'll be able
to do something for me in 30 years or so,'' she said quietly,
fidgeting with her brown-and-yellow school uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Omagh is a sleepy town of 20,000, largely apolitical, and
well-mixed with Protestants and Catholics who coexist relatively
peacefully 60 miles west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   It has a postcard quaintness to it, with church steeples on a
hillside overlooking the placid Strule River. It was along this
river, at the foot of Market Street, a two-block commercial
corridor, that a car bomb parked across from the Cozy Corner Pub
and a row of shops ripped into the heart of the town, and of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   When the bomb _ planted by a splinter group of the Irish
Republican Army called the Real IRA _ exploded on Aug. 15, it
killed 29 people and wounded 400, among them Claire Gallagher. It
was the deadliest single episode of the sectarian violence that has
claimed 3,600 lives in 30 years in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a terrifying watershed that spurred all the parties
in the simmering political war to renew their commitment to the
Good Friday peace accord, signed just four months before the bomb
blast in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people do not want to go back to the bitterness and the
violence of the past'' as a result of Omagh, Northern Ireland peace
broker George Mitchell said at an Oct. 20 speech at the College of
Saint Rose in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He movingly described Gallagher in that speech as a ``tall,
gangly and lovely'' girl who ``poignantly trying to be courageous,
spoke of peace.'' Mitchell, the former U.S. senator from Maine, and
President Clinton had met her during a visit to comfort the victims
of the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Omagh, it is difficult to find someone who hadn't been
touched by the bombing. The bomb exploded at mid-afternoon on a
Saturday. The shops were packed with mothers and daughters doing
their last back-to-school shopping, buying backpacks and skirts and
colored pencils.
</P>
<P>
   Claire was shopping with two girlfriends from school. At
5-feet-9-inches, she stood a head taller than her friends. ``They
managed to escape without injury, but Claire was struck in the eyes
from the side with shrapnel that whizzed right over the heads of
her friends,'' said Colm O'Neill, principal of the Loreto Grammar
School, a Catholic school for girls. ``Her friends are dealing with
a lot of survivor guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill had one student killed and 11 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just devastated this school as it did everything else in
town,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Claire's parents, Marie and Seamus Gallagher, were flown by
helicopter with their daughter to a hospital in Belfast for
emergency eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time we'd flown, and I don't remember
anything about it,'' Marie Gallagher said. ``From that moment, life
changed completely and nothing has been the same since.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Omagh landscape was altered irrevocably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our loss was so deep and indiscriminate, women and children
and people from all sides were killed,'' said Paddy Cullen, editor
of Omagh's weekly newspaper, the Ulster Herald. ``Analysts
speculated at first that this bomb would split this community and
derail the peace process. The people of Omagh vowed that would not
happen. If anything, it has brought us all closer together and
we're more determined than ever that we will not go back to the
violence of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Claire Gallagher is getting around school with the help
of an aide and looking to the future by learning Braille and how to
operate a voice-activated computer. She continues to do the things
she likes best, singing soprano in the school choir and playing
piano, going to discos and the movies with friends, studying Gaelic
as a way of deepening her Irish cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important than ever that we have peace in Ireland,''
Gallagher said. ``Hopefully, what happened in Omagh will make
people stop and think and it will bring us around to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of five children, Gallagher hopes to earn a college
degree in music, with a dream of returning to teach music at Loreto
Grammar School.
</P>
<P>
   R. Mark Sullivan, president of The College of Saint Rose, has
offered Claire a four-year scholarship in music as a contribution
to the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally overwhelming,'' Gallagher's mother said.
``It's the ultimate opportunity. Claire has always had in her mind
she wants to go to New York. She's never been to the States. Here I
was trying to get used to the idea of her going to Belfast and now
she may be going off to America. It's fabulous.''

   On a clear, crisp November day, Omagh's Strule River glinted in
the noontime sun. The idyllic scene was interrupted by the rumble
of two backhoes that removed the twisted rubble that had been the
pub and shops on Market Street destroyed by the August bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the evil and misery of the Omagh bombing, something
positive and good can come,'' somebody wrote on a sign outside the
fenced-in demolition site.
</P>
<P>
   But the hole in the heart of Omagh at the bottom of Market
Street won't soon be healed. ``Someone described the bomb site as
an open grave,'' said Cullen, the newspaper editor. ``It's a scar
that will always remind us of what happened, even as we try to move
on.''

BIRTHPLACE OF RMS TITANIC SINKS INTO DESPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ It isn't much to look at nowadays,
this weedy and forlorn patch of asphalt with a scattering of rusted
steel beams and a view of the Belfast skyline across a muddy river.
</P>
<P>
   That's all that remains of the sloped slip at the Harland &AMP;
Wolff shipyard where the mythic RMS Titanic was launched into the
placid confluence of the River Lagan and Belfast Lough on May 31,
1911.
</P>
<P>
   At 882 feet, 8 inches long; 92 feet, 6 inches wide; and 46,329
tons of iron stacked across eight decks, the luxurious White Star
liner was the largest and most extravagantly appointed ship ever
built _ a powerful symbol of British maritime might.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Maxwell, a plumber and 25-year veteran of the shipyard,
whose grandfather worked as a riveter on Titanic, walked up the few
yards of crumbling concrete incline that remain of the 1911 slip.
He scoffed at the busloads of gullible American tourists who drive
by each day, straining to touch history beyond the shipyard's metal
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fella down the road was selling chunks of rock to the
American tourists, telling them they were pieces of the Titanic
slip,'' Maxwell said. ``Ever since that movie, it's been crazy
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   That movie would be director James Cameron's Oscar-winning epic
of the doomed liner starring Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet,
which became the highest-grossing movie in America at more than
$600 million. Cameron's ``Titanic'' grew into an international
blockbuster with $2 billion in sales worldwide and achieved that
rare pop culture phenomenon, global mania.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's review of the movie: ``A love story with a boat. It
was a big disappointment that Belfast and our shipyard never got a
mention.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's buddy, Bobby Moore, a pipefitter and a 25-year veteran
of the shipyard, was not thrilled with the film version either.
``Ach, just a piece of fluff. At least the ending wasn't spoiled.
You knew she was going to sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell interjected, ``Aye, but that had nothing to do with the
ship we built here. She was well-made. It was a freak of nature
that sunk her.''
</P>
<P>
   On its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, shortly
before midnight on April 14, 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg
off the banks of Newfoundland. Two hours and 40 minutes after
impact, the ship sank to the bottom and more than 1,500 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Titanic is our claim to fame, and it ended badly,'' Moore
said. ``That's what we're known for, the only ship we built that
sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are large, beefy fellows who wear oil-stained denim
coveralls and feed wide pessimistic streaks. It's a natural
response after working through the long decline of what was once
one of the world's largest and most prosperous shipyards.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday of the late-1950s, Harland &AMP; Wolff employed 33,000
people who churned out luxury liners, cargo ships, British naval
ships, oil tankers and ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Today, just 1,400 workers remain and the shipyard hasn't
actually built a ship in three years. Cheap steel in Korea,
low-paid workers in Asia and subsidies for German shipmakers have
sucked the work out of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting a fair kick at the ball,'' Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast dry dock, bracketed by two massive 800-ton cranes
visible all over the city, is a shadow of its former self. Unlike
in the time of Titanic, when ships were built on braces and rolled
into the water, vessels are completed in this cement dry dock
chamber, which is flooded and the finished product is floated out
into the river.
</P>
<P>
   The dry dock on this day contained a mammoth offshore oil rig in
for refurbishing and a boxy drilling ship being built.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, repair and construction of oil rig
platforms have been the primary market for Harland &AMP; Wolff. Once
the dominant builder of oil supertankers, the company hasn't
received a contract to build one of those in many years.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the shipyard seemed grim. Workers sounded resigned
to further shrinkage of markets and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Northern Ireland's tight economy, these are
sought-after jobs with long waiting lists. Many are second- and
third-generation Harland &AMP; Wolff workers. Although it has gradually
become integrated in recent decades, Harland &AMP; Wolff was long known
as Protestant domain: Catholics need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite automation and computerized assembly lines, it remains
heavy labor with hard-earned wages. Maxwell and Moore, approaching
retirement, have topped out on the salary scale at about $575 a
week gross pay. ``At the end of the day, computers don't build
ships,'' Moore said. ``Men do.''
</P>
<P>
   But with their obsolescence looming over them as surely as the
massive cranes, Maxwell and Moore have a notion that might rescue
the sinking shipyard: Tap into Titanic fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're famous for and they're not exploiting it at
all,'' Maxwell said. There are no signs, no archives, no displays
of Titanic memorabilia at the shipyard. And, the most grievous
oversight of all in Maxwell's mind, no Titanic souvenirs for sale.
</P>

<P>
   The only thing tourists can buy at the shipyard is a
black-and-white poster of the launch. Post-movie demand drove the
poster price up from $7.50 to $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   But think of the possibilities, Maxwell mused. Instead of giving
the busloads of tourists the brushoff and treating them like
intruders on private property as they are now, why not turn acres
of derelict buildings and land into a Titanic theme park?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a lot of talk so far,'' Moore said. ``Some developers
have mentioned building a museum, creating a replica of Titanic on
the old slip as a hotel and restaurant and making the shipyard a
tourist attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men looked at each other, hitched up their coveralls and
shrugged in unison.``Same old story,'' Moore said.``No money to do
it,'' Maxwell added.

NATIVE DAUGHTER FINDS HOPE IN DIVIVED CITY

 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ She was just Mary McAleese then,
growing up in the 1960s in the violent and segregated New Lodge
district, a poor and forlorn patch of hardscrabble north Belfast
where sectarian violence exacted a terrible cost in death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese, a Catholic, experienced the violence in many
terrifying ways: the bombing of her father's pub, the severe
beating of her deaf brother by a Loyalist gang, the murders of two
close friends on her wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment and intimidation from Loyalist Protestant gangs
grew so frightening, her family fled its north Belfast home to a
quiet, predominantly Catholic village south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese returned to her old neighborhood Nov. 17 as president
of the Irish Republic, north Belfast's most famous native daughter.
In a speech, she remembered the pain of the past, but carried a
message of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this place well and I know it is a place that has
suffered just extraordinary levels of pain, levels of pain that are
almost unimaginable unless you have lived right inside them,''
McAleese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are so fortunate that we have the fair wind behind us
of the Good Friday agreement and the referendum of the north and
south, which said that there was a huge yes-ness in the hearts of
all our people. It really is up to us now to unpack all that
yes-ness and to put it at the service of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   McAleese, whose role as president is largely ceremonial with
very little political power attached, spoke at the launch of the
New Start Millennium Awards. During the next three years, about 100
awards averaging $6,000 each will be given out across Northern
Ireland for training, education and community support in New Lodge
and the other hardest-hit communities of north Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   The money is being provided by corporations as well as the
British government, which controls Northern Ireland, and the Irish
government. The cooperation is a result of the peace agreement
reached last year on Good Friday between the region's factions.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese said she was particularly interested in seeing the
money go toward parenting courses for teen parents, to fund
literacy mentoring, to create conflict resolution alternatives and
to bolster programs between children and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese spoke at the Ashton Community Hall, where in contrast
to the dark and menacing murals of the neighborhood streets,
student artwork on the walls depicted a place of clean parks, safe
playgrounds, rainbows and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take such pride and joy representing Ireland abroad and
being able to tell the many, many Irish and friends of Ireland all
over the world about this new, smart, self-confident Ireland so
deeply in its stride, so culturally confident, so economically
confident,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McAleese described an ongoing legacy of violence in north
Belfast stretching from her youth to the Oct. 31 murder of Brian
Service, a Catholic man shot by a Protestant Loyalist death squad
as he was walking home.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us can do anything about the past, unfortunately,''
McAleese said. ``We could apologize for it and receive apologies
for it, but we can't undo it. The best we can do is to use this
moment that we have to make something better out of today and build
something much better for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   McAleese described the grim reminders of the remaining ``peace
walls'' and how they separate Protestant from Catholic in Belfast.
She said she prays that one day such walls will be torn down,
replaced by a community of sharing across the sectarian divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the day when the landscape of this place and
the landscape of the heart and the political landscape will be
transformed and we will have here again a place of happy children
running around without the awful burden of hatred and violence that
has hung over this place for so long. Please God, those days will
soon be over.''

COUNTRY CLUB COUPLE EARNED REPUTATION FOR AIDING IRA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ He lives in a plain ranch house in a plain
suburban subdivision. He has a round, soft face, with wisps of
thinning hair slicked straight back above wire-rimmed spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Paul Murray says insurance man, which is what
he is. Nothing says terrorist, which is what he has been accused of
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was investigated and harassed at home. I lost a lot of
business and many friends over the years,'' he said. ``It
ultimately cost me my health. But I don't have a single regret. I
played my part for the Republican cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 59, a native of the Albany suburb of Colonie, was the
first and only American national director of Irish Northern Aid
(NORAID). He held that position for five years beginning in 1989 _
traveling to New York City weekly, making weekend trips around the
United States and extended visits abroad _ until vertigo and other
stress-related symptoms compelled him to resign. Murray handed over
leadership of the NORAID group to his wife, Jean, who has since
passed it on to Paul's brother, Dave Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was not to the militancy born.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Colonie, Murray's only memory of feeling connected
to Ireland was marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade. Paul
graduated from Colonie Central High School and Hudson Valley
Community College. He and his wife later joined Shaker Ridge
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were known as the terrorists at the club,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The snide whispers did not dissuade the couple.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's family believed armed struggle was the only way to
force the British and its imperial government out of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, my cousins wouldn't talk to my grandmother and aunt
because of their pro-IRA position,'' Jean Murray said, referring to
the militant Irish Republican Army that has fought British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Murray opened an Irish pub, The Sand Creek Inn, in Colonie
in 1974 and talk around the bar often turned to the political
troubles in Northern Ireland. It wasn't hard to determine which
side Murray was on.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he always operated on this philosophy: ``Deep inside
every Irish man and woman is a vein of Republicanism, but they're
afraid to let it out until they perceive it is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day in 1976, Murray made a chance encounter
with a north Belfast man at the Starry Plough, a defunct Irish pub
in another upstate New York town, Rensselaer. It changed his life
and steered him into his involvement in the Republican cause of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Belfast man was Geordie Pierce, the only one of 10 siblings
in his family to escape Belfast, who would become another pillar of
the Irish aid community in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became like a brother to me,'' Pierce said, noting Murray
helped him make contacts and assisted him in getting a job.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades the two men have tried to meet every Saturday
morning at Murray's Colonie house to discuss Northern Ireland
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Belfast was a war zone in 1980 when the Murrays first visited
the Northern Ireland city as guests of the Pierce family. The
couple witnessed firsthand the IRA and the British Army in violent,
explosive clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Murrays returned every year between 1980 and 1996. In August
1992, during a Catholic party, the Murrays recalled seeing officers
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, unprovoked, firing plastic
bullets into the crowd. The hard rubber projectiles hit the chins
and elbows of children playing at the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frightening environment for an American,'' Paul
Murray said. ``But our fear turned to outrage and we decided we'd
do our part in the struggle, no matter how unpopular it was here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Murrays didn't heed criticism for inviting convicted IRA
leader Brendan Hughes to their house after his release from prison.
Hughes stayed with the Murrays twice in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was one of the beneficiaries of the Murrays' fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money goes to prisoners' families and not for guns.
Period,'' Murray said. ``We've been investigated over and over
again by many different agencies. We've never been charged with
anything. The British government uses the accusation that we run
guns as a red herring. It's not true.''

COWBOYS TO GIVE RAISES TO AIKMAN, SANDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If it seems that the Cowboys have been
spectators since the free-agent signing period began Friday, it's
because they have been.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the early movement has been to sign high-profile and
high-dollar free agents, said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. He said
such moves aren'tnecessary for the Cowboys to achieve their
off-season goals, which in free agency are to find a speed
receiver, a center and a strong-side linebacker at reasonable
prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, that doesn't mean Jones won't be reaching deep into his
pockets, as new contracts are planned for quarterback Troy Aikman
and cornerback Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate doing something with Aikman and Deion this
year,'' Jones said. ``I'm not talking about restructuring for
salary-cap reasons. I'm talking about new negotiations. I think it
will likely happen this off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones declined to get into dollar amounts, but both contracts
could approach $8 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, whose current contract averages $5.8 million a year, has
three years left on his deal, which pays him $8.5 million in 1999,
$9.3 million in 2000 and $8.8 million in 2001. Sanders, who will
make $8.2 million in 1999, has three years remaining on his
contract; however he will reach incentives that will void the final
two years of the contract. His original deal averages $5 million
per year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has already said that he wants a new deal before the
start of next season. Aikman and his agent, Leigh Steinberg, agree
that it's probably time for them to revisit his contract as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is looking for a deal that will take him to the end of
his career, while also bringing him back in line with the market
value for top quarterbacks. He is currently the sixth highest-paid
quarterback behind Steve Young, Brett Favre, Jake Plummer, Drew
Bledsoe and Mark Brunnell. The top three make more than $7 million
per season.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Aikman and Sanders new deals could help the Cowboys'
tight salary cap situation for 1999, as they would likely include
heavy bonuses and low initial base salaries. However, Jones said
the cap is not part of his motivation for giving them new
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we need to get done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys also need is to reduce fullback Daryl
Johnston's salary _ which is $1.65 million in 1999. Jones said
Johnston is valuable, but not at that price. He said they are
working on redoing Johnston's contract, but has not set a timetable
for its completion.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said the Cowboys are planning to bring back most of
their own unrestricted free agents, including receiver Ernie Mills,
linebacker Broderick Thomas and guard Nate Newton. Their in-house
priority, however, is unrestricted free-agent linebacker Randall
Godfrey, who is expected to replace Fred Strickland at middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that the Cowboys gambled a bit by tendering Godfrey a
qualifying offer of $429,000. That could result in Godfrey's
getting higher offers from other teams, who would only have to give
the Cowboys a second-round pick as compensation if they chose not
to match the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said that Godfrey's off-season shoulder surgery might
temper the offers. Jones speculates that Godfrey will want to come
back and have a good 1999 season to put him position for even
bigger money as an unrestricted free-agent next season.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jones won't discuss specific players they are targeting
in free agency, the Cowboys have made many contacts with players
outside the organization. There is no question a speed receiver is
their primary focus.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted free agent Raghib Ismail of the Carolina Panthers
and restricted free agent Derrick Mayes of the Green Bay Packers
are among the players the Cowboys are evaluating. Ismail is being
targeted by several teams, and the competition could put him out of
the Cowboys' price range. They also could find a receiver via a
trade. One possibility is St. Louis receiver Eddie Kennison.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colts linebacker Quentin Coryatt is still the Cowboys'
main target at outside linebacker. However, he is being pursued by
several other teams, and his agent, Steve Zucker, said Coryatt
won't visit any teams until early March.
</P>
<P>
   At center, the Cowboys could be going back to Mark Stepnoski, a
former Cowboys player who has been with the Oilers the past four
seasons. Stepnoski's agent, Ralph Cindrich, said his client would
like to come back and is looking for a multiyear contract. However,
Cindrich said Stepnoski probably won't make a decision on where he
will play for another month or so.

 &HT;    Art immitating life
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Tell me about your families,'' child therapist
Karen McQueary tells her young clients at the Artemis Center for
Alternatives to Domestic Violence. They often say, ``I don't want
to,'' or ``Pass.'' ``It's too scary,'' they explain. ``It makes me
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children, too traumatized to trust adults, initially
reveal themselves only through their artwork. For McQueary, a pad
of paper and a pencil can be the ``Open Sesame'' to their souls.
``I feel glad and sad and frightened,'' one 8-year-old captioned
his drawing of a father and a child crying purple tears. ``I feel
upset that Dad had to go to jale. I feel lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   This child's-eye view of domestic violence will be displayed
Saturday night at Sinclair Community College at the ninth annual
Artemis gala as part of an exhibit, ``Expressions,'' featuring
original artwork by Artemis clients, children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   None of the books or articles I've read on domestic violence
come as close to capturing the child's experience as this exhibit.
In one drawing, an oversized judge looms over drawings of ``daddy
and lawyer'' and ``mommy and lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drawing depicts the picture-perfect home, complete with
picket fence, dog house, chirping birds, a tree swing and a little
girl. Balloon messages relate, ``You deserve to be safe'' and ``We
wish for Chris to go to a counselor.'' The bird chirps, ``You are
OK, domestic violence is not your fault.''
</P>
<P>
   A little girl drew a heart and a picture of her mother in a
flowered hat: ``I would like my life to be full of love,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A child captioned another drawing: ``I don't trust my daddy
because he hurted my mom. I trust my mom because she never hurted
me; I trust my teacher because she is nice to me and my class.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drawings are more cryptic. McQueary was particularly
puzzled by one until the artist explained that, in the drawing, God
had turned his father into macaroni and cheese ``so he can't hurt
people any more.'' Using art's magic wand, children transform
batterers into frogs, marshmallows, you name it _ always for the
same reason: ``Then he can't hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   How does such an exhibit fly at a glitzy, festive event?
Wouldn't they rather be noshing hors d'oeuvres or boogieing to the
Arnette Howard Creole Funk Band? ``We've been pleasantly surprised
to see that most of the guests visit the exhibit, and spend a fair
amount of time there,'' said Artemis director Nancy Grigsby, who
founded the agency in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The gala has always mixed fun and flair with a serious message _
usually, in past years, with a national photography or art exhibit.
This year, for the first time, the exhibit will be local, featuring
works by current and former Artemis clients. ``This year, we wanted
to make it more local and more personal, to show people what we're
dealing with at Artemis,'' said Jill Bishop, community relations
coordinator. (Tickets are still available by calling Artemis at
461-5091.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most telling is a drawing a child made of the ``place I
feel most safe.'' At first it appears to be a nondescript red brick
building, until you look in the corner where the numbers ``301'' _
the street address for the Artemis Center _ are faintly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bittersweet,'' Grigsby said of the drawing. ``I'm glad
kids trust us and feel safe, but it's very tragic this is the only
place they feel safe and can trust people. We want a community that
holds offenders accountable so the rest of world can be a safe
place, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, the Artemis Center has been doing its part.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY, Calif. _ During afternoon tea at
Monterey's elegant Spindrift Inn, a fellow guest politely asked the
reason for my visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and I are here to attend the graduation ceremony of
my brother's daughter from the Defense Language Institute at the
Presidio,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   I started to say ``from spy school'' because I rather like the
way that sounds even though I know it's not accurate. It's good
that I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their studies and training are long and difficult,'' said the
prosperous-looking man. ``I'm sure she will appreciate having
family members see her graduate. What is her language?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabic,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've seen the need for that language recently. I was a
graduate there in Hmong before leaving for Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, who will be arriving a little later, was a
graduate there in Russian at about the same time,'' I said. ``But
he was sent to Europe rather than Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The man was the first of several people to comment on the family
legacy aspect of having both father and daughter graduate from the
same military language school, albeit in different languages.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center traces
its origins back to Nov. 1, 1941 _ weeks before the bombing of
Pearl Harbor _ when the Army established a secret language school
in the Presidio of San Francisco to teach the Japanese language.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the school was moved to the Presidio of Monterey
and was called the Army Language School. In 1963, the military
consolidated all foreign language programs at the Presidio of
Monterey with the mission to train military linguists to meet
Department of Defense requirements and sustain those capabilities
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidio'' is Spanish. The Spanish founded this presidio in
1770 to defend the bay area from the Russians. With better military
intelligence, they would have known they were looking in the wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Presidio can refer to ``prison,'' ``hard labor'' and
``garrison'' as well as a military installation. Those terms seem
out of place on this scenic peninsula that has some of the nation's
greatest golf courses, swankest homes and best scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Enough relatives came to celebrate young Alpha Nethaway's
graduation that we arrived at the base in a three-car caravan, with
one more soon to follow.
</P>
<P>
   I expected a ceremony that included precision marching past a
high grandstand on a huge parade ground. I envisioned gleaming
swords, colorful pennants and flags and perhaps a military band,
cannon salutes and fly-over of military jets trailing red, white
and blue smoke.
</P>
<P>
   My military training was of a different era. It also was
considerably less subtle and cerebral. The language I learned in
military training cannot be printed in newspapers or repeated
outside of outlaw motorcycle gangs.
</P>
<P>
   I also expected to see a graduation class numbering in the
hundreds, if not thousands.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the ceremony had no marching, swords,
pennants, flags, music or cannon fire. And there was no fly-over.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 people were in the graduation class. They included men
and women, officers and enlisted. They represented most branches of
the military.
</P>
<P>
   A good portion of the ceremony would have been incomprehensible
had not my niece given the English interpretation of her
classmate's speech in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   An officer with 24 years of military service, much of it in the
Middle East, was the guest speaker. He reminded the graduates how
important their training and skills are for the nation. It was all
low-key but enough to choke you up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a fly-over of F-16s doing victory rolls would have been
nice.

 &HT;    Nazis took away everything but her soul
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the Auschwitz death camp and for the
following 50 years, Irene Zis-blatt kept silent about the horrors
she saw and lived through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that silence was very, very important to our survival,
because if you weren't silent they took you right away,'' says
Zisblatt, 68, sitting in the living room of her apartment in
Pembroke Pines, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded finally to tell her story to the Survivors of the
Shoah Visual History Foundation, the nonprofit organization founded
by filmmaker Steven Spielberg, Zisblatt discovered a new wave of
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like inside me, this second life, an inner life that I
didn't release,'' she said. ``When I broke my silence, all these
memories that I suppressed for all these years, they just popped
right back. The pain was not important anymore. What was important
to me was I needed to share my pain with the world, so they cannot
let anybody be painful like this again.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Zisblatt's story is a key part of the Oscar-nominated
documentary feature, The Last Days, which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The film concentrates on the end of World War II, when Germany
realized defeat was inevitable, but continued exterminating the
Jews. Specifically, it focuses on the Hungarian Jews, who were
forced into ghettos, herded onto boxcars and transported to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt was born in the lush resort town of Poleno,
Czechoslovakia, which was later annexed into Hungary. A handful of
Nazi officers occupied the town, but her family was able to hide
for two weeks in their home, which had been sealed to suggest it
had been vacated. Eventually, they were betrayed by neighbors, sent
to the ghetto and then to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Irene was transported to the camp with her
mother, brother and sisters, all of whom would be killed soon after
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's most memorable sequence, Zisblatt talks of her
mother sewing diamonds into her daughter's skirt, telling her to
use them when necessary to buy bread. But the detainees were
stripped of their clothes, so Zisblatt quickly hid the gems in her
mouth. When she saw others being examined for gold fillings,
Zisblatt swallowed the diamonds. Throughout her many months in the
camp, she would retrieve them from her excrement and swallow the
diamonds again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that was the only connection to my mother,'' Zisblatt
explains. ``By not giving up the diamonds it was holding on to a
past, holding on to a strength and (to) my mother's wish to buy
bread so I could be strong and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt was determined not to be broken by her Nazi captors.
``I felt that there was something that they wanted from us,'' she
says softly. ``They already took our possessions, they already took
my family, they already took my freedom, they already branded me
with a number and took my name away. So there was something they
needed to take away in order to kill us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured the only thing that's left is my soul and they're
not going to take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were many times when Zisblatt's will to live ebbed.
``When I was ready to die _ like on a death march, where they were
shooting the ones that couldn't keep up with the march, they left
them on the road _ and I was ready for that,'' she says. At those
times, she recalls an older teenage girl pulling her back on her
feet, repeating their joint pledge, ``Now remember, we're not going
to be ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt eluded the crematoriums and was freed by U.S. troops,
but she soon landed in another camp for displaced persons. A
soldier being shipped home took her name and background particulars
and placed them in an ad in a New York newspaper. There it was read
by her deceased father's oldest brother, who sent her a letter
asking her plans and enclosing a check for $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' says Zisblatt. ``I sent back the check,
because I couldn't buy anything, I had no use for it.'' But she
wrote that she wanted to be with family, to rebuild her life and
start a new family.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to New Jersey, attended night school to learn English,
worked for RCA on a filament assembly line and eventually was sent
to Rutgers University to be able to work with the company's
engineers. ``I kissed the ground that I walked on where I was, that
I was given the opportunity to be in this country and be free and
not to ever be afraid again.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt married, had two children and moved to South Florida in
1989 to alleviate her Krone's disease, which doctors said is
aggravated by conditions in the North. It is unclear whether the
disease is related to her confinement in Auschwitz, but she feels
that is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of her grandchildren fill many frames in Zisblatt's
kitchen, but the inscribed photograph that dominates her living
room is of The Last Days' executive producer _ Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   All through her interviews in Los Angeles, she hoped to
encounter the director of Schindler's List. ``I didn't know what to
expect, but I figured, well, if we're going to work on this for so
long, I'm sure to meet him, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be, until the documentary premiered. ``At the
screening, I figured, `Well, he's going to come for a few minutes.
He's going to run in, he's going to say ``hello,'' he's going to
take a picture and then be on his way, out the back door.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, Spielberg stayed to watch the film and spend time with
Zisblatt and the other four featured interview subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most compassionate, the most wonderful, caring
person,'' she says. ``To meet him and to touch him, it was like
touching an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg had only one request. He knew she had the diamonds
from the concentration camp made into a tear-shaped pendant. She
had only worn it twice, at her children's weddings. But she wore it
to the premiere and Spielberg asked to touch it, to connect with
the triumph and the loss that it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he took these diamonds and he kissed them like it was a
mezuzah,'' an ornamental scroll holder proclaiming one's Judaism,
says Zisblatt. ``And I cried for 24 hours after that.''
</P>
<P>
   As to watching the film that night, well, ``Half of the film, I
didn't even see, because I was crying so hard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And a new tear forms in her eye.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

   q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the background and whereabouts of
the mother of King Abdullah of Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   A: Antoinette ``Toni'' Gardiner was born in Chelmondiston,
England, near Ipswich. Educated at a convent school in Canterbury,
England, she started her working life as a typist and wage clerk.
She met Jordan's King Hussein at a party while she was visiting her
father, Lt. Col. Walter Gardiner, who was then serving at the
British Military Mission in Amman, Jordan. When she married Hussein
in 1961, taking the name Muna, she converted to Islam. It is said
that her personal modesty prevented her from adopting the title
queen. Abdullah was born Jan. 30, 1962, and when his parents
divorced 10 years later, Muna chose to remain in Amman, where she
lives in relative seclusion in an elegant villa. She never
remarried.
</P>
<P>
   After Muna's marriage, her parents moved to Amman, where her
mother died five years ago. Her father still lives there. Muna, now
58, also maintains a small home in London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you served in the Army during the Vietnam War era, but
didn't actually serve in Vietnam, are you still considered a
Vietnam veteran?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not by the definition used by the Department of Veterans
Affairs. Obviously it's a matter of semantics, VA spokesman Tom
Thomas said. The VA distinguishes between a Vietnam veteran (one
who actually served in-country in Vietnam) and a Vietnam-era
veteran (one who served during the defined period of the Vietnam
conflict: Aug. 5, 1964, through May 7, 1975).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the word ``pops'' mean in describing an orchestra?
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from ``popular'' and means an orchestra specializing
in popular or light classical music, such as the Boston Pops.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us some information about the headdresses worn
by Arabic men, such as those we saw during TV coverage of the
funeral of Jordanian King Hussein and in frequent published photos
of Yasser Arafat?
</P>
<P>
   A: The kaffiyeh, the characteristic masculine Arab headdress, is
a square of cotton, linen, wool or silk, and can be either plain or
patterned. It is folded into a triangle and placed on the head so
that one point falls onto each shoulder and the third down the
back. It's held in place on the head by an agal, a corded band
decorated with beads or metallic threads. Originally cream-colored
or white, it now is seen in varying colors, with green, purple,
even red stitching.
</P>
<P>
   Designed more than a thousand years ago, the kaffiyeh protected
wandering Bedouins from the harsh desert climate of lethal sun and
sand storms. Eventually Arab workers in all but North Africa
started wearing it as a head cover, and more recently it made the
leap to Europe and the United States as a fashionable scarf. But in
the Middle East, the kaffiyeh is much more than an item of fashion.
It's an emblem of masculinity, maturity and nationalism, almost a
substitute flag, and can be viewed in some cases as a political
statement. Having crossed many eras and cultures, the kaffiyeh is
worn by Muslims, Christians and Druse, as well as by tourists and
even street vendors in Manhattan and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a U.S. president were impeached and forced to leave
office, he would lose certain benefits and privileges, such as his
pension. But would he also lose his lifetime Secret Service
protection?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Secret Service protection is an open-ended entitlement to
any and all former presidents, said Pete Sepp of the National
Taxpayers Union. It's accorded to them regardless of whether they
simply serve out their term, resign or are impeached and convicted.
``The law treats them all the same,'' Sepp said. Such protection is
governed by a part of the U.S. Code pertaining to the Treasury
Department. The only limitation is that presidents elected after
Clinton will be limited to 10 years of Secret Service protection.
That was passed several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's pension will start at about $151,800 a year,
Sepp said, with additional office and staff allowances budgeted at
$450,000 to $650,000 a year. A presidential pension and other
allowances would be stripped in their entirety only if a president
were both impeached and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Spencer Christian, the wise-cracking,
cheerful weatherman on ABC's ``Good Morning America''? We miss him.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was reported last July that the network was not offering
Christian a new contract, but was extending his previous contract
by six months. So, after a dozen years of reporting on sun, rain
and snow, mixed with trademark witty repartee with his coworkers,
he left New York Jan. 1 for KGO-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in the mascot names of two schools. What is a
wahoo, and what is a hokie? I need to know the schools, and what
the names mean.
</P>
<P>
   A: A wahoo is the informal mascot of the University of Virginia
at Charlottesville. It refers to a UVA student; an under-hoo is an
undergraduate. According to UVA's Internet site, it's derived from
a fish that can drink twice its weight daily. We'll leave the
interpretation up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Hokie is associated with Virginia Tech. It dates to the late
1800s, when the school, at Blacksburg, changed its name from
Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical College to Virginia Polytechnic
Institute. The original college cheer, which referred to the
school's original name, no longer made sense. So a spirit contest
was held, and O.M. Stull (class of 1896) came up with a new cheer,
known as Old Hokie, for which he won $5. Stull said he made up the
word hokie _ no explanation for spelling it with and without the
``e'' _ just to attract attention, and it had no hidden or symbolic
meaning. The words:
</P>
<P>
   Hoki, Hoki, Hoki Hy!/
</P>
<P>
   Tech! Tech! V.P.I./
</P>
<P>
   Sola-Rex Sola-Rah/
</P>
<P>
   Polytech-Vir-gin-i-a/
</P>
<P>
   Rae, Ri, V.P.I./
</P>
<P>
   Team! Team! Team!
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many known American veterans of World War I are still
alive? And when did the last American veteran of the
Spanish-American War die?
</P>
<P>
   A. The population of American World War I veterans is declining
rapidly and is now estimated at 3,200, said Tom Thomas of the
Department of Veterans Affairs. The last American veteran of the
Spanish-American War, Nathan E. Cook, died at age 106 on Sept. 10,
1992.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: As of July 1, 1998, the VA's compensation and
pension rolls showed that 46,311 spouses of World War I veterans,
and 694 spouses of the Spanish-American War, were living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Republican Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona is proposing a bill to
add Ronald Reagan's image to Mount Rushmore. What House committee
is handling this legislation, and whom can we contact on that
committee from Georgia to express our concern?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bill will be introduced Feb. 23, said Michael Paranzino
of Salmon's Washington office. What happens after that isn't known,
so there's no one to contact at this point. You're always welcome
to sound off to your representative about any concern you have, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon proposes to create a foundation that would raise
voluntary contributions _ ``no tax dollars involved,'' Paranzino
emphasized _ to finance the Reagan addition to Rushmore, which is
famous for its giant images of Presidents George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. The proposal
would establish a commission of experts, Paranzino said, adding
that the project wouldn't go forward if the commission determined
it would harm the existing sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his plan Feb. 1, this was Salmon's explanation
for his proposal: ``Ronald Reagan won the Cold War and began the
unprecedented economic growth we have been enjoying for more than
15 years now. He also restored America's hope and faith in the
future. As the 20th century's greatest president, he should be on
Mount Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's idea isn't expected to go far. The reaction of the
Mount Rushmore memorial is that sculptor Gutzon Borglum decided
long ago there's no more room on the mountain for another face.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the timetable for the United States to turn the
Panama Canal over to the Panamanians? Several of us are debating
it.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's scheduled to happen in about 10 1/2 months. The canal
was completed in 1917, with the United States taking control of the
canal and the Panama Canal Zone, a special area bordering the
canal. In 1977, Panama and the United States signed a treaty that
resulted in the transfer of the zone to Panama in 1979. The treaty
also provided for the transfer of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a transcript available of Rep. Bob Barr's speech to the
Council of Conservative Citizens?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently not. Barr (R-Ga.), who spoke to the controversial
group in Charleston, S.C., in June, didn't have a speech prepared
in advance, said spokesman Brad Alexander in Washington. No
transcript is available from the group, either, said Gordon Baum at
its St. Louis headquarters. Baum said he thought Barr had some
notes scribbled on the back of an envelope, but he wasn't sure.
Barr has distanced himself from the council, saying he disagrees
with its racial views, which he finds ``repugnant.'' He said he
merely spoke to the group because he was invited to do so. Both
Alexander and Baum said Barr's topic was presidential impeachment.

 &HT;    Masseur has magic touch, but here's the rub: He treats your pets
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When you're a pioneer in medicine, you
stick your neck out a little. And when your job involves
therapeutic massage of dogs and cats, well, you become easy prey
for jokesters.
</P>
<P>
   Pet masseur and animal behavior expert Michael Holloway knows
this. After he was quoted in a recent article in Time, he was
invited on a morning radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to poke a little fun,'' Holloway says. ``They made
a few jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear no matter how odd his line of work sounds, his
Boca Raton, Fla. business, Pet Massage Rehabilitation Services, has
found a niche in a booming market. More and more owners who
contribute to the $21 billion pet-care industry are willing to pay
extra dough for alternative treatments: Acupuncture, herbal mood
enhancers and, yes, pet massage.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, business for Holloway _ who is a licensed
massage therapist (for humans) and former veterinary assistant _
has grown sevenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway uses deep-tissue massage to facilitate recovery from
surgery and treat physical problems such as hip dysplasia. Therapy
is intended to work in tandem with whatever is prescribed by the
animal's veterinarian, much the way a physical therapist might
rehabilitate a human patient who had knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But massage also heals behavioral problems, such as ``contact
phobia'' experienced by dogs who become fearful when approached by
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Judy and Michael Odsess of Boca Raton turned to Holloway to help
their Old English sheepdog, Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, now 6, suffered as a puppy from a shoulder disorder
caused by his rapid growth. After he underwent surgery to remove
damaged cartilage, the Odsesses hired Holloway, who began weekly
massage sessions. He also added 2- to 4-mile walks three times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Odsess said that when Nathan's veterinarian recommended
massage therapy, ``I thought it was insane. But it made sense.
Massage does work.''
</P>
<P>
   And the several hundred dollars they spend a month for the
treatments?
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally think it's worth it,'' Judy Odsess said. ``He's a
happier dog. He feels better. If Nathan needed acupuncture I'd get
that too.''

</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned that Max Cleland received a Silver
Star. What heroic act did he do to receive that award?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cleland (D-Ga.) was awarded the Silver Star and Soldier's
Medal in connection with his Vietnam War service. According to Army
citations, he won the Silver Star for crawling out of his foxhole
during a rocket attack to tend to wounded men. The Soldier's Medal
was awarded for shielding other men from the grenade blast that
wounded him. But in his autobiography, ``Strong at the Broken
Places,'' Cleland wrote that he hadn't really earned either of the
awards for heroism. ``There were no heroics on which to base the
Soldier's Medal. And it had been my men who took care of the
wounded during the rocket attack, not me,'' he wrote. ``Some
compassionate military men had obviously recommended me for the
Silver Star, but I did not deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, then an Army captain, lost both legs and an arm in the
explosion of an M-26 fragmentation grenade on April 8, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does Charles Ruff, one of the key members of President
Clinton's defense team, use a wheelchair?
</P>
<P>
   A: He contracted a polio-type virus while teaching in Liberia in
the 1960s, and has been using a wheelchair ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the amount of an estate that is not subject
to taxation will increase over the next several years to $1
million. Can you give me a breakdown by year and amount until that
maximum is reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the years and the corresponding Applicable
Exclusion Amounts, the term used by the Internal Revenue Service:
1999, $650,000; 2000 and 2001, $675,000; 2002 and 2003, $700,000;
2004, $850,000; 2005, $950,000; and after 2005, $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article said someone ``had stumbled onto
the Lascaux Cave of the computer industry.'' What does that mean?
I'm a spelunker and am interested in caves, and haven't been able
to find any information in my resources.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Lascaux Cave, situated above the Vezere Valley near
Montignac in southwestern France's Dordogne, is famous because of
art believed to have been placed there by Cro-Magnon man beginning
about 17,000 years ago. The cave consists of a main cavern and
several steep galleries, all magnificently decorated with engraved,
drawn and painted animals in shades of red, yellow, brown and black
on a light background. Painting at Lascaux continued over several
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   After being sealed off since the last Ice Age, Lascaux was
discovered by accident in 1940. Soon after World War II, people
began flooding into the cave to see the paintings. The public has
been kept out since 1963 because the passage of so many visitors
was causing microscopic mosses and algae to grow on the walls,
damaging the art.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're a spelunker, if you visit there you still can see a
re-creation of the Lascaux Cave, with paintings of bison and
flying-hooved antelopes. It's at Lascaux II, near
Beynac-et-Cazenac.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the derivation of the expression ``salad days''?
</P>
<P>
   A: It refers to naive and inexperienced youth, and it comes to
us from Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra.'' Cleopatra, kidded
by Charmian about her old love for Julius Caesar, joked that those
were her ``salad days'' when she was ``green in judgment, cold in
blood.'' In other words, she loved Caesar unskillfully and without
much compassion, compared to the way she loved Mark Antony.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is quite different, however. According to the Facts
on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, the real Cleopatra
actually was a trained and artful lover before her adolescence, and
the salad days that Shakespeare has her admit to were distant
memories long before she married her brother at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the initials R.E.M. stand for in the rock band?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many fans contend that the initials don't stand for anything.
Others have various versions, some not printable. But several
sources say there's no mystery at all. This is what The New Rolling
Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &AMP; Roll reports: ``In April 1980, the
four (Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Bill Berry) formed
R.E.M. (named for the dream-state rapid eye movement) and began
rehearsing in a converted Episcopal church.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites dealing with the origin of band names repeat the
``rapid eye movement'' story, saying it's the state of sleep in
which dreams occur, while one, The Heathen World Homepage, adds
that ``some say R.E.M. means Rightous Energetic Music.'' So take
your pick, or make up an explanation of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the religion of Queen Noor of Jordan when she was
living in the United States, before she converted to Islam?
</P>
<P>
   A: Current Biography says she was a ``nominal Protestant'' _
denomination not specified _ who had never been baptized. Several
days before she married King Hussein on June 15, 1978, Lisa Halaby
expressed her adherence to Islam, which entailed her declaring
before an Islamic court that there is only one God, that God is
Allah, and that the Messenger of Allah is Muhammed the Prophet. In
accordance with the Jordanian tradition that the king's bride take
an Arabic name, Halaby became Noor al-Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the significance of Feb. 14 being designated
Valentine's Day? Is this a holiday created by some company for
commercial reasons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't blame (or credit) greeting card and candy companies, or
the florists of America, although they all enjoy mopping up the
cash flow associated with the day. Some people trace the beginning
of the Valentine's Day observance to an ancient Roman festival,
Lupercalia. It was held in mid-February to ensure protection from
wolves. There's a fertility rite involved, but we won't get into
that.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts associate the event with one or more saints of the
early Christian church, while still others link it with an old
English belief that birds choose their mates on Feb. 14. World Book
Encyclopedia concludes that Valentine's Day, as it's observed now,
probably came from a combination of all three sources, plus the
belief that spring is a time for lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare even got into the act in ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' in which a character discovers two lovers in the woods and
asks, ``St. Valentine's Day is past;/ Begin these woodbirds but to
couple now?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: While I was going through an old scrapbook of my mother's, I
came across an envelope with a 1 1/2-cent stamp. The postmark date
isn't clear, but I'm guessing it's around 1939. I've never heard of
a stamp that cost an uneven amount. Do you know anything about
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Half-cent stamps, usually based on zones, were common in the
late 1930s, said Barry Ziehl of the Postal Service in Washington.
They varied in value and could be used for books or second- or
third-class material. In 1938, the post office issued a 1 1/2-cent
Martha Washington stamp, a half-cent Benjamin Franklin stamp, and a
4 1/2-cent White House stamp, Ziehl said. In 1939, a half-cent coil
stamp also was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Decimal stamps were issued by the Postal Service as recently as
1988, Ziehl said, such as 5.3 cents, 7.6 cents and 8.4 cents, and
were used primarily by nonprofit and small business mailers. But
those weren't the same as the half-centers, and even those have
been discontinued.

</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the background and whereabouts of
the mother of King Abdullah of Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   A: Antoinette ``Toni'' Gardiner was born in Chelmondiston,
England, near Ipswich. Educated at a convent school in Canterbury,
England, she started her working life as a typist and wage clerk.
She met Jordan's King Hussein at a party while she was visiting her
father, Lt. Col. Walter Gardiner, who was then serving at the
British Military Mission in Amman, Jordan. When she married Hussein
in 1961, taking the name Muna, she converted to Islam. It is said
that her personal modesty prevented her from adopting the title
queen. Abdullah was born Jan. 30, 1962, and when his parents
divorced 10 years later, Muna chose to remain in Amman, where she
lives in relative seclusion in an elegant villa. She never
remarried.
</P>
<P>
   After Muna's marriage, her parents moved to Amman, where her
mother died five years ago. Her father still lives there. Muna, now
58, also maintains a small home in London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you served in the Army during the Vietnam War era, but
didn't actually serve in Vietnam, are you still considered a
Vietnam veteran?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not by the definition used by the Department of Veterans
Affairs. Obviously it's a matter of semantics, VA spokesman Tom
Thomas said. The VA distinguishes between a Vietnam veteran (one
who actually served in-country in Vietnam) and a Vietnam-era
veteran (one who served during the defined period of the Vietnam
conflict: Aug. 5, 1964, through May 7, 1975).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the word ``pops'' mean in describing an orchestra?
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from ``popular'' and means an orchestra specializing
in popular or light classical music, such as the Boston Pops.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us some information about the headdresses worn
by Arabic men, such as those we saw during TV coverage of the
funeral of Jordanian King Hussein and in frequent published photos
of Yasser Arafat?
</P>
<P>
   A: The kaffiyeh, the characteristic masculine Arab headdress, is
a square of cotton, linen, wool or silk, and can be either plain or
patterned. It is folded into a triangle and placed on the head so
that one point falls onto each shoulder and the third down the
back. It's held in place on the head by an agal, a corded band
decorated with beads or metallic threads. Originally cream-colored
or white, it now is seen in varying colors, with green, purple,
even red stitching.
</P>
<P>
   Designed more than a thousand years ago, the kaffiyeh protected
wandering Bedouins from the harsh desert climate of lethal sun and
sand storms. Eventually Arab workers in all but North Africa
started wearing it as a head cover, and more recently it made the
leap to Europe and the United States as a fashionable scarf. But in
the Middle East, the kaffiyeh is much more than an item of fashion.
It's an emblem of masculinity, maturity and nationalism, almost a
substitute flag, and can be viewed in some cases as a political
statement. Having crossed many eras and cultures, the kaffiyeh is
worn by Muslims, Christians and Druse, as well as by tourists and
even street vendors in Manhattan and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a U.S. president were impeached and forced to leave
office, he would lose certain benefits and privileges, such as his
pension. But would he also lose his lifetime Secret Service
protection?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Secret Service protection is an open-ended entitlement to
any and all former presidents, said Pete Sepp of the National
Taxpayers Union. It's accorded to them regardless of whether they
simply serve out their term, resign or are impeached and convicted.
``The law treats them all the same,'' Sepp said. Such protection is
governed by a part of the U.S. Code pertaining to the Treasury
Department. The only limitation is that presidents elected after
Clinton will be limited to 10 years of Secret Service protection.
That was passed several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's pension will start at about $151,800 a year,
Sepp said, with additional office and staff allowances budgeted at
$450,000 to $650,000 a year. A presidential pension and other
allowances would be stripped in their entirety only if a president
were both impeached and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Spencer Christian, the wise-cracking,
cheerful weatherman on ABC's ``Good Morning America''? We miss him.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was reported last July that the network was not offering
Christian a new contract, but was extending his previous contract
by six months. So, after a dozen years of reporting on sun, rain
and snow, mixed with trademark witty repartee with his coworkers,
he left New York Jan. 1 for KGO-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in the mascot names of two schools. What is a
wahoo, and what is a hokie? I need to know the schools, and what
the names mean.
</P>
<P>
   A: A wahoo is the informal mascot of the University of Virginia
at Charlottesville. It refers to a UVA student; an under-hoo is an
undergraduate. According to UVA's Internet site, it's derived from
a fish that can drink twice its weight daily. We'll leave the
interpretation up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Hokie is associated with Virginia Tech. It dates to the late
1800s, when the school, at Blacksburg, changed its name from
Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical College to Virginia Polytechnic
Institute. The original college cheer, which referred to the
school's original name, no longer made sense. So a spirit contest
was held, and O.M. Stull (class of 1896) came up with a new cheer,
known as Old Hokie, for which he won $5. Stull said he made up the
word hokie _ no explanation for spelling it with and without the
``e'' _ just to attract attention, and it had no hidden or symbolic
meaning. The words:
</P>
<P>
   Hoki, Hoki, Hoki Hy!/
</P>
<P>
   Tech! Tech! V.P.I./
</P>
<P>
   Sola-Rex Sola-Rah/
</P>
<P>
   Polytech-Vir-gin-i-a/
</P>
<P>
   Rae, Ri, V.P.I./
</P>
<P>
   Team! Team! Team!
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many known American veterans of World War I are still
alive? And when did the last American veteran of the
Spanish-American War die?
</P>
<P>
   A. The population of American World War I veterans is declining
rapidly and is now estimated at 3,200, said Tom Thomas of the
Department of Veterans Affairs. The last American veteran of the
Spanish-American War, Nathan E. Cook, died at age 106 on Sept. 10,
1992.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: As of July 1, 1998, the VA's compensation and
pension rolls showed that 46,311 spouses of World War I veterans,
and 694 spouses of the Spanish-American War, were living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Republican Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona is proposing a bill to
add Ronald Reagan's image to Mount Rushmore. What House committee
is handling this legislation, and whom can we contact on that
committee from Georgia to express our concern?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bill will be introduced Feb. 23, said Michael Paranzino
of Salmon's Washington office. What happens after that isn't known,
so there's no one to contact at this point. You're always welcome
to sound off to your representative about any concern you have, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon proposes to create a foundation that would raise
voluntary contributions _ ``no tax dollars involved,'' Paranzino
emphasized _ to finance the Reagan addition to Rushmore, which is
famous for its giant images of Presidents George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. The proposal
would establish a commission of experts, Paranzino said, adding
that the project wouldn't go forward if the commission determined
it would harm the existing sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his plan Feb. 1, this was Salmon's explanation
for his proposal: ``Ronald Reagan won the Cold War and began the
unprecedented economic growth we have been enjoying for more than
15 years now. He also restored America's hope and faith in the
future. As the 20th century's greatest president, he should be on
Mount Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's idea isn't expected to go far. The reaction of the
Mount Rushmore memorial is that sculptor Gutzon Borglum decided
long ago there's no more room on the mountain for another face.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the timetable for the United States to turn the
Panama Canal over to the Panamanians? Several of us are debating
it.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's scheduled to happen in about 10 1/2 months. The canal
was completed in 1917, with the United States taking control of the
canal and the Panama Canal Zone, a special area bordering the
canal. In 1977, Panama and the United States signed a treaty that
resulted in the transfer of the zone to Panama in 1979. The treaty
also provided for the transfer of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a transcript available of Rep. Bob Barr's speech to the
Council of Conservative Citizens?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently not. Barr (R-Ga.), who spoke to the controversial
group in Charleston, S.C., in June, didn't have a speech prepared
in advance, said spokesman Brad Alexander in Washington. No
transcript is available from the group, either, said Gordon Baum at
its St. Louis headquarters. Baum said he thought Barr had some
notes scribbled on the back of an envelope, but he wasn't sure.
Barr has distanced himself from the council, saying he disagrees
with its racial views, which he finds ``repugnant.'' He said he
merely spoke to the group because he was invited to do so. Both
Alexander and Baum said Barr's topic was presidential impeachment.

days before she married King Hussein on June 15, 1978, Lisa Halaby
expressed her adherence to Islam, which entailed her declaring
before an Islamic court that there is only one God, that God is
Allah, and that the Messenger of Allah is Muhammed the Prophet. In
accordance with the Jordanian tradition that the king's bride take
an Arabic name, Halaby became Noor al-Hussein.

<P>
   Q: What is the significance of Feb. 14 being designated
Valentine's Day? Is this a holiday created by some company for
commercial reasons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't blame (or credit) greeting card and candy companies, or
the florists of America, although they all enjoy mopping up the
cash flow associated with the day. Some people trace the beginning
of the Valentine's Day observance to an ancient Roman festival,
Lupercalia. It was held in mid-February to ensure protection from
wolves. There's a fertility rite involved, but we won't get into
that.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts associate the event with one or more saints of the
early Christian church, while still others link it with an old
English belief that birds choose their mates on Feb. 14. World Book
Encyclopedia concludes that Valentine's Day, as it's observed now,
probably came from a combination of all three sources, plus the
belief that spring is a time for lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare even got into the act in ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' in which a character discovers two lovers in the woods and
asks, ``St. Valentine's Day is past;/ Begin these woodbirds but to
couple now?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: While I was going through an old scrapbook of my mother's, I
came across an envelope with a 1 1/2-cent stamp. The postmark date
isn't clear, but I'm guessing it's around 1939. I've never heard of
a stamp that cost an uneven amount. Do you know anything about
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Half-cent stamps, usually based on zones, were common in the
late 1930s, said Barry Ziehl of the Postal Service in Washington.
They varied in value and could be used for books or second- or
third-class material. In 1938, the post office issued a 1 1/2-cent
Martha Washington stamp, a half-cent Benjamin Franklin stamp, and a
4 1/2-cent White House stamp, Ziehl said. In 1939, a half-cent coil
stamp also was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Decimal stamps were issued by the Postal Service as recently as
1988, Ziehl said, such as 5.3 cents, 7.6 cents and 8.4 cents, and
were used primarily by nonprofit and small business mailers. But
those weren't the same as the half-centers, and even those have
been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Endit.

 &HT;    Don Byron's colors of the clarinetBy Michael Point
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``People have a preconceived notion of what a
clarinetist is supposed to play,'' Don Byron says. ``It's like
there's some unwritten rule about what you can do with the
instrument and what you can't, despite all its possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have explored the clarinet's potential with more consistent
creativity than Byron, whose unpredictable arc through modern music
has redefined the instrument's role while using it to open ears to
forgotten wonders of the past. Byron, classically trained at the
New England Conservatory of Music and jazz experienced, via
ground-breaking work with Bill Frisell, Bobby Previte and Ralph
Peterson, is an omnivorous music consumer who believes in using all
the colors available, as well as occasionally coloring outside the
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to take the whole culture and use it,'' Byron says.
``There's so much out there that goes ignored, and so many ways of
interconnecting things, that I can never understand why musicians
ever have trouble finding something to inspire them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old New Yorker has spent less than a decade in the
spotlight but he's already created a body of work adventurous and
wide-ranging enough to serve as complete careers for less eclectic
musicians. ``Tuskeegee Experiments,'' his stunning 1992 debut as a
leader, presented his personalized takes on everyone from Ellington
to Schuman, while ``Music for Six Musicians'' shifted the focus to
Latin jazz and ``No Vibe Zone'' emphasized a more modern jazz
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Had Byron recorded only these albums his identity as the best
and brightest clarinetist on the contemporary jazz scene would have
been a clear one. But he muddied the waters by tackling other
musical forms, beginning with a controversial album of klezmer
music.
</P>
<P>
   Byron's tribute to klezmer cutup Mickey Katz caught the music
world off guard, despite the fact he had performed with a klezmer
repertory band for a decade. Jewish scholars were outraged, jazz
fans were perplexed and Byron was amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seemed to hear the music,'' Byron says. ``People were
writing editorials and giving lectures about how I wasn't treating
the music properly, yet no one else was even bothering to play
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Byron had just played straight-ahead traditional klezmer he
would have been proclaimed a musical hero. But by opting for an
esoteric approach, he upset many listeners, even while making the
best neo-klezmer album to date. That approach is a constant in
Byron's career, and it's spectacularly showcased in the live show
he's bringing to town Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bug Music,'' named after Byron's favorite episode of ``The
Flintstones,'' remains one of his most popular musical personas.
The mirthful music is nominally jazz, but it's jazz caught at an
intersection of classical and cartoon music. The approach was the
creation of composers such as Raymond Scott, John Kirby and the
early Duke Ellington. Full of elastic adaptability, the music swung
in a manner regular swing didn't and, like the music of Katz, it
proudly included comic overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Byron performs the unusual ``Bug Music'' repertoire with wit and
respect, and his emphasis on Scott and Kirby, innovative stylists
and synthesists whose accomplishments have been downplayed, if not
actually ignored, by modern critics, graphically illustrates his
decidedly different sort of repertory jazz approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most repertory bands always stress the obvious and the
overexposed and miss the material that really deserves to be heard
by more people,'' Byron says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that Byron confused jazz fans with an
off-the-wall klezmer album, or that he mixed cartoon music with the
classics. Even those who thought they were ready for anything were
surprised at last year's ``Nu Blaxploitation,'' a fun and funky
fusion effort featuring the tunes of Mandrill, Byron's favorite
band as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Once Byron fans have fully absorbed Mandrill, they'll be able to
move on to classical composer Igor Stravinsky, another recording
project Byron is involved with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have to go out and search for new ideas or concepts,''
Byron says. ``There's a whole universe full of great music that
deserves to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   So whether it's Mickey Katz or Mandrill, Raymond Scott or
Schuman, Byron is on the beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream of the day when people won't care what type of music I
play,'' Byron says. ``I just want to be able to follow my heart and
soul and hopefully take some like-minded fans with me on the
journey.''

 &HT;    Salt-and-water blend pours waves of tenderness into the driest
roasts
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're too young to remember the good old
days, think of this as a legend. Once upon a time, a Sunday pork
roast was a tender, succulent treat.
</P>
<P>
   That was before farmers bred most of the fat from the pig,
leaving us with a rather svelte porker. And a skinny pig produces a
dry roast. Sure, some cuts still retain a little internal fat, but
the pork loin of today is closing in on chicken breast as a low-fat
choice.
</P>
<P>
   And boneless pork loin is the way most Americans want their meat
these days _ easy to slice and with no bones to remind them of the
origins of the meat.
</P>
<P>
   What's a cook to do? A few chefs and cooking experts say the
answer is easy: brine it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the new approach to Thanksgiving turkey? Lots of cooks
have adopted brining the bird as a way to ensure a moist and tender
breast. The technique works on roast chicken as well.
</P>
<P>
   So listen up if you're tired of dry, rather flavorless, pork
roasts and chops. The cure is a cure.
</P>
<P>
   The brine is simple; just a mixture of coarse salt and sugar
dissolved in water with added seasonings. Because the brine
penetrates the meat, so does whatever flavoring is used. That's a
bonus because traditional marinades just stay on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't the brine make all pork taste like ham, one skeptic
asked? No, because the brine bath is short, just four to six hours
for chops and a day or two for a roast.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this does requires a little planning but the amount
of work is minimal. Making the brine takes at most five minutes.
Add the meat and let the brine do its work for the allotted time.
Then proceed with your recipe, which can be as simple as grilled
chops.
</P>
<P>
   An explanation of why this works? Scientists understand that
better than those of us who just cook. Harold McGee, the
much-quoted California specialist in the science of cooking, says
it's osmosis. ``The meat absorbs the salt water. The salt begins to
denature the meat proteins, causing them to unwind and form a
matrix that traps the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way of saying that comes from Gourmet magazine: ``The
salt is the key element. Its electrically charged ions make the
muscle fibers plump up and absorb more water. The structure of the
protein changes as well, preventing water from escaping during
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   See, I told you the scientists would understand.
</P>
<P>
   I just know that it works.

 &HT;    Good stuff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While some of us have gone to the no-soak method of preparing
dried beans, the Bean Education &AMP; Awareness Network says there's
still one good reason to soak. A new study says soaking helps
dissolve oligosaccharides, the indigestible sugars that cause gas.
The quick hot-soak method is more effective in reducing those
sugars than the traditional overnight soak.
</P>
<P>
   One good reminder
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you missed the point that baking soda has uses
beyond cooking, Arm &AMP; Hammer is introducing a blue Fridge-n-Freezer
box specially designed to deodorize the refrigerator. Tear-off
panels and cloth filters make the new box more effective than the
familiar yellow box we all tuck inside our refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaky sugar hides in some food
</P>
<P>
   Wonder where the pounds come from?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the sugar Americans consume adds to the problem _
about 20 teaspoons, or 320 calories a day. Not you, you say? Well,
look where it's hiding: 13 teaspoons in a cup of Dannon French
Vanilla Low Fat Yogurt with Raspberries, and six teaspoons in a
half-cup of Mott's applesauce _ more than is in a Hershey's milk
chocolate bar.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar hides in such disguises as high-fructose corn syrup,
honey, molasses, sorghum syrup and even fruit juice concentrate,
notes the Tufts University Health &AMP; Nutrition Letter.

 &HT;    Belinda playing baseball again, despite MS
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ A brown cardboard box stuffed with baseball
equipment was in front of him and Stan Belinda slowly, almost
lovingly, sorted through it, touching each sock, each sweat shirt,
each shoe as if they were gold.
</P>
<P>
   To Belinda, they are better than gold. They are life
re-incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and
feared he might never again use the baseball equipment and clothing
he'll put on today to work out with the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   It was last Sept. 21 at the Mayo Clinic when Dr. John Noseworthy
confirmed that the 32-year-old relief pitcher had MS, a diagnosis
first made by Cincinnati's Dr. Robert Reed with a spinal tap on
Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tough, tough day,'' Belinda said Tuesday, his eyes reddening
as he fought tears, both from joy at being back and from the
unpleasant memories. ``I'd gone through so many tests, then a
nine-day waiting period to confirm the diagnosis. I was in la-la
land after I was told. I was sitting on the doctor's table and I
broke down in tears. My wife (Lori) broke down and my (two) kids
were in the room and they didn't understand what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds medical consultant Dr. Tim Kremchek implored
Belinda not to give up, not to quit the game and retreat to his
Huntingdon, Pa., home. Dr. Noseworthy told Kremchek, without naming
names, that there are 10 to 20 active professional athletes with MS
and many more have participated while carrying the incurable
disease.
</P>
<P>
   And Belinda has been helped by Copaxane, a new drug approved by
the Food and Drug Administration just last year that minimizes the
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in here to this clubhouse today is a big boost and a
jolt,'' Belinda said. ``It all came together for me. I did come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Belinda has been without symptoms for several months, which is
extremely encouraging, but May 15, 1998, is indelibly etched in his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've marked down the date . . . it hit me overnight like a
Mike Tyson punch to the head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His left leg had a tingling feeling. It went away for three or
four weeks, then the tingling was back in his leg, his foot, the
bottom of his foot and moved up to his back, stomach, neck and
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it went to my cheeks and the side of my head, I threw up
the red flag,'' he said. ``I was performing well, but I had to put
myself ahead of the team, which is something real hard for me, one
of the hardest things I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Belinda made five appearances over six innings in August
and hadn't given up a run. But he knew his body was shouting at him
that all systems were not go.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the crushing diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been a roller coaster ride,'' Belinda said.
``Some very low points. Everybody brings up the Francisco Cabrera
hit. That haunted me for years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series,
Belinda, then pitching for Pittsburgh, had a tie game on his hands
in the ninth inning in Atlanta. Pinch-hitter Cabrera scorched a hit
down the left field line and slow-footed Sid Bream slid across home
plate with the winning run, sending the Braves to the World Series,
the Pirates home and Belinda into Pittsburgh's Hall of Infamy. To
this day, heartless Pittsburgh fans boo whenever Belinda sticks his
head out of a dugout.
</P>
<P>
   And it bothered him. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``No hit can happen that hits you like this (MS),'' Belinda
said. ``In baseball, I knew I'd always get another chance. With
this you don't know. I thank God I'm sitting here, able to make
another run. In fact, it might make me a better player. I won't
worry what my stats are going to be at end of the year. This is not
an everyday task; this is an every-minute task and mentally, it
drains you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, though, if I give up a home run and lose a game, it won't
be the end of the world to me, like it used to be,'' he said.
``That's not what life is all about. Life is about trying your
best, giving it your all and being good and kind to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are giving him a chance to resume his career, but
Belinda can't deliver a prognosis on his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've asked a question I can't answer,'' he said. ``Every
case is different. It's one of those things where time will tell
everything. They gave me a good bill of health and I'll go day by
day, put it in the Lord's hands, put my life in God's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been throwing for five or six weeks, working out, running
2 miles every three or four days. The main thing is not to get
over-fatigued and to gradually build my body system up . . . and
just hope symptoms don't pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   Belinda self-injects the Copaxane once a day, even though a year
ago he would rather face Mark McGwire with a game on the line than
stare at the sharp end of a needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deathly afraid of needles,'' he said. ``That was a major
mental hurdle. I took at least an hour before I could do the first
one. By the fourth or fifth one, it became part of my life. It's
worth 15 minutes a day if it makes me feel better, and it does.
There are a lot of things I don't understand about this disease,
but I've come to grips with it. And I don't dwell on it. The more
you dwell on it mentally, the worse the symptoms get.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kremchek said symptoms may not show up again, ``for many,
many years. He may finish his career and his life symptom-free. We
know it is not hereditary or contagious and it is suspected to be
viral.''
</P>
<P>
   Belinda, of course, was frightened after the diagnosis. Calls in
late September from teammates and players on other teams comforted
him as he slowly pieced together his shattered mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to set up a game plan all winter, to work at it
mentally,'' he said. ``The mental part is the toughest thing.
Physically, I was able to deal my entire career with groin injuries
and other stuff because I knew they'd heal. This is different.''

 &HT;    Juices run dry when roast cooks too long
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's more than one secret to putting a tender, juicy pork
roast on the dinner table. Brining the roast before cooking is one.
The other one , and it is just as important, is this: Don't
overcook it.
</P>
<P>
   Disregard recipes that say to cook pork to 180 degrees or even
170 degrees. They're as out of date as lard.
</P>
<P>
   As Merle Ellis says in The Great American Meat Book, ``To cook
today's pork to those temperatures would be akin to cremation.''
Experts agree that the absolute maximum internal temperature is 160
degrees, and they recommend pulling the roast out of the oven at
150 to 155 degrees because the temperature will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you will see a faint blush. And that's OK. The bacteria
responsible for trichinosis are killed at 137 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the temperature is easiest with a roast. Use an
instant-read thermometer. Be sure to insert it at least two inches
into the roast. That's harder to do with chops, even thick ones,
though it can be done from the side. A better bet may be the old
checkpoint: Cut into the pork with a sharp knife to make sure the
chop is done but still retains that slight blush.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY, Calif. _ Enough
relatives came to celebrate young Alpha Nethaway's graduation rom
the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio that we arrived at
the base in a three-car caravan, with one more soon to follow. I
expected a ceremony that included precision marching past a high
grandstand on a huge parade ground, gleaming swords, colorful
pennants and flags and perhaps a military band, cannon salutes and
fly-over of military jets trailing red, white and blue smoke. My
military training was of a different era. It also was considerably
less subtle and cerebral. I also expected to see a graduation class
numbering in the hundreds, if not thousands. As it turned out, the
ceremony had no marching, swords, pennants, flags, music or cannon
fire. And there was no fly-over. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald)

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Tell me about your families,''
child therapist Karen McQueary tells her young clients at the
Artemis Center for Alternatives to Domestic Violence. They often
say, ``I don't want to,'' or ``Pass.'' ``It's too scary,'' they
explain. ``It makes me sad.'' Many of the children, too traumatized
to trust adults, initially reveal themselves only through their
artwork. For McQueary, a pad of paper and a pencil can be the
``Open Sesame'' to their souls. ``I feel glad and sad and
frightened,'' one 8-year-old captioned his drawing of a father and
a child crying purple tears. ``I feel upset that Dad had to go to
jale. I feel lonely.'' This child's-eye view of domestic violence
will be displayed Saturday night at Sinclair Community College at
the ninth annual Artemis gala as part of an exhibit,
``Expressions,'' featuring original artwork by Artemis clients,
children and adults. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY, Calif. _ Enough
relatives came to celebrate young Alpha Nethaway's graduation rom
the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio that we arrived at
the base in a three-car caravan, with one more soon to follow. I
expected a ceremony that included precision marching past a high
grandstand on a huge parade ground, gleaming swords, colorful
pennants and flags and perhaps a military band, cannon salutes and
fly-over of military jets trailing red, white and blue smoke. My
military training was of a different era. It also was considerably
less subtle and cerebral. I also expected to see a graduation class
numbering in the hundreds, if not thousands. As it turned out, the
ceremony had no marching, swords, pennants, flags, music or cannon
fire. And there was no fly-over. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald)

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Tell me about your families,''
child therapist Karen McQueary tells her young clients at the
Artemis Center for Alternatives to Domestic Violence. They often
say, ``I don't want to,'' or ``Pass.'' ``It's too scary,'' they
explain. ``It makes me sad.'' Many of the children, too traumatized
to trust adults, initially reveal themselves only through their
artwork. For McQueary, a pad of paper and a pencil can be the
``Open Sesame'' to their souls. ``I feel glad and sad and
frightened,'' one 8-year-old captioned his drawing of a father and
a child crying purple tears. ``I feel upset that Dad had to go to
jale. I feel lonely.'' This child's-eye view of domestic violence
will be displayed Saturday night at Sinclair Community College at
the ninth annual Artemis gala as part of an exhibit,
``Expressions,'' featuring original artwork by Artemis clients,
children and adults. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   FOOD-AFRICAN _ ``You can trace a whole history in a bean
fritter,'' said noted African food scholar Jessica Harris to a
handful of folks who'd gathered at the Shrine of the Black Madonna
on Abernathy Boulevard in late January. Harris described how the
bean fritter (akara) of Nigeria gave way to the black-eyed pea
fritter (acarage) in Brazil and then to the corn fritters of the
American south. That's the way it is with African food -- it
flavors so many different cuisines. And yet we tend to know so
little about it. We cooked and talked with Harris, author of The
Africa Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent, as well as some Atlantans
for a survey of African food, from orange radish salad of Morocco
to the sizzling sosaties of South Africa. (Walker, Atlanta

<P>
   1. RACHEL GRIFFITHS' VIRTUOSO SCREEN DUET Oscar-nominated
actress Rachel Griffiths shares on and off-screen experiences in
the making of the film about cellist Jacqueline du Pre, ``Hilary
and Jackie.'' By Louise Farr. From Women's Wear Daily. 800 words +
photo. 2. RETURN OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN Seven strapping young
males with guns in the Wild West? Sounds like a series with the
right demographic appeal. Based on the 1960 big-screen classic
starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, ``The Magnificent Seven''
TV series is an unapologetic throwback to the western shoot-'em-up
and has a devoted fan base. By Tamara Conniff. BPI. 700 words +
photo. 3. JULIA SWEENEY BATTLES CANCER WITH COMEDY Comedian Julia
Sweeney went from the top TV show ``Saturday Night Live'' to the
worst year of her life. Her brother became ill with cancer and
moved in with her. Her parents got worried and moved in too. Her
little house was soon full and her daily routine was derailed. And
that was just the beginning. For the icing on this horrible cake,
Sweeney herself contracted cancer. Like many artists she did the
only thing she could in the face of adversity and channeled it into
her work. She has turned her harrowing, real-life experiences into
an acclaimed one-woman stage show, ``God Said,Ha!'' And now she's
made a film version of it - a moving and funny look at what it's
like when everything goes wrong. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,200 words
+ photo. 4. IF ONLY WE COULD ALL BE 'FRIENDS' In many ways,
``Friends'' is like a fast-and-funny soap opera. All of the cast
are attractive, have interesting lives, great clothes and
apartments. In its sixth season, the slick formula still works and
has propelled the show to its highest ratings ever. This interview
with the cast shows how level-headed they are about their success.
By Andrew Ryan. From TV Guide Canada. 1,300 words + photo
____________________________________________________________ 5.
GENE WILDER RETURNS TO THE SMALL SCREEN Comic actor Gene Wilder may
be open, talkative and friendly, but he is a distinctly serious
man. That's understandable, since he has known his share of
unhappiness along with the laughter, most notably the 1989 death
from ovarian cancer of his wife, comedian Gilda Radner. ``My early
life was a combination of sadness and hilarity,'' the 63-year-old
Wilder says in this interview. ``My mother was so ill, I was told
not to ever argue with her, because it might kill her. But I was
told to make her laugh.'' Wilder will turn up as the Mock Turtle in
a three-hour-long movie of Lewis Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland.'' By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo. 6. MARK
WAHLBERG BIDS FOR ACTION STARDOM Alma Wahlberg wants to see less of
her son Mark. It was bad enough when he was modeling Calvin Klein
underwear, but in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997) he often wore nothing at
all. And for the past few months, the movie has been playing around
the clock on cable TV. In this interview Wahlberg talks about fame,
embarassing questions about his career, breaking the rules and his
stint in jail. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.
____________________________________________________________ 7.
BACK TO BASICS, VINCE GILL LOOKS FOR HIS COUNTRY ROOTS He may be a
poster boy for today's emerging traditional country music, but
don't say that to Vince Gill. The singer/songwriter, whose personal
artistic style has run from bluegrass to country/pop, looked back
to his country roots for his latest studio album, ``The Key,'' a
salute to the style of classic country. Gill insists that he
recorded this particular set of songs for himself, not intending to
lead any parade back to what he interprets country music to be.
Interview by Beth Torroll. 1,300 words + photo.

   SCHOOLS-RACE (San Francisco) _ Faced with the end of a
race-based admissions system, San Francisco Unified School District
may adopt a less controversial form of affirmative action:
preferences for kids who face personal and economic hardship. A
tentative settlement reached Tuesday would topple the school
district's 15-year-old race-conscious admissions policy. By JULIAN
GUTHRIE.

<P>
   JASPER-REBEL (Jasper, Texas) _ Call it the scout manual from
hell. When lawmen investigating the brutal dragging death of James
Byrd Jr. searched the apartment of murder defendant Bill King, they
found handwritten outlines, bylaws and recruiting letters for what
he called the Confederate Knights of America's Texas Rebel
Soldiers. By RICHARD STEWART.

   INDIAN-SITE (Rotterdam, N.Y.) _ A group of Native American in
upstate New York plan a gathering place for expatriates of various
Native American nations who, far from their reservations, have made

</P>
<P>
   Y2K-ELECTRICAL (Clifton Park, N.Y.) _ New York's power companies
say they expect few, if any, blackouts because of Y2K. But many New
Yorkers aren't buying it. They are, however, buying generators to
supply backup power in the event things don't work as well as
officials say. Sales of power generators and other equipment in New
York state are skyrocketing. By ALAN WECHSLER.
</P>
<P>
   SF-MAYOR (San Francisco) _ Clint Reilly, the former campaign
consultant-turned-businessman, plans to announce his candidacy for
the upcoming mayoral election. With his announcement, Reilly steps
out from behind the scenes where for years her served as a player
in San Francisco and state politics, running campaigns for other
people and causes. By RACHEL GORDON.

   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CAREERS (San Francisco) _ The man who built his career around
selling envelopes has come out with another mixed bag. Bestselling
author Harvey Mackay's latest motivational book, ``Pushing the
Envelope All the Way to the Top,'' doesn't fit neatly into any sort
of career category. He warns CEOs about why companies fail,
explains how he has attracted workers to his Mackay Envelope Corp.
in Minneapolis and describes the traits that help people rise to
the top. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-INVESTORS (San Francisco) _ Linda Pei, a San Francisco
banker, wanted to make a strong statement about male dominence in
the business world. So she and a former co-worker pooled $50,000
from friends in 1993 to start the Pro-Conscience Women's Equity
Mutual Fund, which invests in companies with pro-women policies.
Today, the fund manages $8.7 million in assets and holds stock in
50 large-cap companies. By EDWARD IWATA.

   LEVI'S-COMPETITION (San Francisco) _ Dickies. JNCO. Fubu. Pelle

 &HT;    Mini reviews of movies released on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Snake Eyes'' (R) _ The best thing you can say about this
movie? Well, at least Brian De Palma can only go up from here. In
his very unpredictable career _ from his early Hitchcock rip-offs
to slick Hollywood fare (``The Untouchables'') _ this would-be
thriller has to be his worst work yet. Nicolas Cage plays a crooked
cop at an Atlantic City prize fight _ during which, the secretary
of state is shot and killed. So it's up to Cage (and the
secretary's security chief) to find the killer among the tens of
thousands of ringside fans. You get what you expect from the
director: lots of look-at-me camera angles, tracking shots and
women in dumb wigs. What you don't get is a remotely plausible
story or an ounce of real suspense. It's like De Palma, ripping off
De Palma. Badly. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Governess'' (R) _ Where's Mary Poppins when you need
her? In the 1840s a young Jewish woman (Minnie Driver) poses as a
Christian to secure a job with a wealthy family on a remote
Scottish island and help her own debt-stricken family. The film
tries to deliver a treatise on religious bigotry plus a dollop of
feminism within the context of a fevered bodice-ripper. What
evolves is an overbusy movie with under-realized potential. Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Beyond Silence'' (PG-13) _ A film worth listening to.
Germany's Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film concerns a
musical prodigy who is also her hearing-impaired parents' crucial
link to the rest of the world. Sensitive and well-acted, the film
uses a specific situation to explore a universal one: how children
must learn to separate from their parents without cutting them off.
In German with subtitles. Grade: B +

 &HT;    Sibling witches find love casts a powerful spell
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Raised to adulthood by their witchy, spell-teaching aunts Jet
(Dianne Wiest) and Frances (Stockard Channing), flame-haired
Gillian (Nicole Kidman) moves away to live a poolside party life of
tequila and sexy-dangerous fellows, while quiet sis Sally (Sandra
Bullock) stays home. Sure she's a witch, but all Sally wants is
``normalcy.'' Which is hard to achieve, when every man who falls in
love with you is doomed, by an old family curse, to die.
</P>
<P>
   The movie may look like another lightweight romantic vehicle for
Bullock: a ``Hope Floats'' with brooms. Well, it is lightweight,
but the movie has a bite to it, throwing demon lovers and spiritual
possession into its mix. But director Griffin Dunne manages to keep
the blend coherent; his flick is a charming piffle that celebrates
the powers of love, and especially sisterhood.

 E-Mail's Security Called Shoddy  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of people who get free e-mail services from Yahoo,
Hotmail and Excite are subject to hacker attacks because their
privacy protections are so poor, a nationally known Internet
security expert said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Winkler, a former analyst for the National Security Agency,
said these accounts are easy to break into because they allow an
unlimited number of log-on attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody can try every possible password to get into the
system,'' said Winkler. ``They will get in eventually _ and you
will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers can create software programs that will automate password
selection, going through countless combinations of numbers and
letters until hitting on the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Other security experts confirmed Winkler's observation, saying
it is just one of the security weaknesses of the free e-mail
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, you should look a gift horse in the mouth,''
said Peter Neumann, an expert in computer security at SRI
International, a Menlo Park research firm. Companies that offer
free services, don't spend a lot of time worrying about security,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some paid e-mail services, including America Online, and most
corporate networks will lock out users after a certain number of
failed log-on attempts. In such cases, the user is often e-mailed
about the failed log-in trys and told to contact system
administrators who verify the user's identity, Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hotmail, recently acquired by Microsoft, and Excite issued
statements yesterday saying they offer protections for e-mail
customers.
</P>
<P>
   MSN Hotmail has ``no knowledge of any Hotmail accounts ever
being compromised'' because of unlimited log-in attempts, said
product manager Laura Norman. Hotmail ``has plans in place to
implement a solution'' to address the problem, Norman said, but she
could not provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Excite said it gives users the ability ``to protect their e-mail
accounts with longer passwords than other free e-mail services.
Accounts protected with long passwords can be more difficult to
hack as they are more difficult to decipher.'' The Redwood Shores
Internet company did not directly address the log-on issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, now a private Internet security consultant in Maryland,
disclosed his security concerns in a column yesterday on ZDTV's Web
site (www.zdnet.com/zdtv). He said he was working on a column about
free e-mail when the question of password security came up. Just to
experiment, he tried to break in and found it surprisingly simple
to randomly find a user's password.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be so easy, security experts said. First, the
services should require users to choose a strong password _ one
that is seven characters or more and is a combination of letters
(uppercase and lowercase) and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The services also should not allow an unlimited number of log-on
attempts, and they should notify users if someone has been trying
to get into their account, Winkler said. Although Yahoo asks users
if they need help after three failed log-ins, it does not prevent
them from trying again and again.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail users can take some preventive measures, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't pick anything that is too simple or too easily
identified with you,'' said Peter Shipley, who gained notoriety _
not to mention the nickname ``Evil Pete'' _ by hacking into
computer systems at the University of California at Berkeley in the
1980s. He is now a computer-security consultant for KPMG in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Other advice: Use a different password for each e-mail account
or, if that's too difficult, a different password for different
types of accounts: one for work and one for home, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best password may be vulnerable, he said, because
Excite, Yahoo and the other Internet companies send password and
user ID information as plain text that is not encrypted. In these
cases, sophisticated computer users can use software programs known
as ``sniffers'' to grab your data as it travels over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: be careful what you say in e-mail, Shipley
said. ``E-mail sent over the Internet should be treated as if it
were a postcard _ and not necessarily private.''

PRICE-BUSTING PCS BRING COMPUTERS TO THE MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by all the attention it has garnered, Apple Computer
Inc.'s sleek, colorful iMac might seem to be the most significant
high-tech hit of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Another computer, introduced late last year
with almost no fanfare, is selling almost as quickly as the iMac
and may wind up playing a bigger role in the history of computing.
</P>
<P>
   It's called an eMachine. It's everything the iMac isn't:
bland-looking, technically unsophisticated, and cheap. Very cheap.
Some models cost just $500, including monitor. That's half the
price of the least expensive iMac.
</P>
<P>
   And that has made all the difference. Solely on the strength of
Sunday newspaper circulars and word of mouth, eMachine has become
one of the nation's best-selling computer brands, and a harbinger
of an era when personal computers will be as cheap and commonplace
as television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the beginning of what I'll call a structural
change in what PCs cost,'' said Stephen Dukker, chief executive of
eMachines Inc., the US-based, Korean-owned company that makes the
computer. ``There's a whole area of $800 to $1,500 machines that
are going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic cut in the cost of a computer could finally transform
the PC from a luxury into just another home appliance, making it
affordable to nearly everyone. That was Microsoft Corp.'s goal when
it bought WebTV, a company that makes a $300 box that pumps the
Internet into a TV set. Oracle Corp. also took a swing with its
Network Computer for the home. Neither product is a full-fledged
personal computer, and neither has been embraced by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But prices of computer parts such as processors, hard drives,
and memory chips have plunged in recent years, even as these
components become much more powerful. As a result, it is now
possible to make a true personal computer that is about as cheap as
a WebTV unit, but powerful enough to meet the needs of the average
user.
</P>
<P>
   That's eMachine's market, and by going after it, Dukker thinks
his company is helping to slice the computer industry into two
sharply defined segments: costly high-performance machines and
mass-market models.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-market PCs could also change the face of the Internet,
allowing users with lower incomes to join the mostly affluent
denizens of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Industry giants such as IBM Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., and
Dell Computer Corp. have long competed on price. But all have
costly sales and distribution channels to support, so they don't
want prices to fall too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have offered PCs at similar prices as promotional
gimmicks. IBM had a $599 computer available in limited quantities
last Christmas. Other firms, such as PrecisionTec LLC of Costa
Mesa, Calif., offer ultracheap machines by mail order. But
eMachines' sole focus is the low-end market, and it has succeeded
in getting shelf space in many of the nation's leading electronics
retailers, including Circuit City and Best Buy. America Online, the
world's largest on-line computer network with 15 million members,
also features eMachines in its computer retailing forum.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes eMachines was founded just five months
ago and expects to turn a profit this quarter. It hopes to sell as
many as 2 million computers this year and rake in $1 billion, which
would make it one of the fastest-growing companies in history.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with a long distance phone call. Dukker, a former
executive at retailer CompUSA, had moved to a rival firm, Computer
City. In June, when CompUSA announced it would purchase Computer
City for $275 million, Dukker's career prospects seemed dim.
Apparently the same thought occurred to Jung Koh, chief executive
of Korea Data Systems, a leading maker of computer monitors and an
old friend.
</P>
<P>
   Koh phoned Dukker and asked if he was interested in a possible
business venture. Why not? Dukker figured. ``I went off to Korea
and had some discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukker served up an idea that had come to him a few months
earlier as the result of an experiment at Computer City. The
company ran a sale of ultracheap personal computers at $599 each,
for a limited time. Dukker wasn't surprised that the computers sold
quickly. But something else happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of these buyers was very different,'' he
recalled. When Computer City sold a typical $2,000 computer, 10
percent to 12 percent of the customers brought them back. But the
return rate on the cheap machines was much lower, 4 percent to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal reason for the lower return rate,'' Dukker said,
``was the customer could afford the purchase.'' Time and again,
customers who had spent two grand would return a machine when they
saw it down the street for $100 less. Some would exchange an
expensive machine the week after they bought it, because an even
faster one was now available.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyers of cheap machines tended to be satisfied with
what they had. They didn't expect state-of-the-art performance, and
they knew they had a good price. So they kept the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole behavior toward the machine became a whole lot more
like an appliance,'' said Dukker.
</P>
<P>
   That gave him an idea, one which Koh quickly embraced. Dukker
and Koh began discussions with TriGem, a Korean maker of computers
and computer parts, and drew up a business plan. Dukker believed
that if they could make the machines both cheap and reliable, the
low return rate would ensure a slim but acceptable profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporated in the United States, eMachines started business on
Sept. 1. By October, the company had begun making 150,000 computers
at a TriGem plant in Korea, with monitors supplied by KDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dukker worked his retail-industry contacts and persuaded the
Best Buy, Office Depot, Fry's, and MicroCenter chains to carry the
computers, but he was terrified. ``I was waking up in a sweat and
saying, `Oh, my God, I've got to sell 150,000 computers in the next
two months.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. By year's end, consumers had purchased
180,000 of them. This quarter, eMachines aims to sell 300,000 more.
Market research firm Ziff Davis Infobeads of La Jolla, Calif.,
found that eMachine was the sixth-best-selling computer brand at US
retail stores in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing it with price,'' said Infobeads analyst Matt
Sargent. While ``eMachine's average price for the month of December
was just over $400 . . .the average price for the market was over
$1,000,'' Sargent said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers love the low price of the eMachines, but retailers
also love them because they sell so fast, Sargent said. PCs have
almost as short a shelf life as hamburger, and dealers lose money
unless they can move the merchandise quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cheap is not enough. The eMachines have to work, and
work they do. They're far from state-of-the-art machines, but the
various models contain reliable low-end processors from National
Semiconductor Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., as well as
Intel Corp.'s cut-rate Celeron chips. A built-in graphics chip
comes from ATI Technology Inc., one of the industry leaders, and
hard drives are supplied by Seagate Technology Inc. and Korea's
Samsung Electronics Co.
</P>
<P>
   The eMachines haven't been on the market long enough to assess
their long-term reliability. But some early customers say they're
delighted with their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I buy another one? You bet!'' said Ruth Sams, a senior
programmer at Florida State University. Sams beefed up the memory
of her eMachine to 96 megabytes from the standard 32 megabytes and
put in a better graphics card, but figures she still saved money on
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Her eMachine will soon be obsolete, but so what? ``For $499,
I'll just keep upgrading every year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Freeman, an IBM employee in Longmont, Colo., picked an
eMachine when he needed a second computer at home. ``No system that
IBM offers can touch the price,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these computer-savvy buyers aren't the only customers.
Dukker says that 56 percent of eMachine buyers have never before
owned a computer, and 35 percent of them have household incomes
below $30,000. In his view, the eMachine is tapping a whole new
market, made up of people who could never before afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is convinced there's a future in supercheap
machines. Brian Connors, IBM's general manager of consumer systems,
said his company would continue to stress overall product value,
rather than just a low sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that eMachines isn't even a year old yet. ``What
happens if eMachines goes away a month from now, two months from
now, a year from now? With IBM, you know we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM made the same argument in the 1980s when an unknown startup
called Compaq began offering knockoffs of IBM's then-dominant
desktop machines. Soon hundreds of other firms leaped into the
market for ``cloned'' PCs, savaging IBM's profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks eMachines alone will have a vast impact on the
market. But if the company can sell $500 computers at a profit,
others will certainly follow. And that would permanently reshape
the computer industry, whether the big boys like it or not.

   Less than three weeks ago, a team of adventurers reached the
South Pole after an overland trek by a new route _ and promptly
pulled out something that looked like an ordinary cell phone to
receive their congratulatory calls, by way of a satellite link.
</P>
<P>
   Such instant communication is a far cry from 1912, when Robert
Scott's team made it to the pole only to find that a rival team led
by Roald Amundsen had already reached it five weeks earlier. If
they had only known that their quest to be first to the pole was
already lost, they might have turned back and been spared their
tragic end out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's getting to the point where it will be difficult to
be out of touch with the outside world, no matter where you are . .
. unless, of course, you choose to be.
</P>
<P>
   First came portable global positioning system or GPS devices
that could tell you exactly where you were; now, with the launch of
a satellite-based cellularlike phone service last November, there's
virtually no place left on Earth, even the poles, where you can't
just call someone instantly, using a pocket-sized phone.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and currently only, of these ``anywhere, anytime''
phone services to reach the market is called Iridium, a
66-satellite system owned by Motorola, Sprint, and other investors.
But Iridium won't be alone for long. At least two other companies
are about to introduce similar services, and others say they may
enter the competition before long.
</P>
<P>
   Why are companies lining up to invest the billions of dollars it
takes to start launching the required ``constellations'' of dozens
of satellites and the related ground equipment needed to create a
full-service satellite system?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our studies show there are 20 to 30 million potential
subscribers to this kind of service worldwide,'' says John
Cunningham, a spokesman for Globalstar, a satellite-based system
that expects to begin offering service by the end of this year.
Even if all the companies that have announced plans to enter this
market really did so, he said, ``we think there is much more
demand'' than they could meet.
</P>
<P>
   The basic principle is simple. Most of today's communications
satellites are in an orbit 22,300 miles up, where they appear
stationary over a point on the Earth and can be reached by antennas
over a large portion of the planet but require lots of power to
beam their signals back to the ground. Wireless phones, by
contrast, rely on thousands of local antennas that can only reach a
few hundred yards. The Continued on next page &QL; 
new systems use satellites in much lower orbits, such as
Globastar's 900-mile altitude. At that height, they are within
reach of small, cellularlike phones. (Most companies provide phones
that can also work with ground-based wireless systems as well.)
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for having the satellites in orbits within reach of
small antennas is that they cannot stay put over a given spot on
the ground. Instead, they go whizzing by, propelled by inviolable
laws of physics. That means that in order for every place on Earth
always to be within view of at least one satellite, there have to
be a lot of satellites up there. Globalstar will use 64 satellites,
Iridium has 66 (reduced from the originally planned 77 that caused
the system to be named after element number 77), and another
competitor called ICO, which plans service by late next year, will
use 10 satellites in a somewhat higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for consumers is steep, at least so far; but then,
so was the price of the first generation of cellular phones.
Competition in the market is likely to drive prices down fast, just
as wireless phones have now become so inexpensive that they can
sometimes compete with regular wired phone service. But for the
moment, making a call on the Iridium system will require users to
plunk down about $3,000 for a phone, and then pay as much as $7 a
minute (depending on your location) for calls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're planning to hike up Mount Everest, take a trek
across Antarctica or the Sahara, or sail singlehandedly around the
world, that may seem like a small price to pay for instant contact
_ something past generations of explorers never even imagined.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the prices should come down substantially. ICO
says its handsets will sell for less than $1,000, but will not
quote a figure for its per-minute rate. Globalstar's Cunningham
says he can't predict the retail price of their phones, since his
company will sell them only to local service providers, not
directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the service itself, he says, will be close to the
roaming rates charged by many wireless systems: perhaps around
$1.50 a minute on average around the world. (Iridium says that in
some locations, its present service price is also in that range).
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, the price just won't matter. Take the group
that made the recent trek to the South Pole. Led by Peter Hillary,
son of Sir Edmund Hillary of Everest fame (who, in 1957, had also
reached the pole), the expedition was caught in blizzards along the
way that kept them tent-bound for days. When one member suffered
frostbite, he was able to get crucial medical advice by phone from
doctors back home.
</P>
<P>
   And when they finally got to the pole, the team almost
immediately received calls with messages from Australia's prime
minister and Queen Elizabeth II.

THEY'RE WATCHING YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, you're not being paranoid. You are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Everytime you log onto the Internet, you're probably helping to
build a dossier on yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated shopping sites on the Web keep track of
everything you buy, and analyze the information in an effort to
sell you still more goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites entice you with come-ons like free electronic mail
accounts, in exchange for personal information like your name and
telephone number. Still other sites don't ask you for anything, but
simply keep track of your electronic wanderings, using the in
</P>
<P>
   formation to create a personal profile that is a marketer's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Scary? Some people think so.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by Business Week magazine found that more
than three-quarters of those who shop on the Internet say they
would buy even more if there were better privacy safeguards. And
among those who didn't shop on line, privacy fears were the chief
reason they stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The popular computer network America Online created a national
furor last year when it released information about one of its
customers to the US Navy. Timothy McVeigh had posted, anonymously,
information on line that suggested he was gay. The Navy persuaded
AOL to violate its own privacy policy and reveal McVeigh's
identity, whereupon he was discharged from the service.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh was subsequently reinstated after a federal court
challenge, but the incident served as a startling illustration of
how much personal information is available on line.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of information can Web-based businesses collect and
how do they do it? The simplest method, and perhaps the most
misunderstood, is the ``cookie.'' A cookie is a small chunk of data
that is sent by a Web site to a visitor's computer. The cookie can
be used to store data that the visitor will need whenever he
returns to the site. For example, a visitor to the New York Times
Web site must get a password to sign in. But if he agrees, he can
also get a cookie that will ``remember'' his password. The next
time he visits the site, the Times computer will check his browser.
If the cookie is there, the visitor is instantly logged in, without
having to retype the password.
</P>
<P>
   Internet advertisers love cookies, because they make it possible
to control exactly which ads are displayed on a person's computer.
This is the business of companies like New York-based DoubleClick,
which attaches cookies to ads in order to create profiles of
millions of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Many commercial Web sites feature banner
ads linked to the DoubleClick network. When someone visits one of
these sites, his or her computer gets a cookie that notes the
particular ad being displayed. The cookie continues to track the
user, noting every visit to a site featuring DoubleClick ads. The
cookie tracks which ads the user clicks on for more information,
and which ads he or she ignores.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, DoubleClick builds up a profile of the Web
surfer, which can be used to send ads specifically tailored to his
or her tastes. As a result, two different people visiting the same
Web page may see entirely different ads, depending on the content
of their DoubleClick cookies.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it might sound like Web users are being followed by
some virtual detective, but DoubleClick general manager Christopher
Saridakis says that cookies are not an invasion of privacy. ``It
really doesn't contain any information about the individual,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick doesn't know who you are or where you live. It just
knows that somewhere out there, Person X, likes football,Continued
on next page &QL; 
hates basketball and is interested in sport-utility vehicles.
Besides, DoubleClick allows consumers who don't want to be tracked
to opt out of the system. On request, they'll send out a cookie
that blocks all other DoubleClick cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cookies pose little threat to your privacy. A cookie
can only be read by the Web site that installed it. Even if you
visit a fly-by-night Web site run by hostile hackers, they can't
learn anything about you by accessing your cookies. Indeed, most
cookies only contain a set of numbers that will be meaningless to
any other computer but the one that created the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those who insist on avoiding them, most standard Web
browsers can be set to warn the user of incoming cookies so that
the user can opt to refuse them. Unfortunately, so many sites
install cookies that users will be bombarded with dozens of cookie
requests. To avoid this, some people use software tools with names
like InterMute and Internet Junkbuster that allow consumers to
block out nearly all cookies.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a price to pay for life without cookies _ some Web
sites won't let you in without one.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a
newsletter based in Washington, D.C., refuses all cookies as a
matter of principle. ``I don't see any benefit to me in allowing
them to place a cookie,'' he says. ``The benefit's all to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks acknowledges he's never heard of anyone suffering a
loss of privacy because of cookies, but he fears that could change
if companies find ways to link your cookie to a file of personal
information about you.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happening at hundreds of Web sites, where consumers
provide detailed personal information. Such information can be
combined with cookies to create a personalized customer profile _
or to reveal sensitive information to complete strangers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some advantages to personalization, however. An
example of it at its best can be found at eToys, a popular toy
retailing site. Toy shoppers can create a personal account at the
site that will keep a permanent record of everything they have ever
purchased there. The site also allows them to create a wish list of
toys they might want to buy in the future. It even has a calendar
that can send e-mail reminders of a child's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like the popular bookseller Amazon.com, take
personalization even further. The Amazon site analyzes the books a
customer buys, and directs the customer to other titles that might
also be of interest. ``Their business model is based on getting
very detailed information on their customers and what they do,''
says Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what scares him.
</P>
<P>
   eToys vows never to sell the information it collects about its
customers. Amazon reserves the right to do so, but will keep
customer data private if the customer submits a request via e-mail.
But many other Web retailers make no such pledges. Under existing
law, they're free to sell any information about you, to anyone
willing to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the many Web sites that don't sell anything,
but still collect lots of personal data on visitors. Many sites
offer free Web pages and free e-mail service. But these services
aren't really free. They're provided in exchange for personal
information that can be used to build up a database of potential
customers. And consumers have no control over what happens to this
data.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most aggressive effort yet to compile information on
computer users was announced on Feb. 8. A California firm called
Free-PC.com is giving away computer systems to the first 10,000
customers who sign up for the company's free Internet access
service.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. Customers must provide lots of personal
information _ name, address, age, marital status and so on. This
information will be used to beam carefully targeted advertisements
to each Free-PC.com user. In addition, the Free-PC.com system
tracks every site the user visits, adding this data to the person's
marketing profile. Users who frequently visit personal-finance
sites might see frequent ads for mutual funds or banks.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC officials say they'll sell their data collection to
other companies, but will not include information that can be used
to identify individuals, like names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken last year by the Federal Trade Commission found
that only 14 percent of the 1,400 commercial Web sites surveyed
even had an official privacy policy to inform consumers about how
their personal data would be used. The Clinton administration has
warned Web-based businesses that unless they move aggressively to
provide better privacy guarantees, new federal laws are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws may be inevitable because of events overseas. The 15
nations of the European Union have imposed very strict privacy
regulations on firms doing business inside its borders. For
instance, a European firm can't sell personal information about
customers to a third party without getting explicit permission from
the customer. Now the EU is threatening to limit the ability of
American companies, including Internet companies, to do business in
Europe unless the United States adopts equally tough privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are scrambling to stave off regulation by
adopting voluntary privacy guarantees. TRUSTe, a nonprofit
organization in Palo Alto, Calif., certifies companies that pledge
to protect the privacy of Internet visitors. As of December 1997,
only 42 firms had signed up for TRUSTe certification. After
warnings from the federal government, the number jumped tenfold
last year, to 427 firms.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scott, TRUSTe's executive director, says that reputable
Web sites are becoming much less willing to share information about
their customers. ``I think that the sites that are serious about
this have realized, hey, this is something we can't be cavalier
about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe doesn't forbid members from sharing the information they
collect. Instead, the organization requires that certified
companies clearly inform visitors about how the firm will use any
information it collects. The idea is not to limit companies' use of
data, but to provide information so that consumers can make
informed decisions about whether to provide data.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a voluntary program like TRUSTe will
satisfy the concerns of European regulators, who favor rigid legal
protections of consumer privacy. Besides, in the case of Timothy
McVeigh, AOL violated its own rules about releasing personal
information. Some privacy advocates think that only federal laws
will prevent such lapses.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott is convinced that as consumers become better informed,
businesses will have all the incentive they need to improve their
protection of personal data. ``If you're going to violate the trust
of your consumers,'' Scott says, ``I don't think you're going to be
in business a very long time.''

`HOMICIDE' WEB SITE LINKS FANS TO CYBER PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's late, round midnight. You're scrolling through your
favorite news group, alt.newageritual, and you notice a posting
inviting you to an on-line spiritual revival. You click over to the
Webcast and witness what appears to be a human sacrifice: Right
there on your computer screen, a woman is bound, gagged, and
stabbed by some virtual shaman. What to do? Call the police? E-mail
your service provider? Run anti-voodoo software?
</P>
<P>
   We've seen a baby born on the Internet, witnessed open-heart
surgery, and, gasp, seen Victoria's Secret models walk the runway
in their scanties. Now ``Homicide,'' the NBC police drama set in
the streets of Baltimore, is introducing a serial cyber killer.
It's something of a first in entertainment: Tonight's episode has
been preceded with an on-line counterpart on the Web site,
homicide.com. Earlier this week, the site laid out the plot as part
of its innovative ``Second Shift'' series, an on-line drama
featuring the officers who work at the homicide unit when the
television cops are off duty. On the Web, the ``murder'' appears to
be virtual performance art, as if shock artist Chris Burden
performed his mutilation antics on line.
</P>
<P>
   But in this television episode, it turns out that the murder is,
in fact, real. There is what one detective calls a ``temporal
being'' _ that is, a dead body. When one voyeuristic witness finds
out that it wasn't a hoax, he stammers, ``Oh man, oh man, that's so
. . .'' _ a long pause _ ``it's so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Homicide'' folks are on their way to a skillful merger of
the two media. The prelude on the Web serves as a sly appetizer,
with a few neat tricks that draw you into the story and leave you
hungry for more. The payoff comes in the television episode, where
the images from the Web site become clues to solving the murder.
The criminal is a hacker in more ways than one, spoofing the
investigators with fake e-mail addresses and other cyber-jinks.
Some of the detectives are savvy to cyberspace (Bayliss has his own
home page, but Giardello can't even use a calculator). As the
suspense grows, they learn to navigate what one character refers to
as the realm of the ``Internuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-boiled detectives become hard-wired, and that's a good
thing. It's also exactly the kind of merger that executives in both
the television and Internet industries have been scrambling to
achieve. In Net speak, they call it convergence. Plenty of TV shows
have complementary Web sites, but for the most part, they're
digital fan clubs where folks can buy T-shirts and read bios of the
stars. ``Homicide'' goes a step further. ``I'd like the viewer at
home to see that NBC shows do not just begin and end with the
television tube,'' says Tom Hjelm, director of interactive
programming and executive producer for NBC Digital Productions.
``In the early days, we were seen as a pretty alien bunch,'' he
adds, referring to the on-line group. ``But now I'd like to see an
interactive writer or producer sitting down at the table when the
shows are conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, limits to convergence. ``It's hard to do a
chase scene on line,'' says Ayelet Sela, ``Second Shift'' writer
and producer. ``But you can break down the fourth wall on line,
which you can't do on television.'' In past ``Second Shift''
stories, users could read the detectives' notes, search for clues,
play desktop sleuth.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Homicide'' has a loyal _ perhaps even obsessive _ fan
base, and viewers don't necessarily need streaming audio and video
as an incentive to watch the show. So what's the value for the
viewer? It makes the experience more immediate, giving you the
feeling that you have inside information before the show starts.
Interactive theater productions like ``Nicholas Nickleby'' were the
rage back in the '80s, precisely because they made audience members
feel as if they mattered. And early users of the Internet (back in
the days when you had to type in commands on a phosphorescent
screen) remember feeling as if they were members of a secret club
every time they logged on. It gives everyday Judys and Joes the
sense that they're a part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the networks? Why is convergence the Next Big
Thing? ``I would like to see us continue to build a business around
this,'' says Hjelm. ``Second Shift,'' after all, has a corporate
sponsor. Take a guess who it is. Think hard. Consider: You have to
use the Windows Media Player to access the video version on line,
and Macintosh users can only view a text version of the ``Second
Shift'' script.
</P>
<P>
   Did I hear you say Microsoft? You're a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence, as the witness said, is cool _ unless you're one of
those stubborn folks who continue to polish their Apple at home. Oh
well. The television episode was designed to stand on its own, but
the on-line segment certainly enhances the plot and it wraps up on
line next week. Will they do it again?
</P>
<P>
   Probably, says ``Homicide'' coproducer Sara Charno, adding,
``When eight-track tapes came out, everyone thought that was the
wave of the future. No matter what the medium, whether it's a movie
or television or the Internet, it's still about telling a story.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Ah, the wave of the future. Remember time capsules, those
quaint collections of memorabilia folks would bury in the ground to
be uncovered in the next millennium? Well, the folks at MIT's Sloan
School of Management have created a time capsule of their own,
which they say they are ``sealing in the cornerstone'' of the
school's updated Web site. (It's actually an icon on the site, and
the information is stored in the server.) The goal is to capture a
digital snapshot of the Internet as it exists today and have a few
laughs (and gasps) five years from now when the capsule is
reopened. The capsule covers a broad sociopolitical range, with Web
sites about e-commerce and merger mania, the impeachment
proceedings and anti-pornography campaigns, women's empowerment and
Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has also solicited predictions from folks like UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Governor Paul Cellucci (who makes obligatory
comments about education). For the rest of the year, browsers can
add their own prophecies to the capsule, which is at
mitsloan.mit.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions by the likes of Martha Stewart and Bill Gates will
not be divulged until 2004, when the capsule is opened, and we're
holding our breath to learn what they have to say about wallpaper
and world dominance.

base, and viewers don't necessarily need streaming audio and video
as an incentive to watch the show. So what's the value for the
viewer? It makes the experience more immediate, giving you the
feeling that you have inside information before the show starts.
Interactive theater productions like ``Nicholas Nickleby'' were the
rage back in the '80s, precisely because they made audience members
feel as if they mattered. And early users of the Internet (back in
the days when you had to type in commands on a phosphorescent
screen) remember feeling as if they were members of a secret club
every time they logged on. It gives everyday Judys and Joes the
sense that they're a part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the networks? Why is convergence the Next Big
Thing? ``I would like to see us continue to build a business around
this,'' says Hjelm. ``Second Shift,'' after all, has a corporate
sponsor. Take a guess who it is. Think hard. Consider: You have to
use the Windows Media Player to access the video version on line,
and Macintosh users can only view a text version of the ``Second
Shift'' script.
</P>
<P>
   Did I hear you say Microsoft? You're a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence, as the witness said, is cool _ unless you're one of
those stubborn folks who continue to polish their Apple at home. Oh
well. The television episode was designed to stand on its own, but
the on-line segment certainly enhances the plot and it wraps up on
line next week. Will they do it again?
</P>
<P>
   Probably, says ``Homicide'' coproducer Sara Charno, adding,
``When eight-track tapes came out, everyone thought that was the
wave of the future. No matter what the medium, whether it's a movie
or television or the Internet, it's still about telling a story.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Ah, the wave of the future. Remember time capsules, those
quaint collections of memorabilia folks would bury in the ground to
be uncovered in the next millennium? Well, the folks at MIT's Sloan
School of Management have created a time capsule of their own,
which they say they are ``sealing in the cornerstone'' of the
school's updated Web site. (It's actually an icon on the site, and
the information is stored in the server.) The goal is to capture a
digital snapshot of the Internet as it exists today and have a few
laughs (and gasps) five years from now when the capsule is
reopened. The capsule covers a broad sociopolitical range, with Web
sites about e-commerce and merger mania, the impeachment
proceedings and anti-pornography campaigns, women's empowerment and
Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has also solicited predictions from folks like UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Governor Paul Cellucci (who makes obligatory
comments about education). For the rest of the year, browsers can
add their own prophecies to the capsule, which is at
mitsloan.mit.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions by the likes of Martha Stewart and Bill Gates will
not be divulged until 2004, when the capsule is opened, and we're
holding our breath to learn what they have to say about wallpaper
and world dominance.

ONE FOR THE MONEY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I see a new computer, I reach for my screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   I want to know what's inside _ the parts that were bolted
together to produce the PC. Nowadays anybody with a tool kit can
assemble computers and sell them for a few hundred bucks. Some of
these so-called ``white-box'' computers are as good as anything
from Compaq or IBM. Others are tinny junk.
</P>
<P>
   How do you tell? Well, here's what to look for. And yes, you can
check without unscrewing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the processor at the heart of it all. There are a
raft of good cheap processor chips on the market, with only a few
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of Intel Corp.'s low-cost Celeron
processors was notoriously slow. But I got decent performance from
SimCity 3000, a game with demanding three-dimensional graphics, on
a $500 eMachine computer with the new Celeron chip running at 333
megahertz (megahertz is a measure of a computer chip's operating
speed). Indeed, according to industry benchmarks, the latest
Celerons may be too good; they rate nearly as high as Intel's
Pentium II flagship line. So skip older Celeron-based machines and
take a look at the 333.
</P>
<P>
   Some other cheap PCs rely on a processor called the MediaGX from
Cyrix, a division of National Semiconductor Corp. This was the same
type of chip found in last year's breakthrough sub-$1,000 computer
from industry leader Compaq Computer Corp., and Packard Bell NEC
still offers some MediaGX machines. But it's definitely last year's
technology.
</P>
<P>
   From a gearhead's perspective, the MediaGX is quite advanced.
Most computers use separate chips to process sound and video, while
the main processor does the rest. MediaGX puts all this stuff on
one chip, thus saving money for the computer maker. But MediaGX
machines deliver sluggish performance, and traditional systems are
now so cheap that there's no need to make this compromise. Avoid
the MediaGX boxes and look for cheap machines that use the Cyrix M
II, AMD K6-2, or Intel Celeron.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to the computer's graphics subsystem, the part
that draws pretty pictures on the screen. A good graphics
accelerator with lots of memory will actually make your computer
work faster, and make graphic images look good. Companies like ATI,
Diamond, and Matrox make good-quality graphics processors. You also
want at least 4 megabytes of memory assigned exclusively to the
graphics chip.
</P>
<P>
   No self-respecting computer comes without a modem. Insist on
getting a V.90 modem, capable of downloading data at up to 56,000
bits per second. Don't settle for one of the slower V.34 modems.
</P>
<P>
   The modems inside many cheap computers aren't full-fledged
modems at all. Regular modems are really small computers in their
own right. Cheap machines usually use a stripped-down device called
an HSP modem or Winmodem, which depends on the main processor chip
to work. These modems slightly reduce your computer's processing
speed, and they only work with Microsoft's Windows operating
system. Don't buy one for use with an alternative operating system
like Linux. Still, for day-to-day Web surfing, HSP modems work
fine. They're a safe way to save a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I also count card slots, those empty spaces in the computer's
motherboard where you can plug in useful accessories. Say you're
getting a second machine for the home. You might want to fill one
of your motherboard slots with a $40 Ethernet card. Then you can
link the two machines in a local area network, and share a single
printer between them. You also need an Ethernet card to get cable
modem service for high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Just about all PCs have extra card slots. I'd insist on at least
two. Slots come in two types, called PCI and ISA, and most
motherboards will have both. But most accessory cards are PCI these
days, so try to get at least one empty PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this checklist the usual no-brainers. Of course you look
for a multigigabyte hard drive _ the bigger the better. The cheap
boxes all come with 32 megabytes of memory, but that's a bare
minimum; spend more for 64. And if you must run Windows, run
Windows 98; some cheap machines still offer Windows 95. But Windows
98 lets you use the new Universal Serial Bus devices, like printers
and scanners, that work as soon as you plug them in. Of course,
this assumes that you buy a computer with USB connectors. You'd
better.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, this wish list would have run you well over $1,000.
Today you can hit the spot for $500 to $600, and have money left
over for a screwdriver.

COMPUTERS HELP TEACHERS KEEP IN TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BETH DALEY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's one of the mantras of education reform in
Massachusetts: better communication among parents, teachers, and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been constant complaints that teachers have no
phones and parents have little time to converse during school
hours. And while teachers want to share lesson plans, they say it
is difficult to communicate with peers from isolated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that poured into schools during the last several years
were intended to help students learn. While a debate still reigns
over whether that is really working, the machines are now giving
teachers powerful access to parents, students, and each other
through an Internet provider designed only for Massachusetts
educators.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 21,000 teachers have signed up for the $25-a-year
MassEd.Net service, which gives them an e-mail account, personal
Web space and unlimited access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to reach teachers in the classroom,'' says Ed Biggs,
a fifth-grade teacher at the Batchelder School in North Reading. He
says parents now contact him through the service to discuss their
children's progress. He shares ideas, lesson plans, and suggestions
with other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to drop a short message than to get in touch
with a teacher,'' by phone or other means, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main components of the education reform effort _
getting teachers out of classrooms to share ideas _ has been one of
the largest stumbling blocks. Meanwhile, getting parents more
interested in their children's achievement also has been slow as
teachers have trouble getting in touch with parents during the work
day.
</P>
<P>
   MassEd.Net, which was started last year, is the first program of
its kind in the nation and gives teachers 24-hour free technical
support. The $25 annual fee compares to about $240 for the rest of
the public.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 80,000 educators in the state who are eligible
for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a teacher has a whole new curriculum and is teaching
ancient civilization and starting on ancient Egypt,'' says Greg
Nadeau, chief technology officer for the state Department of
Education. ``There are probably a handful of people in
Massachusetts who are trying to start the same unit but the teacher
will never meet them. Now she can send an e-mail to teachers in
certain schools. It transforms the way teachers communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Chuckran, an advanced biology teacher and head of
science for the Bridgewater-Raynham Regional School District, the
system has helped him help students. This quarter, students are
writing about organ harvesting and they must cite at least five
Internet sources. Once students complete the paper they have the
option of sending it to him via e-mail, which gives them an
automatic two-day extension. Students who don't have computers at
home can use school or library computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all choose the e-mail option,'' says Chuckran. ``If they
have any problems as they are working on their papers they e-mail
me and I help them along and answer their quesitons. It's been a
fantastic way of working and interacting with students.'' In
addition, last month, Gov. Paul Cellucci announced a program that
will allow teachers to take college and professional development
courses on-line.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, a grant will pay outstanding teachers
to post up to 1,000 lesson plans on a Web database that other
teachers can access. Eventually, teachers will be able to choose
lesson plans from other teachers. What's more, Nadeau says, they
will be paid for it, just as textbook companies are paid for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will create a real marketplace of ideas . . . This will be
a richer source than all the textbooks,'' Nadeau says.

MARKETING HELPED TURN SMALL COMPANY INTO A POWERHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GLENN RIFKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much has been written about Cisco Systems Inc. and
how it rose from obscurity to market prominence by providing the
switches and routers that form the plumbing of the Internet. But
there is another, more obscure, player that has reaped Internet
rewards by producing a fundamental piece of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The EMC Corp. is to data storage what Cisco is to routers. But
few outside of Wall Street and corporate data centers are familiar
with this emerging technology powerhouse. Based in Hopkinton,
Mass., on the far western reaches of metropolitan Boston's Route
128 high-technology belt, EMC dominates the $10 billion market for
large data storage systems _ a market it wrested from IBM.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, which had revenue of $4 billion last year, provides the
storage systems for corporate computer systems _ not only
mainframes but also the power network server computers through
which corporate America uses the Internet. And America Online, as
well as seven of the other 10 largest Internet service providers,
employ EMC storage systems as their main data repositories.
</P>
<P>
   Although EMC was founded 20 years ago, it was only in the 1990s
that the company rose to the leadership of the large data storage
market _ a category encompassing both hardware and software that is
expected to reach $35 billion by 2001, according to the Dataquest
research house. With the Internet creating a seemingly insatiable
appetite for storage, and with corporate computing needs growing
apace, EMC has seen its annual profits surge from $30 million in
1992 to nearly $800 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock _ which closed on Friday at $102.375, down $1.75 _ has
been the second-best performer in the S&AMP;P 500 in the 1990s, with a
return of more than 32,000 percent, second only to Dell Computer's
50,000 percent. Its stock market value, more than $50 billion, is
larger than for companies like American Express, Boeing and
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Part of EMC's success lies in its having embraced an approach
that might be called radical marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Radical marketers emphasize listening to customers; creating a
community atmosphere among customers who are served by employees
and salespeople who are expected to take a missionary's zeal to
their work. Marketing is also made one of the top priorities of the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Successful organizations in a wide range of endeavors _
including Harley-Davidson Motorcycles, Providian Financial and Iams
pet food _ have employed radical marketing techniques to overcome
the larger advertising budgets and giant marketing machines of
their bigger competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of EMC, the tone was set by the co-founder and
chairman, Richard J. Egan, and the chief executive, Michael C.
Ruettgers, who joined the company in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1990, EMC had no measurable share of the market
for mainframe data storage. At that time, IBM owned three-quarters
of the market, in which the prevailing wisdom among information
technology professionals was the aphorism that ``no one ever lost
his job by buying IBM''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly things can change. Today, EMC owns 35 percent of the
market for large external storage systems, compared with a 22
percent share for the market's No. 2 company, IBM, which has now
focused much of its attention on building smaller computer disk
drives rather than the large data storage systems in which EMC
specializes.
</P>
<P>
   How did EMC do this? To begin with, EMC helped convince
customers that the data storage system was no longer a mundane
peripheral to corporate computers but a technological weapon which
the customer could put to strategic business use.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the catalog merchant LL Bean, an EMC customer,
found that it could process transactions sufficiently faster to add
a full day _ and tens of millions of dollars in sales _ to its
holiday shopping season and still promise delivery by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's rise came on the wings of its Symmetrix storage systems, a
product line that was introduced in 1990 and that drastically
shifted the technical assumptions about data storage.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than follow IBM's model of writing millions of lines of
complex software microcode to run these refrigerator-size
electronic file cabinets, EMC engineers built storage devices made
up of hundreds of small, off-the-shelf disk drives. The engineers
were able to make these devices work together with a simple bit of
microcode, and the company packaged them as smaller, cheaper,
faster, more powerful and _ as it turned out _ inherently more
reliable storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   That pioneering technology was known as RAID (redundant array of
independent disks). And though it was invented at the University of
California at Berkeley, EMC developed it into a commercially viable
product that processed data faster than conventional storage
devices and took up less floor space, too.
</P>
<P>
   IBM had reaped 70 percent profit margins by selling ``one size
fits all'' systems, much to the chagrin of corporate
information-technology managers, who had long felt hampered by such
limited and restrictive offerings _ and were often hard pressed to
afford the systems, which might sell for $700,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   EMC aimed to address such frustrations, seeking the advice of
corporate computing managers and inviting them to a visitor center
at EMC headquarters, where customers could regularly meet with
engineers, see work in progress and offer suggestions. And to turn
visitors into customers, EMC put the new systems into client sites
at no charge for a few months of testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Unum Corp., a large insurance company, used the free trial
to process its year-end data, an enormous number-crunching effort
that traditionally took two full weeks of computer time. Using
EMC's system, the company completed the task in three days. The
customer was sold.
</P>
<P>
   EMC executives referred to these as ``puppy dog sales.'' Once
the cute puppy was home, few cared to return it to the pet shop. It
didn't hurt that initially at least, EMC's prices tended to be
hundreds of thousands of dollars below IBM's.
</P>
<P>
   And over time, EMC learned to concentrate on the customers that
could implicity help the company market its products. For example,
some 9,000 banks in the United States spend nearly $20 billion each
year on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   EMC knows that the top five _ BankAmerica, Chase Manhattan,
Citigroup, JP Morgan and Banc One _ account for nearly 40 percent
of that spending. All are EMC customers. Winning them has helped
the company turn the other top 25 banks into EMC customers today,
and more of the nation's smaller banks are coming into the EMC fold
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Grab the leaders and the rest generally follow. It's one of the
premises of radical marketing _ the technology marketing model for
the 21st century.

INTERNET CALLS: CHEAP, AND `FAT-FREE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BRUCE MOHL   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Robert Sanford of Massachusetts calls his daughter in
Florida, he doesn't use the regular phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, using a basic telephone, routes his call over an
Internet system managed by AT&AMP;T and gets charged 7.5 cents a minute
no matter what time of day he calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple and the quality of the service is
excellent,'' says Sanford, an international business consultant.
``I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like every other business in America, telephone companies
are experimenting with the Internet. Their interest is in using it
as a vehicle for carrying phone traffic. So far the market is
relatively tiny _ sales of $500 million are forecasted for this
year _ but the efficiency of delivering phone conversations in the
so-called Internet protocol, or IP, format is attracting a lot of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is currently offering service in seven metropolitan areas.
IDT Corp., a Hackensack, N.J., Internet service provider, is
operating nationwide and has 250,000 customers. Qwest
Communications and Sprint are not in the Boston area yet, but they
are rolling out the technology.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the attraction is price. Howard McNally, an AT&AMP;T
vice president, calls Internet telephony fat-free long distance.
The price is low, from 5 to 7.5 cents a minute,For that, consumers
have to prepay their accounts with a credit card and dial 31
numbers to place a call.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at companies experimenting with the
Internet, the current market is geared heavily toward budget-minded
customers and college students. ``Anyone who is frugal,'' McNally
says. ``It's the person who would drive across town to save 2 cents
on gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are able to offer the low rates because they don't
have to pay the local phone company an access fee to start the
call. That saves about 2 to 3 cents a minute. The companies also
save on billing and customer service because calls are prepaid.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, customers prepay for their calls in $25, $50 or $100
chunks. They can arrange to have their credit card automatically
charged again when their balance runs low. To place a call, they
punch in a local access number, dial their home phone number, a
four-digit PIN number and then the number they are calling.
</P>
<P>
   Voice processing equipment at the local access number converts
the phone conversation into individual packets of digital
information that are then Continued on next page &QL; 
routed over the Internet to the area to which the phone call was
placed. Equipment there reassembles the packets of information,
routes the call back on to local phone lines to the person being
called. It all happens in a blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies route their calls over the public Internet, but
most companies are using private Internet networks. They say this
gives them more control over the routing and the quality of the
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in Internet calling has been steady but slow, primarily
because Americans seem reluctant to prepay for phone service. But
industry officials like McNally say the IP approach will pick up
steam rapidly as more and more calls are carried over cable wires
coming into homes.
</P>
<P>
   The IP approach is considered a more efficient way of routing
calls. Regular phone connections generally require a one-to-one
connection that occupies a fixed amount of space on the phone
network even if no one is talking. Under the IP approach,
information travels in packets down several different Internet
pathways to the ultimate destination, where they are reassembled.
The technique uses up less space on the network and allows more
calls to be handled.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which is busy buying or partnering with cable companies,
plans to adopt IP for all calls it handles over cable wires coming
into customer homes. AT&AMP;T officials say the IP approach will allow
them to handle more calls efficiently and permit installation of
more lines into a single home at reduced cost. ``We're betting the
ranch on IP in the future,'' says AT&AMP;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern.

   Peter T. Szymonik's mailbox gets stuffed with bills, just like
everybody else's. But unlike most of us, Szymonik doesn't haul out
his checkbook and a roll of postage stamps to make his payments.
For Szymonik, a 35-year-old manager at Romac Emerging Technologies,
a consulting and outplacement firm in Manchester, Conn., going to
the bank means going to his home computer and logging onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been using on-line banking for almost three years now,''
says Szymonik, ``and would never go back to manual checks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Bankers Association, about 625 of the
nation's 9,000 consumer banks presently offer some form of on-line
banking, which allows customers to carry out many common
transactions over the Internet, or by dialing into the bank's
private network.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, where Szymonik banks, was one of the first in the
nation to embrace on-line banking back in 1995. Bob Shay, executive
director of global electronic banking for BankBoston, says that
375,000 of his bank's 1.8 million customer accounts _ about 21
percent _ use some kind of on-line banking system. That customer
base, he says, is growing by 50 percent a year ``We're really being
lifted by the consumer move to the Internet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early on-line banking systems required dialing into
a private network run by the bank. But today, as millions of
Americans hop onto the Internet, many are finding it is simple to
interrupt an evening's Web surfing to drop by the bank. New York
City market researcher Jupiter Communications estimates that 18
million US households will be banking on line by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Money and computers go together well. For one thing, computers,
designed for record-keeping and number-crunching, are ideal for
keeping track of one's cash. But perhaps more important, money is
largely a computerized concept to begin with. For many years, most
of the world's money has existed, not as stacks of bank notes, but
as data bits stored within computer networks. At last, cheap home
computers and easy Internet access are enabling ordinary people to
handle their money with the same electronic efficiency as large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   On-line banking systems fall into two general categories. You
can sign up for a system, such as BankBoston's HomeLink or Fleet
Bank's Web Banking, that works with any standard Web browser. This
method lets you go on line from practically anywhere to get
up-to-date information about your finances. You can also use this
method to pay your bills and transfer funds among different
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, including BankBoston, also let the customer
communicate with the bank through a popular money-management
program, such as Intuit Inc.'s Quicken or Microsoft Corp.'s Money
software. These banks have made arrangements to link their computer
systems to a network operated by Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Quicken and Money dial a number that connects them to
the Intuit network, or they can link up through the Internet. Then
they can download their latest banking data directly into their
software.
</P>
<P>
   But this method forces users to do their banking on the computer
where their banking software is installed. With Web-based banking,
any Internet-linked computer in the world will do. In addition, the
Web-based systems tend to provide more up-to-date information,
while data sent through the Intuit network is generally delayed by
about a day.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Web-based services make it more difficult to keep
permanent records of your data. Users must download a file
containing the data, then import it into a home-finance program.
For those who want an easy way to keep accurate records, it's
simpler to bank directly through their finance software.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks provide basic on-line services free of charge. You
can log on to verify account balances or see if a check has
cleared. But for many users, it's being able to pay bills on line
that makes computer banking worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Banks generally charge service fees for on-line bill payment,
though they will often make an exception for those with large
amounts on deposit. Customers who use a bank's own Web-based
banking system often pay less than those who use software like
Quicken. That's because it costs the bank more money to process
checks through the Intuit network.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with on-line bill payment isn't technology,
but the lack of it. In an ideal world, the entire process would be
electronic. Money would be transferred instantly from your bank
account to the company you're paying. In the real world, it hardly
ever works that way, because very few companies are equipped to
handle direct electronic payments. Instead, the bank must print out
a check and mail it. Ironically, these checks will often take
longer to arrive than if you'd mailed them yourself. Thus, you may
have to pay your bills earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many companies ask you to return a coupon with your
check, to help them enter the payment into their computers. You
can't include these coupons when you pay on-line. Many consumers
have had bill payments go astray because of a missing coupon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this happens less often as more people use on-line
banking. Meanwhile, major companies are slowly moving toward
so-called ``electronic bill presentment'' systems, that will let
them send bills over the Internet and receive instant electronic
payments through consumer bank accounts. Jupiter Communications
estimates that 15 million households will pay bills this way by the
year 2002. It won't make bill paying any more pleasant, but at
least they won't clutter up the mailbox.

CONE MY EARS? I MUST BE WAXY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - John Rosegard lay curled on his side on a table, the
picture of relaxation, except for the foot-long flaming cone
sticking in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry _ he wasn't the victim of some medieval torture. He
was having his ears cleaned and had paid $30 for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ear coning, and the basic idea has been around for
centuries. It's fairly simple: The shape of the cone forms a vacuum
with the ear; the heat of the flame draws out earwax and other
debris. Some wax is good, but too much can cause all sorts of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how sound the idea behind it, there is still
something daunting about sticking a flaming cone in your ear.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was his first time, however, Rosegard wasn't
worried. He was lying on a table outside Phoenix Civic Plaza, where
the Phoenix Holistic Health Expo was held last weekend. Dieter
Gould, owner of King Cone International, was holding the cone,
fretting that the fire marshal wouldn't allow him to demonstrate
the cones inside, where he was selling them (business is growing
rapidly, he said). Open flame and all that.
</P>
<P>
   After about 10 minutes, half the cone had burned down, so Gould
pulled it out of Rosegard's ear, took a wooden skewer and scraped
out the inside. A fine, off-white powder dumped out, along with
what looked like small pieces of caramel. In a word, yuck. &QL; 
 &QL; 
What's in a color?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It all looks weird,'' Gould said of what comes out of people's
ears after they've been coned. ``I've seen many different colors.
I've seen olive drab, which indicates infection. I've seen
shoe-polish black, which may indicate nicotine in a heavy smoker.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, you can't tell everything about a person by what's in
his ears. Gould carefully kept claims sufficiently vague _ so don't
expect companies to substitute ear coning for urine tests to find
out if you've been using drugs. The point is to make you feel
better, not to reveal innermost secrets.
</P>
<P>
   After cleaning the cone, Gould lighted it again and stuck it
back into Rosegard's ear. After 10 more minutes, he repeated the
process in the other ear. He finished by dabbing a cotton swab in
olive oil and wiping Rosegard's ears with it.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, who lives in Redondo Beach, Calif., started his
ear-coning business six years ago. He's a nice guy but occasionally
a little hard to get a straight answer out of. He's one of those
people who can't talk about earwax without getting into its
harmonic relationship with the body's organs and the 4,000 pores in
the ear and the healing effect of this and that; somehow the liver
and kidneys were involved, but it was hard to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But he explained away the biggest worry people have about ear
coning _ other than, presumably, immolation _ with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any dripping at all, it'll drip onto the candle,
not into the ear,'' he said. ``It's the design of the candle, the
way it's shaped. It's the way I'm holding it, too . . . at about
the 1 o'clock position.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Earwax exonerated
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's important to note _ Gould sells the cones for people to
use themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Rosegard liked the results. So did I _ after watching
Rosegard, I paid my $30 and had Gould cone my ears. When he lighted
the cone and stuck it _ gently _ into my ear, it was like listening
to a seashell _ I could hear the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   That gave way, once the flame burned a bit, to a gentle white
noise. There was some warmth, but no painful burning.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, my earwax got a clean bill of health _ just the
remnants of an older infection, Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   Although to my untrained eye, what came out of my ears looked an
awful lot like what came out of Rosegard's, and he was apparently
loaded down with candida, older wax and open to a virus.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about many holistic remedies _ you can't tell
if they work. Yes, my ears were cleaner, but Gould could have told
me my wax showed I had been bitten by a tsetse fly and I couldn't
have disproved him. No matter the treatment, it's all harmony and
healing _ in this case, the whole ball of wax. &QL;

AFTER 10-MONTHS, SLATE DROPS ITS ON-LINE SUBSCRIPTION FEE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an important test of one facet of Internet commerce:
Would readers pay an annual subscription rate of $19.95 for the
privilege of reading a magazine on line?
</P>
<P>
   If the tale of Slate magazine, which is owned by Microsoft, is
any indication, the answer is no. Ten months after deciding to
charge readers $19.95 a year, the publisher of the online magazine
announced in an e-mail notice to subscribers that, as of last
Friday, it would now be available free on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, Slate's editor, said that the decision was not
a setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you don't like to reverse course,'' he said. ``You
try one thing, you try another. It's a stage in the learning
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail to subscribers, Scott Moore _ who was named
publisher of the online magazine last Monday _ wrote that there
were two reasons for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the advertising market on the Web has continued to
expand at a remarkable pace, '' he wrote. ``It roughly doubled in
1998 to about $1.8 million, is predicted to grow to about $3
billion in 1999, and should continue a healthy 50 percent to 60
percent annual growth rate for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that ``the biggest problem with remaining paid was
that doing so would restrict our advertising potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident,'' he wrote. ``that by making Slate.com free
our audience will grow substantially and this will make us more
attractive to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The second problem, Moore wrote, was that, on the Web, ``paid
subscriptions for content (other than smut and investments) simply
have not grown as expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new arrangement, readers who pay $19.95 a year will
get e-mail deliveries and print-out editions, and have access to
the archives and general bulletin board of Slate, services that
will not be provided free.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., said that the
issue was one of supply and demand. `` Last year, I said this was
the dumbest thing I had ever heard,'' he said. ``There is so much
free content on the Web that if you try and charge for it people
won't go to you. There is too much substitutable content.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the fact that readers can look at Salon magazine,
a Slate competitor, which is free. ``It's like if Ford came out
with a Taurus that cost $50,000. If I can get a Camry for $25,000,
why would I pay $50,000 for a Taurus?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bass added that only two areas on the Internet can charge for
their services: financial and pornography sites. He said that
financial sites like thestreet.com and The Wall Street Journal's
Web site are popular because they offer specific advice that few
other sites offer, and the subscription prices can be written off
as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only wildly successful sites that charge have been adult
entertainment,'' he said. ``And people tend not to act economically
rationally around adult entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Keane, a senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, an
online market research firm, pointed out that there is also a
psychological hurdle for consumers to overcome in paying for
content on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see their personal computers as a utility device, and
they're going to pay for information that leads them toward a task,
or that helps them with a purchasing decision,'' he said. ``So
consumers don't have a natural proclivity to pay for content on
line.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that the Internet is a maturing market.
``After all,'' he said, referring to cable TV, ``if somebody had
told you in 1975 that you would be paying $40 a month for your
television, would you have believed it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an editor's letter posted on Friday, Kinsley answered what he
expected would be readers' questions about the decision. ``It's
painful,'' he wrote, ``to think of turning away so many Slate
readers from so much of our content _ not to mention the potential
readers who don't come in the first place. The spreadsheet wizards
figure that ad revenue from the increased traffic will more than
compensate for the lost subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said that the paying subscribers number in ``the high
twenty thousands'' and that the magazine was visited by 300,000 to
400,000 news users each month. Moore would not disclose Slate's ad
revenue, which is charted by an internal group, MSN Advertising
Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Slate was started in June 1996 and, after some false starts,
began charging last March. It has remained something of a sideshow
in Microsoft's Internet strategy, which in earlier stages
emphasized entertainment programming or local information but is
now focused on building traffic to a home page, MSN.com, that
directs users to both content and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site Friday, Salon, which is published by Salon
Internet Inc., crowed over the news, with a commentary headlined
sardonically ``Slate rejoins the Web.'' Later, in an interview,
David Talbot, the editor and chief executive of Salon, said that
Slate's decision to charge readers ``was a case of Microsoft's
hubris'' and ``prevented other sites from linking to it, further
restricting circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you charge, it prevents other sites from linking to you,
which is how the Web grows, when you become integrated to other Web
sites through links,'' he said. ``When you hit a gate as a reader
saying you have to pay, Web sites stop linking to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Bowe, the editor of the online magazine Word, which is
owned by the Zapata Corp., said that she was not surprised at
Slate's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, no one has really been willing to pay to read anything
on the Web,'' she said. ``It's a little heartbreaking for me to
say, but the Web magazines are just not as important, yet, as the
print magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley said, ``I think if she's going to be depressed about
that, she's going to be depressed for a while.''

THE ATM'S ONE-STOP FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the day hasn't arrived yet, it seems certain that before too
long kids in America will find it hard to believe you once had to
deal with a human being called a teller to get your money out of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   With the way technology is evolving, a decade from now children
might find it impossible to imagine that there was a time when all
that automated teller machines gave out was money.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more banks convert to ATMs that use complex touch
screens to execute transactions instead of limited numeric keypads,
an amazing range of possibilities is opening up for the corner bank
machine.
</P>
<P>
   While machines that vend stamps and offer coupons are becoming
more common in Greater Boston, they are only the beginning: Prepaid
telephone cards, theater and movie tickets, ski-lift tickets, MBTA
passes, and gift certificates are among the many other products
banks may be offering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides alternative products, new ATMs could also offer access
to a wide range of information and services, such as trading stocks
and mutual funds, applying for loans and learning the latest news
headlines. ``There's a huge effort going on right now to do what we
call non-cash dispensing,'' says Randy Gearhart, director of ATM
development for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The key technological innovation driving expanded ATM use is the
growing prevalence of touch-screen computers, which allow people to
put their fingers on an electrically sensitive surface to select a
transaction from a menu on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of ATMs, using a 10-digit number pad and
buttons corresponding to four or eight preset actions, have been
necessarily limited to a short menu with options like withdraw from
checking or show balances.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to touch screens, banks can offer unlimited options
beyond just withdrawing money or transferring dollars among
accounts. BankBoston, for example, has moved to touch-screen
technology for more than 750 of its 1,600 ATMs. Those now serve
more than 60 percent of all ATM transactions, according to bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to program machines to have multiple displays
corresponding to financial transactions, ticket purchases, or
information requests.
</P>
<P>
   For the most complicated tasks, touch screens could be
programmed to display a 26-letter keyboard on the lower half of the
screen. That would allow people to use the ATM for complex requests
such as buying 500 shares of Consolidated Amalgamated or
reserv-Continued on next page &QL; 
ing two first-class tickets on the Tuesday flight to Bimini.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shay, BankBoston's executive director of global electronic
banking, says the ``holy grail'' is to find a universally accepted,
fraud-proof medium for printing a broad range of tickets through
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, banks would be able to get sports arenas, cinemas,
airlines and other businesses to accept a universal, printable
ticket that might include security features such as a watermark or
hologram to prevent forgery.
</P>
<P>
   While banks are only beginning to exploit ATMs, experiments now
underway suggest the boggling range of capabilities the machines
could soon offer:
</P>
<P>
   --Spanish banks using Diebold machines have begun selling
bullfight and opera tickets.
</P>
<P>
   --Cathay Pacific Airways has begun rolling out ATMs inside
jetliners that allow users to exchange currency or buy cards for
inflight entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   --In Charlotte, N.C., and Orlando, First Union Bank plans this
spring to roll out machines that register a photographic image of
people using the ATM instead of a card to verify their identity
when they cash a check.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing their identity over the phone the first time
they use the machine and having a picture taken, people will later
be able to cash checks on the spot by entering their Social
Security number and having their identity verified through
``biometric'' comparisons made by two cameras. However, customers
will pay a fee of up to $3 per $100 cashed.
</P>
<P>
   --Elsewhere in the world, including England and South Africa,
banks are developing technologies such as retina or thumbprint
scans as an alternative to requiring customers to carry a bank card
with an electronic strip.
</P>
<P>
   --Later this year, BankBoston expects to install modular
printers inside ATMs that will allow people to request, for an
as-yet-unspecified fee, an up-to-the-minute printed bank statement.
The printers will go behind panels that now have a slot the width
of a standard piece of office paper.
</P>
<P>
   --Singapore banks use ATMs to issue checks to customers as a way
of curbing mail fraud and theft of checks. While customers wait for
about 2 minutes, the machine prints up, binds and dispenses a
supply of 15 or 20 personalized checks.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation is that currently, most machines used by
BankBoston and other banks hold four cassettes. Normally, all four
hold money. In machines that sell stamps, one of the four cassettes
is converted to dispense stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to converting cassettes to hold different products
is that it increases the frequency bank employees need to refill
the machine with money, as well as the risk someone trying to make
a withdrawal will find the machine out of service because it has
run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of getting rid of a cash cassette versus the
number of customers we would serve'' by offering other products
``haven't made a whole lot of sense so far,'' Gearhart says.
``There needs to be demand and there needs to be a business case
for doing it.''

Power Mac stands out in crowd, distinguished by minitower, speed 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the side, it looks like a pillowcase with
handles. This latest desktop computer from Apple continues the
company's renewed emphasis on design.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, this model is called simply (and boringly) the Power
Mac G3. Apple has abandoned, for now at least, giving jazzy new
names to every new model of the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But the Power Mac G3 is geeky in name only. It looks like no
other computer you've seen before, except for the Apple's runaway
hit, the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Like the iMac, the Power Mac G3's color scheme is iridescent
blue and white. The Power Mac, however, is a minitower and doesn't
include a built-in monitor like the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   And the Power Mac is the fastest Mac yet, offering processing
speeds up to 400 megahertz. There's also 1 megabyte of something
called backside cache, a chunk of memory designed to speed up the
processing power of the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   With the Power Mac, Apple has added a new design concept for
desktop computers. There are four handles atop the minitower, which
give this computer the pillowcase look from the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac continues other design changes begun with the iMac
last August.
</P>
<P>
   For one, there's no built-in floppy drive. You can, however,
easily add one in any of the Power Mac's five bays for internal
storage devices. Two of these slots also support Zip drives, CD-ROM
drives and DVD drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac is also designed to support USB, the new standard
already in use in PCs for connecting peripheral devices such as
mice and monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the iMac, though, the Power Mac is built for transition.
One slot supports the previous connection standard, so you can use
a current mouse, keyboard or monitor. The Power Mac does come with
the same USB iridescent blue mouse and keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac is also the first Apple computer to come equipped
with a new technology called FireWire. This is another peripheral
connection technology, and it vastly enhances the ability to
transfer video and audio files to your Mac. You'd use a FireWire
port, for example, to transfer to your Mac images from your
camcorder.
</P>

Once a novelty, now big business 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Netwatchers are not necessarily Net geeks.
</P>
<P>
   What I know about the Windows 98 operating system you could put
into half of a very small thimble, and I will never understand why
``King's Quest VII'' crashes every time I'm ready to fight the evil
wizards.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a Web surfer from way back _ all the way back to 1994,
to be exact. I read an article about all these neat things you
could see on your computer if you had this gizmo called a
``browser.'' So I got myself one at the local software joint and
installed it on my dumpy little Compaq Presario 486. I ventured out
into the wilds of cyberspace all by myself, with no map, no search
engine and certainly no technical support.
</P>
<P>
   There really wasn't much to look at then, and with a 2,400 bps
modem, if you wanted to look at the cool sites of those days _
HotWired, Pathfinder or the Louve museum _ you needed time, and
plenty of it. My friend Janet called me up after I had sold her on
the virtues of ``that Internet thing'' to complain. ``In the time
it takes me to download Time magazine, I can sit down on my couch
and read Time magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? In those days, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling somewhat guilty, I felt compelled to help my friends and
fellow Web surfers get the most out of the Web. After all, it was
at my suggestion they were forking over $19.95 of their hard-earned
money each month to stare at their computers and wait for the magic
of the Web to appear before them. In my quest for Web knowledge, I
did the only thing I could think of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I got a subscription to Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines _ which was pretty much how you had to
read Wired in those days _ I found out that you could get better
computers with faster modems, and there were books that could help
you find Web sites to give you Tarot card readings, Emily
Dickinson's poetry and the contents of a Coke machine in some
building at Stanford University. Not that I had any need to know if
there was any Diet Coke left in some vending machine at Stanford
University, but it was kind of cool to be sitting on the other side
of the country gathering up this kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the days of wandering aimlessly through cyberspace are
gone. More and more users are logging on every day from home and
work. Portals such as Yahoo! and Excite promise to take you to
every Web site worth seeing, and the number of sites grows
exponentially every day.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more retailers, banks, and airlines pour onto the
Web, it's becoming more of a utility than an amusing little hobby.
Everyone wants a piece of your valuable online time and your
valuable off-line money. Web powerhouses like CNN and Amazon.com
would love it if you spent all your online time just visiting their
sites and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have spent more than my fair share of time at Amazon
_ the travel mug/thank you note last Christmas from Amazon's
marketing department was a real wake-up call for me and my credit
limit _ there are other things to do online that are useful and
just plain fun. To miss them is to miss the creativity and
innovation that made the Web worth looking at to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The Web of the 21st century is big business. Everyone from
Disney to Martha Stewart has their own Web page, and newcomers to
the Web are lost even before they start. Companies like Peapod now
will deliver groceries to your front door, and the cable and phone
companies are promising a future filled with ``always on'' Net
access that will eliminate busy signals and the endless downloads
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Web is going to change your life. You may
become a devotee of online shopping, hourly news updates from MSNBC
or sending e-mail to your friends and co-workers. Even if you never
log on, the Web isn't going to go away. You watch your kids bounce
from Web site to Web site from a nervous distance or look at Web
addresses constantly being flashed across your TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a novice Web surfer, the Web was filled with novice
Web surfers. People built Web pages with lists of sites because it
was fun, not to make money, go public, get into mergers and
acquisition or land on the covers of business magazines. In the
last six years the Web has become a business. As consumers we need
to know what's going on out there and how it's going to change how
we use the Web and how we fit it into our lives.
</P>
<P>
   While we try to figure it all out for you, there's lots to do in
the meantime. Why not see how the Coke machines are stocked in New
York and Denmark? (http://www.cc.columbia.edu/(tilde)cocacola/ and
http://
</P>

   amigos12.diku.dk/currentstatus.html, respectively).

SHERRY TURKLE STUDIES THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most marketers are busy figuring out what e-commerce can
do for people, Sherry Turkle is more concerned about what it is
doing to people.
</P>
<P>
   Turkle, a professor of the sociology of science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been called an
ethnologist of on-line life, a cybershrink, and the Margaret Mead
of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerations? Perhaps. But this much is true: As a pundit,
Turkle has carved a national niche for herself as an authoritative
commentator on the existential topic of how the Internet is
transforming people's behavior and sense of self. In 1995, Newsweek
magazine named her in its ``50 for the Future: the Most Influential
People to Watch in Cyberspace.'' In 1997, Time Digital Magazine put
her on its list of the top 50 ``Cyber Elite.''
</P>
<P>
   As millions of consumers flock on-line to do everything from
checking stock quotes to searching for that
</P>
<P>
   1955 Roy Rogers lunchbox, life on the Internet has taken on a
mystical aura. The fascination has led many Internet-watchers to
Turkle's doorstep in search of higher meaning.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the masses, she has dispensed humanist perspectives
on one of man's coldest creations. Her books _ ``The Second Self:
Computers and the Human Spirit,'' (Simon and Schuster, 1984) and
``Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet'' (Simon
and Schuster, 1995, $25) _ deal with how computers have changed the
way people interact with the world and view themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Turkle views the world of electronic commerce in philosophical
fashion. One of her recurrent messages: The Internet will not
replace stores, boutiques, shopping malls, and supermarkets.
Instead, browsing on-line will only whet people's appetite for the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Turkle points to ``City of Bits'' (MIT Press), a
book published by MIT colleague, William Mitchell. Viewers can read
the entire book on line for free. Instead of dampening sales,
Turkle posits that the on-line version has boosted sales of the
physical book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has increased the appetite for the book itself,'' Turkle
says. ``People wanted the experience of the book, its
functionality, its ease of maneuverability.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the shopping experience. ``I sense myself as
a consumer who has access to many, many different kinds of media
for getting information,'' she says. ``I experience the product at
a store. I see it in a catalog in a setting I can fantasize about.
I can go on line to learn more about it, its ratings, its price
points. All this information goes into a purchasing decision, and
increasingly, we are becoming better and better at it. It's
changing the experience of being a consumer. People are becoming
connoisseurs of information.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who see the on-line buying experience as being too
cold, or too dehumanizing, Turkle says the criticism is a red
herring. ``Too often, the computer is compared to what it would be
like living in a small village. They imagine a cafe in France where
people meet daily and you come across the same cast of characters.
They set up a 19th-century ideal and compare the computer to it.
What we're really doing is confronting what we miss most in the
rest of our lives . . . As a mirror for society, it's a very
telling comment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that yearning for the human touch that will preserve roles
and functions that ought to belong in the human domain.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, she says, ``I was interviewing an 11-year-old
about artificial intelligence. He said, `When there are robots who
can perform all the jobs, people will still cook the food, run the
restaurant, and have families. I guess they'll still be the ones
who will go to church.' He was saying that you have to accept
computers for what they can do, but that there are still things
that only people can do, like form relationships and develop
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkle is less sanguine, however, when it came to the subject of
on-line trading of stocks. Likening it to a ``casino atmosphere,''
she cautions against the addictive quality of stock trading that
can lead to financial ruin for individuals. She also worries about
how day trading, as the practice is called, can contribute to, in
fact feeds on, the volatility of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there will always be speculators,'' she says. ``But
as this phalanx of Americans move into day trading, you begin to
create a stock market that feels like a casino. It becomes a closed
game of winners and losers, increasingly disconnected from economic
life.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Turkle is occupied with a more
down-to-earth topic than macroeconomics. As mother of a 7-year-old
daughter, Rebecca, Turkle is interested in how technology affects
children. Her current research topic: The Furby, a fuzzy,
computerized, mechanized doll that talks, blinks, sleeps and asks
to be fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the conversation is about how `smart' the Furby
is,'' says Turkle. ``But I think the story is not so much what's in
the Furby as what it triggers in the child.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Turkle has observed a crucial difference in how children
connect with a Furby versus a doll that behaves completely
predictably. ``This lack of predictability causes us to see them in
a different light,'' Turkle says. ``In the future, these toys can
socialize us into being used to the idea that machines are not
always predictable and shape the way we relate to them.''

How the cookie crumbles 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People love cookies and milk. People hate cookies and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't have your ``Internet for Dummies'' handbook
nearby, a computer ``cookie'' is a file that Web sites install on
your computer's hard drive when you visit a site that offers
cookies. They are very small files, never more than 225 characters
or 4K of disk space. Not all sites send cookies to your computer,
but an increasing number do.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless though they might be, most Internet users have a
knee-jerk reaction to anyone or anything trying to gather
information about them. The notion that merely typing in a Web
address opens up the opportunity for companies to find out anything
at all about them is distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an advertiser might set a cookie on your computer
to track how many people have viewed an online advertisement. Web
sites also send cookies to monitor how many users might view a
particular page or section. The folks who send these cookies say
they do it to help determine which parts of their Web sites get the
most traffic so they can add or subtract content accordingly and to
keep users from looking at the same advertisements over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies, for the most part, are harmless both to your computer
and your privacy. There's really no harm in sites such as ESPN
SportZone sending baseball-related ads to users browsing the
baseball section. In fact, some users may find the products and
services being offered to them useful.
</P>
<P>
   However, cookies can also be used to track your password, user
name, credit card numbers and any other information you have
provided via an online form. Sites like The New York Times, which
require user ID and passwords, store this information as a cookie
in your hard disk, so registered users won't have to keep filling
out forms every time they go to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines use cookies to ``remember'' individual user
habits and deliver customized news and services targeted to them.
</P>
<P>
   Online vendors, such as Amazon.com, can read the user's cookie
and match it with a stored profile that would contain credit card
information, so the user won't have to enter the information each
time.
</P>
<P>
   Given what cookies do, it won't come as a surprise that Internet
advertisers love cookies _ all kinds and any kind. Cookies with
news, with entertainment, with sports, with search engines. If you
can put it on the Web and you can advertise there, you can bet
there's a marketing department somewhere making sure every Web ad
comes with cookies. Most cookies are active only during a single
Web surfing session and disappear after users log off.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sheer vastness of the Internet and the complexity
of home PCs make many Web users wary of cookies. There are concerns
that cookies can be used to lift personal information from your PC
or perhaps something more insidious. A special Web site called
Cookie Central (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .cookiecentral.com) explains the various uses and potential
misuses of cookies. Ironically, the site uses cookies itself to
deliver its own banner ads to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, the U.S. government says it likes cookies.
A report issued last March from the Energy Department's Computer
Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) said, despite the fear and
loathing some users have, ``the hype about cookies has far
outweighed the actual hazards of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular concepts and rumors about what a cookie can do has
reached almost mystical proportions,'' the report stated. ``It is
not an executable program and cannot do anything to your machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The report helped quiet rumors that America Online planned to
use cookies to gather private information from its members' hard
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing consultants such as DoubleClick
(http://www.doubleclick
</P>
<P>
   .com) use cookies to increase the efficiency of the placing of
advertisements on Web sites and deliver ads to the people most
likely to be interested in a particular company's products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick addresses the issue of cookies and Internet privacy
directly at its Web site. The company reassures all Web surfers
that any user information gleaned from cookies remains completely
anonymous. ``We do not sell or rent any information to third
parties,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the information is anonymous, DoubleClick maintains, only
the sites themselves and advertisers could benefit from the
information the company gathers.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick believes cookies make the Web a better place. ``We
believe that cookies enhance the Web experience for the user by
limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level
of relevant content on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   While DoubleClick might paint too rosy a picture of cookies,
there really isn't anything dangerous about them. There are ways
you can monitor what sites are sending you cookies and/or stop them
altogether, and you can read about them below.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who will abuse cookies _ unscrupulous Web sites
might take your information and sell it to offline marketers, but
as Electronic Frontier Foundation director Stanton McCandlish told
CNet last year, ``It's really difficulty to imagine a technology
that can't be abused.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT COOKIES DO ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Web site tracking: It's a way to help Web designers and
developers keep tabs on which areas of their sites are most
popular. It also provides more accurate accounts of how many people
have actually visited a Web site and what pages they viewed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Marketing: Cookies deliver targeted advertisements for
products consumers might want _ for example, advertising sporting
equipment to users who visit the sports area of a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3. Storing IDs: Cookies can store passwords and user IDs, so
subscribers to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Slate
or any site that requires a user ID and password won't have to keep
filling out registration forms everytime the visit the site. Online
retailers like Amazon.com and others use cookies to streamline
their online ordering process, remembering what orders have been
placed, or items that have been selected but not yet purchased.
Users can return weeks later and find the items still in their
``online shopping baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Personalization: Even the most anti-cookie contingent agrees
this is one of the best uses of cookies. Microsoft and Netscape
browsers use cookies to create personal start pages. Users can come
to a large site such as CNN, MSNBC or Excite and select which areas
of the site they want to view and which areas they don't. The
cookie stores that information and uses it on the next visit.
</P>
<P>
   5. Target marketing: Cookies can be used to build a profile of
you _ where you surf, and what advertisements you click on. This
information is used to send ads to you that supposedly will be of
interest to you based on your Web surfing history.
</P>
<P>
   COOKIES DON'T ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Mine your PC and gather information about you from other
programs such as letters, spreadsheets or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   2. Send information to any other sites you surf.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make changes to any information you've supplied previously.
</P>
<P>
   4. Damage your computer or your hard drive in any way.
</P>
<P>
   5. Taste good dunked in milk or purchased from a supermarket.

EDITING HOME VIDEOS INTO CHERISHED MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 17 million US households that own both a camcorder and a
personal computer also own something else, according to Griffin Dix
Research: an average of 20 videotapes they rarely watch.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, as many of us with camcorders have found, is that
what seemed like endlessly fascinating graduation ceremonies,
Little League games and baby feeding sessions at the time we were
rolling tape turned out to be a little tedious on playback.
</P>
<P>
   Programs that plug into your personal computer to help you edit
down and jazz up your videos are becoming one of the hottest new
markets in home electronics. Dataquest, a multimedia
market-analysis firm, estimates that shipments of these products
rose from 471,162 units in 1996 to more than 1 million in 1997, and
probably more this past year.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen products priced for home use are on the
market, with new ones seeming to come out every month. They include
Ulead Systems' VideoStudio 3.0, Adaptec's VideOh!, Iomega Buz, Avid
Cinema (a Power Macintosh product), Dazzle Digital Video Creator,
and MGI Software's Videowave.
</P>
<P>
   One of the least expensive, versatile and klutz-forgiving
systems is Studio 400 by Pinnacle Systems, which went on the market
in May and normally retails for $199 or less.
</P>
<P>
   While some systems require you to undertake the frightening task
of opening up your computer to plug in a device that translates
tapes into digital bits for storage and editing on your hard drive,
Studio 400 uses a paperback-book-sized device that plugs into your
serial and parallel ports like a printer.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work, you need a Pentium-class computer running
Windows 95 or 98, a VCR that can be controlled by an infrared
remote and can be plugged in somewhere close to the PC, and a
couple of specialized cables to hook up the VCR and camcorder to
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth checking at this Web page _
www.pinnaclesys.com/framesets/support.html _ to make sure your
camcorder will work with Studio 400. (Generally, Sony, JVC, and
Panasonic camcorders and all other camcorders that support 8mm tape
or have what is called a Panasonic 5 pin will work out, according
to Pinnacle.)
</P>
<P>
   Once everything is hooked up, you play back the tape. To
conserve memory, the system transfers to your computer memory a
lower-resolution version of the tape _ 160 by 120 pixels _ that
should take up no more than 150 megabytes per hour of tape.
</P>
<P>
   The program automatically determines the beginning of each
``scene'' on your tape, sensing when you stopped or paused the
camcorder while recording.
</P>
<P>
   The first frame of each scene shows up as a still picture in an
``album'' on your computer screen. Using your mouse, you drag
images to what is called the ``storyboard,'' recombining scenes in
whatever order you want and omitting the boring stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add in up to 100 different transitions (the new
scene spins out of the old one, for example), fadeouts, 200
different styles of titles, as well as background music (classical,
country, jazz, rock, and so on) or your own voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   You can preview what different editing approaches will look like
before committing to them. When you have finished tweaking the
captured version of your tape, Studio 400 goes to work playing back
the actual version, inserting the special effects you have chosen
and outputting the whole package to your VCR tape. What comes out
is a full-resolution video. Or, if you have the hard-drive space,
you can keep a version on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle also says you can use the system to create video to
send to other people by e-mail or post on a Web page and, if you
are daring enough, push the system to use as a sort of video phone
with someone else who has it.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it seems to be much simpler than some of the earlier
approaches to PC-based video editing, but it's not a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Buckingham, an analyst with International Data Corp.'s
desktop multimedia and graphics group, told Computer Dealer News in
a recent survey of the field that many people might find editing
programs a bit frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is, the PC is really not powerful enough for most
video applications, and users are not sophisticated enough,''
Buckingham told the trade magazine. ``Today's PC applications are
kind of like driving a car _ you go left, right, front back. You
add video, and it's like going from driving a car to flying a
plane, in that it requires experience and training to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Fischer, senior analyst with John Peddie Associates of
Tiburon, Calif., asserts in a Pinnacle press kit that because of
its memory-conserving features, ``Studio 400 is the first product
to make basic video editing with transitions, voice- and music-over
and high-quality titling practical for consumers with typical home
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that, like Hamburger Helper, the ultimate result
will depend heavily on the quality of the ingredients. Unless you
use a tripod and professional lighting, don't expect your videos to
come out looking like a network show _ but they might come out
looking as good as home video spliced into an evening newscast, and
certainly in a more brisk, entertaining package.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost and complexity of using the system, it might make
a perfect self-serving ``gift'' for a group of siblings, cousins or
friends to give to a technophile: Slip it under Uncle John's
Christmas tree, then give him the treat of paring down your endless
family videos.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, as impressive and versatile as all of Studio 400's
features seem to be, my wife and I have discovered a highly
functional peripheral on our home entertainment system that can
accomplish the level of editing we find we really need.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the pause button, part of the no-name VCR my wife's
father bought her from a mail-order electronics house 12 years ago.
We hook up our camcorder to the TV set, pop in a tape to the VCR
and start recording, then pause the VCR tape when we think Aunt
Sylvia has probably seen enough of little Susannah spooning oatmeal
approximately into her mouth, unpausing before she performs her
next brilliant trick.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great way to turn 60 minutes of adoring parents who can't
stop the camcorder into 15 minutes of video for far-flung aunts,
uncles, and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   But undoubtedly many people far more skilled with electronics
than us will love the chance to trim, rearrange, and transition
their memories. Studio 400 could be a fun, reasonably priced way
for you to play professional videomaker.

 The Snag in Lycos' MP3 Jukebox  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  What's with the new MP3 search engine on Lycos? When
I click on a song to download it, I get the same message every
time: ``Internet Explorer could not open the site because the
server returned extended information.`' Please help. The MP3
revolution is passing me by!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Most likely, the server that hosts the songs you are
trying to get is crowded and not letting anyone on. ``Most MP3
servers reach their maximum number of users during peak hours of
the day,'' says my 17-year-old son, who's quickly turning into an
expert on the subject. ``You just have to keep hammering at them.''
A spokesman for Lycos acknowledged that in its first full day, the
new MP3 search engine generated more than 1 million hits.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible cause for the message you're getting is that
some sites use ``ratios,'' letting you download stuff only if you
first upload something. It's an easy way for a site to increase its
content. You can avoid this particular problem by using an audio
search engine such as MediaFind (formerly Chaos MP3), which lets
you block ratio sites from search responses. You'll find it at
search.mp3.de /index.html.

   Insomniac Compaq
</P>
<P>
   Q: My Compaq Presario home PC will not stay asleep. It wakes up
by itself during the night. This happens without any programs left
open, and it makes no difference how we put it into ``sleep'' mode.
What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most Presarios are programmed to wake up at midnight, or
whenever the phone rings, if the PC also is being used as a fax
machine. But you can change the default and eliminate the problem.
Here's how: Restart your PC, and when the Compaq logo appears,
immediately press the F10 key. That will take you into the Setup
program. Now go the Power section, where you can change the wake-up
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Pandora's Box
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, a gray box has been appearing in the middle of my
screen for no apparent reason. The top left corner contains
``Waol,'' and the text in the box says, ``This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
problem persists, contact the program vendor.'' Any suggestions on
how I can get rid of this pesky problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: My guess is that the America Online program on your PC has
become corrupted _ ``Waol'' stands for Windows America Online. So
what you should do is delete AOL from the computer and install a
fresh copy. Of course, you should download the new copy from AOL
(keyword: Upgrade) before deleting the old one because once you
delete it, you won't be able to get online. And it would make you
feel like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   When Your Click Sticks
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I click on Microsoft Internet Explorer, I get a message
that it cannot connect to the server. Yet when I click on AOL,
which uses Internet Explorer, everything works fine. What is wrong?
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of COMPUTIN () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: AOL is an online service that connects you to the Internet.
Once you log on, you can use AOL's built-in Internet Explorer
browser (as well as another version of IE or Netscape Navigator) to
browse the Web. When you open the browser, it goes out and connects
with the server for the browser's home page. After that, every time
you go to a new site on the Web, the browser will seek out the
server for each site's address.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not actually online, however, the browser is basically
worthless. It only works if it can connect to a server. And the
message you're getting indicates that you haven't yet gone online.
So log onto AOL first, and then open the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Folder Foul Up
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use Windows 95 for my business. I prefer to view the
contents of my folders in list form rather than icons. Every time
Windows crashes, all my folders revert to showing files as large
icons. I've been using My Computer to change them back to list form
one folder at a time, using each folder's View menu. Is there a way
to set a global preference for viewing the content of all folders
and sub-folders as lists?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know of any global options for My Computer, but you
can make life easier on yourself by managing your files instead
with Windows Explorer. When you choose List from its View menu, all
the folders are displayed that way. FYI, the easiest way to start
Windows Explorer is by right-clicking the Windows Start button and
choosing Explore.

Author tells tale of how to lose money in a hurry 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Wolff wrote one of the first ``how not to''
books about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate: How I survived the Gold Rush Years on the
Internet,'' is about Wolff's experience as an unlikely Internet
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The former journalist turned screenwriter turned American
expatriate and would-be novelist turned media consultant staked an
early claim _ 1994 _ in the Internet gold rush. Wolff New Media
compiled, published and sold NetGuide, a book that tried to be the
TV Guide of the Internet. Burn Rate tells the story of how Wolff
turned a profitable publishing company into a money-sucking
Internet black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff traded outside cash for control and grew his new media
company exponentially. In four months in 1996, his company shot
from 8 employees to 70. Wolff took a profitable business making 15
percent to 20 percent profit margins into a company that in one
year lost $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Wolff was smacked: Unable to cover the bills, he
allowed his company to be taken over by some of its investors. The
book, finished in March 1998 and released in June, is Wolff's smack
back. Part diary, part gossip column, part cautionary tale, Wolff
describes Burn Rate as ``an incredibly sweet revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn Rate has sold close to 100,000 copies. Wolff, 45, said he
is starting to think about a new book. In the meantime, he writes a
weekly, 2,000-word media column for New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff will speak in Atlanta at a Wednesday night dinner
sponsored by the Association for Interactive Media.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you end up an Internet entrepreneur?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I started consulting on the future of media for some
friends on Wall Street. Then I got involved with people wanting to
do some media deals. I got gradually more and more in this world of
deals and media and entrepreneurship, and I liked it. I liked being
around business people. I'd been around writers for a long time.
And you know, writers, are a lot of _ they're a group with a lot of
homogeneity, let's say. I got into the business world and said,
where'd these people come from? It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did that lead you to the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I got more interested in desktop publishing technology. I
was always looking for ways to compete with larger media
organizations and that lead me to the Internet. Around 1990, I
started getting this inchoate sense that there was a relationship
between information and technology. That sounds ridiculous now, but
in 1990 not a lot of people I knew were thinking like that. The
Internet just got into my horizon, in subtle ways. A guy I knew
knew a guy who said there was lots of free information out there,
stuff you pay Lexis/Nexis for. I told an intern to find out about
it for me.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually it was just there. It was a presence. I remember
trying to explain this to people in the early 90s, and it was
impossible. You sounded like a crazy person at that point. You were
trying to describe the indescribable, and no one ever got it. I
thought then that there's got to be a book here. I came up with
NetGuide. I saw it as a TV Guide for the Net. Describing the
Internet as a new kind of TV, a new kind of media, which no one was
doing at that point. The book came out in Jan. 1994, within a week,
knew my life had changed. The response to the book was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it too late for regional cities like Atlanta to get
involved in the technology industry in in a big, Silicon Valley
way?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's too late and too early still. I still don't know what's
going to work in this industry. Everybody assumes this certainty,
but it lasts for a limited period. Like electronic commerce. Yeah,
well, e-commerce doesn't work. All the people know is they can sell
products while losing money on them. No one has figured out how to
sell products that make money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What advice do you have for people running start-ups?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's all a matter of your individual goals. If you want to
trade up into a company that you don't control, there's one way. In
my own career, I traded up and shouldn't have. I did not want to be
beholden and under the thumb of other people, even if it meant the
possibility of unlimited wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would you do differently?
</P>
<P>
   A: I shouldn't have expanded as fast. We grew twentyfold. We
went, in four months, from eight employees to 70. Revenue went up,
but losses did too. I took a profitable company making 15 percent
to 20 percent margins into a company that, in a year, lost $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What reaction did you get from the subjects of your book?
</P>
<P>
   A: These guys were so shocked by the book. Never in their
wildest imaginations did they think that this would happen, that
someone would hold them up to the kind of ridicule I held them up
to. It was and is an incredibly sweet revenge. Of all the kinds of
things business people think, they don't think there are people who
will write about them in a completely honest, open and unexpurgated
way. It's quite possibly never happened before in the annals of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the biggest surprise?
</P>
<P>
   A: How much you could make and how much you could lose. And that
I would have been able to turn myself into a business guy. Really,
for me, to be a business guy, to have been able to step forward and
create the industry, meant that no one knew anything.

SEVERAL LAWSUITS CHALLENGE INTERNET ADS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent round of lawsuits, including one from Playboy
Enterprises, threatens to challenge some fundamental assumptions of
Internet advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, no stranger to the courts when it comes to protecting
its famous brand, is suing Netscape Communications and Excitein an
effort to keep banner ads for pornographic, non-Playboy sites from
appearing when Web surfers use either Netscape or Excite to look
for material with the key words ``playboy'' or ``playmate.''
Searching for Playboy magazine on Excite, for example, summons a
come-hither ad from Tease.com.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks before, Estee Lauderfiled a similar lawsuit
against Excite, accusing the search service of trademark
infringement, ``bait and switch'' false advertising and unfair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A search for Estee Lauder on Excite, or on Excite's associated
search provider, Web Crawler, brings up an ad for the Fragrance
Counter _ a retailer that Estee Lauder says is not an authorized
seller of Estee Lauder products. The Fragrance Counter is also
named in the Estee Lauder suit.
</P>
<P>
   Selling advertisers access to so-called key words, so that their
banner ads appear near certain search results based on the key
words _ such as a competitor's brand name _ is widespread in the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in ``Amazon'' on the Lycos search engine, for instance,
may elicit an ad for the bookseller Amazon.com's chief rival,
Barnes &AMP; Noble. Searching for a pair of Levi's jeans with Netscape
may bring up an ad for the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   (To find out just how widely their names are being used in
keyword purchases, companies often use a free service called
Bannerstake _ www.namestake.com _ to display ads associated with
their names.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ad sales based on key words account for roughly a
quarter of the advertising revenue generated by portal and search
sites like Excite _ a category of Web sites that together generated
more than $450 million from advertising, according to Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   If Playboy and Estee Lauder prevail in court, the rules of
Internet advertising would need to be substantially rewritten. ``At
the end of the day, the search engines are selling advertising
against a trademarked name and making a profit on it,'' said Drew
Ianni, a Jupiter analyst. ``Any change would have an impact on the
bottom line.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Can You Play `Feelings' On the Ocarina?
</P>
<P>
   The new Nintendo video game, ``Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of
Time,'' is on pace to become one of the best-selling video games
ever. And its popularity seems to have spawned another craze _
demand for real ocarinas, those flute-like musical instruments that
look like sweet potatoes with finger holes.
</P>
<P>
   In the video game, its elfin hero, Link, travels through time
and the magical world of Hyrule, doing battle with his nemesis,
Ganondorf, to save Princess Zelda. Playing his ocarina transports
Link through time and space.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nintendo fans are transporting themselves on the Web in
search of their own ocarinas. Anita Feng, an artisan in Issaquah,
Wash., who has been making traditional-style ceramic ocarinas for
25 years, has seen her business more than double to about 60
handmade instruments a month, since the Nintendo game was released
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, about three-fourths of my business is from people
who played the game,'' said Ms. Feng, who operates the Anita's
Ocarinas site (www.scn.org/bg599). She said she received five to 10
orders daily, primarily for the 10-hole ocarinas, like the one
played by Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feng said she might have to hire help to handle the new
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The ocarina boomlet brings rare cachet to an instrument believed
to have been invented in the 1860s by an Italian, Guiseppe Donati,
who gave them a name meaning ``little goose.'' But then, rarely has
there been a video game as popular as the latest version of Zelda,
who has been a Nintendo character since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six weeks of 1998, the game sold about 2.5
million units, generating $150 million in revenue. Nintendo is
projecting eventual sales of six million copies or more of Ocarina
in Time.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Feng has seen her business boom, not all ocarina
makers have been as lucky. Charlie Hind, for instance, says he has
seen only a limited increase in ocarina sales at Hind Musical
Instruments (www.germanmarketplace.com/hind.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   Zelda fans may revel in virtual adventures on screen, but when
it comes to ocarinas they seem to demand authenticity. Some have
scoffed at buying Hind's ocarinas, which instead of being ceramic
are made of wood.

EDITORIAL: FREE SPEECH AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state lawmakers may be eager to shield children and
others from smut on the Internet, but it is very difficult to do so
without trampling on the First Amendment. Two recent cases show the
constitutional harm misguided laws can inflict.
</P>
<P>
   One case involves the 1998 federal Child Online Protection Act.
Federal District Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia showed proper
sensitivity to the First Amendment in issuing a preliminary
injunction against enforcement of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The law would require all commercial sites, including free
sites, that contain material that might be deemed ``harmful to
minors'' to obtain credit card numbers or adult identification
numbers from users. Violators could be subject to heavy fines and
up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   This would force Web site operators either to put up age
verification barriers or delete potentially sensitive materials
from Web pages in an effort to avoid possible prosecution. It could
also deter adult Internet users from obtaining access to all kinds
of nonpornographic material because they may not want to lose their
anonymity by entering an identification or credit card number into
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unwisely brushed aside First Amendment concerns in upholding a
Virginia law that prohibits state employees from using office
computers to read or download sexually explicit material on the
Internet without getting written approval from a department head.
Six professors at Virginia's public universities argued that the
law violated their free-speech rights by barring access to all
sexually explicit information on line that could be relevant to
research or teaching. The court, however, ruled that the state
could control the work-related speech of the professors as
employees, including their access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, better options exist. Filtering software can
protect children from on-line pornography more effectively than a
law that infringes on the rights of adults. Similarly, Virginia can
prohibit state employees from using office computers for
non-job-related purposes, without resorting to a content-based
distinction that hurts free speech and limits the legitimate use of
computers by educators.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: What the press has learned
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hate the word ``media.'' I'm a snob. I don't like being lumped
in with Larry Flynt and Matt Drudge. I'm not sure they'd like being
lumped in with me. But, as the Emperor Joseph said in ``Amadeus,''
there it is.
</P>
<P>
   So, now that It is over, what has the mainstream press learned?
(I define ``It,'' in this case, as the impeachment saga.)
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, not an awful lot: Something's out of kilter in the news
trade. The good news doctrines, the ones they have taught in
journalism schools, since the wilder forces of journalism turned
establishment, no longer apply. Good newspapers ask, ``Are you who
you say you are?'' But the question has become harnessed to bad
causes, bad motives. The perpetual search for public hypocrisy
leads grubbily to the perpetual search for personal hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   The public doesn't trust our competence to sort out good from
bad. That makes news decision-making simpler: just let everything
in. But that doesn't work either, one person's great scoop being
another's story that should have been suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The technologies Marshall McLuhan contemplated have taken
charge. One can only trust the marketplace to continue to show
better sense than the heralds of the night. Too many notes.

   For much of the last three decades, to ask the question ``What
is the hottest fad in the media business?'' is to invite the
responding query, ``What is Barry Diller up to now?''
</P>
<P>
   From his start as an ABC programmer, brainstorming
movies-of-the-week in network television's heyday in the early
1970s, Diller found ways to surf the trends of the moment. After
subsequently running Paramount Pictures, he spent most of the 1980s
building Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television into a viable alternative
to the Big Three networks, mining the premise that there was a
younger, hipper audience than ABC, CBS and NBC were delivering to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 90s, running the home-shopping channel QVC and
later the Home Shopping Network, he has demonstrated that
advertising is not the only way to derive revenue from the
remote-control constituency. From there, it was only a mouse-click
or two to the realization that the Internet could be a lot like
what some people used to call interactive TV.
</P>
<P>
   So, Diller was soon extending the Home Shopping Network onto the
World Wide Web. Then he was acquiring the electronic ticketing
agent Ticketmaster and melding it with the city-guide Web company
Citysearch _ even as he was also amassing a more conventional set
of media holdings through his television empire, USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   All this past was prelude to Barry Diller's latest multimedia
move. Last week he proposed a three-way shuffling of high-priced
stock certificates through which Diller hopes to come out
controlling a new company that would combine Lycos, a popular
portal to the World Wide Web, with the electronic shopping holdings
of his current company, USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new operation, to be called the USA Lycos Interactive
Networks, would entertain, inform and sell things to people online,
on television and over the telephone. It was valued at $22 billion
when it was announced on Tuesday, before Wall Street panned the
deal, sending the shares of Lycos _ and the deal's prospects _
tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   That initial investor skepticism does not mean Diller will not
carry out the plan, of course. After all, Diller's best-known
enterprises previously, the Fox Network and QVC, were seen as media
Siberias when he started. But he was able to fire up enough
perceived heat, and real business value, to create the next media
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of mastering both the style and substance of this
deal will be Diller's toughest yet, since he has before never run
something with as many disparate lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry has been brilliant in building the company,'' said John
Tinker an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``He has
done OK in managing it. But now the challenge will be pulling all
this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller argues that the complexity of his new deal reflects a
world in which media companies and retailers are increasingly
intertwined. Significantly, given his continued interest in the
convergence of old, passive media and new, interactive ones, USA
Lycos would aim to make its money as much from retailing as from
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe that there is a new convergence between
information, entertainment and direct selling,'' he said in an
interview last week. ``Once you have the technology for
interactivity, you can have direct selling and you can bypass the
middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller's road to the media shopping mall began in 1992, as he
was looking for a venture after leaving Fox. Diller first noticed
QVC on the recommendation of a friend, the fashion designer Diane
Von Furstenberg. He marveled at QVC's capacity to translate a
focused hour of televised product pitching into a frenzy of
phoned-in sales orders.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no accident that when Diller moved on to the Home
Shopping Network, he became keenly interested the company's small
outpost on the Web, the Internet Shopping Network, which was one of
the first online computer stores. Diller decided that computers had
too low a profit margin, and so he closed the store. But in its
place he created First Auction, a site that offers some of the
costume jewelry and collectibles sold on Home Shopping Network
along with other merchandise like furniture, all of which have much
higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The auction format, which has also been successfully adopted by
Web companies like E-Bay, has transformed shopping on the Internet
from a utilitarian exercise in ordering to the blend of
entertainment and sport that has made TV shopping channels so
successful.
</P>
<P>
   First Auction's sales are now running at a $40 million annual
rate, with few of the costs faced by Internet start-ups because it
can use the warehouses and computer systems of the Home Shopping
Network.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, Diller's efforts to link the Internet and
television have been modest and limited to some First Auction
promotions on the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   He has found few ways to cross-promote his company's television
operations _ the Home Shopping Network and the USA Network, a cable
channel specializing in original series as well as movies, and its
sibling, the Sci-Fi Network. Each network, he says, has a very
different profile _ with Home Shopping appealing to older women and
USA going after a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, analysts give Diller good, if not excellent
grades, for his record of running the companies he has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to the money-losing Home Shopping Network in late
1995, Diller has turned it around. Last year, cash flow _ or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization _
was $330.3 million and revenue of $1.07 billion. Yet, it trails
QVC, which despite reaching one-third fewer homes is expected to
report 1998 revenue of well over $2 billion and cash flow above
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   But making deals may well be Diller's most notable
accomplishment lately. Take his purchase of Ticketmaster, in two
transactions in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after gaining control of Ticketmaster, Diller realized
that the company's small but rapidly growing Internet ticket sales
site was as big as many of the Internet start-ups that were
receiving huge valuations in the stock market. So he split off that
business as Ticketmaster Online and merged it with Citysearch, a
somewhat struggling effort to create Web-based local entertainment
guides in major cities that had been started by an eccentric
entrepreneur, Bill Gross.
</P>
<P>
   With a combination of good timing and sales panache, Diller was
able to sell 10 percent of Ticketmaster Online Citysearch in
December in a public stock offering at $14 a share. Its shares
subsequently rose as high as $80, although they are now less than
half that, closing Friday at $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Still, USA's portion is worth about $1.6 billion, far more than
the $610 million it paid for all of Ticketmaster. In fact, it is
the high market value of Ticketmaster Online's stock that has given
Diller the chips to raise his stakes in the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Diller was worried about other big media companies activities
online _ like the Walt Disney Co.'s effort to tie all of its media
properties into one all-encompassing Internet portal, the Go
Network. Among many other things, Go intends to offer the sort of
local information that Citysearch does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat around watching what Disney was doing,'' Diller said,
``and said if we don't get a relationship with a national portal,
our desire to play a big game will be toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller began talking with a number of portal providers, and
three weeks ago started talks with Lycos, which had been conducting
its own public search for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Diller proposed merging Ticketmaster Online Citysearch
with Lycos. But the conversations soon expanded to include First
Auction and then the rest of the Home Shopping Network _ along with
the old-fashioned, telephone-sales portion of Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we had to put HSN in with all its merchandizing
power and ability to be a real retailer on the Net,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of $1.5 billion in shopping revenue particularly
appealed to Robert Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, which is
based in Framingham, Mass. He has long prided himself on having a
New England frugality that contrasts sharply with the Internet new
math practiced by many of his Silicon Valley competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos, Yahoo, Excite and the rest have been all dependent on
pure advertising revenue,'' Davis said in an interview last week.
``We believe that by moving to having more commerce and transaction
revenue, we can have real earnings fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the new game plan looked disappointing to holders of Lycos
stock, which plummeted on word of the deal. Lycos shareholders had
hoped that the company would be acquired for a big premium, the way
that the portal Excite recently sold itself to the Internet-cable
company At Home for nearly double Excite's stock market price. Even
CMGI Inc., the investment company that took Lycos public in 1996
and still owns 20 percent of it, hinted it might vote against the
deal if the company's stock stayed low.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Lycos had bounced back somewhat. But it ended the
week at $99.50, down 22 percent from its price before the deal was
announced on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, even the initial enthusiasm of USA Networks'
shareholders seemed to have faded, as the stock closed on Friday at
$38 _ 12.5 cents higher than they were last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Diller contends that any recalcitrant Lycos shareholders do not
understand the deal, which he said would give them something rare _
a stake in an Internet company with real revenues and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining pieces of USA Networks, Diller has definite
plans to go on a shopping spree to build it into a bigger, more
conventional media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see us looking for opportunities to add cable
networks, broadcast stations and probably film production and
distribution,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   But Diller's history of testing the outer boundaries of
new-media models suggests that he will not be content to
concentrate solely on conventional film, cable and broadcasting. If
he can get Wall Street to endorse last week's USA Lycos deal,
Diller would control an Internet company with a market
capitalization in excess of $20 billion.

TICKETMASTER AND MICROSOFT SETTLE SUIT ON INTERNET LINKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ticketmaster, a unit of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc., has
settled its two-year-old lawsuit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parties agreed not to disclose the terms of the
settlement, executives said the agreement did resolve the suit's
central issue _ whether Microsoft's Sidewalk online city guides
could bypass many of Ticketmaster's advertising-laden Web pages and
link Sidewalk users directly to the ticket-purchase portions of
Ticketmaster's site.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Conn, chief executive of Ticketmaster's Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch business, said that Microsoft had agreed to no
longer link Sidewalk to pages deep within the Ticketmaster site,
where visitors might not even realize they were using
Ticketmaster's services.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the settlement, the Sidewalk guides will now
point visitors who want to purchase tickets directly to the
Ticketmaster home page _ where Ticketmaster will have ample
opportunity to bathe them in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides came to terms on Jan. 22, but had not announced
the settlement. Conn disclosed the deal in an interview late last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been widely watched for its potential to establish
a legal precedent on the intellectual property rights of Internet
companies. But with an out-of-court settlement, the online industry
remains without legal guidelines on the practice of so-called deep
linking, of which Microsoft was by no means the only practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster filed suit in April 1997 in a federal court in
California, arguing that Microsoft had ``pilfered'' its content and
therefore diluted its value. At the time, Ticketmaster had recently
signed a deal with Citysearch, which, like Microsoft's Sidewalk
guides, provides information about local news, merchants and
entertainment in various cities. In that deal Citysearch was
essentially paying Ticketmaster for the right to do what Microsoft
was doing free.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster, which was acquired by Diller's company in 1997,
merged its online division with Citysearch last September to create
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.
</P>
<P>
   In its legal defense, Microsoft had argued that Ticketmaster's
stance breached an unwritten Internet code in which any Web site
operator has the right to link to anyone else's site. Microsoft
also based its defense on what it said was its First Amendment
right to publish public information.
</P>
<P>
   But with the settlement, those in the industry looking for the
federal court's guidance were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's in the best interest of the parties, but for the
purpose of providing meaningful guidance to the Internet community,
this is the worst news I've heard all day,'' Jeffrey Kuester, an
Internet law specialist and a partner in the Atlanta law firm
Thomas, Kayden, Horstemeyer &AMP; Risley, said when told of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to hear some good, broad, general language from
the court,'' Kuester said. ``Now, do we know if deep linking is
bad? Is linking to a main home page OK? Is it just not OK to link?
We don't know.''

MICROSOFT DENIES RUMORS THAT IT IS CRAFTING A LANGUAGE LIKE JAVA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. is playing down a report in Monday's PC
Week, a trade magazine, that the software giant has been briefing
software developers on a new programming language that would be
similar to Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java software, but free of
technological or licensing obligations to Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun recently won a court order blocking Microsoft from shipping
products containing Microsoft's own version of Java, which Sun
claims has been altered to work only with Microsoft Windows, thus
thwarting the so-called cross-platform capability designed into the
language. Cross platform means that a developer can write one
version of a program in Java, which can then run on Windows,
Macintosh, Unix and other software operating systems. Microsoft is
appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why software developers, who have embraced Java
enthusiastically, would be interested in a new programming
language. But analysts predicted that Microsoft would work hard to
win the role of intellectual leadership that a dominant programming
language confers within the developer community. And it is Java and
its steaming coffee cup logo _ not Windows _ that are synonymous
with the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The PC Week article quoted unnamed software developers who said
they had been briefed on a Java language alternative code-named
``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the developers offered any details about the
nature of such a program, not even whether or not it would be
cross-platform. The article, which was heavily promoted by PC
Week's public relations staff late last week, offered no clue as to
what the product really is, who would use it or when it would ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems Microsoft at this point is not willing to give more
than a broad outline,'' said Eric Lundquist, PC Week's editor in
chief. ``It may be it is something they're working on in their labs
and they're trying to get feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Risse, Microsoft's product manager for application
development tools, said Cool was simply one of a number of new
ideas under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we discussed something like this? Yes. Are we developing
anything? No, we are not,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of 800 employees in the development tools unit, ``not one _
zero, nada _ is working on or developing any new language,'' he
said. ``That's the case today and for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Poulson, a spokeswoman for Sun, said that rumors had been
circulating for two years that Microsoft was at work on a so-called
universal virtual machine that would conceivably enable its
operating systems or applications to run Java programs without
employing any Java technology themselves. Such a piece of code
would fall far short of a new language, but Microsoft already has
two programming languages, C++ and Visual Basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separately, they did ask the judge if they could build
independently developed works, and they were specific in their
court papers about a compiler,'' Ms. Poulson said. A compiler is a
programming tool that converts high-level languages, like C++ or
Java, into the machine code of ones and zeros that computers
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Whyte, of United States District Court in San Jose,
Calif., has not yet ruled on Microsoft's request. But at any rate,
Risse said the concept called Cool is unconnected to the lawsuit.

Virtual birds, dating tips come courtesy of e-mail 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a moment of abject stupidity, which is several
degrees dumber than my normal state of simple stupidity, I allowed
the whole world of public relations agents to access my e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, my mailbox is constantly stuffed with rubbish that
I never read past the first paragraph; at times the subject heading
is enough to prompt erasure.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often come gems of such surpassing brilliance that
I cannot but share them with you. The first came from an
all-purpose flack, or public relations agent, from whom I hear
several times weekly. Now, I did not make up what follows; I
haven't changed a word of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can have a personal computer valet,'' he writes. ``For
under $100, you can command an animated parrot with built-in speech
recognition to navigate PC programs, monitor stocks, call friends
and associates over the Internet via a built-in Internet phone,
issue meeting reminders, warn of unexpected events on the stock
market and report news and weather. It is called Prody. If you
don't have a best friend, this is the closest thing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can arrange a demo.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for me, you can't. I've had parrots. Parrots have large,
cruel beaks. They have voices, equaled only by those of a couple of
White House reporters I once knew, capable of cutting through a
quartet of jackhammers. I once observed a parrot clamber down from
its perch, work its way to the top of our breakfast table, sidle up
to my father's dinner plate and seize his hamburger steak. Dragged
that ground beef all the way back to the edge of the table and was
about to heave it over the side when Dad caught on.
</P>
<P>
   My computer gives me enough trouble now. I sure don't need it
coming on with a virtual parrot screeching, ``Prody wants a
megabyte!'' I don't have many friends, and I doubt I would keep
them by having my virtual parrot call them up at odd hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I want ornithological hysteria the next time my 401(k)
takes a torpedo amidships.
</P>
<P>
   The same day I was offered a parrot demo, I got a book
announcement. The book is entitled ``How To Juggle Women,'' and
that intrigued me, because even after a year on the Internet this
is a fetish I'd never discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, I misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is an essential guide for the seasoned dating man
who needs help organizing the women in his life,'' the announcement
said. ``Women are constantly grabbing your interest and attention.
Do you have to choose one over the other? Of course not! Stop
letting opportunities like these go to waste. Why not date them
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``You will learn time-saving techniques that will maximize your
availability, and allow you to spend time with several ladies a
day. The author details scheduling methods so you never have two
dates at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, women are certainly grabbing my interest and attention all
the time, and I could use some help organizing the women in my
life, chiefly my wife. My daughters and my granddaughters seem
pretty well organized.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the book will be of little use, since my dating
days ended 42 years ago this week, and I was scarcely what you'd
call seasoned. I manage to spend time with several ladies a day,
usually without making any of them mad, and without having to get
involved in tedious things like dating. They're friends, and as
long as I don't unleash virtual parrots upon them or buy books on
girl-juggling, they may remain so.

MARKET PLACE: THE INSIDE EDGE IN INTERNET STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic on Active Apparel Group stock is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Christmas, shares of Active Apparel Group, a clothing
wholesaler, were swept up in the market enthusiasm for retailers
doing business on the Internet. Active Apparel promoted its
Internet debut in a news release and on CNBC, and though the
company had not yet sold any goods in cyberspace _ indeed, its Web
site was not up and running when the first release went out _
investors bid up the stock as high as $25, from $1.25 on Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several officers and directors took advantage of the
stock's surge to sell close to $1 million of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   After those sales, the price of Active Apparel shares quickly
fell back into the single digits. On Friday, they closed at
$4.6875, meaning investors who still own shares bought during the
frenzied days of late December have big losses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Active Apparel nor the insiders who sold have been
accused of any wrongdoing. But for the buyers of those shares, it
was a painful lesson, and not an isolated one. Outside investors do
not always fare as well as insiders when companies advance on
Internet euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   The tide that has lifted Internet stocks the last few months has
brought with it plenty of flotsam _ companies with only the most
tenuous connections to the Internet but whose shares were bid up as
if they were the next Yahoo or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the tide recedes and even the biggest Internet stocks
fall sharply from their highs, some investors find themselves with
the equivalent of driftwood _ stocks in companies whose insiders
have bailed out at higher prices and in companies whose promoters
issued ``research reports'' because they were paid to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, insiders of companies that issue new stock to the
public agree not to sell for a ``lock-up'' period of up to six
months. But companies that are already publicly traded and that
suddenly announce an Internet plan are not under the same
restrictions. That makes investors particularly vulnerable to a
downdraft caused by insider selling.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken action against
some companies and promoters that have not fully disclosed their
practices, and regulators are warning investors to proceed with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``More companies, legitimate and illegitimate, seem to be
getting onto the Internet every day,'' said Chris Ullman, an SEC
spokesman. ``Technological developments have made it so that it
doesn't take much to set up a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newly christened Internet companies, of course, may
bounce back from recent stock declines. Active Apparel, for
example, now has a fully operating Web site. Its stock, which had
been threatened with delisting from Nasdaq's biggest market when
its market value fell below Nasdaq's requirements, is trading on
Nasdaq's smaller, less prestigious small-cap market.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Marbach, an outside spokesman for the company, said that
the recent stock sales by insiders are no reflection on the
company's prospects. In most cases, the sales represented only a
small portion of their total holdings, Marbach said, and some
insiders have bought stock the last year in addition to exercising
options and selling stock.
</P>
<P>
   Those explanations are not likely to comfort individuals who
bought Active Apparel stock at high prices when insiders were
selling, however. ``Give me hope!'' wrote one such investor, a
California woman who goes by the screen name ``Portofoy,'' on the
Yahoo message board for Active Apparel stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, folks, I bought AAGP at 22, repeat 22,'' she added,
referring to Active Apparel's stock symbol. ``Too much caffeine
that morning, I guess. Is there hope? Should I hold on? I'm hurtin'
for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, timing is everything in the fast-moving, volatile
world of Internet stocks. And insiders have key advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Connect Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., company that
distributes software allowing companies to sell goods over the
Internet. On Nov. 30, as investors heard reports of the crowds
flocking to Internet shopping sites over the Thanksgiving weekend,
shares of Connect, which has since changed its name to
Connectinc.com, soared to more than $15, up from less than $2 the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks later, after the shares fell back into the single
digits, was it revealed that on the very day that its stock price
soared, insiders sold nearly 1.5 million shares, at prices ranging
from $5.63 to $12.44.
</P>
<P>
   Greigory Park, the company's chief financial officer, said the
sales were timed ``to take advantage of a run in the stock that was
pretty much speculation-based.'' He said the company had issued no
news to account for the sixfold increase in its stock price. ``The
run in the stock was a complete surprise to everybody here,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company was under notice from Nasdaq that its
stock might be delisted because the company had only $1.1 million
in net tangible assets, versus the $4 million minimum Nasdaq
requires.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's efforts to raise money to put it in compliance
with the listing requirement came at a much more lumbering pace
than that insiders displayed when they were selling their own
shares in November.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Connectinc.com raised $4 million from new
institutional investors in a private sale on Jan. 20, the price was
a mere $2.60 a share. That was far less than the $6 the stock was
fetching in the open market at the time and less than half what
insiders had reaped weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Park said the company opted to sell the shares at such a
discount because it wanted to satisfy the Nasdaq listing
requirements as soon as possible. ``Yes, the institutional
investors got a better price than the average investor could have
gotten in the market, but individuals weren't being asked to come
up with one and a half million dollars each,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Park said, the company's sale of shares was
unrelated to the sale of personal holdings by insiders several
weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company's stock had been publicly traded for more
than two years, its insiders were not under the same restrictions
that often govern newly public companies, like the many
Internet-related companies that have gone public in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders at newly public companies usually agree with their
underwriters to refrain from selling additional shares for up to
six months. That ``lock up'' period gives buyers confidence that
millions of additional shares will not flood the market, depressing
the stock's price, and that managements are in it for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   But once the lock-up period expires, the psychological drain can
deflate a stock, whether or not actual selling follows. Take, for
example, Broadcast.com, which feeds audio and video broadcasts over
the Internet and which went public last July, selling 2.5 million
shares. The owners of its other 14.5 million shares agreed not to
sell any of their holdings for 180 days. (The shares have since
split two-for-one.)
</P>
<P>
   Beginning late last month, two big holders and early backers of
the company, Intel and Motorola, filed to sell shares. On the days
those filings became public, Broadcast's share price fell sharply,
although it has since rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   At $68.87, it remains far above the initial offering price of
$9, after accounting for the split, but is well below the high of
$144.75 reached on Jan. 12, before the insiders registered their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently wrong with insiders turning their
hard-earned shares into cash, of course. But unlike with recent
IPOs, selling by insiders at companies that have long been public
is much less transparent to the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Internet has speeded up the rhythms and cycles of
corporate life and investment, the quick rise of Internet stocks
has brought a flurry of regulatory actions against companies
promoting their alleged Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the SEC filed 23 enforcement actions against 44
individuals and companies across the country, charging that they
used the Internet to fraudulently promote the companies or their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern of regulators has been over promoters who
are paid a fee to publicize a company's Internet connections, but
which do not disclose that fact to investors. And even when a
service discloses that it might have been paid such a fee, the
disclaimer is sometimes so far away from the stock tips that an
investor could be confused about the fee or could miss it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   One example of that trend is the Internet Stock Review, a web
site that provides information about companies involved in
electronic commerce and other Internet-realted businesses. In
January, the Internet Stock Review published a list of ``20
companies to watch during 1999.'' The aim of the list, according to
a press release, ``is to bring attention to the names and or to the
existence of these companies (many of which have no coverage on
Wall Street),'' and then to have investors decide on their own
whether to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Several names on the list are well-known companies like Borders
Group, the bookstore chain; Fingerhut, the catalog retailer that
last week agreed to be acquired by Federated Department Stores; and
Federal Express, which delivers many of the goods bought over the
Internet. None of these companies went to any lengths to show up on
the list. But sprinkled on the list are upstarts like Aim-Smart,
which provides access to Internet shopping sites, and other small
companies like AllNetServices, Dynamic Media.com and MediaX _ all
of which have paid the owner of the Internet Stock Review to
publicize them.
</P>
<P>
   The press release notes that certain companies listed are
``client companies,'' and invites readers to read the disclaimer on
the web site. That disclaimer states that the list is not a buy
list, and notes that for services to certain companies, ``payment
at the time of engagement in each instance was valued at less than
$250,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are not told, however, that since the report on
``companies to watch'' was issued, 1.5 million shares of Aim-Smart
restricted stock have been registered for sale by its owners,
legally the only hint public shareholders may get that a sale of
stock might be afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Perry, who operates Perry &AMP; Co., the public relations
company that publishes the Internet Stock Review, says he believes
the service's disclosures about its compensation are adequate.
Perry &AMP; Co. has not been accused by the SEC of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys try to hide it,'' Perry said. ``We're proud of
what we do. We're not a buy-sell service,'' but simply one that
points investors to places to begin their own research.
</P>
<P>
   But even the SEC admits that it is becoming much harder for
investors to distinguish between the real and the unreal when it
comes to investments in Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the messages that came out of the October sweep is that
just because something is on the Internet doesn't mean it is
legitimate,'' said Ullman of the SEC. ``Something can be the
equivalent of a boiler room but on the Internet it can look as
impressive as a Fortune 500 company.''

US TINKY STINK MAKES BRITISH WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Most Britons greeted the outings of three gay Cabinet
ministers in recent months with stifled yawns. But when the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, the American televangelist, outed one of the
Teletubbies this past week, the country responded with guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on stupidity among Americans is a favorite pastime
here, and because of Falwell, the Brits had no shortage of fodder
last week.
</P>
<P>
   News broke here on Thursday that Falwell had warned readers of
his National Liberty Journal under a ``Parents Alert'' to guard
their children against the influence of Tinky Winky, the largest of
the four Teletubbies, the British import that has become a staple
on US public television.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said that Tinky Winky was a closet gay role model, part
of what he considers an insidious campaign to brainwash the masses
into accepting that homosexuals are normal.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Falwell cited Tinky Winky's color, purple, which he
said is the gay pride color, and the triangle antenna on Tinky
Winky's head, again a symbol of gay pride. And, Falwell pointed
out, while Tinky Winky mumbles in the voice of a male, the purple
Teletubby at times carries a handbag.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a spokesman for Ragdoll Productions, which created
``Teletubbies'' and distributes it in the United States, said he
was perplexed by Falwell's conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   First, the gay pride color in Britain is pink, not purple. And
Tinky Winky's accessory is a magic bag, not a handbag. As for the
antenna, the spokesman suggested that Falwell, or anyone else
predisposed to creating controversy, could make all sorts of
insinuating accusations about the antennae of the other
Teletubbies. Dipsy's, for example, could be viewed as phallic.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC, which broadcasts ``Teletubbies'' in Britain and
distributes them internationally, issued a statement saying,
``Teletubbies is an entertainment and innocent program for
preschool children to enjoy. Any symbolism people may find in it is
of their own making.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Falwell's accusations against Tinky Winky are just off
color, Tinky Winky is no stranger to controversy. In 1997, David
Thompson, the British actor who first wore the Tinky Winky costume,
was fired because, as Ragdoll and the BBC put it at the time, ``his
interpretation of the role was not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   It emerged that one of Thompson's hobbies was ``naked balloon
dancing,'' whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of sex, watching the Teletubbies is a
mind-numbing experience. It takes a vivid imagination to find
anything sexual about them. The Teletubbies, who wear no clothes
but show no signs of genitalia, are gentle creatures who speak in
gibberish _ like the preschoolers who form their audience. They
often engage in communal affection, known in Teletubby parlance as
``big hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, teenagers and young adults have been known to take
drugs and hold parties watching tapes of the Teletubbies. Some
critics here have suggested the underlying theme of the children's
series is not sex, but the ingestion of prodigious amounts of
hallucinogens.
</P>
<P>
   No one here had ever complained about the supposed sexual
content of the Teletubbies, or more specifically that Tinky Winky
was gay. That is, until Falwell piped up.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits, meanwhile, are beside themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, they say, until Falwell finds out that the actress who
plays Po is Pui Fan Lee, a Chinese left-wing radical.

MICHIGAN SENATOR REFLECTS GOP DESIRE TO MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ He blended into the background of impeachment, most
notable for his alphabetical role of being the first to vote. But
the minute the trial was over, Senator Spencer Abraham seemed
poised to become a star of the next Republican cause.
</P>
<P>
   Because by Saturday, Abraham was talking issues _ specifically,
tax cuts _ and uttering the now-ubiquitous phrase ``time to move
on.'' And as he waited to board a plane back to Detroit he acted as
though business had already returned to normal _ co-opting, it
seemed, the political strategy of President Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal, I think, really, is just to get some debate going in
Michigan about tax issues,'' said Abraham, 46, as he sat in a
terminal at Reagan National Airport. ``We've actually got a budget
surplus, not just because of Social Security but also because of
the so-called operating budget as well. So I think it's a real fair
time to talk about how we handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, after watching their members suffer in the
polls and in last November's elections as a result of impeachment,
have made no secret of their determination to move on to other
things. During a weekend retreat in Williamsburg, Va., earlier this
month, Republican House members were admonished for lacking a
strategy on anything but impeachment. On Saturday, at a conference
in Miami, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman told other
Republicans that the public views the party as ``mean-spirited,
vindictive, not attending to the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a party identity crisis, Republicans seem to
fear its effects will be felt in Michigan, particularly by Abraham,
who as a one-term Republican has no guarantee of a solid future in
the Senate. Clinton is quite popular, winning Michigan with 52
percent of the vote in 1996. Impeachment, on the other hand, is not
popular: 64 percent were opposed to the process, according to a
poll taken last November.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, the first Republican senator elected in Michigan in two
decades, already faces some formidable Democratic opponents in his
2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Feiger, best known as the lawyer for Jack Kevorkian,
the assisted suicide doctor, and for his own failed gubernatorial
bid, has said he will ``of course'' turn impeachment into a
campaign issue against Abraham. Any raising of impeachment might
help other potential candidates, including Detroit Mayor Dennis
Archer and former governor Jim Blanchard, simply because they are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, according to a January poll taken in Lansing,
impeachment would play a marginal role in an election at best, and
42 percent of those polled said they would not consider impeachment
a deciding factor if Abraham voted to convict and remove Clinton,
as he did last Friday on both articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Even in working-class areas around Detroit, where most voters
are Democrats, several people said impeachment would be irrelevant
in the next race. Tom McGee, 60, a retired phone splicer and former
union president, said he ``wouldn't have voted for Abraham no
matter what he did with impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Candida Davis, 44, a nurse, said she ``would
have to focus on what his character is, outside of what he did on
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jen VanDusen, 28, a marketing services
specialist at the Ford Motor Co., said she would never consider
voting against Abraham in favor of a Democrat, and certainly ``not
specifically'' because of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't affect the way I vote,'' said VanDusen, a
Republican who voted for Abraham in the last election. ``Although I
did like that he voted guilty. I would support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are signs Republican leaders are concerned
about the 2000 elections, including Abraham's. Chief among them:
Majority leader Trent Lott flew to Michigan for a town meeting, the
first of several dozen Republican gatherings planned in the coming
weeks. Michigan Governor John Engler, who is popular and a close
friend of Abraham's, is also scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham did not seek out the town meeting: He has other genuine
concerns now that impeachment is over, including a set of
5-year-old twins and a 2-year-old. He also has a legitimate claim
to discussing taxes instead of the trial. Although he attended
Harvard Law School, where he founded the conservative Federalist
Society, Abraham is known in the Senate for his work on the Budget
Committee. These days, that role is the one he would prefer to
emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran for Senate, I made a lot of pledges about getting
the budget balanced, and was met with the cynicism one might
expect,'' he said. ``But I got a seat on the Budget Committee. The
budget's balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' he added, ``the impeachment trial is over, so we
have to move on. I haven't met anyone on either side of the aisle
who says, `Let's rehash impeachment.' So the question is: Do we
move ahead legislatively or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham's legislative battles may be as fierce as impeachment.
He is given credit for suggesting a 15 percent across-the-board tax
cut to Bob Dole, who used it in his unsuccessful 1996 presidential
bid. Now that Republicans are promoting a similar across-the-board
cut, there appears to be plenty of room for political attacks on
Republicans, including Abraham, over issues alone. Lott also backs
the plan, which is seen by Democrats as favoring the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Guests on the Sunday talk shows made that clear. White House
Chief of Staff John Podesta, appearing on ABC's ``This Week with
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' said Clinton planned to address
the issue of tax cuts with congressional leaders when they return
from a one-week recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be plenty of things to fight about,''
Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham seemed eager to get to those battles, almost denying the
possibility that constituents would ask him about impeachment
today. If the question does arise, he said he would be ``obviously
happy to talk about the vote, if that comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I think this is more of a tax focus,'' he said.

WORRY ON KOSOVO REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Before he began these latest peace talks, President
Jacques Chirac told the warring factions in Kosovo that their
barbarity against each other was anti-European.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac told the ethnic Albanians and Serbs that war had taught
the rest of Europe that compromise with one's historical enemies
was not only more courageous than waging war, but was also more
beneficial to Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   But another reason why the European governments are determined
to resolve the conflict in Kosovo was to be found outside the
wrought iron gates of the chateau at Rambouillet, where the talks
are being held.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, many of them wrapped in the
blood-red flag of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, milled
around the streets, shouting slogans in support of the guerrillas,
unnerving locals in village cafes. Some of the protesters said they
were living in France, while others, asked where they lived,
shouted out several other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Kosovo has forced or encouraged hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee Kosovo in the last year,
either for sanctuary or a better way of life. Every European
country has seen a surge in the number of Kosovars seeking asylum,
especially Germany and Switzerland, where established Albanian
communities have swelled with refugees from the rebellious
province.
</P>
<P>
   According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, more than
300,000 people have been displaced in Kosovo in the year that has
passed since Serbian authorities crushed an uprising by the Kosovo
Liberation Army. About 2,000 civilians have been killed in the
conflict, most of them ethnic Albanians, and mostly at the hands of
Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of those displaced, about 210,000, are still in
Kosovo, living with family or friends. Another 45,000 have
resettled in other parts of Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics that make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 are scattered throughout Europe, more than half of
them in Germany, where about 35,250 have applied for asylum, and in
Switzerland, where 21,520 are seeking shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the applications for asylum are in countries that have
long been havens for political refugees, such as Germany,
Switzerland, and Britain, which also have established Albanian
communities with an informal support system. But the conflict in
Kosovo has also badly stretched the resources of countries not used
to large influxes of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The number of asylum applications in Hungary, for example, went
from 1,100 in 1997 to 7,400 last year, nearly half of that total
coming from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to accommodate the surge of asylum seekers from
Kosovo, officials in the Netherlands have been forced to limit the
number of countries from which they will consider applications.
Last year, the number of asylum seekers there rose from 34,000 to
48,000, with refugees from Kosovo accounting for almost a third of
the increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch were embarrassed last year when they were forced to
house hundreds of asylum seekers in tents because they ran out of
indoor accommodations. But they and other European governments fear
they will be forced to implement similar stopgap measures unless a
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are fleeing persecution at the hands of Serbian
authorities, widely viewed as the aggressors in the conflict,
Kosovo Albanians are presumed to be entitled to asylum in most
European countrie, even though the Kosovo Liberation Army has
promoted conflict with the Serb authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Maki Shinohara, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva, said refugees from Kosovo ``are being
tolerated'' throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appealed to governments in Western Europe to deal with
asylum requests from Kosovo individually, and that even if they are
rejected not to send them back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara said those deported to Serbia would face persecution.
Kosovo Albanians say they would face death.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara said there is no guarantee that the fate of Kosovo
refugees will be part of any agreement, should one emerge from
Rambouillet. Although the UN is not represented at the
negotiations, Shinohara's office gave its position after it was
provided an advance copy of the framework document that US envoy
Christopher Hill drafted for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue for us is amnesty,'' she said. ``In
principle, most refugees could go home if there was a settlement.
But many of them fear persecution when they return.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, more than three years after the Dayton agreement
ended the war there, getting refugees to return to areas that
became ethnically homogenous remains one of the biggest challenges.
Kosovo, however, could be easier because its population of 2
million is 90 percent ethnically Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   But, diplomats and humanitarian groups agree, safeguards for
refugees must be part of a final deal if there is a realistic
chance of luring back many of the 100,000 refugees who have left
the Balkans for continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While the armed conflict has accelerated the flight of refugees
from Kosovo, there has been a steady exodus from there since 1989,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ended Kosovo's autonomy.
Thousands of ethnic Albanians were thrown out of work, others
thrown into prison as suspected subversives. Many decided to seek a
better life abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is an example of the larger picture. Only 10 years ago,
government figures show there were only about 30 Albanians living
in London. Today, there are as many as 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Albanians crowd into the Lisi restaurant in Maida
Vale, northwest London, to catch the news from Tirana beamed in via
a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what's going on back home,'' said Ilir, 23, a
refugee who said he was from near Pristina, the Kosovo capital, but
refused to give more information, saying he feared Serbian
authorities, not to mention the British, who are still
investigating his asylum application.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, which borders on the Serbian province of Kosovo, is the
poorest country in Europe. A growing number of native Albanians
have begun to falsely claim they are from Kosovo in an attempt to
win asylum, say officials at the British government's Home Office.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara said the Albanian dialect spoken by Kosovars is
different from that in Albania. ``A language test would identify
the fakers pretty quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir, who spoke authoritatively about Pristina, naming cafes and
characters there, said he found it incomprehensible that people
would falsely claim to be from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are from Kosovo,'' he said, his head down, ``that means
someone in your family or your friends have been killed.''

GUN MAKERS TAKE A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not a blast through its heart, but anytime a wounded
handgun industry hops on one leg, it makes my day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal jury in New York City found that 15 of 25
gun makers had marketing and distribution practices that fueled
illegal trade from states with weak gun laws to states that are
much more strict. The jury further found that 9 of those 15 were
liable in at least one street shooting.
</P>
<P>
   One could easily be confused by the reaction to the ruling. The
gun industry acted as if it had won. The lawsuit had been brought
forward by the families of victims of seven shootings. The jury
found that gun makers were liable in three of the shootings and
awarded money in only one, a sum that will probably end up being
about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With damages awarded in only one of the seven shootings, gun
lawyers immediately said the verdict was so weak, the judge should
throw it out. ``There's no rhyme or reason to this jury's
verdict,'' said gun lawyer John Renzulli. ``It makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs were almost ecstatic. It was the first time gun
makers were ever found the least bit liable for putting a product
onto the streets that could easily end up in the hands of a killer.
``It was never about the money,'' said one of the plaintiffs, Diane
Zaretsky, who lost her husband to gunfire five years ago. ``It was
about shared responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a jury finally forced the gun makers to share
responsibility for the crippling and fatal results of their
products is one of the most encouraging breakthroughs in the
gun-control debate to date. Until now, gun makers have been as
invulnerable as Big Tobacco from lawsuits, hiding behind its
antiquated interpretation of the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But the science that links cigarettes with cancer, the
statistics that connect guns to blood on the streets, and the
common sense that marketing them as instruments of glamour and
power makes them all the more alluring has begun to win juries
over.
</P>
<P>
   On the same front page last Friday in which The New York Times
reported the gun verdict, there was also a feature about the
stunning $51.5 million verdict against Philip Morris in a lawsuit
brought by a woman who developed lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is not just happening in the juror room, but in the
general way people think about the industry,'' said Stanford
University law professor Robert Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin meant that about cigarettes, but the same could be applied
to guns. A Harris poll last year found that 69 percent of all
Americans and even 57 percent of gun owners want tighter laws on
gun control. Several cities, such as Chicago, New Orleans, Miami
and Bridgeport, Conn., have filed suits against gun makers. Cities
such as Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia are on the verge of
filing suits, charging gun makers with negligence in either
marketing or manufacture. The cities want to recoup medical and
police costs costs due to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The defiant Make My Day gun lobby, a lobby that once could stop
serious gun control with political contributions and sheer voting
strength, has been forced to scramble. Last week, the lobby
succeeded in getting Georgia to enact a law preventing its cities
from suing gun makers. Atlanta had filed such a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next year, I think we can probably get 25 or 30 more
states to do the same thing,'' said James Baker, director of the
National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker admitted that Georgia, where the NRA claims 93,000
members, is one of its stronger states. The prospects for getting
much more urbanized states to do the same thing are much more
uncertain unless governors like Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and
John Rowland of Connecticut cave in to the sure-to-come ploy of
lost jobs at Smith and Wesson and Colt (what are lost jobs compared
to lost lives?).
</P>
<P>
   Just as uncertain is how gun makers will be able to handle
either sustained multiple litigations, let alone substantial jury
awards.
</P>
<P>
   The American gun industry is nowhere as solvent as Big Tobacco.
Despite their annual carnage (35,000 homicides, suicides and
accidents involve a gun), yearly US gun sales are between $2
billion and $3 billion, which pales next to the $72 billion by
Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the two cooperative cigarette makers, gun makers are
historically preoccupied with outdueling each other's firepower.
Robert Ricker, a top aide of the American Shooting Sports Council,
frets that such an uncoordinated industry may not have the
``horsepower to deal with national litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before have handgun makers hopped this hard. Never before
do they seem so afraid of being knocked off their feet. A few more
wounds like this, and they just might be convinced not to be so
eager to contribute to the nation's carnage.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good day when the gun industry is forced to consider
that the person saying ``Make My Day'' is not Charles Bronson, but
a woman like Diane Zaretsky, who will take the killing no more.

ROBITAILLE GETS HIS SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's never been any doubt about Randy Robitaille's offense.
The center scores in bunches, and this season for Providence, he is
leading the American Hockey League with 72 points (21 goals, 51
assists).
</P>
<P>
   In the last 15 games, Robitaille had 28 points (8 goals), and he
was the AHL's Player of the Week with 10 points in four games last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping he can bring some of that offense with him from
Providence, the struggling Bruins have called up Robitaille (and
forward Landon Wilson) as they prepare to play the Senators in
Ottawa Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I want to be and I'm happy to get the
opportunity, and hopefully I can make the best of it,'' said
Robitaille, who was up for four games with Boston last season. ``I
can't be nervous playing my game. I want to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille is a native of Ottawa and will have plenty of family
members and friends at the Corel Centre in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to make as few mistakes as possible,'' he said, ``but
if I do make a mistake, I won't get down on myself. Hopefully, I'll
have the confidence to go back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could use a spark. They are in ninth place in the
Eastern Conference _ 1 point from eighth, the final playoff spot _
with 28 games remaining. Ottawa is first in the Northeast Division,
second in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottawa is a great team, but we've got guys here who can get
the job done,'' said Robitaille, who scored a team-record five
goals for the Baby B's in a 14-2 rout of Syracuse Nov. 25. ``I'm
just trying to carry over what's going on down in Providence, by
coming here with a good attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Robitaille missed the final 29 games of the AHL
season after breaking his leg. After a so-so training camp, he
seems to have gotten better with experience this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were waiting for my game to come along and we're up at
the right time, my game is feeling good,'' he said. ``I'm getting
stronger and I've worked on my defensive game.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who will skate on a line between Cameron Mann and
Ken Baumgartner, doesn't think there will be a great deal of
pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the older guys are looking to the younger guys
to lead this team, they're just expecting us to chip in and work
hard for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will be his sixth NHL game; his first was against the
New York Islanders in 1996-97, when, on his first shift, he was
belted behind the net by Ken Belanger. Robitaille separated his
shoulder and missed the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's on my team now,'' Robitaille said. ``It's just
the way it happened, on my first shift. I'm sure we'll joke about
it later.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's status may be in doubt. He did not practice Tuesday and
was being examined for an ailment that may be appendicitis . . .
Defenseman Kyle McLaren is ready to get back to work after missing
14 games with a separated left shoulder. ``There's been no problem
the last week and a half,'' said McLaren. ``I've just been
strengthening it. Thursday it should be 100 percent. If I go out
and if I don't hit, I'm not going to be successful, worrying about
my shoulder.'' . . . P.J. Axelsson's right thumb is sprained, not
broken. He'll play against Ottawa. ``It hurts a bit but it's
nothing more than that,'' he said. Sergei Samsonov, who has a thigh
contusion, also will play. ``It was tight at practice, but I
started slowly to see how it went,'' Samsonov said. ``It felt tight
and sore but it's fine.'' . . . Steve Heinze, who has a groin
injury, left practice early. He has missed two games and hopes to
get back next weekend.

GROUPS UNITE FOR STRONGER VOICE IN WELFARE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the drama of President Clinton's impeachment limped to a
close, a different and potentially significant moral tale was
unfolding in another corner of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 people from 40 states gathered in Washington last
week to grapple with the question of what religious congregations,
in the uncharted era of welfare reform, can do to help the poor
lift themselves out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The National Summit on the Churches and Welfare Reform, the
first meeting of its kind, attracted more than 500 faith-based
organizations that provide dozens of services, from child care to
job training to health care.
</P>
<P>
   As the country embarks on a historic and controversial effort to
curb guaranteed government aid to needy families, churches,
synagogues, and mosques are likely to play a huge role in helping
the poor enter the working world.
</P>
<P>
   But summit organizers say that while congregations certainly are
capable and willing, they also are obliged to hold governments
accountable so they will not completely abandon the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before politicians start patting themselves on the back for
welfare reform, they need to understand exactly what is
happening,'' said Jim Wallis, an organizer of the summit and a
Washington-based Christian activist who is spending a year as a
fellow at the Center for the Study of Values in Public Life at
Harvard Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are asking the wrong question,'' said Wallis,
editor of Sojourners Magazine and founder of Call to Renewal, a
national faith-based organization working to overcome poverty.
``The question isn't how many people are getting off welfare. The
question is how many people are getting jobs. And right now, the
data show that half the people are getting jobs and the other half
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who are able to get jobs are earning wages too low to
significantly improve their economic situation, Wallis argued.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum last week on churches and welfare reform at Harvard
Divinity School, Mary Jo Bane, a professor of public policy and
management at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said many
people being pushed off welfare are landing minimum-wage jobs that
make it inevitable that they will remain poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare poor have become the working poor,'' said Bane,
who quit her job as an assistant secretary for health and human
services in the Clinton administration in protest after the
president signed the federal welfare reform law in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal of the church summit, Wallis said, was to catalyze
an organized movement of religious congregations that could have an
influential voice in public policy involving the plight of poor
people.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to mimic the success the religious right has
enjoyed in having its voice heard in Washington and in state
capitals on moral issues such as abortion and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Building on what Wallis said was a successful summit, key
organizers will meet next month to decide what steps to take to
build a national association of congregations working on poverty
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Wallis said, it is clear that welfare reform will fail
unless government at all levels deals better with three key
weaknesses: a lack of affordable health and child care, and jobs
that pay too little to support families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real potential for advocacy,'' said Wallis, who is
completing a book on the connection between spirituality and social
action. ``There are no political action committees for poor people;
no highly paid lobbyist on Capitol Hill. Well, that's what churches
are supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of churches have been doing their own things
individually and staying away from politics,'' he said. ``There's a
major untapped force here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great changes in welfare laws, Wallis said he is
encouraged by the response of religious groups. A growing number no
longer are simply interested in operating traditional charities
such as soup kitchens, clothing closets, and homeless shelters.
They want to provide permanent solutions to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running food pantries and the like in the end can be very
demoralizing for churches and clients, because nothing ever seems
to change,'' Wallis said. ``Working on what it takes to move out of
poverty can be more energizing. We want to end poverty, not service
it.''

NFL `RELOCATION FEE' HOVERS OVER PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They sit and wait and wonder, in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Will Patriots owner Robert Kraft have to pay the way they did
when they decided to move their teams?
</P>
<P>
   This is a question the National Football League is not prepared
to answer yet, and one the folks who own the Baltimore Ravens, St.
Louis Rams, and Tennessee Titans have great interest in.
</P>
<P>
   All of them paid big bucks to move, what the NFL calls a
``relocation fee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft told the Hartford (Conn.) Courant recently that he
does not anticipate having to pay a relocation fee.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, then the fun will begin. The folks we have spoken
with two of these franchises say that if the Patriots don't have to
pay, they won't pay either. That would be a major headache for the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from Cleveland to Baltimore cost Art Modell, owner of the
Ravens, approximately $45 million. He is on the books to pay the
NFL $29 million (or $1 million to each other team) for being
allowed to move. Also, he had to forfeit his share of what the
league will get from the new Cleveland Browns expansion franchise,
which is around another $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams lost a bid in court to avoid paying the $29 million
relocation fee, forfeited their $16 million of the Cleveland
expansion money, and also had to pay more than $25 million to get
out of their lease in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (nee Oilers), who relocated from Houston last year,
reportedly are down for a $27 million relocation fee, though it is
unclear why their price is different from the others. Reportedly,
such figures are determined by the league's Finance Committee, of
which Kraft is a member.
</P>
<P>
   A league source said no decision has been made on whether Kraft
will have to pay a relocation fee to move to Hartford from Boston.
But by league rule, he is clearly moving the Patriots out of the
``home territory,'' the stipulation by which the others teams have
been hit with the fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home territory'' is defined in the NFL constitution as the
area within a 75-mile radius of the city to which the franchise was
granted, in this case Boston. Hartford, at 100 miles from Boston,
is outside the home territory.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who would have to remove himself from the Finance
Committee if it is to rule on a relocation fee, is expected to
argue that Hartford is in the same market. It clearly is not. In
fact, most fans in Connecticut are New York Giants fans, and have
been for years, and the others are Jets fans. Hartford is
approximately the same distance from New York City as it is from
Boston, so there is no way Kraft should say it is part of the
Boston market.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft and Governor John Rowland of Connecticut agreed on
the deal to move the Patriots last week, the Courant wrote, ``If
the league charges a relocation fee _ as it did to the Rams, which
paid the league $46 million when the team moved from Los Angeles to
St. Louis in 1995 _ it could be a problem. The agreement assumes
that the league will not impose a relocation fee. If it does, the
agreement (Kraft-Rowland) does not bind either the state or the
team to pay. It does go on to say that if the NFL imposes an
unacceptable condition for the relocation, either party can
terminate the agreement after Oct. 31 (1999).''
</P>
<P>
   The people in Connecticut already are very concerned about
overpaying to bring the Patriots to the state, and another $30
million relocation fee _ $1 million for each other team in the
league, presumably _ could be the deal-breaker. Kraft most likely
would have to be the one who decides whether he wants to pay that
himself or forget the Connecticut deal.
</P>
<P>
   The teams in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Tennessee, for the most
part, have not paid the NFL their relocation fees yet. Now they
want to see how Kraft is treated. If he doesn't pay, they won't
pay. And if they don't pay, the league will have $85 million at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   This problem could leave the door open for the state of
Massachusetts and the city of Boston to get back into the picture
in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the only one in the league who wants to see the
Patriots move out of this market is Kraft. Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue made it clear at his Super Bowl press conference that he
would prefer the team stay in Boston. Gene Upshaw, head of the
Players Association, said the same thing. And there is little
question that the majority of owners across the league favor Boston
over Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   However, Massachusetts and Boston seem content to let the team
leave when it wouldn't be that difficult to put together a deal to
keep it. But no one in a position of political leadership seems to
want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the league would break its own rules
to allow Kraft to move to Hartford, despite the problem of the
relocation fee.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the battle for the St. Louis relocation money
that solidified the league rules on allowing franchises to move.
The city of St. Louis, which is on the hook to pay $20 million of
the $29 million owed in relocation, went to court over that, but
the court upheld the NFL. After the trial, NFL lead lawyer Frank
Rothman was asked what was the most significant thing to come out
of it was. He said, ``The court said that our rules (regarding team
movement) are valid, that we don't have to vote for any team to
move unless the owners decide to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The two key guidelines for moving are support of the fans, in
buying tickets to the games, and support of the financial
community, in paying for local radio/TV contracts, stadium signage,
advertising, and the like. The Patriots have not had an empty seat
in five years, and they claim to have a waiting list that exceeds
20,000. Also, they have had tremendous local support, generating
more than $22 million per year from Foxboro Stadium in
Patriot-related events, one of the top numbers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Bill Bidwill, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, wanted
to move his team. Pete Rozelle, who was commissioner at the time,
wanted Bidwill to move to Baltimore and replace the Colts, who had
left for Indianapolis. Bidwill opted for Arizona, though, and the
league imposed a relocation fee, which was new at the time. Bidwill
reportedly paid $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The league tried to make Al Davis pay a fee for moving the
Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1983, but Davis won a court
case that allowed him to move and not pay. Davis is back in court
with the NFL in California. The league wants him to pay for moving
back to Oakland. He refuses to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Raiders trial that led the court to suggest
that the league draw up its own guidelines for moving, which it did
_ the ones that theoretically should prevent Kraft from moving.

JUST SHOWING IS WINNING FOR NEW DESIGNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For his fall fashion show here on Sunday, designer
Mark Montano paid his 14 models barter-style: one outfit each for
several trips down the runway. He couldn't afford a makeup artist
or a DJ, so friends volunteered. And the champagne party afterward?
It's on hold _ indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have no money as a young designer, this is exactly
what it takes,'' says Montano, 32.
</P>
<P>
   This is fashion week. For the industry, no period is more
important. It's when virtually every major American designer
unveils his or her all-important fall collection. Fashion trends
are launched here, and industry heavyweights such as Ralph Lauren
and Calvin Klein get lots of press coverage and retail orders _
which boost the reputation of American designers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion week isn't just about household names. Up-and-coming
designers such as Montano play a big role as well. For one thing,
they bring fresh perspectives and ideas, something the industry
can't survive without. Also, they're often more willing to take
chances with their clothes than old hands are. And such risks can
lead to breakthroughs in design. Last, their presence creates an
atmosphere of competition, which spurs designers to do better work.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, new designers on the scene face an uphill battle, no
matter how enthusiastic and enterprising they may be. With more
than 80 shows running this week, attracting harried retailers and
journalists can be tough. New York-based Montano says his show
Sunday _ his first on the official fashion-week calendar _ was
``totally a dream come true. . . . Ever since I was little, I've
been sewing and looking at fashion magazines. . . . It's wild'' to
be here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the unveiling of his 36-piece collection
scheduled a strategic two hours before renowned Donna Karan's show,
Montano obviously couldn't come close to matching the scale. His
show (located in the smallest venue available) drew a respectable
340 people. But Karan's show, for her 87-piece DKNY line, attracted
almost 800 to a larger nearby facility, including celebrities such
as actress Jennifer Esposito of ``Spin City,'' singer Debra Cox,
and actor Cameron Mathison. Guests for Karan's show had to line up
an hour before start time. Among them, providing all-important
publicity, was CNN reporter Elsa Klench (who was let in early).
</P>
<P>
   Booking experienced models in a competitive environment like
this can be almost impossible when you can't pay them the going
rate of $5,000 to $10,000 per show. No problem for Karan, of
course. DKNY _ celebrating its 10th anniversary _ hired some of the
hottest, including Esther Canadas and Kiara Kabukuru. What about
Montano? Rather than name names, let's just say that one of his
volunteer models tripped on the runway and another couldn't stop
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Montano doesn't need a supermodel to have an impact.
The fact that he showed on the calendar speaks volumes. His venue
cost $7,800 to rent, paid for by Cotton Inc., a nonprofit industry
trade group, after the Denver native won a national contest in
which he described how he uses cotton in his designs. The grant for
the show wasn't part of the contest prize, but Cotton sponsored it
anyway, says Montano spokesman Patrick Hughes: ``If alcohol
companies can sponsor fashion shows, why not Cotton Inc.?''
</P>
<P>
   Montano's latest collection is geared toward ``a really
hard-edged woman with a lot of style,'' Montano says. ``My customer
is a woman who has an attitude about life. She's a very strong
woman who is happy with herself no matter what she weighs'' or
looks like. ``My colors are bright, my patterns bold. They're happy
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show included sexy, bold, unexpected elements, like
shoulders that pointed sharply into horn shapes and a collar that
unzipped and jutted out into two long points. One dress was long in
the front and miniskirt length in the back. A few skirt waistlines
were asymmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   Like Karan, Montano studied design in New York. (Karan attended
Parsons School of Design; Montano graduated from the Fashion
Institute of Technology.) Using $5,000 saved from an internship at
Oscar de la Renta, Montano opened a store in Jersey City, N.J.,
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Sewing all of his goods himself, he cultivated a following and
eventually moved his store to Manhattan's East Village in 1991. Now
some of his clients include LeAnn Rimes, Demi Moore, and Melanie
Griffith. (Montano's casual wear ranges from $75 to $400. His ball
gowns start at $500.)
</P>
<P>
   Montano _ who says his ``company car'' is a bike and who lives
in an apartment above his store _ is quick to agree that the
fashion business is tough. But he also points out it could be
worse. His first show, in 1993, was in a public park. ``I wheeled
the clothes 15 blocks'' to get there, he says, shaking his head.
``It was outside and it was cold. It sounded like a good idea at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday's show was the first time in three years in which the
music didn't cut off while Montano's models were still on the
runway. ``I've learned that at a certain point, you don't have
control over a show. You have to relinquish it.``
</P>
<P>
   Montano says his ultimate goal isn't necessarily to become the
next Donna Karan, who is creative director of a publicly traded
company. ``I want to be able to design and create without worrying
about money. That's what my life is about _ creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Montano, who has seven volunteer assistants, says that every day
at 2:30 p.m. they all order sandwiches and sit around, discussing
fashion, relationships, and life in general. ``I love it,'' he
says. ``I never want to lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if a Montano show never attracts 800 people? ``In a lot
of ways, I feel I've reached the goal I set long ago,'' he says.
``They painted my name out front! Whatever else happens, I made it
here.''

SIR GEORGE TRAVELS THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He's now called Sir George Martin, having been knighted
three years ago. He'll forever be known to the public, though, as
the professorial producer of the Beatles. He worked on all of their
albums _ including the popular ``Beatles Anthology'' series of the
past few years, which reunited him with Paul McCartney, George
Harrison, and Ringo Starr at Abbey Road studio in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Abbey Road staff was amazed to see these old codgers
reminiscing about old times,'' says Martin, who will be inducted
into the Rock Hall of Fame next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was astonishing to do the anthology series _ to relive all
your moments of joy and fun and sadness and anger,'' adds Martin by
phone from England. ``I'm very glad we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 72, will relive another aspect of his Beatles experience
on a multimedia lecture tour, ``The Making of Sgt. Pepper,'' which
comes to the Berklee Performance Center Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multimedia is a rather grand term,'' says Martin. ``It's kind
of a talk, really. I do use one or two bits of video to illustrate
what we're talking about, which wakes people up and gives me a
chance to have a glass of water. I speak for up to an hour and 15
minutes. It's an explanation of `Sgt. Pepper' and why and how it
came to be made. I wrote a book about it some years ago and I also
had a TV program based on it. It's the kind of thing I've been
doing for a while, but people seem interested in it and everywhere
I go, they receive it very warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' is not
Martin's favorite Beatles album (he'll instead name ``Rubber Soul''
or ``Abbey Road''), he says that ``it took on a shape of its own''
once the Beatles settled into the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its significance is that it was a breakthrough, a kind of
watershed,'' Martin says. ``It was something that I'd always
nurtured in my mind _ to get a little more programmy about what we
were doing and a little more symphonic. I was lecturing Paul and
John (Lennon) always to think in classical terms, not necessarily
to write classical music, but to think about form a bit more. John
wouldn't have any of it. He said, `I'm a rock 'n' roller. What are
you on about? I'm a Teddy Boy (term that roughly means tough guy).'
Paul took some of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin says that in later years, he and the Beatles eventually
went too far. He says he was a ``little pretentious'' in the
classical overtones he brought to ``Abbey Road.'' He admits to
other second thoughts, though he's proud of the body of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago, before John died, we spent some time in his
flat and he said he'd like to do everything again,'' recalls
Martin. ``I was appalled by this and I couldn't really believe he
meant that. I said, `You mean you'd like to record everything
again?' And he said, `Yes, I would.' I said, `You know, I think
some of those records were great.' I couldn't understand what he
was on about. I was just saying to myself, `Well, his imagination
is always much better than real life,' which I think was true. I
think his dreams were much more vivid than reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I went through the anthology, there were cases where
I said to myself: I think we should have left it there and not done
any more. I would have liked to be a little more minimalist. That
was my only criticism. I think what we did wasn't bad, but some of
the innocence of the demos was incredibly charming. When you hear
the first time a song had ever been heard in the studio, and we put
a mic on it _ some of those, warts and all, were better than the
masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of Lennon's and McCartney's post-Beatles
solo work, Martin is equally honest. ``They wrote some smashing
songs during that time and they also wrote some rubbish. I don't
think either of them ever achieved the Olympian heights they
achieved together. I think they missed each other very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever tell them that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure. Sometimes I would say things that weren't very
welcome and I would get rapped over the knuckles. But I think they
knew that too. I'm sure they knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although principally known for his Beatles work (he's often been
called ``the fifth Beatle''), Martin has been a prolific producer,
with more than 700 records to his credit. Outside of the Beatles,
he's proudest of his productions with the band America, Jeff Beck,
and the Mahavishnu Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people I enjoyed working with. And even
before the Beatles, I enjoyed my work in the comedy field with
Peter Sellers,'' says Martin, who began his career in 1950 as a
classical producer for the Parlephone label, which he eventually
headed and to which he signed the Beatles in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is now losing his hearing (he originally offered to
do this interview on the Internet rather than by phone), had
another career highlight when he produced Elton John's tribute to
Princess Diana, ``Candle in the Wind.'' Martin then retired from
making records after releasing last year's ``It's My Life,'' a
compilation of Beatles songs done by artists from Celine Dion to
comedian Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a typical retirement. He's now on his lecture tour,
then will arrange Beatles songs and other compositions for
orchestras in Canada this spring. He hopes to get back to
Montserrat (where he had the world-famous Air Studio, which was
recently damaged by a hurricane) to help rebuild that island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very full, so retirement is not exactly the word,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   As for today's producers, he likes the self-produced techno
group the Prodigy, but doesn't like the way that many modern
records are made. ``Producing today is such a different art. It's
very technical and it's very computerized. You've got to be a
master of many things in the studio. It's less to do with musicians
and orchestration and more to do with sound bites and Pro Tools and
those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he miss the record business. ``First of all, records
are very hard to sell now. The record business is not very good.
Secondly, most of the corporations seem to be run by people who
don't know a great deal about what we're trying to do. It's not as
happy as it was in our day.''

 HANOVER, N.H.: ... to $3,604.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents say they identify closely with both the Kendal and
Hanover communities. ``I have a life within Kendal, but I also have
a life outside of it,'' says 77-year-old Joan Birnbaum. ``I take
part in all sorts of activities in town, and I have a lot of
younger friends outside of Kendal.'' A former investment counselor
for the United Methodist Church, Birnbaum moved to Kendal from
Greenwich, Conn. in 1991, when the retirement community opened.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum serves on several retirement community committees and
is active in a couple of area women's organizations, the local
Wellesley College alumnae club, a bridge group in Hanover, and a
Congregational church in Norwich, Vt. And she keeps on learning.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hanover's top assets for many Kendal residents such as
Birnbaum is the Institute for Lifelong Education at Dartmouth.
Staffed by volunteers, the institute offers about 30
adult-education courses on a wide range of subjects each semester
as well as a summer lecture series.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's classes are held at Dartmouth and in various
venues around Hanover, including the retirement community. Nearly
40 percent of Kendal community residents are enrolled in the ILEAD
program. Birnbaum says she has taken 25 ILEAD courses on subjects
as varied as the history of Yugoslavia, how to predict weather, and
the art of story telling. ``It's whatever interests me,'' she
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the college towns that have attracted retirement
communities are, like Hanover, serene, safe, and in beautiful rural
settings. Also appealing (and reassuring) to elderly retirees is
the presence of medical schools and the teaching hospitals usually
affiliated with them. The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, for
instance, is considered one of the best in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the presence of a population of vigorous elders also
gives specialists in the growing field of gerontology an
opportunity to study the long-term effects of aging. ``The
Dartmouth Medical Center looks on Kendal as a big laboratory,''
says 77-year-old Robert Stambaugh, a Midwesterner with a degree
from Purdue University who was a Union Carbide Co. executive. ``A
lot of people here have volunteered for studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendal is nondenominational, though it was developed by the
Kendal Corporation of Kennett Square, Pa., a nonprofit company with
a Quaker affiliation. The corporation has developed 10 such
retirement comunities around the country, including several in
college towns. The one in Ithaca, N.Y., for example, is on the
Cornell University campus.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of Kendal at Hanover residents are
Quakers, says administrator Leonard Cadwallader, ``but the
operating philosphy is Quaker.'' Among other things, Cadwallader
says, this means decision-making by consensus and an emphasis on
community service and volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   One active Kendal volunteer is Walter Frank, who chaired the New
York Stock Exchange in the mid 1960s. ``I like to sing,'' explains
Frank, who leads sing-alongs to entertain infirm and bedridden
patients in the community nursing center. Asked about his own
health, the 90-year-old Frank cheerfully replies, ``I'm bullish.''
</P>
<P>
   George Graham, 77, a Kendal resident and Dartmouth alumnus,
says, ``I audit classes at the college, go to plays and concerts
there, and take part in a Dartmouth fitness program. And, quite a
few of my classmates are also in the area and I see them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the presence of Dartmouth alumni such as Graham is
understandable, the community might at first seem an odd retirement
choice for 90-year-old Olin J. Stephens. ``People always ask me
what I'm doing so far inland,'' says Stephens, the legendary
designer of boats that have defended the America's Cup eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Known in yachting circles as ``the ancient mariner,'' Stephens,
who did not attend Dartmouth, dropped anchor at Kendal shortly
after it opened. ``I've always liked the country, had sons living
in the area, and my wife wasn't in good health at the time and
needed a place like this,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1993 but Stephens has no plans to ship out. ``I
don't feel stranded here,'' he says. He says he spends most of the
year in New Hampshire, with occasional forays to Maine and
California to visit friends and do some sailing, often in restored
old wooden boats he designed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens says he has taken several courses at Dartmouth and
makes use of the library and other facilities. ``I'm now working
with a Dartmouth professor studying the effect of wind on sails,''
he says. ``I have a pretty fast PC with a good memory that I use to
work on mathematical problems, and the project keeps me busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides all the activities at the college, the retirement
community itself has about 70 resident-organized special interest
groups, from book and bridge clubs to woodworking and weaving
groups. It was the absence of just this sort of intense
intellectual and social activity that made Charles and Shirley
Boren decide last year to exchange their retirement home in New
Mexico for an apartment in Kendal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a beautiful spot in a canyon along the Pecos River,
but it was lonely and isolated; you had to drive two hours just to
go to a movie,'' says Shirley Boren. ``Being here is stimulating
and a relief _ we don't plan ever to move again.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both in their mid-60s, lived in Hartford for 30
years before moving to the Southwest five years ago. A
psychiatrist, Charles Boren was a consultant to the National
Basketball Association and now lectures part time at Dartmouth
Medical School. He says he's impressed _ and inspired _ by the way
Kendal residents care for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues at the end of life are loneliness, making your life
count for something, and facing death,'' says Borens. ``We never
lose the need for role models, and these people are models for
aging.''

ESPYS ARE PRIME-TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dick Vitale was backstage Monday night at Radio City
Music Hall, waiting to present an ESPY award, when he struck up a
conversation with actor Christian Slater. They chatted like old
pals, shook hands, and went their separate ways _ Vitale to his
wife and daughters, Slater to schmooze with other Hollywood
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that Vitale didn't know who Slater was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I told my daughter that I just met some guy, uh, a
Christian Slater and she went, `Oh my God, Christian Slater . . .
Christian Slater,' '' said a slightly embarrassed Vitale said.
</P>
<P>
   There are worse things in life, and given that ESPN considers
itself the center of the sports universe, it's only natural that
one of the network's most recognizable personalities wouldn't know
each person who makes a splash in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The funny part is that Slater also didn't know to whom he was
talking.
</P>
<P>
   When Vitale made it onstage to present an award, Slater was
backstage watching on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there's that guy I just met,'' he told a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPYs are more than just an annual celebration of athletic
achievement. No other sports awards show brings athletes from
different professions together for mutual praise. That alone
qualifies it as a one-of-a-kind event.
</P>
<P>
   But the ESPYs are much bigger, bigger than simply having Jeff
Gordon, fresh off his Daytona 500 victory, and Sammy Sosa under the
same roof. That's easy. But Hollywood celebrities and sports? Now
that, as ESPN likes to describe it, is ``the greatest night in
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The ESPYs weren't always so great. Seven years ago, Steve
Bornstein, then president of ESPN, approved an idea that one of his
editors, John Walsh, had been kicking around for years. Walsh had
been managing editor at Inside Sports magazine and dreamed up a
sports award show as a way to create publicity to save the
publication. Inside Sports went out of business before the show
came to be, but Walsh held on to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bornstein liked it, and the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is show biz,'' said ESPN executive producer Jeff Ruhe.
``This isn't like live sports, where you just turn on the cameras.
We devote a lot of time and attention to the ESPYs and we have seen
a real payback in terms of awareness of the show. More and more big
names are excited about and look forward to participating every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Dennis Miller hosted the first show, held at the Felt
Forum in Madison Square Garden, and while some of the presenters
were stars, they didn't always know what they were doing. Raquel
Welch, for instance, gave the college basketball player of the year
to ``Christine'' Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, the show had its moments, such as the
time a cancer-stricken Jim Valvano accepted the Arthur Ashe ESPY
for courage. ``Don't give up, don't ever give up,'' Valvano told
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Allegro was executive producer of the first show and he
remembered Bornstein telling him it could run no longer than two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Allegro and Walsh tried to cut back the highlights, but it
turned into three hours. An annoyed Bornstein restated the two-hour
rule and Allegro and Walsh went back to the editing room. They
finally got it to two hours and 40 minutes and, according to some
critics, the show was still too long.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN stayed with it, though, encouraged by the support of such
stars as Emmitt Smith and Jimmy Johnson and the worthiness of its
contribution to cancer research through the V Foundation. Its
ratings were better than those the cable network received from most
of its college basketball games. The live audience grew from about
2,000 to 5,000 after the show moved to the bigger Radio City Music
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell it's catching on,'' said ESPN's Charley Steiner.
``Everywhere I go, someone invariably tells me that a play should
be considered for an ESPY.''
</P>
<P>
   Now ESPN turns down offers from stars to participate. Not that
anyone could tell from the crowded scene backstage Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson hosted this year's show, which was filled with
tributes to the incredible baseball season. Talk-show host Rosie
O'Donnell held court in one corner. Actor Jeff Daniels talked with
Cal Ripken in another. Mark McGwire and David Wells traded jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry and his wife stood in the middle of the room
and posed for photographs with stars, including actors Matthew
Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees fan, Parker inched her way over to Strawberry and got
to shake his hand. She tried to coax her husband but he was a
little torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Mets fan,'' Broderick said. ``And I'm still struggling
with Yankee fever. And besides, what do you say to Darryl
Strawberry? `Hi, it's nice to meet you.' I don't know. I'm a little
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Broderick eventually went over and sheepishly had a picture
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Al Franken stayed in the background. He liked the idea
of having entertainers mix with athletes but was a little concerned
about comparing his own athletic prowess with those in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Minnesota and I wrestled in high school,'' Franken
said. ``You don't see any awards for professional wrestlers, now do
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming governor of Minnesota is one thing, but no one could
imagine Jesse Ventura winning an ESPY.
</P>
<P>
   Not even in ``The Body's'' prime.

   Here are some recipes created by Melissa Kelly, executive chef
of the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company Inn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
OLD CHATHAM CAMEMBERT CRISP
</P>
<P>
   2 pieces fresh sheep's milk Camembert cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 sheets phyllo dough
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons melted butter plus 1 tablespoon unmelted
</P>
<P>
   For the egg wash:
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut each Camembert from corner to corner into 2 triangle shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lay a sheet of phyllo in front of you, butter it lightly with
the melted butter, and lay another sheet over the top. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Place the Camembert triangles in a row at the bottom of the
sheet (you should have 4 triangles). Cut the phyllo between each
piece from the top to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at the bottom, fold the phyllo ``flag-fold style''
over the cheese and roll the cheese until you get to the top. Make
the egg wash by beating together the egg and milk, then brush a
little on the final fold.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, heat a skillet over a medium-high flame,
add 1 tablespoon of unmelted butter and brown the phyllo on all
sides until golden. This should take less than 1 minute on each
side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm with a fruit chutney, toasted bread, and a tossed
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

FIELD GREENS WITH ROASTED BEETS AND FRESH SHEEP'S CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Goat cheese can be substituted for the sheep's cheese. Both
cheeses are sharp and play off the sweetness of the beets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup olive oil (medium-bodied pure)
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 beets
</P>
<P>
   Mesclun greens (field mix)
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs basil (torn into bite-size pieces)
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs flat-leaf Italian parsley (pick leaves from stem)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch chives (snipped into 1-inch lengths)
</P>
<P>
   2 heads Belgian endive, separated into spears
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound cheese (fresh sheep or goat)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the vinaigrette by mincing the shallots and placing them
in a bowl with the vinegars. Season with salt and pepper, then let
sit 15 to 20 minutes. Whisk in the olive oil and adjust the
seasonings to taste. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven to 400 degrees. Wrap the beets in foil and roast
for about 1 hour or until a knife slides in with ease. Remove from
the oven and let them cool. Then peel the beets and cut into
wedges. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, toss the greens and herbs with half the vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, lay the endive spears on a platter or plates. Place
the greens in the center of the endive and arrange the beets around
the greens. Drizzle the beets with the remaining vinaigrette.
Crumble the cheese over the top and then sprinkle with cracked
black pepper. Enjoy with crusty bread.

CHEF MELISSA KELLY MAKES IT FROM SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD CHATHAM, N.Y. _ The rolling hills around the Old Chatham
Sheepherding Company Inn are frosted with snow. The January
vacation is over, along with the annual refurbishing of the
antique-filled main house. The chef is back in residence,
developing her winter menus. And the first lambs of the season's
expected 1,600 are trying out their spindly legs.
</P>
<P>
   A stay at a country inn spells romance to most of us, and this
one, tucked into a 500-acre working sheep farmjust over the
Massachusetts border, hits every high note. Its draw, though, isn't
just as a bucolic hideaway for well-to-do New Yorkers. The Old
Chatham Sheepherding Company Inn is a mecca for food lovers,
because of Melissa Kelly, executive chef and co-manager.
</P>
<P>
   On this wintry day, she greets me in a cozy sitting room of the
1790 Georgian-style house. Wearing overalls and a little T-shirt
under a long white apron, with her dark brown hair slicked back
into a ponytail, she looks like an 11-year-old who had wandered in
from school.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, at 33, is an undisputed culinary star, acclaimed by
national food magazines and writers since graduating first in her
1988 class at the Culinary Institute of America. Her food, which I
had sampled the previous evening, ranges across the new American
palate. Its clearest impetus is not a regional style such as
Mediterranean or a look such as vertical. The impetus for
everything Kelly makes is taste.
</P>
<P>
   One can be assured of being fed well here. That stems not only
from Kelly's talent but also from her life philosophy. The French
talk about ``terroir'' _ being able to taste the soil, the very
essence of the land, in wine and food. That's what you get in
Kelly's cooking at the inn.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Kelly's conversation illuminates the way she puts
that exquisite food on the table. Basically she starts at the
beginning. She uses the lamb raised on the farm to create highly
flavorful dishes such as grilled lamb chops with a ragout of
flageolet beans, tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, and eggplant on a
bed of mustard greens. The Camembert _ layered with phyllo sheets
and fashioned into a crisp to be served with cherry-gooseberry
chutney and venison prosciutto _ is made down the road at the
farm's creamery from milk from the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the vegetables are grown in the kitchen garden next to
the inn in the warmer months. Kelly stores root vegetables in a
cellar for the colder months. Year-round, she and a gardener grow
salad materials in a greenhouse next to the garden. The breads,
biscuits, and desserts are made by her fiance, Price Kushner, in a
bakery next to the inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I studied the Shaker philosophy'' of doing
everything from scratch, Kelly says of her first days creating a
cuisine for the inn, which opened 3 1/2 years ago. The Shaker
Museum and Library across the road lent inspiration, and she was an
eager student. After all, she grew up in an extended
Italian-American family on Long Island that had a tradition of
gardening, fishing, and putting up vegetables for the winter. ``It
was almost embarrassing that we were so peasant,'' Kelly says with
a wry grin.
</P>
<P>
   The peasant orientation, ``the things I learned as a child from
my grandmother,'' gave Kelly a foundation when she moved from
working in restaurants for pocket money during high school to
deciding that cooking was what she wanted to do with her life.
</P>
<P>
   Her dedication to her craft is limitless. ``Everything is my
concern,'' she says of her job as executive chef and co-manager
with innkeeper George Shattuck III. ``The first three months that
we were open,'' Kelly says, ``I literally didn't get off this
road.'' Even now, as the inn's fame has grown, Kelly finds it hard
to stay out of the kitchen on Tuesdays, her day off. She lives on
the edge of the property and her schedule stretches from 10 a.m. to
the wee hours of the morning six days a week, planning, managing a
staff of five to six cooks, and cooking alongside them. ``It's very
intense,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Firmly believing in using only what is fresh and seasonal, Kelly
has developed local sources for game birds and for vegetables she
can't grow, and she has found a fish purveyor she trusts. She
writes the menu daily, changing it four or five times ``up until 5
o'clock.'' Kelly checks on the Camembert production, makes sure the
guests have sheep-shaped cookies on their turned-down beds in the
evenings, and tries to find time to plan restarting the smokehouse
on the property.
</P>
<P>
   She became interested in smoking food several years ago. While
researching regional cooking, she began reading about Native
American methods. The farm raises six pigs at a time for the
restaurant and she and her staff butcher sides of pork, cure hams
and other pork products, and make sausages and headcheese. The
bacon is cured here but smoked off the premises, and Kelly would
like to add that chore to her repertoire. ``The pork is delicious
because (the pigs) eat so well,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One might suppose, from the back-to-basics approach, that
Kelly's food would be rustic, but that's not the case. Her dishes
are as evolved as those in fine New York City and Boston
restaurants, the presentation as exquisitely mannered. Truffles and
caviar, foie gras and lobster grace the menu. And the desserts by
Kushner are works of art. It's also true that lamb grown near the
kitchen, or sheep's milk ice cream made from milk only hours old,
or green tomato pickles and tomatillo chutney canned at the peak of
ripeness in the summer make indelible taste impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Customers come from all over the country, with the strongest
contingent from New York City. Many diners travel down from Albany,
only 20 minutes away, or over the Berkshires from Massachusetts,
about 40 minutes east. In the summer months, the inn and the
restaurant are ``consistently busy,'' Kelly says. March and April
are slower months.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly previously worked for restaurateur Larry Forgione at
Beekman 1776 Tavern farther down the Hudson River and for Alice
Waters at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. She first came to the
farm to give advice to owners Tom and Nancy Clark, who had started
raising sheep on the property and were thinking of creating a bed
and breakfast. At that time, Kelly says, the inn was just an
``empty, dark, drab house.'' Kelly told them they needed a full
restaurant and less than a year later began the intense work to
open one.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Clark finds the antiques that furnish the house,
supervises all the decorative elements, and even hunts out the
delightful antique china that is mixed and matched with new pieces
for the dining room. Tom Clark is in charge of the financial
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The inn consists of five rooms in the main house, two guest
cottages with three rooms, a carriage house with two rooms. Four
suites are being built and will be ready for the summer high
season. All are luxuriously appointed and the rooms go for $185 to
$450 a night. But both Kelly and innkeeper Shattuck stress that
it's not formal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep it cozy and family-style,'' Kelly says. Guests
are encouraged to wander down to the dairy barns to watch the lambs
being fed and the sheep being milked, to watch through glass
windows the yogurt and cheesemaking operations, and to hike the
paths around the property. There are afternoon lectures on
gardening, talks and demonstrations by local artists, and cooking
classes in the bakery. And the 70 staff members are unfailingly
gracious.
</P>
<P>
   The life is ``very consuming,'' says Kelly, who serves 70 to 100
meals a night, works in a small kitchen with only three other cooks
at a time, and rarely sees her fiance during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I'd have my own place,'' Kelly says. But the
inn's resources and the latitude the Clarks give her are
fulfilling. ``I don't make all the final decisions,'' she says,
``so sometimes it's hard. But they have a lot of confidence in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in midwinter, Kelly and the gardener, Jo Ann Regan, are
poring over seed catalogs to begin next summer's garden. It's been
a system of trial and error, Kelly says, but also rewarding. She
rattles off what grew last year: raspberries, strawberries, green
garlic, spring onions, purslane, squashes, fava beans, Romano
beans, filet beans, baby carrots, turnips, broccoli rabe, edible
flowers of all kinds, and the list goes on. ``Every year it gets
better,'' she says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The smile and the sentiment could refer to it all _ Kelly's
belief that going for the pure, elemental taste in good ingredients
gives great results. The diner can taste the terroir of the farm in
her food.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW TO GET THERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Old Chatham Sheepherding Inn is in Old Chatham, N.Y., off

in January, is on the National Historic Register and a member of
the Relais &AMP; Chateaux association.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, which is open to the public, serves dinner every
night except Tuesday and also serves Sunday brunch. Prices for
entrees range from $19 to $29.

INSURERS HOLD THEIR OWN, RECEIVE $80M IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seemingly running against a high-tech tide, three New England
insurance companies received a total of almost $80 million in
venture fund financing during the last quarter of 1998, accounting
for 14 percent of all investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
   One, Insurance Holdings of America Inc., of Beverly, Mass.,
which got $24.75 million from a consortium of venture funds, is in
fact built around the presence of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Representing several life and property insurance underwriters,
it uses the Internet to provide franchised field agents the ability
to offer quotations and write insurance policies almost instantly,
drawing on data stored in a computer bank at company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McCarthy, founder and chief executive, said its agent
network includes 82 who now work in Sam's Club stores, operated by
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., in New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Nine more states, including Massachusetts, are expected to be
added by June, and most other states by the end of the year.
Insurance Holdings also plans to launch a World Wide Web site this
summer where consumers can order insurance directly.
</P>
<P>
   The others, Connecticut Reinsurance Corp. and Target Capital
Partners Inc., are more traditional insurers, with business plans
that aim to acquire smaller companies over several years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both companies said they chose Connecticut because
of an economic development program that exempts them from all state
corporate taxes for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1995, the Connecticut Insurance Reinvestment Act was
designed to stimulate a revival of the state's traditional
insurance industry, decimated in recent years by mergers,
acquisitions, and automation.
</P>
<P>
   Participants must have at least 25 percent of their employees in
the state and remain in Connecticut for 10 years. The first company
to take advantage of it, Zurich Reinsurance Centre Holdings Inc.,
moved 400 employees to Stamford from New York in 1997, with its
projected tax break estimated at $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Reinsurance and Target Capital each received $25
million in start-up funding from Northington Connecticut Insurance
Reinvestment Partners LLC, funded mostly by the insurance industry.
Connecticut Reinsurance chief executive David Harris said his
company also got $5 million from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, also chief executive of Harris Insurance Holdings of
Houston, a group that includes Central United Life Insurance Co.,
Christian Life, and Unum Life, said Connecticut Reinsurance is
negotiating to acquire other life underwriters being offered for
sale by large financial institutions, following major mergers and
acquisitions in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is restructuring right now,'' he said, ``and is
looking at what they now have and repositioning again.''
</P>
<P>
   Target Capital Partners chief executive Mark Kottler, who is
based in Boca Raton, Fla., said his company plans to buy up to 20
smaller general managing agency companies now underwriting and
issuing policies to niche markets, such as liability insurance for
lawyers, architects, and nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   The first acquisition, last month, was an Illinois company that
insures architects, engineers, home inspectors, educators, and
public officials, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Kottler said such firms typically have about $50 million in
annual premium revenues, and while profitable, are managed by
owners who are nearing retirement age and don't have succession
plans. ``A changing of the guard is occurring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Kottler said they both plan to locate their corporate
offices in the Hartford area, where, Harris said, a sizable work
force that knows the insurance business appears to be available.

THIS IS NOT YOUR MOTHER'S WEATHERVANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His stores abandoned by middle-age women, Larry Davidson Jr. is
hoping teenage girls can save his family's clothing business.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the Weathervane Retail Corp. of New Britain,
Conn., stocked its chain of small New England stores with wardrobes
for women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   But as these women reached middle age, fashion became less of a
priority, and a drop in sales forced a chain that traces its roots
to 1911 to seek bankruptcy protection in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Weathervane isn't the only retailer hurt by such changes. Look
at any clothing chain that targets baby-boomer women, and most have
recently posted ``lackluster results,'' says Davidson,
Weathervane's president and a grandson of a company cofounder.
</P>
<P>
   Women who were once Weathervane customers have ``migrated to
T.J. Maxx,'' he says. ``Or else they wait until department stores
have a big sale.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reinvent itself as it prepares to emerge from
Chapter 11 next month, Weathervane has shifted its focus from its
former customers to their teenage daughters. That younger
demographic group is rapidly growing in size and has seen its
spending power surge in the strong economy of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Matronly merchandise has been banished from Weathervane.
Instead, shelves groan under sporty denim and youthful styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a somewhat similar mentality to Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch _ only cheaper,'' says Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's family is no stranger to change and retail
reinvention. Founded 88 years ago by Samuel Davidson and his
brother-in-law, Alexander Leventhal, the business long operated a
string of junior department stores under the D&AMP;L nameplate,
competing with the likes of G. Fox &AMP; Co. and Sage-Allen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;L closed its doors in 1994, and many of its small family-owned
rivals are gone too, casualties of consolidation in an industry
dominated by a few department store giants.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Davidsons and Leventhals, they had branched
out in 1969, opening boutique-size stores called Weathervane that
catered to baby boomers in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   As these girls grew into women, Weathervane aged with them,
updating the merchandise to keep pace with their customers'
evolving wardrobe needs.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy worked fine for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1990s, many Weathervane customers had reached
middle age, a time when fashion becomes less of a priority and
shopping rarely qualifies as a leisure activity.
</P>
<P>
   As they juggle career and family, time-squeezed middle-age women
tend to buy new clothing for themselves only when their old
clothing wears out, Davidson says.
</P>
<P>
   And when they do shop, they want low prices and stores like T.J.
Maxx they can zip in and out of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-age women no longer shop the whole mall,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That was bad news for Weathervane. With its small stores rarely
producing more than $1.8 million each in annual sales, it couldn't
compete on price with the likes of a T.J. Maxx, whose Framingham
parent has annual sales of nearly $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So Weathervane decided to return to the teen market, in part
because just as their mothers had started stinting on fashion,
their teenage daughters were splurging on it in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   That splurge could continue for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   According to Teen Research Unlimited, a consulting firm that
tracks spending patterns, US teenagers accounted for an estimated
$141 billion in purchases last year, and the numbers of a group
sometimes labeled ``Generation Y'' and ``echo boomers'' is expected
to grow until the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, teenage girls now spend about the same as boys,
about $83 per week of either their own money or their family's
money, the group says, while as recently as 1994, girls spent much
less than boys, partly because girls with jobs earned less.
</P>
<P>
   But having demographics on your side doesn't guarantee success
for a cash-poor retailer trying to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Paragon Capital LLC of Needham came in, extending
loans to Weathervane after it filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Weathervane had operated 86 stores, many of them in strip malls
and community shopping centers. Their chief virtue? They offered
convenience to the older, time-pressed shopper.
</P>
<P>
   But teenagers still prefer to shop in big malls such as South
Shore Plaza and Natick Mall. That left Weathervane with a lot of
stores in places teenagers rarely venture.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of Chapter 11 is that it lets a retailer break
leases at unprofitable locations. Weathervane closed 32 stores; 54
remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the increased buying power of teens hasn't gone
unnoticed by other retailers. Even in its new lean-and-mean
condition, Weathervane will have to fight Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the
Gap, and Gap's sister chain Old Navy for its share of the teen
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   One Weathervane strength is its long-term relationships with
clothing manufacturers. By drawing on these relationships,
Weathervane can stock its stores almost entirely with private-label
merchandise that is comparable in quality to brand-name goods but
at a much lower price, says Paragon chief executive Stewart Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teenage daughters would buy everything they could from
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch if I let them,'' he says. ``So I'll buy them
one pair of $60 jeans from Abercrombie, but for the second and
third pair, that's when you go to Weathervane.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned Weathervane doesn't disclose financial
information, but Davidson says sales at stores restocked with teen
apparel are up smartly, and the company will report an operating
profit for the year it spent in Chapter 11.

CHURCH TRIES ADS TO AMPLIFY CALL FOR PRIESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not seem like a match made in heaven, the Roman Catholic
Church turning to savvy advertising professionals for help.
</P>
<P>
   But on billboards, radio spots and television ads, the church
has joined forces with marketing gurus to send the message that
it's looking for a few good men.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched often jarringly between car and beer commercials on
TV channels such as Comedy Central, church ads are asking male
viewers to consider the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Jarring it may be, but church leaders say they must be more
aggressive if they are to overcome a significant plunge in the
number of priests over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the United States had about 59,000 priests. Two years
ago, there were just over 48,000. More telling, the number of
parishes without a resident priest is at 2,393, up from 549 in the
mid-1960s. And this at a time when the number of Catholics _ 61.2
million _ is more than 12 million higher than in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   So, in Milwaukee, billboards declare, ``Work with the World's
Greatest Boss,'' or, ``Enjoy the Ultimate Benefits Package.'' The
small print urges the reader to call St. Francis Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign started in November, and Milwaukee church officials
said it's too early to tell if it will produce new seminary
students, but they say they have gotten several phone calls from
men interested.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Diocese of Providence, R.I. ran ads on channels
that are popular among young men _ MTV, ESPN, the Comedy Channel.
</P>
<P>
   One ad shows a telephone ringing incessantly and ends with the
message: ``Christ calling you to the priesthood.'' Since the ads
started running, three men have applied to study for the
priesthood, including a police officer and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten many, many calls from Catholics praising us for
even doing this,'' said the Rev. Marcel Taillon, director of
vocations for the Providence diocese. ``I think people are just
happy that the church is trying to get this message out and to have
something positive about the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Archdiocese of Boston is not relying on ad campaigns
to draw more priests, officials are trying new outreach strategies
to attract candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, for example, Cardinal Bernard Law is hosting a
retreat at St. John's Seminary in Brighton for 47 men who have
expressed interest in the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Law first held the retreat in 1997. That year 23 men attended;
last year it was 29. Of the 52 who went on the retreat, 14 have
applied to enter St. John's Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able spend that much quality time with the cardinal
really confirmed for me that this was the route I wanted to take,''
said Michael Drea, 32, who went on last year's retreat and is in
his first year at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cardinal's willingness to do this really gives a
lot of encouragement to people who may be sitting on the fence and
not quite sure if they want to do this,'' said Drea, who worked at
St. Sebastian's School in Needham, Mass. before entering the
seminary. ``It's really impressive to have someone like him doing
this and challenging people to consider the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Hines, 30, another first-year student at St. John's who
left a job to pursue the priesthood, said the 45-minute
conversation he had with Law at last year's retreat ultimately made
him decide to become a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we were done he said to me, `I think you have the
call,' '' said Hines, who had been considering the priesthood for
years. ``I don't think I would be here if he had not said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's three-day commitment to the retreat underscores the
church's new attitude toward the recruitment of priests, church
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can the church, they said, simply sit back and expect
young men to flock to seminaries. Fewer priests means that they are
less visible in society today, making it harder to persuade young
men that the priesthood is a viable vocational option, church
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids grow up thinking about becoming a doctor, a lawyer, but
not many grow up thinking about becoming a priest,'' said Owen
Phelps, editor of The Observer, the newspaper of the Diocese of
Rockford, Ill. ``When I was growing up you saw priests not only
saying Mass but teaching school or coaching the basketball team.
Now, you might see a priest for an hour at Mass on Sunday. Becoming
a priest doesn't register on people's radar like it used to 30 or
40 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Rockford Diocese spent $50,000 on a media
campaign that included billboards and radio and TV commercials.
``God is still calling men to religious vocations, but this is a
media age and we have to be able to work in this new culture,''
Phelps said. ``That means turning up the volume and amplifying
God's call using mass media.''
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal critics of the church say the church could more
quickly ease its priest shortage if it opened the priesthood to
married men and to women, something the Vatican shows no intention
of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support doing whatever it takes to make the Mass as widely
available as possible,'' said Sister Christine Schenk, president of
FutureChurch, a liberal national Catholic organization based in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the often high-profile marketing campaigns
appear to be paying dividends by yielding at least a slight uptick
in the number of men entering the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockford Diocese two years ago had eight men studying for
the priesthood. Right now there are 31. The Diocese of Kansas
City-St. Joseph, Mo., has seen its number of seminary students jump
from three to 20 in five years. In Milwaukee, church officials say
they expect their advertising campaign to generate 30 new
seminarians by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, after years of steep declines, the number of
students entering seminaries has stabilized in recent years at
about 500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the church needs to be out in the marketplace speaking
not in churchspeak but in the language that people understand,''
said the Rev. Robert Stiefvater, director of vocations for the
Archdiocese of Milwaukee. ``At the very least we have people
talking about the priesthood, which is not something that maybe was
happening before.''

COLLEGE ACTIVISM, '90S STYLE, UNITES TWO SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The events of the past two weeks are reminding university
administrators of their salad days: students staging sit-ins in
presidents' offices, presenting them with lists of demands,
chanting about moral imperatives in foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the issues are fair wages and better conditions in
the sweatshops that turn out billions of dollars in logo-emblazoned
college gear. Across the country, they have set off a wave of
student activism among a generation that has been labeled
apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a very different pack of protesters from the
long-haired, antiestablishment dissenters of the past. Entering the
presidents' offices, they carry cell phones and laptops so they can
do their homework (and get into good graduate schools). At
Georgetown University, students brought Dustbusters, figuring that
if they were going to occupy the president's office, they had best
clean up after themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And in a decade when each year registers another record low in
student concern for anything but their future earnings,
administrators are responding differently, too. They're not
annoyed, outraged, or polarized; they're charmed, proud _ and
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God students are getting passionate about something
other than basketball and bonfires,'' said John Burness, an
administrator who helped negotiate the end to a 31-hour standoff at
Duke University last week. ``But the tone is definitely different.
In the old days, we used to have to scramble to cut off phone lines
when they took over the president's office, but we didn't have to
worry about that here. They just bring their laptops and they do
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests began at Duke the first weekend of the month and
spread to Georgetown, where a four-day sit-in in President Leo
O'Donovan's office ended in Tuesday's wee hours. Students at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison entered a fifth day of protest
Friday, and as at the other campuses, they have been strategizing
daily via conference calls with student groups coordinating
protests at 50 other schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last big thing on campuses was divestment from South
Africa in the '80s,'' said Tico Almeida, a Duke senior. ``This
could turn out to be the next big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the protest were planted in the summer of 1997,
when Almeida and a core group of other students were working as
interns at labor unions and law firms, and learned about a plan by
14 universities to force a code of conduct on the Collegiate
Licensing Co., which manufactures logo wear for about 160 schools.
The code would set minimum wages and working conditions for the
factories that make the sweatshirts, caps, and other items sold in
university book stores.
</P>
<P>
   The students wanted a stricter code that would also force the
company to make public the location of its factories. But last
March, the universities signed a code that did not include that
provision, after the company said it didn't want its competitors to
know that information.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of trying to persuade the universities with
petitions, the students decided it was time to get pushier. More
than 100 students marched across the Duke campus to the president's
office. And with an e-mail update spreading across the country,
other campuses planned protests of their own.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a return to the spirit of the '60s, but it is a
significant blip. Each year of the past five, the annual survey of
national freshman attitudes conducted by the University of
California at Los Angeles has hit a new record low with students
who say it is important to ``keep up with political affairs.'' At
26 percent this year, it was down from 58 percent when the survey
was first done in 1966. By contrast, the interest in being well-off
financially rose to 74 percent this year from 44 percent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period during which we grew up, we remember Iran-Contra,
but we also remember presidents who were pretty popular, an economy
that's been strong the last several years,'' said Alex Zwerdling, a
Middlebury College junior who delivered students' demands to the
administration late last week. ``At this campus you have a pretty
solidly upper-middle class bunch of people, kids have a lot of
self-interest to worry about. Not in a negative way, but they're
worried about what they're going to do when they get out of here.
It's a very personal outlook as far as betterment goes, it's
focusing on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the threat of being sent overseas to fight, students and
researchers say, political issues seem remote, unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   But working conditions in sweatshops _ where college-age
students and younger earn about $2 an hour, and may endure
poisonous air and sexual and physical abuse _ have hit a nerve.
Many of the students admit that they wear clothing made in
sweatshops, so slipping a sweatshirt over their heads in their cozy
dorm rooms, they say, reminds them of the less fortunate whose only
opportunities are in the factories where they are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are our age, even younger than us,'' said
Eric Brakken, a 21-year-old senior at Wisconsin. ``We're seeing a
lot of people who've never been involved, because this is such a
close issue for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But while today's protesters are employing phrases like Moral
Power, Solidarity, and The Principle of the Matter, they're not
carting unwilling administrators out of their offices, shoving the
finger in photographers' faces, or smoking pot in the president's
chair.
</P>
<P>
   There was a smattering of graffiti on the Georgetown campus the
weekend of the protest there. But for the most part, students sat
quietly, eating bagels while they did homework in the president's
office. When administrators asked if they might say a Mass
together, the students said, ``Sure.'' At Duke, students agreed to
let a chaperone stay with them during their occupation-sleepover in
President Nan Keohane's office, and agreed to an administration
request that they clean up after themselves. (They did that, too.)
Their version of protest music was love-happy Dave Matthews Band
songs blaring from a boombox.
</P>
<P>
   Budding activism hasn't made them abandon their academics. The
protesters include Truman and Rhodes scholars. Their numbers rose
and dwindled as they ran off to attend class or turn in papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hate the establishment? They wanted to work with it. And the
establishment was happy to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very proud of our students,'' said James A. Donahue,
dean of students at Georgetown. ``This is not just about their
self-interest, that's why the commitment and the passion is just
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Students were not only more civil than past protesters, they
were more focused on accomplishing a goal _ and less on simply
making noise.
</P>
<P>
   Students say that reflects how they've learned from the mistakes
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s, from what I've read anyway, there was a real
distrust of authority, but frankly, this is a business issue and
we've got some pretty damn smart people in the front office who can
work with us and help,'' Zwerdling said.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment, too, has changed. Many administrators were
among the longhairs, their sentences still laced with barnyard
epithets and ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a general sympathy and empathy with this as a way of
realizing social change,'' Donahue said. ``In the '60s you had a
generation of decision-makers and faculty who didn't have that
history. Now we're in the position of trying to help institutions
find responsible answers to these challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and administrators at Duke and Georgetown settled the
protests by agreeing to revisit the code of conduct after a year's
trial period, and to push the company to make its factory locations
public if conditions don't improve. The students say they'll be
watching, and ready to strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Wisconsin, often a more radical campus, students
were already upping the ante. Next up? A hunger strike.

US TINKY STINK MAKES BRITISH WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Most Britons greeted the outings of three gay Cabinet
ministers in recent months with stifled yawns. But when the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, the American televangelist, outed one of the
Teletubbies this past week, the country responded with guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on stupidity among Americans is a favorite pastime
here, and because of Falwell, the Brits had no shortage of fodder
last week.
</P>
<P>
   News broke here on Thursday that Falwell had warned readers of
his National Liberty Journal under a ``Parents Alert'' to guard
their children against the influence of Tinky Winky, the largest of
the four Teletubbies, the British import that has become a staple
on US public television.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said that Tinky Winky was a closet gay role model, part
of what he considers an insidious campaign to brainwash the masses
into accepting that homosexuals are normal.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Falwell cited Tinky Winky's color, purple, which he
said is the gay pride color, and the triangle antenna on Tinky
Winky's head, again a symbol of gay pride. And, Falwell pointed
out, while Tinky Winky mumbles in the voice of a male, the purple
Teletubby at times carries a handbag.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a spokesman for Ragdoll Productions, which created
``Teletubbies'' and distributes it in the United States, said he
was perplexed by Falwell's conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   First, the gay pride color in Britain is pink, not purple. And
Tinky Winky's accessory is a magic bag, not a handbag. As for the
antenna, the spokesman suggested that Falwell, or anyone else
predisposed to creating controversy, could make all sorts of
insinuating accusations about the antennae of the other
Teletubbies. Dipsy's, for example, could be viewed as phallic.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC, which broadcasts ``Teletubbies'' in Britain and
distributes them internationally, issued a statement saying,
``Teletubbies is an entertainment and innocent program for
preschool children to enjoy. Any symbolism people may find in it is
of their own making.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Falwell's accusations against Tinky Winky are just off
color, Tinky Winky is no stranger to controversy. In 1997, David
Thompson, the British actor who first wore the Tinky Winky costume,
was fired because, as Ragdoll and the BBC put it at the time, ``his
interpretation of the role was not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   It emerged that one of Thompson's hobbies was ``naked balloon
dancing,'' whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of sex, watching the Teletubbies is a
mind-numbing experience. It takes a vivid imagination to find
anything sexual about them. The Teletubbies, who wear no clothes
but show no signs of genitalia, are gentle creatures who speak in
gibberish _ like the preschoolers who form their audience. They
often engage in communal affection, known in Teletubby parlance as
``big hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, teenagers and young adults have been known to take
drugs and hold parties watching tapes of the Teletubbies. Some
critics here have suggested the underlying theme of the children's
series is not sex, but the ingestion of prodigious amounts of
hallucinogens.
</P>
<P>
   No one here had ever complained about the supposed sexual
content of the Teletubbies, or more specifically that Tinky Winky
was gay. That is, until Falwell piped up.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits, meanwhile, are beside themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, they say, until Falwell finds out that the actress who
plays Po is Pui Fan Lee, a Chinese left-wing radical.

DARTMOUTH PLAN RELIES ON MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does anyone else remember the hoax perpetrated a few years back
by a group calling itself the Barbie Liberation Organization? It
bought up hundreds of talking GI Joe and Barbie dolls and then
switched the voice boxes before restocking the toy store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The hilarious result? Buxom Barbies that bellowed: ``Vengeance
is mine!'' and camouflaged soldiers that fretted: ``Will we ever
have enough clothes?''
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of that clever illustration of gender caricature
by news of Dartmouth College's stealth campaign to civilize its
frat boys by sending women to live among them.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Dartmouth president James Wright is trying to
solve some serious problems, from social isolation to alcohol
abuse, on the Hanover, N.H., campus. To his embarrassment, he is
banking on the transforming power of female virtue to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed more than he must realize since Dartmouth
admitted women in 1972. It's true more than 95 percent of corporate
executives are still men, that more than two-thirds of adults
living in poverty are still women. It's true more than 85 percent
of elected officials are still men, that more than 95 percent of
child care workers are still women.
</P>
<P>
   But women are gaining fast on men in unanticipated venues. Equal
opportunity too often means an equal chance to engage in
self-destructive behavior. Witness women's advancing rates of lung
cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   While Wright couched the changes to be instituted next fall in
terms of general concerns that ``single-sex organizations play far
too dominant a role in social life,'' it is clear that alcohol is
the heart of the problem at Dartmouth, as it is at most colleges
where the party scene revolves around Fraternity Row.
</P>
<P>
   How to bring unsupervised drinking by underage students under
control in unregulated fraternity houses is a major preoccupation
of administrators from MIT, where a fatal alcohol poisoning in 1997
forced the school to rexamine its student housing policies; to
Boston University, where an underage co-ed charged last fall that
she was raped after being served alcohol at a fraternity party.
</P>
<P>
   The 34 alcohol-related deaths estimated to have occurred on
American campuses last year only hint at the number of students
injured, assaulted or raped because of the consumption of too much
liquor. Last September, a study by the Harvard School of Public
Health reported that more than 42 percent of college students
surveyed in 1997 identified themselves as binge drinkers _ that's
five drinks at one time for a man, four for a woman. More than 52
percent said they drank expressly to get drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The number of students abusing alcohol is much higher among frat
members, says the author of the study, Dr. Henry Wechsler, adding
that members of sororities are catching up fast to their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, there is not that much difference in alcohol
consumption between sororities and fraternities on co-ed
campuses,'' says Wechsler. ``I wish I could say women are
different, but they binge drink, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the myth of the inherent moral superiority of women.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been a double-edged sword. The Seven Sisters
schools were founded more than a century ago to educate women
turned away from colleges like Dartmouth because of notions about
female delicacy, including ``scientific'' evidence that
intellectual pursuits could cause permanent sterility in women.
</P>
<P>
   The suffragists tried to turn prevailing myths about women to
their advantage, arguing that granting women the vote would
``purify'' politics. Well, we've all seen how that's worked out.
</P>
<P>
   President Wright has his work cut out for him at Dartmouth,
where students canceled Winter Carnival parties last weekend to
protest his threat to the fraternity system. ``My sympathies are
with him,'' says Dr. Wechsler. ``There is no simple answer to this.
He should get credit for trying to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dartmouth women do integrate the fraternities next fall, they
should take their cue not from their new frat brothers but from
their sisters at all-women colleges. There, Wechsler says, binge
drinking is far less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   At Wellesley, they know that when William Allen White advised
women ``to raise more hell and fewer dahlias,'' he did not have a
frat party in mind.

A RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY OR NOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was often hysterical but rarely historical; no one bothered
to note what they were doing the day impeachment died. What Clinton
got caught doing was terribly tawdry but never rose to the required
tyrannical. We wasted a year's public business, flattened pine
trees and Washington's wandering attention span on this trumped-up
political passion play. Clinton started us down this dismal road.
His enemies not only enthusiastically joined the parade; they wound
up leading it.
</P>
<P>
   At the anticlimax of this never-consummated sexual dalliance we
tote up the damage. Every subsequent president will have to deal
with the diminished and devalued presidency. Thanks to the
follow-the-headlines-wherever-they-lead gutlessness of various
courts and judges afraid to step in the path of the infotainment
industry's juggernaut, every future president can be sued while in
office on the most trivial of charges.
</P>
<P>
   Some Son-of-Paula-Jones scandal will eventually unhinge some
president or some presidency; that 9-0 Supreme Court ruling
allowing presidents to be sued is not only daft but dangerous. No
president can henceforth accept total loyalty or candor or
confidence from his lawyers or bodyguards. We stripped future
presidents bare; we'll rue the day we gave the impeachment mob the
run of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders spent 12 months in a ``collective gof.'' We
haven't seen mass self-hypnosis of this scope since Jonestown. The
right wing brewed this heady elixir, and the Sun Belt moralists
couldn't get enough of the stuff. It was autosuggestion on a vast
scale.
</P>
<P>
   So was it the ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' that Hillary
claimed? Your answer depends to a considerable degree upon your
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the year of Monicamania that unfolded since Mrs. Clinton's
icy allegation, much has transpired. Her husband did what he did,
said what he said, somehow kept his day job and his poll ratings
while losing much of his personal respect and his personal
reputation, which are not the same things. What his family thinks
of him, and he of them, is their private business.
</P>
<P>
   But of the ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' what is one to
conclude?
</P>
<P>
   Is it merely a coincidence:
</P>
<P>
   That independent counsel Kenneth Starr hauls down $1 million a
year in fees from a law firm representing tobacco interests when
Clinton wrought havoc in big tobacco's patch? That Starr's soft
landing at Pepperdine Law School is funded by Clinton-hater Richard
Mellon Scaife, paymaster to the right-wing scandal machine? That
Starr hired a Paula Jones supporter, lawyer Paul Rosenzweig? That
Clinton was ambushed in his Paula Jones deposition and grand jury
testimony by a suspiciously linked chain involving the duplicitous
Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg, a onetime Nixon campaign spy who
spoonfed Newsweek and other news outlets like Matt Drudge, the
Internet sludge-pot?
</P>
<P>
   That House Republicans rushed to impeachment judgment in
December for fear their shrunken majority might choke on removing
Clinton? That right-wing mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose plan to enrich
Newt Gingrich with $4.5 million in book contracts, cranked up his
empire to fricassee Clinton at every turn?
</P>
<P>
   That the trio ordered deposed and videotaped by Senate
Republicans just happened to include two Jews and a black man,
whose words and image, now in the public domain, can be used in Sun
Belt campaign commercials?
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton-Gore policies are too green, too tree-huggy, too
enviro-friendly for Sun Belt economic interests, stripminers,
agri-biz and resource extractors, and the solons who live off their
campaign dough? That eight of 10 GOP congressional leaders, and
many of the committee chairmen, are from Southern or Western states
hostile to Clinton's policies?
</P>
<P>
   That at almost every critical juncture of Whitewater, Filegate,
Travelgate, You-name-it-gate, there were shadowy right-wingers
forking over large sums to keep the jackal pack on the hunt? That
so many of the lawmakers in thrall to the antiabortion forces were
also impeachers? That the dump-Clinton chorus wound up as almost
totally partisan, regional, ideological, and even religiously
demarked, with the politicized Christian right out front?
</P>
<P>
   If your answer to all of the above is ``yes,'' that all this is
merely a coincidence, then you do not believe with Hillary and
millions of other Americans that this was some sort of ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Me? My own answer is a weak ``sort of.'' I have trouble with
conspiracy theories. They are very hard to prove, and even if
unproven, they corrode the political process, undermine faith in
democracy, and delegitimize opponents' often fairly won triumphs.
Millions of Americans, maybe one in three, wanted Clinton out, many
for righteous and moral reasons, perhaps some with a less worthy
political agenda in mind. I have friends on both sides of the fault
line Clinton has imprinted on our body politic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans made it hard on those who don't want to
believe in political conspiracies at the highest level of national
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The further left or right you go on the political spectrum, the
more willing people are to embrace conspiracy theories. And they're
not good for your political health.

HERE'S TO ROBERT DUVALL, AN ACTOR, NOT A MOVIE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the approach of the Academy Awards, it is
time to root for Robert Duvall. No matter what the outcome, this is
a worthwhile investment, a bankable emotion. After his portrayal of
a Boston lawyer, Jerome Facher, stole ``A Civil Action'' from the
rest of an excellent cast, Duvall received another Oscar
nomination, his third for best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   He is an actor, not a movie star, a crucial difference. In a
lifetime of covering politics, I've met many stars who were
campaigning for or against some politician: Bob Hope, Jimmy
Stewart, Gregory Peck, Warren Beatty, Angie Dickinson and others.
</P>
<P>
   For conversation, it's useful to compliment a star on a lesser
work, as John F. Kennedy did when he met Norman Mailer. ``I've read
`The Deer Park,' '' JFK deadpanned to the novelist, ``and the
others.'' When I complimented Paul Newman on ``The Helen Morgan
Story,'' he raised an eyebrow, but took it well.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Shirley MacLaine, you were great in ``Two Mules for Sister
Sarah.'' Her dazzlingly elfin smile showed she could be a good
sport about it. When I raved about his performance in ``Inside
Daisy Clover,'' Robert Redford grinned, kept the conversation
going, and eventually invited me to lunch. (With this churlish
gambit, ink-stained wretches fear no retaliation; few respondents
have the time or patience to research our multitudinous lesser
works.)
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars are instinctively polite to anyone with a press
card, but when I encountered Robert Duvall, I was on my own time
and my own nickel. He, too, was on vacation last year at a pleasant
spot far from Broadway or Hollywood. As he crossed the garden of
the hotel, his gait was unmistakable, evoking what Katharine
Hepburn said of John Wayne's ``light dancer's steps.''
</P>
<P>
   As Duvall approached, I stalled in a too-familiar wasteland
between tongue-tied and garrulous. Figuring that most artists savor
appreciation based on some knowledge, I blurted out the
compliments.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Duvall, I loved every frame of ``The Apostle.'' You captured
the Southern Baptists I got to know when I pulled guard duty at the
US Army Chaplains School. I played football against them and
discussed scripture with them. You portrayed the uncomplicated
simplicity of Southern clergy, so different from today's media
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Duvall appeared genuinely interested. ``Was that in the South,
sir?'' (Sir?) No, it was actually on a post in Long Island Sound.
It was surreal, protecting the choir practice of the padres with my
M-1 rifle against a flotilla of godless Bolsheviks bent on
interrupting ``Bringing in the Sheaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Duvall's eyes narrowed as though he were enduring a feckless
pitch for a lame screenplay. I returned to my principal mission.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, I loved many of your roles, from Boo Radley to
Frank Burns and Frank Hackett. Tom Hagen, of course, and Mack
Sledge, Bull Meechum, Colonel Kilgore, and Doctor Watson, Tom
Spellacy, and Lucky Ned Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering his roles rather than acknowledging his celebrity
was an offer he could not refuse. He said a fervent thank you and
we wished each other good day.
</P>
<P>
   He made it possible and easy to remember ``To Kill A
Mockingbird,'' ``MASH,'' ``Network,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Tender
Mercies,'' ``The Great Santini,'' ``Apocalypse Now, ``The Seven
Percent Solution,'' ``True Confessions'' and ``True Grit.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the star in only two, winning the best-actor Oscar for
``Tender Mercies'' and a best-actor nomination for ``The Great
Santini.'' He has been in some turkeys, too. ``The Betsy'' and
``The Eagle Has Landed'' were awful, but Duvall's performances were
not.
</P>
<P>
   He's no matinee idol, but he had stage training in New York,
where his pals were Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. His politics
and personality? Who cares? Jay Carr, a critic's critic, calls him
an American Alec Guinness, high and proper praise for Robert
Duvall, an actor's actor.

FRYE GETS BACK INTO THE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ As the ball sailed over the left-field fence,
becoming as small as a snowflake against a cloudless sky, the
batting-practice slugger couldn't resist taking a shot at his
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be depressed,'' Jeff Frye taunted Joe Kerrigan, the
pitching coach who was muttering to himself on the mound. ``I've
been on a couch for 12 months, and I take you deep.''
</P>
<P>
   To borrow Pedro Martinez's favorite phrase, Jeff Frye is back in
the house, nearly a full year after his left knee disintegrated
during a rundown drill in camp. He arrived here more than a week
ago, well ahead of Tuesday's reporting date for position players,
and there was no mistaking his pleasure as he took his swings with
catcher Scott Hatteberg, another early arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't do what I did before,'' said Frye, ``I won't be the
second baseman. That's why I came early, to be ready when the rest
of the guys get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is fully recovered from surgery that left him with a
matching set of repaired anterior cruciate ligaments, one in each
knee, Frye admits he'll be concerned that the signing of
high-priced Jose Offerman means he may be dealt before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm here, but yeah, I have doubts,'' said Frye, who
made a successful comeback from surgery on his right knee six years
ago, but will be 33 on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of rumors that they're shopping me around.
Nobody's stupid enough to make a deal when there are question marks
about a guy's health, but we'll find out pretty early how things
are going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye was wearing shorts and a T-shirt left over from his 1996
collection. On the back, it read: ``Mo gets a $50,000 bonus and
didn't bring us any T-shirts back. So we bought our own. Thanks for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the bonus Mo Vaughn received after
winning the MVP award in 1995. Frye thought of designing a new
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of making one that said `B.C./A.M.,' '' Frye
said. `` `Before Christ and After Mo,' but I didn't want anybody to
take it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Frye came to camp last February, there could not have been
more things right in his universe. Coming off his best season in
the big leagues, one in which he batted .312 and appeared in a
career-high 127 games, Frye had been rewarded with a three-year, $7
million contract. A favorite of manager Jimy Williams, who loved
Frye's fearlessness, he figured to be the team's leadoff man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was at a point where my career was taking off,''
Frye said. ``Instead, I wound up sitting at home.''
</P>
<P>
   While attempting to tag Darren Bragg between third and home
during a routine drill, Frye's spikes caught and his left knee
buckled, making a sound that turned his heart to dust. Frye had
torn not only the ACL but also some cartilage, sending the Sox on a
season-long scramble for a second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Four players started games at second last season _ Mike
Benjamin, Mark Lemke, Donnie Sadler, and Lou Merloni. Frye,
meanwhile, returned home to Texas, rehabilitated relentlessly, and
watched every game he could on TV, while his team went to the
playoffs without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was tough,'' he said. ``I wanted so much to be a part of
it. Not taking away anything from anybody who played second _
Sadler did a great job, so did Merloni, and Benjamin did an
unbelievable job _ but I kept feeling like the guy who was supposed
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye remained in touch with his teammates, appearing in the
visitors' clubhouse on both Red Sox visits to Arlington, Texas, and
coming to Boston for surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right
thumb, which he had jammed while sliding on the next-to-last day of
last season. The severity of the injury went undetected at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to spring training and thought it was all right,'' Frye
said. ``I could play with it. But later, my physical therapist
noticed how weak it was, and that's when we discovered the ligament
was torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he needed crutches for two weeks, Frye was on an
exercise bike the day after his knee surgery, which was done by
Richard Steadman, doctor for the US Olympic ski team. Frye wore a
brace for a couple of months and says he has been running and
jogging for the last several months. He has been hitting for the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised at first to hear last December that the Sox had
signed Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody assumed, including me, that we were going to sign
another first baseman,'' Frye said, ``and he's been pretty much a
second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the Red Sox, after losing Mo, felt like they had
to get somebody, so they got a guy who was coming off a great
season who they think can help the team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no animosity toward him. I'm happy he got $26
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye said he talked to Williams several times this winter, and
was told by the manager that he is the second baseman coming into
camp. The manager's word is good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest with you,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that unless Offerman winds up at first base, a
position he played part-time just one season in Kansas City, Frye
could be odd man out. There are two reasons, he said, that he won't
be kept in a Benjamin-type utility role. He had a terrible time
playing third base as a fill-in in '97, and he's overmatched at
short as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, they're not going to pay me what they're paying me to be
a part-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye has spent most of his career uncertain whether he had a
job, both in Texas and Boston. As recently as '97, he was forced to
the bench when Nomar Garciaparra arrived and John Valentin moved to
second, until Tim Naehring's elbow injury forced another
reshuffling. He thought his suspenseful springs had ended a year
ago, but here he is again, feet planted on ever-shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope on April 5 I'll be playing second base for the Red Sox,
playing for Jimy,'' Frye said. ``I can't think of anybody I'd
rather play for. But we'll just have to see.''

A GOLD MEDAL _ AND A BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE LAKE TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ Not long after Lisa Brown-Miller
returned home from Nagano with her Olympic gold medal last winter,
she found a message on her answering machine from coach Ben Smith.
There was a women's ice hockey camp for younger players coming up
in the summer. Would she like to help out?
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Miller hemmed. Hawed. Talked it over with her husband,
John. Called Smith back, only to get his machine. There's sort of a
circumstance, she said. We'll talk.
</P>
<P>
   When they did, she told him she was sorry but she couldn't
accept his offer. Let me put it this way, she explained, back in
Nagano, ``we're lucky we didn't get called for too many players on
the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant. The veteran forward who had talked longingly before
the Games of retiring immediately afterward to settle down, spend
more time with John, think about starting a family, was _ much to
her surprise _ already six weeks pregnant when she stood at center
ice one year ago to receive her gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we found out, I'm like wh . . . wh . . . what?''
Brown-Miller said. ``He's going to have bragging rights when he
goes to preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the US women's ice hockey team defeated Canada, 3-1,
exactly one year ago today (Feb. 17, 1998), the lives of all 20
players have changed in ways they could only have imagined _ and,
often, in ways they couldn't. They've seen their faces on
supermarket cereal shelves, and watched tapes of themselves doing
the Top 10 List with David Letterman. The team's captain, Cammi
Granato, is a radio commentator for the Los Angeles Kings. Katie
King and Tricia Dunn have co-authored a book. Everyone, from Chris
Bailey to Sandra Whyte, were greeted back home as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's doubtful anyone's life has changed more than that of
Brown-Miller, whose days are filled with the obligations brought
not by a medal, but by a baby born on Aug. 25, three weeks early
and even more beautiful than a balletic Granato breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what life would be like after, but I wouldn't
want it to be any different,'' said Brown-Miller one recent
afternoon, feeding Alex his sweet potatoes and barley cereal in the
kitchen of a new home virtually within cooing distance of all his
grandparents. ``It's like a complete 180. I'm going in the totally
opposite direction. He's my complete focus now. When we won the
gold medal, I couldn't think of any better feeling in the world,
and then Alex was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 32, Brown-Miller was the oldest player on the US squad that
went to Nagano, and the only one who was married. A member of the
national team since its inception in 1990, Brown-Miller saw 1998 _
in which the sport of women's ice hockey made its Olympic debut _
as her first, last, and only chance, and resigned in the summer of
1996 as Princeton's hockey coach to train full-time.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith says ``there wouldn't have been any sense fielding a
team if she wasn't on it,'' the 5-foot, 1-inch Brown-Miller doubted
up until the last minute that she would survive the final cut. On
the mid-December night in Lake Placid when Smith was to announce
the Olympic roster, Brown-Miller had arranged for John to be ready
to get her out of town immediately after the meeting. ``When my
name isn't read off, I don't want to be around here,'' she said she
told him. ``I was convinced I was not going to be on that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Miller played in all six games in Nagano, scoring a goal
and an assist. She also took some powerful hits, including a
drilling by Canada's Karen Nystrom with just over a minute to go in
the final game that sent her slamming to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back on that and you think, oh my god, little Alex
got rocked,'' said Brown-Miller, acknowledging that it's just as
well she didn't know she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   But after all the sacrifices, the training, the time away from
her automotive-engineer husband, she thinks she would have played
even if she had known, given her doctor's OK. ``It would have been
tough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown-Miller's situation is unusual, it is not a first.
In the 1996 Olympics, Michele Granger pitched the first 5 1/3
innings of the gold-medal softball game while two months pregnant,
while kayaker DeAnne Hemmens was also expecting. But while the
contact in ice hockey adds an extra dimension, Brown-Miller was not
on especially-thin ice in playing during the early stages of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly early on, I don't think there would be too much
danger,'' said Dr. Sandra Glasson, who served as the team's
physician. ``At that stage, the fetus is well-protected in the
uterus.'' And Brown-Miller's fitness and skill level played in her
favor. ``Basically what we tell patients is to continue the
activities that you have been participating in all along. If you've
been running two or three miles a day, it's OK to run two or three
miles a day, but it's not a good idea to take up running if your
body was not accustomed to it when you became pregnant. Most of us
couldn't go out there and play even a portion of a hockey game, but
her body was used to it.'' (Brown-Miller told the story that upon
learning she was pregnant, she asked her doctor if she could still
work out. ``You just played hockey in the Olympics,'' the physician
replied. ``Feel free.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, asked if knowing of the pregnancy would have made
him nervous, Smith gasped: ``Oh, god, yeah. As if we had a lot of
other easy decisions to make.'' Karyn Bye, for years her roommate,
agreed. ``Brownie is such a physical and intense player, and a
small player, she can get banged around a little bit,'' said Bye,
the assistant captain. ``Overall, I think it was a good thing none
of us knew, in the best interests of the entire team.''
</P>
<P>
   But once they did find out? ``I was thrilled,'' Smith said. ``I
was pretty choked up, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her teammates sprung into action. A ceremony in
Colorado Springs brought the team together; a baby shower followed.
You name it, if it was tiny and had anything to do with hockey or
the Olympics, Alex got it either then or after he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brownie looks at all of us as Alex having 19 aunts,''
said Bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had to buy a lot of clothes,'' said Brown-Miller's
husband, John, of those 19 aunts. But more important, with the team
now scattered, ``Alex is sort of a conduit to keep in touch. Lisa
talks to them a lot. It's good for Lisa, good for us, good for
Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, Brown-Miller had decided to concentrate on home and
motherhood. Having moved from an apartment into a new three-bedroom
contemporary house late last fall (``It's the one with no grass,''
said Brown-Miller in giving directions), she still has furniture to
buy and boxes of Olympic memorabilia to unpack. Although she
remains on the board of directors at USA Hockey, she recently
turned down an offer to start up and coach a women's Division I
hockey program at nearby Wayne State University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was excited about the challenge,'' she said, but
quickly nodded toward the baby. ``He's only five months old. We
think all the time I spend with him right now is real important.''
As for competition, she occasionally plays with a women's senior A
team based about an hour away, but mostly considers herself ``on
sabbatical. When I said I was ready to retire, I was ready to
retire. There are certain things I miss: I miss being around my
friends, I miss the competitive side of things. I'm sure (that as
Alex gets older) that in some way, shape or form I'll be involved
in women's hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now her favorite workout is trying to coax a smile from
Alex. It's one that doesn't take much effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad to see '98 go, because it's been so good,''
said the woman described by Smith as ``a great player, a great
coach and an all-world mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How,'' asked Brown-Miller, ``do you top it?''

A LOW BLOW ON MARCIANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks at ESPN are smart. They know how to generate barroom
arguments. It's easy. Just create a ``best ever'' list and watch
the spittle fly.
</P>
<P>
   So now we have ESPN's top 100 athletes of the 20th century.
Numbers 51-100 have been revealed and the countdown from 50 to 1 is
a weekly television event featuring one of the greats of the
century. Already we've revisited the lives and times of Chris Evert
(No. 50), O.J. Simpson (49), Pete Sampras (48), and Edwin Moses
(47), with Eric Heiden (46) coming Friday. No doubt we'll get to a
top 10 that includes Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali, and Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, folks in Brockton, Mass. are wondering how homeboy
Rocky Marciano _ the one and only undefeated heavyweight champ in
history _ came in at No. 51, missing the cut for the weekly
festival accorded members of the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marciano, Rocky's 32-year-old nephew, says, ``When you
talk about great athletes in this country in the 20th century,
Rocky has to be somewhere in the top 25. He represents everything
good about athletes _ on and off the field. I think he deserves a
place in there. There's only a few records that have lasted and
Rocky's record continues to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 45, Rocky Marciano died in a plane crash in Iowa 30 years
ago. But he's still a huge presence in Brockton, where scores of
relatives (there's a Marciano or a Colombo on just about every New
England coaching or playing roster) still live. The Rock also lives
in the minds of those who have little and fight for a better life.
He lives every time the mighty Brockton Boxers take to the gridiron
at Rocky Marciano Stadium. And he lives every time time you put
Rocky or Rocky II, III, or IV in your VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Rocky Balboa. Marciano was the real thing. The true
Rocky.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Rocco Marchegiano, the oldest of six children of
Pasqualena and Pierino Marchegiano. He was a high school catcher
and linebacker, and when he was 15 he intercepted a pass and ran it
back 67 yards for a touchdown. After school he was a coal-truck
loader, a candy mixer, a brush cutter, and a shoe factory worker
before he was drafted into the army. At Fort Lewis in Washington
state, he tried boxing for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He fought under the name of Rocky Mack in his first pro bout in
Holyoke, Mass. in 1947. The Chicago Cubs gave him a baseball tryout
that spring, but he couldn't throw or run well enough and returned
to the ring. He was a serious contender by 1951 and knocked out
37-year-old Joe Louis in New York on Oct. 26, 1951. In September of
'52, he knocked out Jersey Joe Walcott in Philadelphia to win the
heavyweight championship. He defended his title only six times and
retired in 1955 after knocking out Archie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of my heroes,'' says Massachusetts Auditor Joe
DeNucci, who had 86 professional fights and was once ranked fifth
among middleweights. ``I still remember the night I boxed Joey
Giardello at the Boston Garden in December of '61. I was 21 years
old and Rocky was sitting in the front row with my father. He
looked like an ordinary working guy, wearing boots and a winter
jacket. Giardello and I boxed to a draw and I still remember Rocky
cheering me on and saying I got robbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember being a kid watching him on closed circuit TV
at the Paramount Theater in (a Boston suburb). I saw when he
knocked out Joe Walcott for the heavyweight championship of the
world. There's no question he has to rank certainly in the top 50.
He never lost a fight. How can you not be in the top 50? I don't
get it. I don't know how they meausre issues of greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Marciano is more than a local legend. In a sport populated by
men who always hang around too long, Rocky knew when it was time to
stop. Can we think of any other boxer who left on top? Marciano is
boxing's equivalent of Sandy Koufax, Jim Brown, and Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   So how can ESPN rank him behind Eric Heiden? Edwin Moses? Chris
Evert?
</P>
<P>
   All of the above were fine performers, but Marciano would seem
to belong ahead of them _ closer to Ali and Louis in the top half
of the all-time 100.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's selection process was thorough. A panel of 48
journalists, historians, observers, and administrators cast votes.
Panelists included the likes of Roone Arledge, Chris Berman, Bob
Costas, Harry Edwards, Curt Gowdy, Bryant Gumbel, David Halberstam,
Lesley Visser, George Will, and the Globe's Bob Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is a naysayer when it comes to Rocky:
</P>
<P>
   ``The three most famous fights of his career were against
37-year-old Joe Louis, Walcott, who was about that old, and Archie
Moore, who was over 40. The rest of those guys he fought were
ham-and-eggers. Rocky's a convenient local myth and it's as simple
as that. We voted for 50 people and it never occurred to me to vote
for Rocky. It never entered my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marciano, who played in the 1986 Rose Bowl for Iowa and
now works for the Massachusetts lottery, says, ``It's lousy. The
people of Brockton still hold Rocky so dear to them. It's almost an
embarrassment to the city. They take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Marciano may have been dissed by ESPN, but he's going to be on a
US postage stamp this summer. And his name will come up again every
time a heavyweight champ tastes his first defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like with Roger Maris,'' says Peter Marciano. ``People
forgot about how great he was until last summer when his record was
challenged. You might go years without hearing Rocky's name. Then
when someone like Larry Holmes goes for his record, Rocky comes
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the University of Iowa. Rocky was killed in Iowa. I
remember when Holmes got to 48-0 all my college buddies were
ragging on me, telling me Rocky's record was going down. At that
same time, people there invited me to Newton, Iowa, where Rocky's
plane crashed. I saw the one big oak tree in the cornfield and I
knelt down and said a prayer. I prayed that his record would stand
forever. Holmes lost the fight that night. Rocky answered my
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rocky is indeed Up There jabbing in the big ring in the sky,
you know he must be asking himself one question.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Heiden?

TEAMS SET SIGHTS ON TOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the regular season evaporating into its final few games and
the start of conference tournaments only a few days away, less than
three weeks remain until the field for the NCAA women's basketball
tournament is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Selection Sunday is March 7, when 64 teams will learn where
they're seeded and who they'll be playing as the always-emotional
chase for a national title begins to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   How many New England teams shape up as NCAA worthy? While the
high of six teams probably won't be reached, it's a good bet that
the following will be extending their seasons:
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (21-4): From the time practice began in October, the
Huskies were a shoo-in to make their 11th consecutive NCAA
appearance. The path to the postseason hasn't been as smooth as in
the past _ the Huskies may not even win their sixth straight Big
East postseason title, given that tournament host Rutgers is tied
for first with UConn and lost by only a point in their only
regular-season meeting. Even so, the Huskies' reality is different
than that of any other New England team. One question their fans
want answered: will their two-year Final Four drought end?
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (18-6): Emphatic victories over Notre Dame and
UConn helped guarantee the Eagles their first appearance in the
tourney, negating a third straight midseason slump. At any rate,
losing to UConn, Rutgers, and Notre Dame is far less injurious than
being defeated by Syracuse, Providence, and Villanova. Finishing
the regular season with two wins will give BC the 20 victories that
coach Cathy Inglese so covets; coupling that with a decent showing
in the Big East tourney would seem to ensure at least a seventh or
eighth seed.
</P>
<P>
   Maine (18-5): The Black Bears did nothing this season if not
show that theirs was more than a one-woman team. If America East
opponents thought the graduation of All-American Cindy Blodgett was
going to open doors for them, a three-headed offensive attack
slammed it shut. Methuen's Jamie Cassidy (23.3 points per game),
Medford's Kristen McCormick (45.9 3-point percentage), and Amy
Vachon (8.2 assists per game) all rank among the nation's top 10 in
their categories as the Black Bears try for a fifth consecutive
conference title (and automatic bid).
</P>
<P>
   Other America East contenders include New Hampshire, which
counts on Orsi Farkas to lead it to a postseason surprise, as does
Vermont with Karalyn Church. Northeastern has its best team in
years, led by Tesha Tinsley and Betsy Palacek, and is certainly
capable of repeating its regular-season upset of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross (18-7): Amy O'Brien is in the last few weeks of a
wonderful four years with the Crusaders, and the school's all-time
leading scorer would like nothing better than to cap her career
with a third Patriot League championship and subsequent NCAA berth.
The Crusaders have lost just one league game, so it would take a
monumental effort to deny them a second straight bid and sixth
overall (second only to UConn among New England schools).
</P>
<P>
   In the Ivy League, which does not conduct a postseason tourney,
Dartmouth is a game behind first-place Princeton with five games
left and plays the Tigers this weekend. Harvard and Brown also are
still in the running but need help from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A thousand welcomes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast-10 Conference's 1,000-point club welcomed two more
members last Saturday: Assumption's Stacy Mattioli, a junior from
Sturbridge, and Stonehill senior Becky Barrett of Needham each
reached the milestone. For Barrett, the feat was even more
impressive since she's the NE-10's reigning defensive player of the
year . . . Jillian Danker, one of New England's most highly
sought-after players as a senior at Minnechaug Regional in
Wilbraham last year, led Vanderbilt with 15 points in a Feb. 7 loss
to No. 1 Tennessee. Danker, a 6-foot-1-inch guard/forward, is
averaging 4.5 points per game as one of the Commodores' top
reserves . . . UConn has scored 100 or more points in 12 games,
three shy of Long Beach State's 1987 record . . . If Massachusetts
wins one of its final two regular-season games, it will ensure a
fifth straight .500 or better season under Joanie O'Brien. It's
worth nothing that, three years before O'Brien took the job, UMass
was 0-27 . . . The latest strange polling twist: Virginia Tech has
the nation's sixth-best ratings power index, a 23-1 record, and is
ranked 10th. Rutgers (eighth in RPI), Duke (ninth), and Old
Dominion (10th) all are deemed better teams by the AP voters . . .
Coaches have been known to make some peculiar promises if their
team achieves certain goals, but it's doubtful any can rival these:
If No. 20 Santa Barbara makes the Sweet 16, coach Mark French says
he'll go sky-diving. And should the Gauchos go further, assistant
Cori Close has agreed to go on ``The Dating Game.''

   HANOVER, N.H. _ It's a sunny and brisk winter day, and Dartmouth
College students by the dozens are hurrying across the town green
on their way to classes.
</P>
<P>
   And keeping right up with them is Betty Tuttle, 81, who is still
working on her learning curve. ``We have so many advantages because
of Dartmouth,'' says Tuttle. ``It's like a Utopian kingdom here.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired librarian, Tuttle is among the growing number of older
people who, instead of moving to a Sun Belt ``leisure village''
built around a golf course, have opted for retirement communities
built close to major colleges and universities such as Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   In such communities, residents are able to lead stimulating,
active lives largely based on taking advantage of opportunities on
campus, from auditing classes and lectures to attending concerts
and sporting events. At Dartmouth, such options extend outdoors and
include skiing at the college-owned downhill area or on a superb
network of cross-country trails, as well as participating in
organized hikes, nature walks, and canoe trips.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly of Rockport, ``Bee Gee'' Tuttle and her husband,
Irving, a Dartmouth alumnus, are among the 370 residents of Kendal
at Hanover, a retirement community situated two miles from the
Dartmouth campus and linked to it by shuttle bus. This is not the
kind of retirement community where rocking on the veranda is the
most exciting option _ or even a probable one.
</P>
<P>
   The residents (who range in age from their mid-60s to their
mid-90s) tend to be a high-powered lot, including about 40 retired
professors, two former college presidents, doctors, lawyers,
Fortune 500 executives, a leading yacht designer, and a former
chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. In most cases, they bring
to retirement the same determination to excel that they did to
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the combination of being able to enjoy the beauty of
the outdoors and also go to wonderful concerts, exhibitions, and
programs at the college,'' says Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle recently attended a Dartmouth function that showed the
advantages of being where she is. Called ``A Feast of Song,'' it
was a lavish 17th-century-style banquet at which costumed Dartmouth
students served the meal, played baroque music, and put on period
skits. ``Where else but someplace like this would I get a chance to
go to something like that?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 campus-oriented retirement communities
around the country, including several in Massachusetts, with dozens
more in the planning or discussion stages.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's Landing is on the campus of Springfield College and was a
joint venture of the college and a local hospital group, Bay State
Health Systems. Loomis House in Holyoke and Loomis Village in South
Hadley are close to Mount Holyoke College and a short ride from the
rest of the Five College Area. Applewood in Amherst is directly
across from Hampshire College and has a stop on the free bus route
that serves the five schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of the colleges was a major consideration in
placing the community here,'' says Applewood director Robert
Woolrich. ``There are tremendous learning opportunities.'' Tuttle
believes that the stimulation retirees find in Hanover is
rejuvenating. ``People seem to get younger here,'' she says. ``I
was cross-country skiing not long ago and a 90-year-old woman from
Kendal came up and passed me. And my 96-year-old neighbor has just
started rereading `War and Peace,' but this time she's doing it in
Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities such as Kendal attract retirees who are more
concerned with expanding their mental horizons than in improving
their tan or golf swing, says James Armstrong, former president of
Middlebury College. ``There is a vigorous quality about life here
that helps us maintain our health, and I don't feel the least bit
old,'' says the 79-year-old Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has a daily routine that, he says, leaves little time
for boredom. A typical day includes a couple of hours working at
his desk, followed by exercise such as tennis or cross-country
skiing. In the afternoon he usually participates in committee work
and then has cocktails with friends before dinner. The after-dinner
program often includes attending a class or an event at the
retirement community or on the Dartmouth campus.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth College does not have a direct tie to Kendal, but
according to John Hennessey, chairman of the retirement community's
board of trustees and former dean of the college's Amos Tuck School
of Business Administration, ``There has always been a bond between
us.'' Professors often allow Kendal residents, many of them
Dartmouth alumni, to audit courses. And residents avidly
participate in an expansive adult-learning program offered through
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Occupying a 65-acre site, a former farm at a bend in the
Connecticut River, Kendal looks more like an upscale condominium
complex than the popular image of a retirement community. Most of
the residents are independent and live in their own apartments. But
Kendal also is a ``continuing care'' community and has an
assisted-living program and a nursing unit providing skilled care
to residents who are infirm, bedridden, or have cognitive
disabilities. Amenities include three restaurants, a health clinic,
a beauty parlor, a bank, hobby workshops, a gift shop, meeting
rooms, a 7,000-volume library, an exercise room, and a large heated
lap pool.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kendal is considered moderately priced for a community
of its type, all this doesn't come cheap. Entry fees, nonrefundable
after a trial period, range from $80,962 to $287,864, depending on
the size of a unit and whether a single person or a couple occupy
it. Monthly fees, which include one meal a day, run from $1,539 to
$3,604.

MAKING CREPES DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TRYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the ado about ``wraps'' these days, you'd think
enveloping food in a pancake was something new. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   Remember crepes? Those light, feathery French pancakes that used
to appear on fancy restaurant menus in the '60s. They were filled
with cheeses, fruit, seafood and chicken. They were drenched in
newburg sauce, cheese sauce or spirits. And they were a pain to
make. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances such as nonstick saute pans that really
don't stick have made crepe cooking easier. And instant-blending
flour means you can whip out a batch of crepes in half the time it
used to take. Another reason to make crepes: They freeze perfectly
so you can pull them out and heat them up whenever you need a quick
appetizer, entree or dessert.
</P>
<P>
   There are, generally, two types of crepes: sweet and savory. And
about all the two kinds have in common is the method for making
them. Sweet crepes can contain sugar in the batter, but they don't
have to. They're usually made from white flour and cooked in
clarified butter or an unflavored oil such as corn. Dessert crepes
are filled with sweet cheeses, chocolate, fruit and other things
that make sugar-lovers swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Savory crepes, on the other hand, can be made with buckwheat or
whole wheat flours, in addition to white flour. They can be cooked
in olive oil and filled with meats, sharp cheeses, spices and
topped with gravies and sauces. Some chefs are even adding
vegetables or vegetable puree to the crepe batter. A technique
that's reminiscent of those green (spinach) or red (pepper)
tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find a crepe recipe in any good French cookbook,''
says Sophie Parker, owner of Chez Sophie in Malta, N.Y., ``but be
sure to make the dough and let it rest for an hour or two,
sometimes even overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Crepe batters need a good rest to help the flour fully dissolve
into the liquid. However, if you use an instant-blending flour
(like those sold for making gravy) you can cut the resting time
down from at least an hour to 10 minutes, according to ``The Way to
Cook,'' by Julia Child (Knopf, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Another key to making crepes is the amount of oil or butter in
the pan, Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil the pan very lightly,'' Parker says. ``Take a clean piece
of paper towel and rub the oil on the pan. You don't want to pour
it in and have a pool.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parker makes crepes for special occasions, she uses corn
oil. ``It doesn't have any taste and it's very light,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crepe batter must coat the bottom of the pan quickly,
the most important thing to remember is to keep the pan at the
proper temperature, Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's too hot, the batter will dry out too quickly and not
coat the pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker recommends cooking crepes over a medium flame. Another
trick, especially when using an electric stove, is to lift the pan
off the heat when you pour in the batter then swirl the batter
around the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the crepe until the top is set and the bottom is lightly
browned. Then, turn it for a few seconds and slide it off onto a
plate. Accomplished crepe makers simply flip the crepe in the pan
without a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is superstition in France,'' says Parker, who grew up in
Northern France, ``that on Mardi Gras, if you can flip a crepe with
one hand while you hold a coin behind your back with the other
hand, you'll have money the rest of the year. But you can't use any
utensils.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what you fill them or top them with, that's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you don't even have to bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them just sprinkled with sugar and rolled up like a
cigar,'' Parker says. ``The contrast between the hard sugar and the
soft crepe is delicious.''

POLITICS WITH BRAINS, BODY; BRIGHT `FUTURAMA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strange but true: John F. Kennedy Jr., having lived the most
atypical life imaginable, may actually be more in touch with the
thinking of regular folks than your average Beltway pundit is.
</P>
<P>
   This conviction emerges from a reading of Abigail Pogrebin's
profile of the scion of Camelot-turned-magazine editor in the March
issue of Brill's Content, along with an interview of Kennedy by
Pogrebin and the relentless Steven Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Washington insiders have either yawned or sneered at George ever
since Kennedy launched it four years ago as a ``lifestyle magazine
grounded in politics,'' and Pogrebin reports that they continue to
do so. But Pogrebin also takes the extra, revealing step of talking
to actual readers of George, and they describe it as a magazine
that puts politics in its proper place: comfortably on the
periphery of their lives, not at the center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   In creating George along those lines, it could be argued that
Kennedy has a firmer grip on the public pulse than most pundits do.
We have, as Kennedy notes, entered a ``postpartisan'' and
nonideological age, opening up plenty of room for George's
evenhanded approach. Sure, George (circ. 420,000) goes overboard on
the show-biz stuff and gives too many celebrity airheads a
platform, but it's a better mag than its detractors claim. It
succeeds because it recognizes how completely the boundaries
between pop culture and politics have blurred, and how utterly the
traditional, eat-your-peas approach to political journalism turns
off young readers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy says George is aimed at people who want to ``talk about
politics with the same sort of informed casualness that they might
talk about the new movie coming out, or a new record, or the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be the democratic ideal, but it sure describes a
lot of people I know. So why shouldn't George's personality-driven
journalism be one avenue into public affairs for apolitical Gen
Xers and their younger siblings of Generation Y? In any case, it's
hard to argue with either half of this Kennedy assertion: ``There
were a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a farce,
and it hasn't been.''
</P>

<P>
   Speaking of farces: It's not easy to express dismay at the
election of Jesse (The Body) Ventura as governor of Minnesota
without coming off like a stuffed shirt, but Dennis Cass manages it
splendidly in this month's Harper's.
</P>
<P>
   Cass, a Minnesotan, followed the former pro wrestler's campaign
of ``celebrity, inexperience and issue-avoidance'' and was present
at Ventura's election-night party, where frat boys, bikers, and
punk-rockers gathered to celebrate the triumph of a candidate
``whose campaign refrain was `I don't know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Cass's view, Ventura's victory represents _ among other
disquieting things _ the further erosion of an already dubious
tradition: the election of former entertainers to political office.
From Ronald Reagan and Clint Eastwood _ ``the top of the food
chain'' _ the trend has moved to encompass Sonny Bono and former
``Love Boat'' actor Fred Grandy. Now a major state has a governor
best known for ``prancing around in shiny panties and a feather
boa'' as one of the designated villains of wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventura is not only television, he's Saturday morning
television,'' laments Cass. ``He's cable, he's pay-per-view, he's
direct-to-video. . . . Minnesota is about to become like Italy,
where porn stars win parliamentary seats, and I wonder what is
next, whether somewhere in America there is a birthday-party
magician destined to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of these days, it will finally be universally acknowledged
that ``The Simpsons,'' rather than ``Seinfeld,'' has been the best
TV show of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' ' creator Matt Groening does not pound that
drum during an interview in the new issue of Wired magazine, but he
does say enough about his upcoming midseason show for Fox,
``Futurama,'' to whet the appetite of anyone who has ever fallen
off the couch laughing at Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' is set in the year 3000, and it features, in the
words of Wired executive editor Kevin Kelly, ``celebrity talking
heads in jars, narcotic soft drinks, while-you-sleep advertising,
one-eyed she aliens, jet-powered scooters, beer-drinking robots,
and a corrupt megacorporation run by a despotic mom.'' The robot
looks especially promising, a cyborg screw-up to rival Homer
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   With mordant wit, Groening delivers his opinions on pop culture,
advertising, cartooning, merchandising spinoffs, the Web sites
devoted to Simpsonia, the appropriations of his characters' images
by groups ranging from vegetarians to neo-Nazi skinheads, and why
he retains his belief that the one key thing to remember at all
times is that ``the authorities don't have your best interests at
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Best news of all: Groening says that `` `The Simpsons' are still
on the air in the year 3000.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the year 3000, maybe media moguls will have figured out how
to combine the Net and TV, a hoped-for convergence that is their
consuming obsession these days. Everyone wants to do it, but no one
is quite sure how, or what it will look like.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can mastermind the Net-TV marriage, it just might be
Geraldine Laybourne, the subject of stories in both Forbes and
Wired. Laybourne is the odds-bucking woman who, armed with only a
master's degree in early childhood education, transformed an
obscure cable network called Nickelodeon into the reigning
powerhouse of children's television. ``She turned what was a
`spinach' channel, something kids should eat, into a `pizza'
channel, something kids wanted to eat,'' her first boss at Nick
tells Forbes author Tom Post.
</P>
<P>
   Now Laybourne has teamed up with Oprah Winfrey and the creative
team behind ``Roseanne'' and ``Third Rock From the Sun'' to create
Oxygen, a TV channel aimed at women. Laybourne already seems to be
looking beyond the immediate competition from the existing women's
channel, Lifetime, toward a larger goal of creating a multimedia
company that combines ``the entertainment power of television with
the interactivity and specificity of the Internet,'' according to
Post.
</P>
<P>
   The author makes clear just how difficult it will be to
integrate the two media _ and how foolish it would be to bet
against Laybourne.

FOR DECORATING, IT'S RED ALL OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Throughout history, the color red has carried
many different connotations _ from aggression and destruction to
vibrant emotion to love and the celebration of life.
</P>
<P>
   A color favored historically in interior design, it provided
backgrounds for figural work on the frescoed walls of the ancient
city of Pompeii, for the throne rooms of royal palaces, for many of
the great literary and artistic salons of Europe and on down to the
chambers in ``red-light'' districts.
</P>
<P>
   In China, red was considered the symbol of pleasure, joy and
festivity, and it was the symbol for blazing love in the Eastern
Orthodox Church, according to Frank H. Mahnke in the book ``Color:
Environment &AMP; Human Response'' ($64.95, Van Nostrand Reinhold,
1996).
</P>
<P>
   Red can raise the blood pressure. It is popular for sports cars
and barns. It's the first color that babies see.
</P>
<P>
   Mahnke, founder and director of the American Information Center
for Color and Environment in San Diego, an environmental designer
and consultant for architectural projects, noted that red is an
arousing, exciting, stimulating color with positive associations of
passion, strength, activity and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Red is the boldest of all the colors in the spectrum and has the
greatest emotional impact, wrote Bonnie Rosser Krims in ``The
Perfect Palette: Fifty Inspired Color Plans for Painting Every Room
in Your House'' ($30, Warner Books).
</P>
<P>
   Red is a warm color, said Margaret Walch, director of the Color
Association of the United States in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the color red is associated with warmth and comfort,
you often see it in the dining and living room,'' Walch said. ``You
often see red used in public rooms, because it's also invigorating
and stimulating. The architect Frank Lloyd Wright used red rooms in
several of his homes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, red was a very popular color for dining
rooms, according to preservation architect Doug Bucher, of John G.
Waite Associates in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was also used occasionally in the library in the second
half of the 19th century,'' Bucher said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, red was popular for public buildings as
well, as it reiterated the old notion of being associated with
prestige and royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Chamber in the New York state Capitol was done in
red with red stenciling on the stone walls. The two legislative
chambers in state capitals were often in either red, the most
popular, or green or blue, also associated with royalty, according
to Bucher.
</P>
<P>
   The color red also is said to stimulate the appetite, which is
why it was so popular for dining rooms and restaurants. However,
because red is considered such a stimulus, you may not want it in
the kitchen if you are trying to diet, or in the bedroom if you
have trouble getting to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Red rooms fell from favor during the Colonial Revival, Classical
and Art Deco period of the early 20th century, Bucher said. It
wasn't until World War II, when dark colors became the vogue, that
red came back into fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although red is a popular room color today, you never found
much of it in American houses, except for in fabrics,'' he said.
``It would be relatively rare to find a room in red, except for in
upper-class houses, especially those in Europe. Red pigment was
expensive, which put it out of reach for many working-class homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's become very popular for the dining room, library
and living room. Works of art, especially those in gold frames,
look good against a red wall. You often see red walls in galleries
and museums for this very reason.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people simply select red walls for a room in their homes
because it's their favorite color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had actually seen red used in a dining room in another house
and decided to use it in mine, as it's also my favorite color,''
said Maria Winans of Latham, N.Y. ``We even used the same shade of
red for the inset of our tray ceiling in the dining room. So it
wasn't too much red, we used white wainscoting below the chair
rail, the cornice and window and door trim.''
</P>
<P>
   The window treatments are salmon, gold and green. ``It's all
very striking,'' she said, ``and we love it.''

WHEN CUPID VISITS THE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blame William Agee and Mary Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Her rapid rise from company neophyte to a vice president of
Bendix Corp. in the early 1980s fueled rumors that they were
engaged in an office romance _ gossip that not only led to a flood
of publicity but, for the first time, focused attention on love on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Agee was chairman of Bendix. Cunningham was a newly minted 1979
Harvard Business School graduate whose MBA had led to more than 30
job offers, including one from Bendix. He was 49; she, 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theirs was the classic case,'' Joseph Weintraub, a management
professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., says of the
Agee-Cunningham romance. ``That was where all the debate over the
office romance actually began, with Bill Agee and Mary
Cunningham.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward nearly 20 years and the debate continues, but the
parameters of the discussion certainly have changed. No longer
taboo, the office romance has bloomed as the definition of the
workplace has expanded to include social meeting ground.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to prevent messy entanglements that could affect
productivity, employers had previously adopted antidating policies
and regulations banning fraternization on _ and sometimes off _ the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, the pendulum has swung away from such
policies toward more lenient guidelines or no rules at all. The
general consensus seems to be that any attempt to legislate
morality at work might infringe on employees' privacy, or even
worse, result in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey of 600 US firms by the Society for
Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., 72 percent did not
have policies governing employee relationships or office romances.
But most US firms, 90 percent, have instituted sexual harassment
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a mine field,'' said David Blankenhorn,
president of the Institute for American Values, an academic think
tank in New York that focuses on children and family matters.
``Historically, the policies companies adopted reflected shared
cultural values. No one was going to sue because everybody thought
the company was doing the right thing. Secondly, it was in the
interest of workplace productivity and harmony. But the cultural
consensus has become fractured and conflicted. There may not even
be a consensus about this issue anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1999 Roper Starch Worldwide survey of 1,000 men
and women, 38 percent have dated a co-worker and 72 percent know of
employees who date each other. The survey suggests that Americans
are somewhat concerned about the problems inherent in such
relationships, but think it is inevitable that people who work
together will become involved. And, of those who have dated
co-workers, 23 percent said the relationship led to marriage. The
participants had some misgivings, however. When asked what they
thought about office romances, 72 percent said employees ``should
never date the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dennis Powers, author of ``The Office Romance: Playing
with Fire without Getting Burned'' (Amacom Books, New York, N.Y.),
says employees who are dating would do well to follow certain
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent problems, Powers suggests, the couple should identify
a top-ranking person who will be more likely to support their
liaison, inform the employer of the relationship, and be willing to
accept, or even suggest, a transfer to another department,
especially if the relationship is between a supervisor and
subordinate. Powers also suggests that couples who work together
consider bringing a third party to meetings to prevent gossip and
make sure discussions are conducted in an appropriate manner.
</P>
<P>
   Where corporate policies do exist, they tend to focus on the
manager-subordinate romance, with reason: The Agee-Cunningham love
connection not only upbraided lives, it raised questions about fair
play in the office. When Agee was asked by the Bendix board of
directors to describe his relationship with Cunningham, he
reportedly said he and she were simply ``very, very good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The board didn't buy it. Shortly after Cunningham's promotion to
vice president, the Bendix board fired her, sending a message that
such alliances would not be tolerated primarily because any
appearance of impropriety or favoritism can wreak havoc in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is an imbalance of power, a situation where a
manager or chief executive is involved with a subordinate, the
relationship can create issues of equity and fairness,'' noted
Babson's Weintraub. ``Even if the person is not getting favored
treatment, other people may think so. It usually turns out to be a
no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, company supervisors or managers are required to report
personal relationships with subordinates. ``Today, the only
restriction we have about the office romance is we do not want
married couples or boyfriends and girlfriends reporting to each
other,'' said AT&AMP;T spokesman Burke Stinson.

   As for dating between co-workers, Stinson said, ``I guess you
could say we treat that with benign neglect. Of the 108,000 people
employed by the telecommunications giant worldwide, approximately
8,000 are married couples who met on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co, workplace romances are generally
accepted, but relationships between the boss and underlings are
verboten. ``With a company as large as Sears, workplace romances
are something we see a lot,'' said spokeswoman Paula Davis. ``It
seems logical today that the more time you spend at work the more
likely it will become a social outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1990s, (Sears) had 29 pages of policies and
procedures, but we found that the more rules and regulations we
created, the more ambiguities cropped up,'' Davis said. The
company, which employs 300,000 people nationwide, tossed out its
regs and substituted a set of guidelines, and a 1-800-ethics assist
line to help Sears associates who are unsure or uncomfortable about
a situation related to an office romance.

MAILBOXES COME IN ALL STYLES AND TYPES

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The mailbox has become a decorative necessity
that we place at the entrance to our homes and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Wall-mounted mailboxes come in a variety of styles _ an economy
vertical box, 11-by-11 1/2 inches, in black or white metal costs
$5.48 at Home Depot, for example. A brass version costs $26.97, and
a horizontal plastic model can cost from $6.97 to $9.99. A solid
brass mailbox 15 1/2 inches wide by 7 inches high will cost
approximately $99.
</P>
<P>
   Mail slots are also popular for the door or installed to the
side of the door. These usually come in sizes of seven or 11
inches. The cost for solid brass is approximately $19.93 for the
small letter size, or $29.99 for the larger size. Brass-coated and
aluminum cost less.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike post-mounted mailboxes, frequently found in the country
and at the end of suburban driveways, wall-mounted boxes do not
feature a flag to alert the postal carrier that there is a pickup.
But they do offer the option of a newspaper or magazine holder
under the box and a lock on the upright models. Among decorative
options are solid brass boxes from mail-order catalogs that can be
personalized with your name, address or house number.
</P>
<P>
   Some are large enough to receive packages through a door on the
side of the mailbox and mail through a hinged flap on the front.
The cost is of such a box from Lillian Vernon is around $90.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new brass mailboxes are treated with a weather- and
tarnish-resistant lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   Mailboxes also come in oversize (17 3/4-by-16 1/2 inches by 7
1/2 inches high) weather-resistant plastic that never needs to be
painted and won't leak, for $24.99, from Improvements catalog. A
magnetic catch makes sure the door stays shut even when the box is
stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Door-to-door city mail delivery began in the mid-1860s,
according to Paula Rabkin, research associate on postal history for
the U.S. Postal Service headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Patent designs for mailboxes and mail slots were in abundance by
the 1890s. A commission was formed by the postal service to set
guidelines for all mailboxes. They must fit the minimum dimensions,
be weatherproof, feature a signal for pickup on rural boxes,
security such as a lock, and be relatively inexpensive to
manufacture, Rabkin said.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s and '60s many contemporary versions began to
appear. But they still must be acceptable to the postmaster, so as
not to hamper the delivery of mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In early rural delivery, prior to urban delivery, people put
just about anything out to catch the mail,'' Rabkin said. ``They
used everything from cigar boxes to used flue pipes from stoves.''

 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hamstrung by the tightest labor market in a generation,
employers are turning to a long overlooked and largely untapped
labor source: the urban and rural poor.
</P>
<P>
   As jobless rates hover at 4.3 percent nationally and 3.3 percent
in Massachusetts, more companies are recruiting from communities
once ignored, offering jobs and training to candidates with limited
education.
</P>
<P>
   That strong hiring has helped drop unemployment among minorities
to historic lows nationally: 7.8 percent for blacks and 6.6 percent
for Hispanics in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, one in five people with a high school diploma or
less is not actively engaged in the job market, but this group is
the largest untapped source of labor in the country,'' said
economist Paul Harrington, associate director of the Center for
Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. ``So, when we say
some employers are starting to tap this group, we are talking about
a pretty big labor pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and supermarkets were among the first to turn to
previously shunned candidates. Now the trend is showing up among
high-tech companies and financial services firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the first private partnership of its kind, nine financial
institutions in Boston have pledged a total of $1 million over
three years to send underemployed and jobless candidates from four
inner-city training programs to an academy created by the New
England College of Finance. Their goal: to fill thousands of future
jobs with trained recruits from urban areas who will earn $18,000
to $25,000 per year, plus benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In Watertown, NewRiver Investor Communications Inc. hired 10
staffers from Boston neighborhoods to fill $10-to-$15-an-hour basic
programming jobs, and it is looking for more. The company, which
sends financial information over the Internet for such companies as
Prudential Insurance, Loomis Sayles, and Salomon Smith Barney, has
53 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Said Karl Johnson, managing director of production: ``When you
have low unemployment it is very difficult to recruit people
because some may be over qualified and they are not looking to stay
and grow with the firm . . . We are looking for people who want to
stay and are willing to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar local efforts are tapping people like Ali Fernandes, who
three years ago was a high-school dropout with dim job prospects.
But after a stint with City Year, a volunteer civic organization,
the 21-year-old from Dorchester earned his high school equivalency
diploma and landed a job at Cambridge-based CitySoft Inc., an
Internet software firm that hires inner-city workers to develop Web
sites at $10 to $15 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I did not know what I wanted to do,'' he said. ``Now,
I know I want to go to school for computer science and business.
I've grown in my interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more marketable than I was before,'' said Fernandes,
whose goal of some day owning a high-tech marketing company no
longer seems out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference between such programs and many previous ones:
Employers are motivated overwhelmingly by bottom-line
self-interest, not the societal greater good. ``This isn't
philanthropy,'' said CitySoft cofounder Nick Gleason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an enlightened self-interest,'' acknowledged George
Russell, senior vice president and director of community affairs at
State Street Corp. ``We need workers, and we need them in an
economy with a very low unemployment rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some question whether companies are simply looking
to reap gains by hiring easily exploited workers and paying them
low wages to do entry-level, dead-end jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is better than no job, and better than working
at McDonald's,'' said Brandeis University labor historian
Jacqueline Jones, author of ``American Work: Four Centuries of
Black and White Labor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we are talking about the big picture and the long run,
then the jobs must lead to skill acquisition, to higher annual
salaries, and to an incentive to get more education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, what we are really seeing is the 20th century
equivalent of dead-end factory jobs in industries that already rely
on a vast army of telemarketers, keypunch operators, and low-level
data programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Regan, president of the New England College of Finance,
maintains the partnership between the Boston area financial
institutions, the college, and several community organizations is a
``win-win'' situation for all. ``These are real career ladder
jobs,'' Regan said. ``These are not maintenance jobs. . . These are
career-track jobs, with benefits and a fully paid education at the
college. The emphasis is on long-term retention, not hiring people
and then wishing them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Months before the pledge was announced last month, Regan and
State Street's Russell began discussing the idea of bringing
employment to inner-city workers while focusing on intense
training, job placement, and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to focus our energies on putting people to work,
particularly African-Americans and minorities who have been left
out, are unemployed, or underemployed,'' said Russell. ``We aren't
looking for college graduates. We need people who are articulate,
with good work habits and a good work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes at a critical time for Boston's financial
services industry. Twenty-five percent of the mutual fund
industry's assets are housed in Boston, making it a vital center
for an industry whose growth is expected to lead to hundreds of job
openings in Boston this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts is expected to refer
90 people to the New England College of Finance's new training
academy this year. Action for Boston Community Development, a
nonprofit community organization, will send 100 recruits who have
completed basic skills training and meet partnership
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can pilot a successful year and demonstrate what can be
done, the jobs are out there and they are in the thousands, not
just the hundreds,'' said Joan Wallace Benjamin, president of the
Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts. ``This will definitely have
an impact on the community. People will be able to be more active
consumers in this economy. These companies have been around for a
long time, which means an opportunity for long-term work and career
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment of the nation's poor is hardly limited to the
financial services industry. Two years ago, Gleason, 31, then a
newly minted Harvard MBA, and James Picariello, a 27-year-old
computer whiz, launched the Web development firm CitySoft from
their living rooms with the aim of recruiting directly from
Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan.
</P>
<P>
   Their motivation was two-fold: to inexpensively tap the Internet
market by training their own people rather than hiring recruits
directly from college, and to spur hiring in long forgotten
inner-city areas. Gleason, a former community activist turned
entrepreneur, hopes other firms will follow their lead.
</P>
<P>
   CitySoft now has four consultants and six employees from
Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan who create Web pages for the
firm's 30 clients, including ITT Sheraton, Allaire Corp., and
BankBoston. The company founders say earnings should reach a modest
$1 million by year's end. It also plans to extend recruitment
efforts to include a major community development corporation in the
South Bronx. CitySoft lends its consultants and some of its
employees out to clients in need of Web site development. Other
employees work out of CitySoft's Cambridge office.
</P>
<P>
   Among its employees: 23-year-old Kelby Mendes. He was making $7
an hour and struggling to pay for classes at Roxbury Community
College when he heard that a South End training center run by
activist Mel King had a direct link to jobs at CitySoft. Last year,
Mendes enrolled. Today, the Roxbury resident earns $11 per hour
developing Web pages. ``I see myself always taking programming
classes on and off just to stay up to speed,'' he said. ``That's
the only way to solidify my progress in this field.''
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts in the Boston area are mirrored by efforts in other
regions of the nation. When Beverly Lucas and partner Jerry Hill,
owners of The Software Factory, moved from the Washington, D.C.,
area to South Boston, Va., two years ago, unemployment in that town
of about 9,000 farmers and textile workers was hovering between 11
and 13 percent. Since then, they have been training jobless and
underemployed workers to do basic computer programming. Lucas and
Hill say their start-up will hit $4 million in sales this year _
more than double earlier projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here because there was a pool of people available, and
a need for tech jobs,'' said Lucas, 48, whose company employs 25.
``The upshot is we're benefiting and people in the town are too.''
</P>
<P>
   For high-tech companies that venture into poor areas in search
of workers, however, the road can be rocky. CitySoft cofounder
Picariello said he has gone to Massachusetts training centers to
recruit, but limited funding has made it difficult for them to
fully satisfy the company's needs. Plus, he said, ``There is a real
disconnect between what people are being trained to do and what we
really need.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bolling, director of a technical training program at the
Mandela housing development and at Castle Square Apartments in
Roxbury, trains 20 people in day classes at each location per year.
Of those, 88 percent land jobs. The retention rate? Eighty-five to
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bolling said, more needs to be done _ and his hands are
tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't produce what (software companies) need overnight,''
said Bolling. ``We take people with zero skills to the point where
they can do, for example, Microsoft Word for Windows. When they
leave, they have the foundation for further training. To prepare
people for the employment the software companies have, the industry
would have to get involved.''

TWO GOLDEN WORDS: INTERNET RELATED

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The I's had it _ Internet-related companies, that is _ as
venture fund managers poured $561.2 million into New England
start-ups during the final three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This rush of investment pushed total funding to promising
entrepreneurs in the region to over $2 billion for the year, spread
among 407 companies in all six states. Total New England investment
for 1997 was $1.36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both the quarterly figure and annual total were records for the
Boston Globe/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC survey of venture capital
funding, which began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The number of New England companies getting financing from
venture funds during the final quarter _ 99 _ was down from the 114
counted during the fall. But the average deal, $5.7 million, was up
19 percent, as these funds had little trouble raising new money
from their investors, which include pension funds, college
endowments, insurance portfolios, and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patrick M. Gray of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
bigger deals are the result of huge profits made during the past
three years by these money sources. A separate survey by Venture
Economics of Newark found 364 venture funds nationally raised $88.4
billion last year to be put into these high-risk but highly
enticing enterprises. That was 25 percent more than in 1997, and
more than double the amount raised in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Venture investment also continued to set records nationally,
with $3.7 billion pumped into 713 companies from coast to coast
during the quarter, and $14.3 billion shared by 2,856 companies for
the year. That year-end figure was up $2.8 billion from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Software and information systems and communications companies
again led the pack, receiving about half of all investment for both
the quarter and the year, both regionally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, lines between traditional industry sectors
blurred, as consumer-oriented communications companies claimed
space in the Internet realm, and enterprises engaged in
business-to-business commerce over the Internet categorized
themselves as either communications or software firms.
</P>
<P>
   One Boston company, Virtual Ink Inc., which has developed an
electronic device that uses the Internet to transmit images from
office or school ``white boards'' to distant points as they are
being drawn, said it had trouble convincing potential investors why
it wanted to be seen as an Internet-related company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some saw this as just a computer hardware peripheral, which it
is not,'' Greg McHale, the company's chief executive, said. In the
end, Virtual Ink got the $5 million it wanted to launch a national
marketing campaign from CMG AtVentures Fund, an affiliate of CMGI
Inc., the founding investor in Lycos Inc. and other Internet
start-ups that became Wall Street superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 99 New England companies receiving venture financing
during the last quarter, at least 41 were Internet related,
according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers/Boston Globe survey, also
known as the Money Tree Survey.
</P>
<P>
   This first attempt to make such a distinction relied on the
companies themselves for information, and venture fund managers
said many candidates probably were overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the Internet is like electrification _ it drives all
business today,'' said Stephen J. Ricci, a partner at OneLiberty
Ventures in Boston. Michael Frank, a partner at Advanced Technology
Ventures in Waltham, added: ``Almost 100 percent of what we do is
somehow related to, or touches, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that fell into the Internet category in the survey
ranged from on-line retailers _ such as Furniture.com Inc. of
Worcester, toysmart.com of Waltham, MASS., and MotherNature.com
Inc. of Acton, Mass. _ to firms that make switches and software
that allow data to move faster, with telecommunications carriers as
their prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   But they also included marketing, publishing, health care, and a
variety of service companies _ sectors that also are trying to
realign themselves to do business in an on-line age.
</P>
<P>
   Some venture fund managers see this second group as perhaps more
promising than those focused on on-line commerce, which in spite of
high interest on Wall Street has yet to prove itself able to
deliver profits based on sales of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can, you want to build a company that has real revenues
and real profits,'' said Robert Fleming, a partner at Prism Venture
Partners in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet was perhaps the strongest force in venture
funding last year, other sectors, including drug development,
medical devices, health care management and services, and
traditional retailing, all continued to attract investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture investment was up almost all across the board,'' said
Gray, a partner in PricewaterhouseCooper's Boston office who
oversees the New England portion of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Nine biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the region
received $87.5 million during the fourth quarter, $10 million more
than the same number of companies in these sectors got during the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The single largest fourth-quarter venture-fund investment in the
region was, in fact, a $31.4 million mezzanine financing to Dyax
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., which has developed a specialized
technology to search molecular databases for proteins that can be
used in drug development.
</P>
<P>
   Dyax planned to go public last year but postponed its initial
stock offering as market conditions wavered.
</P>
<P>
   As a percentage of all investment in New England, however, these
sectors remained flat compared with earlier years, when they
sometimes captured up to 40 percent of all financing during a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist away from electronics, two insurance companies
setting up shop in Connecticut _ Connecticut Reinssurance Corp. and
Target Capital Partners Inc. _ ranked second and fourth in dollars
received in the region during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Reinsurance received $30 million and Target $25
million. Both said they plan to take advantage of big tax breaks
Connecticut is offering to try to revive its insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to another biotech company, Ontogeny Inc. of
Cambridge, which received $28 million in late-stage funding that
could precede an initial public offering. The company has developed
protein compounds that have promise for treating bone fractures and
cartilage and skeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   By region, California's Silicon Valley region continued to lead
the nation for 1998 in both number of investment deals, 787, and
dollars invested, $4.55 billion. That amount was about 31.9 percent
of all venture money invested nationally.
</P>
<P>
   New England's investment dollar share for the year was 14.2
percent, up from 11.8 percent in 1997. The Southeast, with $1.12
billion invested during the year, held its third-place position in
the Money Tree Survey, but the region's share of the national total
slipped to 7.9 percent from 9.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gray sees a continued high level of investment across the nation
as venture fund managers, under some pressure to put the growing
amounts of investor money they are raising to work as soon as
possible, increase the amounts they pledge in each funding round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund managers are raising $100 million and more for their
investment funds regularly now,'' he said. ``Ten years ago they
were raising $30 million to $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture fund companies say they have no trouble raising these
amounts, either, citing other surveys that document high returns in
recent years. Several said their institutional investors have
raised the ratio of funds going into these higher-risk accounts, to
7.5 percent and sometimes 10 percent, from a traditional level of 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Economics reported last month the average US venture
fund delivered an annualized return of 32.2 percent over the
three-year period ended Sept. 30. However, last summer's market
slump resulted in an average loss of 3.6 percent in venture funds,
the first quarterly loss since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest obstacle facing start-ups now, fund managers
said, is a shortage of personnel that now reaches beyond technical
skills and into managerial fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge dearth of such talent,'' said Frank, of
Advanced Technology Ventures, leading to the risk that chief
executives who are hired to run start-ups will have too little
experience, and the people they hire will also be less qualified.

TWO TOP WRITERS PRODUCE MASTERFUL HISTORICAL THRILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the best writers of the historical thriller genre are
Robert Harris and Joseph Kanon. And each has a new book out.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' latest, ``Archangel'' (Random House, $24.95, 373 pages),
tells of four days in the life of Fluke Kelso, a former Oxford
historian who travels to Moscow to attend a conference on the
recently opened Soviet archives.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso gets a visit one night from Papu Rapava, who says he was
on the security detail of Secret Police Chief Lavenry Beria. He
claims he was with Beria on the night Stalin suffered his fateful
stroke and he helped Beria steal Stalin's papers and a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   After Beria's death, Rapava was sentenced to the Gulag for 15
years. Now he says he knows where the notebook is hidden and wants
Kelso to help him get money for it. Unexpectedly, Rapava takes off
without leaving an address or a phone number. The only thing he
leaves behind is a book of matches from a Moscow bar.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Kelso skips out of the conference and goes to
the Lenin Library to see if any of Rapava's story checks out. He
finds a book by a Red Army general that states that Stalin kept a
``black oilskin exercise book in which he would make occasional
notes and that for some time he kept letters. .. All efforts to
discover either the notebook or these letters have failed. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Next Kelso goes to the bar named on the book of matches and
meets a television reporter named O'Brian and Rapava's estranged
daughter, Zinaida. For $300, she agrees to drive Kelso to her
father's apartment. When they get there, Zinaida flees and he finds
the old man murdered. Kelso is questioned, released and told not to
miss his flight the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   But he spots Zinaida at the airport and takes off with her when
she tells him that her father left her something in a toolbox. She
drives to an old shed, and they find the toolbox just as O'Brian
shows up with a camera. Inside the toolbox is a black oilskin
notebook that turns out not to be Stalin's but that of Anna
Safanova, a young comrade from Archangel who worked at Stalin's
dacha outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to try to find out what happened to Anna, O'Brian and
Kelso drive to Archangel and interview her aged mother. What they
discover in a forest outside the city could rewrite history and
change the world forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archangel'' is creative and filled with enough plot spins to
keep you reeling.

</P>
<P>
   In ``The Prodigal Spy'' (Broadway Books. $25. 409 pages), Kanon
pegs his second historical thriller to the witch hunts of the House
Un-American Activities Committee of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you are 10-year-old Nick Kotlar and your world is
perfect. Your father is Walter Kotlar, an undersecretary of State,
your parents are in love and they treat you wonderfully. Then
suddenly, your father stops going to work and heads for Capitol
Hill to testify before the committee because a young department
store clerk has accused him of treason.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters wait outside your house every morning and walk
your father to the hearings. They leave you alone, but when
classmates start making snide comments, your parents take you out
of school.
</P>
<P>
   One night Walter Kotlar vanishes and his accuser plunges from a
hotel window. Just imagine young Nick's anguish when he has to
admit that his father is a traitor and willing to give up his
family for his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's mother moves them to New York and marries Walter's best
friend, Larry Warren, a career diplomat. Adopted by Larry, Nick
changes his last name and life goes on. Having served in Vietnam,
Nick is now in London as a graduate student. During an anti-war
rally outside the U.S. Embassy, he meets a beautiful blonde
freelance journalist named Molly, who tells him Walter Kotlar is
living in Prague and wants to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Using Molly as his cover, Nick heads for Prague and the
long-overdue meeting with his father. Walter Kotlar wants to get to
know his son, but he also wants Nick to help him to go home; he
says he's willing to unmask a long-time mole still in Washington.
But Walter is murdered before he can give any details of the spy
code-named Silver.
</P>
<P>
   It's left to Nick to uncover years and years of deceit and to
learn the hard way that almost everyone has something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``The Prodigal Spy'' is its point of view: The
entire story is told through Nick's eyes, first as that scared
young boy and then as an adult trying to make sense of a
clandestine world he doesn't understand. Kanon lets the action
progress at a natural speed, building his characters bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   Kanon has set out to show how the crimes of the father can
affect the child _ a task he masterfully pulls off.

MUTUAL FUND INVESTS IN COMPANIES THAT SUPPORT WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not long ago, Wall Street mocked socially
responsible funds. No more.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, baby boomers have started pouring more money
into the nation's 144 socially responsible mutual funds, with
assets hitting a record $529 billion last year, according to the
Social Investment Forum, a nonprofit organization in Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the performance arena, these stock funds gained 18.5 percent
in 1998, compared to 14.3 percent for the average domestic stock
fund, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sign of success: about 40 percent of socially
responsible funds have earned top 5-star and 4-star ratings from
Morningstar Inc., compared to 30 percent of funds in other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a very good showing overall,'' said Jon Hale, a
Morningstar analyst who follows socially responsible funds.
``People were skeptical of them as investment vehicles, but now
there's a growing respect and recognition. As an investment
approach, it's here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   These funds often specialize, carefully sorting out companies
that have exceptional environmental and human rights records or, in
the case of one fund, invest in companies that are deemed good for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pei, a San Francisco banker, and a former co-worker pooled
$50,000 from friends in 1993 to start the Pro-Conscience Women's
Equity Mutual Fund, which invests in companies that the fund
managers believe have pro-women policies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fund manages $8.7 million in assets and holds stock
in 50 large-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   Run by portfolio managers Heidi Soumerai and Bill Apfel at U.S.
Trust Company Boston, the fund enjoyed a 28.76 percent gain last
year, edging the Standard &AMP; Poor 500's 28.72 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, we were told the social criteria for our
investments would limit us, and we couldn't possibly outperform
other funds,'' said Pei, 54, the president of the fund. ``Now, so
many socially responsible funds are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pei is betting that clients will continue to invest with their
financial minds, and their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make money while following your heart, why not?''
Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   Pei and Leslie Christian, a former Salomon Brothers executive
who is now managing director at Progressive Securities in Portland,
Ore., began the fund in part because they believed that
businesswomen had made little progress in breaking the glass
ceiling in corporate boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and said, `What happened?' In the '70s
and '80s, we thought we'd be at the forefront, a new vanguard of
businesswomen,'' Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to start a mutual fund, using money as a voice
for women. Pei registered the fund with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They hosted a wine-and-cheese party for 100 friends,
who pitched in $50,000 to start the fund.
</P>
<P>
   They also started hunting for good stocks, large-cap companies
that treat women well in the workplace. Among their criteria: Women
in executive ranks; equal pay for women; career development
programs; pro-family benefits, including child care and maternity
leave; contracts with women-owned companies; and positive images of
women in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the companies must be top performers in their
industries, with well-run management, strong market share and high
earnings potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the fund's holdings are in technology (19
percent), health care (17 percent) and financial services (15
percent). Top holdings include Lucent Technologies, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, Sanmina and Cisco Systems.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One tough decision Pei and her fund managers must make soon:
whether to hold or dump 180,000 shares of BankAmerica, the San
Francisco corporate institution taken over last year by NationsBank
of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some departing BankAmerica women executives have accused the
NationsBank management of discrimination, charges denied by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in touch with bank executives to find out what's going
on there,'' Pei said. ``Were these disputes involving employees, or
part of corporatewide practices?''
</P>
<P>
   While lacking the raw clout of giant mutual funds and pension
plans, Pei hopes her fund will show that women are a force in
finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, we have a lot of power,'' Pei said. ``That's an
important message to get out.''

academics to write their wartime histories or scour ancient file
rooms worldwide for damaging or exculpatory information. At stake
are hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements, potential
public embarrassment, and even business complications. And often
the race is simply for companies to find disquieting information

 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)  
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Long before the Y2K computer glitch, 1999 filled me with fear.
On New Year's 1969, my mother commented, ``Imagine that: thirty
years from now you'll celebrate a new millennium and your fortieth
birthday.''
 &HT;    At ten years old, both sounded apocalyptic. I convinced myself
neither would ever arrive.
 &HT;    The long-dreaded day has come. This month, I turn forty.
 &HT;    Forty? The ``old age of youth and the youth of old age'' is upon
me. Friends who have already passed the mid-life milestone grin
knowingly, ``It's tough. You'll see.''
 &HT;    They are right. Over the last months, a gnawing sense of
mortality keeps me awake nights. My career dissatisfies me. I am
trying to eat better and work out. I even want to buy a
convertible.
 &HT;    A by-the-numbers mid-life crisis.
 &HT;    Recently, I saw a book about spirituality for life's ``second
half.'' Thumbing through the pages, the prospect of the ``second
half'' irritated. Not for me, I mused. I am still young. After all,
I just had a baby.
 &HT;    In many ways, forty is young -- especially now as people live
longer. However, as the distance between my students and me
increases, I know that forty is not youthful. That twenty-year gap
constantly reminds me that I'm not of their generation. They are
growing up; I already have.
 &HT;    The spirituality of growing up and being grown-up is not the
same. Youthful spirituality seeks answers for big questions: Who is
God? Who am I? Who will be my life partner? What am I to do in the
world?
 &HT;    A quest for order engulfs the young as they become independent
persons. As a result, religions with strict moral boundaries and
clear-cut beliefs appeal to teen-agers and young adults, providing
direction to those otherwise adrift.
 &HT;    By forty, spirituality is no longer about order. Rather, it is
about meaning. For most of us, those ``big questions'' have been
resolved. There may or may not be a God. I may or may not ever
figure out who I am. Partners may or may not be for life. My career
may or may not provide meaning or fulfillment. The twenty years
between college and mid-life reveal the messiness of life -- very
little is as we expected it to be. Is there any meaning in the
mess?
 &HT;    Mid-life spirituality seeks to make sense of messiness. There
will always questions. Instead of answers, faith turns to finding
meaning through telling stories. Through story, patterns emerge
that give form to the chaos of adulthood.
 &HT;    Story-telling is an ancient -- and profoundly human -- way of
expressing faith. Every culture told stories of creation,
recreation, and death. A tribe's self-understanding and explanation
of God came from campfire tales -- and were eventually gathered
into sacred books and systematic theologies.
 &HT;    Sadly, in America, we treat the dominant religious book -- the
Bible -- as an answer book. This is an adolescent approach to the
text. The Bible is primarily a storybook -- tales whose collective
narrative shapes us spiritually. Its main story-line is that of a
God who creates and loves a people who, in turn, love God and serve
the world.
 &HT;    This story provides meaning for generations of Jews, Christians
and Muslims. Anyone who has spent time in its pages knows the Book
is riddled with ambiguity and paradox. Even it provides no
clear-cut answers. If so, how could there be so many conflicting
interpretations of its message? The Bible is, after all, a
collection of stories. And story must be experienced as living text
-- not simply memorized as a cheat sheet for God's final exam.
 &HT;    At forty, I find myself living in multiple stories: my own
story, my family's story, my church's story, history's story, and
biblical story. Meaning is multi-layered; truth is textured. Life
experience enriches each interpretation as stories are told and
retold. In the process, both humanity and divinity speak.
 &HT;    Perhaps story-telling as adult spirituality accounts for the
current popularity of spiritual autobiographies. As the last
baby-boomers turn forty, an entire generation is moving away from
question-and-answer religion to narrative faith -- a shift likely
to produce profound consequences for America's religious
institutions and political landscape. We should expect a higher
degree of religious and moral flexibility with an aging population
-- as already evinced by the Clinton scandal.
 &HT;    Life is messy and that's okay. Our stories tell us so.
 &HT;    Contemplating the years ahead, I may never be rich enough to buy
that red Mercedes convertible. But I trust the story will become
richer. Looking back on life's narrative seems fundamentally more
satisfying than finding the answers -- and even makes the prospect
of 2029 interesting rather than fearful.
 &HT;    Imagine that: my daughter will be thirty!

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Long before the Y2K computer glitch, 1999 filled me with fear.
On New Year's 1969, my mother commented, ``Imagine that: thirty
years from now you'll celebrate a new millennium and your fortieth
birthday.''
 &HT;    At ten years old, both sounded apocalyptic. I convinced myself
neither would ever arrive.
 &HT;    The long-dreaded day has come. This month, I turn forty.
 &HT;    Forty? The ``old age of youth and the youth of old age'' is upon
me. Friends who have already passed the mid-life milestone grin
knowingly, ``It's tough. You'll see.''
 &HT;    They are right. Over the last months, a gnawing sense of
mortality keeps me awake nights. My career dissatisfies me. I am
trying to eat better and work out. I even want to buy a
convertible.
 &HT;    A by-the-numbers mid-life crisis.
 &HT;    Recently, I saw a book about spirituality for life's ``second
half.'' Thumbing through the pages, the prospect of the ``second
half'' irritated. Not for me, I mused. I am still young. After all,
I just had a baby.
 &HT;    In many ways, forty is young -- especially now as people live
longer. However, as the distance between my students and me
increases, I know that forty is not youthful. That twenty-year gap
constantly reminds me that I'm not of their generation. They are
growing up; I already have.
 &HT;    The spirituality of growing up and being grown-up is not the
same. Youthful spirituality seeks answers for big questions: Who is
God? Who am I? Who will be my life partner? What am I to do in the
world?
 &HT;    A quest for order engulfs the young as they become independent
persons. As a result, religions with strict moral boundaries and
clear-cut beliefs appeal to teen-agers and young adults, providing
direction to those otherwise adrift.
 &HT;    By forty, spirituality is no longer about order. Rather, it is
about meaning. For most of us, those ``big questions'' have been
resolved. There may or may not be a God. I may or may not ever
figure out who I am. Partners may or may not be for life. My career
may or may not provide meaning or fulfillment. The twenty years
between college and mid-life reveal the messiness of life -- very
little is as we expected it to be. Is there any meaning in the
mess?
 &HT;    Mid-life spirituality seeks to make sense of messiness. There
will always questions. Instead of answers, faith turns to finding
meaning through telling stories. Through story, patterns emerge
that give form to the chaos of adulthood.
 &HT;    Story-telling is an ancient -- and profoundly human -- way of
expressing faith. Every culture told stories of creation,
recreation, and death. A tribe's self-understanding and explanation
of God came from campfire tales -- and were eventually gathered
into sacred books and systematic theologies.
 &HT;    Sadly, in America, we treat the dominant religious book -- the
Bible -- as an answer book. This is an adolescent approach to the
text. The Bible is primarily a storybook -- tales whose collective
narrative shapes us spiritually. Its main story-line is that of a
God who creates and loves a people who, in turn, love God and serve
the world.
 &HT;    This story provides meaning for generations of Jews, Christians
and Muslims. Anyone who has spent time in its pages knows the Book
is riddled with ambiguity and paradox. Even it provides no
clear-cut answers. If so, how could there be so many conflicting
interpretations of its message? The Bible is, after all, a
collection of stories. And story must be experienced as living text
-- not simply memorized as a cheat sheet for God's final exam.
 &HT;    At forty, I find myself living in multiple stories: my own
story, my family's story, my church's story, history's story, and
biblical story. Meaning is multi-layered; truth is textured. Life
experience enriches each interpretation as stories are told and
retold. In the process, both humanity and divinity speak.
 &HT;    Perhaps story-telling as adult spirituality accounts for the
current popularity of spiritual autobiographies. As the last
baby-boomers turn forty, an entire generation is moving away from
question-and-answer religion to narrative faith -- a shift likely
to produce profound consequences for America's religious
institutions and political landscape. We should expect a higher
degree of religious and moral flexibility with an aging population
-- as already evinced by the Clinton scandal.
 &HT;    Life is messy and that's okay. Our stories tell us so.
 &HT;    Contemplating the years ahead, I may never be rich enough to buy
that red Mercedes convertible. But I trust the story will become
richer. Looking back on life's narrative seems fundamentally more
satisfying than finding the answers -- and even makes the prospect
of 2029 interesting rather than fearful.
 &HT;    Imagine that: my daughter will be thirty!

Y2K PROBLEM HITS CREDIT CARDS EARLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You browse through a small shop on the island of Gibraltar,
select a souvenir and hand your credit card to the cashier.
</P>
<P>
   He utters a thank-you, places the card through a swipe machine
for verification, then frowns and gives the card back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, your card is expired,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was just renewed through 2001,'' you explain.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs. And politely asks you to pay cash or return your
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers to foreign countries have experienced such an
uncomfortable situation over the past few weeks. Primarily in small
establishments off the beaten path. And especially when a credit
card _ or ATM card _ carries an expiration date beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And we thought all that Y2K talk was baloney.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIGIT DILEMMA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is this:
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmers have commonly used the last two digits,
rather than all four, to represent the year. With these programs,
the first two digits are presumed to be 19. Thus, 99 is programmed
as 1999. But 00 is programmed as 1900, not 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While most businesses in the United States already have
addressed changes required to advance computer systems into the
next millennium, a small minority of merchants in other countries
has been slow to respond. Not every card-swipe machine is outfitted
with new software. And if the machine reads the expiration date as
being in 1900, not 2000 ... you guessed it: Your card has been
invalid for 99 years. Or so the merchant is led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is concerned enough to issue an
announcement two weeks ago that reads in part, ``U.S. citizens
abroad should not assume that credit cards, ATM machines,
international banking transactions, etc., will operate normally in
all locations throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But a cooperative effort by major credit card companies is
dedicated to limiting international traveler inconveniences. And,
says John McCarthy, vice president of Visa International's 2000
Project, ``Our data shows that more than 99.4 percent of merchants
worldwide have accepted 2000-expiration cards without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are monitoring this situation closely. We want cardholders
to feel confident in using their cards. Visa, American Express,
MasterCard and other companies recognized some time ago that this
was a potential problem. We established a Payment Card Council and
got together and discussed the issue. We've traveled all over the
world since 1996 working with merchants (on the necessary
changes).''
</P>
<P>
   It's a massive undertaking. ``We've got 15 million locations
worldwide directly connected to Visa,'' says McCarthy. ``We've been
in contact with each of them. We created 300,000 test cards with
expiration dates in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEALING WITH REJECTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that the vast majority of businesses overseas _ and
certainly all major airlines, hotels and other leading
travel-service providers _ will gladly accept our credit cards.
You'll likely encounter few if any problems at the most popular
destinations. And card companies will continue to address any
trouble spots; they certainly don't want us resorting to cash
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we do if a merchant rejects a credit card that we
know is valid? McCarthy urges travelers to ask for a voice
authorization. ``All merchants have telephone numbers they can call
to check expiration dates,'' he says. ``Then the transaction can be
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming the cardholder and merchant can overcome any
language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend that any international traveler also formulate a
backup plan for spending and exchanging money, especially when
venturing beyond large cities, resort areas and other regions
accustomed to dealing with tourists. Take a few travelers checks
(though I experienced occasional difficulty cashing these last year
in small European towns except at banks). And carry enough cash
(securely) in case you get in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   If you do encounter a problem, inform the card-issuer when you
return home so that it can take steps to protect subsequent
travelers.
</P>
<P>

Internet at travel.state.gov.

CACTUS FLOWERS BEST WHEN POT-BOUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Last spring my husband gave me a beautiful flowering cactus.
The flowers were almost iridescent. I believe the name was star
cactus. It is still alive and doing well. What do I need to get it
to bloom again? Is it similar to the Christmas cactus?
</P>
<P>
   A: One plant commonly called star cactus is ``Astrophytum
ornatum'' and is native to Mexico. It is shaped like a stocky,
deeply ribbed ball and slowly becomes more cylindrical or columnar
with age. This cactus bears long spines and large, bright yellow
flowers at the plant crown on older plants in spring and summer. It
is a relative of the spineless cactus known as bishop's cap. Does
this sound like your cactus?
</P>
<P>
   Most cactuses flower on new growth. Give the plant care during
the warm season, but don't be too fussy with it in winter. It may
flower best when slightly pot-bound. The plants generally are
slow-growing, so frequent transplanting is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Star cactus likes sun, but be careful of exposure to a full day
of unrelenting full hot sun. Some filtration is best. A daily dose
of some sun or an abundance of bright light will encourage blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Give the plant fresh air. Increase watering in spring and
summer. Water well, and allow the water to drain. If draining into
a saucer, empty it. Let the plant go dry between waterings, and
water infrequently during winter. Don't allow the soil to remain
dry so long that the plant shrivels.
</P>
<P>
   The planting mix should provide rapid drainage. A commercial
cactus mix should be fine. Some advocate adding ground limestone to
the mix to boost root development and plant vigor.
</P>
<P>
   You can apply a diluted fertilizer every second or third time
you water during the growing season. A 20-20-20 houseplant
fertilizer will do. Some boost bloom with a diluted African violet
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas cactus, ``Schlumbergera bridgesii,'' needs short
days and cooler temperatures to produce midwinter 3-inch tubular
blooms in bright pink, red, fuchsia or white. This cactus is a
sprawling, jointed, spineless plant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About 23 years ago we planted a boxwood hedge along the front
of our house. This area did not receive much sun, but the hedge
grew thick and healthy. Once in a while we would notice a few brown
leaves, but the bushes continued to grow. Recently we have noticed
two bushes next to each other have turned brown and died. We would
like to replace these but feel we should first find out the
possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   A: When a boxwood dies and then one next to it does, too, it is
possible that root knot nematodes are at work. These are
microscopic worms in the soil. The plant may wilt during the day
and recover at night. It will gradually decline, and branches or
the entire plant may die. Remove the dead plants and examine the
roots for galls or swellings. The roots may look gnarled.
Sometimes, too, disease organisms, such as root rot, attack
infected roots.
</P>
<P>
   Have your county extension service help you with a diagnosis if
you're not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Boost the organic matter in the soil to introduce beneficial
soil microorganisms and encourage those already present. Keep the
area clean. Remove any weeds, which can be hosts to the pests.
Water remaining boxwood as needed to avoid drought stress and
reduce root knot damage. This will not decrease the pest
population, however. Don't let runoff from suspected infected areas
spill into other garden areas. And don't transfer any soil from a
suspected area elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Soil solarization using a clear (not black) plastic spread over
bare soil for several weeks during hot weather can reduce nematode
populations, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   There are nematicides that sometimes can be applied around
established plants. Contact your extension service for information.
</P>
<P>
   Dwarf yaupon, an evergreen often used as a foundation plant,
would be a good substitute if it becomes necessary to replace your
boxwood. Apparently it is resistant to root knot nematodes and is
shade-tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities: Fungal problems can occur when drainage is
less than ideal. Portions of plants may die, but it is possible an
entire shrub will die. When portions of a boxwood turn yellow or
brown, and there is a brownish discoloration in the wood at the
base of the trunk (you'll need to cut the wood to check), cotton
root rot could be the problem. If the entire plant is not dead,
prune affected branches, improve the drainage in the bed or replant
the boxwood in another area. You may want to lift the plants, work
some sand into the soil to improve drainage, then replant.
</P>
<P>
   If a shrub turns yellow or brown and some leaves brown only on
the leaf margins, it could be drought or winter injury. But other
fungal diseases can result in these symptoms, so diagnosis can be
tricky. Prune affected branches and improve drainage to see if
plant health improves.
</P>

Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston 77210. The bulk of mail prevents

SUSPECT'S WRITINGS POINT TO ROLE IN LEADERSHIP OF `AYRIAN' GROUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Note: ``Mein Kampf'' is Hitler's political manifesto) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Call it the scout manual from hell _ or maybe
``Mein Kampf'' _ East Texas Style.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmen investigating the brutal dragging death of James
Byrd Jr. searched the apartment of capital murder defendant John
William ``Bill'' King, they found handwritten outlines, bylaws and
recruiting letters for what he called the Confederate Knights of
America's Texas Rebel Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes calling himself the president of the organization,
sometimes a captain, he called himself and his followers ``a
relative handful of Aryans dedicated to fighting on the behalf of a
world that often fears and hates us.''
</P>
<P>
   King clearly considered his ``Aryan'' heritage far superior to
other races _ ``a race of individuals who have found themselves
existing on humanity's evolutionary plateau. Born with the genetic
capacity for great power, leadership and knowledge; we have chosen
the added burden of responsibility, to defend those who have not
the power nor resources to protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While that might sound like the Rebel Soldiers would protect
other races, theirs was clearly the only race they felt needed
protecting. ``At times this will mean coming to the aid of our
fellow kindred _ providing a defense against those races who feel
their powers allow them to dominate others. Just as often, we will
be called on to safeguard our Aryan race against those individuals
and organizations who fear and hate them simply because we are
`different'! All to (sic) often, we will defend Aryans against
their own kind _ as the unfortunate quest for supremacy continues
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the writings found in King's apartment listed rules and
codes his Rebel Soldiers were expected to follow. ``The possession
of any contraband or consumption of any illegal drugs and/or
alcohol at organizational functions is strictly prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said King and his companions spent several hours
drinking beer before they picked up James Byrd Jr. for the last
ride of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act nobly and courageously, always carefully considering the
consequences,'' another list of rules said, ``as the effect of your
deeds live on after you pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rule tells Rebel Soldiers to ``love, protect, reproduce
and advance your folk.'' Almost two months after his arrest on
murder charges, King's girlfriend gave birth to their son.
</P>
<P>
   King was clearly looking toward the future in his writings. In
what he titled ``Introduction to the Texas Rebel Soldiers,'' King
said the organization ``was started on July 4, 1998, in memory of
all Aryan kindred who led a courageous fight throughout the dawn of
time towards the advancement of our beautiful and great race.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was killed early June 7, and King had been in jail for
almost a month by the time Independence Day came that year.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that ``no leader will ever ask you to break any law,''
but in other parts of his writings, he made dire predictions of
racial war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been my fervent wish, long before the formation of the
T.R.S., that hostilities be avoided at all cost, be it race vs.
race or kind vs. kind. In recent years, however, I have become
painfully aware that a war is being waged across the planet earth _
and that we (the Aryan race) are the first, quite possibly the
final, line of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That war, he claimed, called for extreme measures: ``While it
may appear unseemly and disturbing that we are engaged in sometimes
illegal activities, it must be stressed that these activities have
proven vital to our survival on many occasions. We live in
difficult times and moral choices of questionable nature are
unfortunately the result.''
</P>
<P>
   King's writings make it clear that his Texas Rebel Soldiers had
its start while he was previously in prison on a burglary
conviction. Texas prison officials said King and Lawrence Russell
Brewer, also charged in the Byrd slaying, were members of a very
small group, which existed only at the Beto I Unit, called
Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials monitor 11 major racial gangs or groups within
the giant Texas prison system and keep tabs on about 20 other minor
groups that seem to come and go. The Confederate Knights were one
of those minor groups, said Sam Buentello, who keeps tabs on such
prison groups.
</P>
<P>
   Buentello wouldn't talk about King's case because he is due to
be a witness in the capital murder trial, but he said prisoners
often get Klan propaganda and build their own groups around what
they read.
</P>
<P>
   If so, King may have based his Texas Rebel Solders on an older
group that is no longer active.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material found in King's apartment bore the name of
the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Huntersville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   That group was active in the late 1980s but has been inactive
since 1992, said Joseph Roy Sr., director of the Intelligence
Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala. The
center keeps tabs of hate groups throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups are constantly forming and dying, Roy said. Groups
like the Texas Rebel Soldiers are far from rare, he said. There are
more than 5,000 white supremacy groups in the United States, he
said. Only about 500 are active at any one time.

this white bean and palm oil version is the most common. Palm oil
is a wonderfully flavorful red oil that also happens to be high in
saturated fat. It can be found at ethnic grocery stores and
markets. You may choose to fry these fritters in an alternative oil
_ but we're glad we took Harris' recommendation and tried them once
in palm oil for a unique taste.

   SIDE DISH
</P>
<P>
   Bean Fritters (Akara)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 fritters
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30-45 minutes Soaking time: overnight Cooking
time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dried Great Northern beans
</P>
<P>
   Oil for deep frying, preferably red palm oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups cold water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon finely minced habanero chile, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the beans by picking over them to remove any impurities
and broken or bad beans and soak them overnight in water to cover.
The next day, remove the skins from the beans by rubbing them
between your hands. (This can be a time-consuming step, so find a
partner.) Heat the oil for frying to 375 degrees in a heavy Dutch
oven or a deep fryer. Place the prepared beans in a meat grinder or
food processor and pulse until you have a smooth paste. Place the
paste in a large bowl. Beat the bean paste with a wooden spoon to
aerate it, and gradually add the water. Continue to beat while
adding the water. Use only enough water to make a mixture that will
fall easily from the spoon (too soupy and it will break apart in
the oil). Add the chile and onion and season to taste with salt.
Continue to stir so that all ingredients are well-mixed. When
ready, spoon the akara up by the tablespoonful and drop a few at a
time into the hot oil. Fry for 2 minutes on each side, or until
golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper. Serve hot.

   CAMEROON
</P>
<P>
   Like many cuisines, African food evolved as new folks and new
technologies arrived on its shores. But simplicity _ even when
combining local ingredients with more European techniques _ has
endured. Give this elegant mango cream a try. From ``The Africa
Cookbook,'' it's a dreamy end to any exotic meal.

<P>
   Mango Cream
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 1 hour Cooking time:
10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 large mangoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly toasted Coconut Crisps (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh mint, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Peel the mangoes and cut in pieces. Place pieces in a medium
saucepan with water to cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes,
or until very tender. When cooked, put through a food mill until it
is a thick pulp. Place pulp in a small bowl, cover with plastic
wrap and chill for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whip the cream with an electric mixer or wire whisk,
slowly sprinkling in the sugar. When the mango pulp is chilled,
slowly fold in the sweetened cream, stirring only enough to make
sure that the ingredients are well-mixed. Pour the mango cream into
individual sherbet glasses, sprinkle each serving with some of the
toasted coconut, garnish with mint and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To make Coconut Crisps, open a brown coconut by baking it
in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes, then whacking it soundly with
a hammer on its ``fault line.'' Take out the coconut meat,
reserving liquid for other uses. Remove the brown rind from the
meat and pare the coconut into long, thin strips with a potato
peeler or paring knife. Place pieces on a cookie sheet and brown
them under the broiler for about 5 minutes, or until they are
lightly toasted. Watch them carefully, as they go from lightly
toasted to charred black in the blink of an eye. May also serve
warm with drinks.

   MOROCCO
</P>
<P>
   The foods of North Africa are heavily influenced by other
Mediterranean cuisines, so olive oils, couscous and flat breads are
common. Small vegetable salads are very popular, and this one from
``The Africa Cookbook'' shows how the foods of Africa often are
familiar foods with a twist _ such as the pairing of oranges and
radishes. It's a cool, tangy, sweet union. The orange flower water
can be found in many ethnic and gourmet groceries.

 &HT;    Just a few `riffs' of improvisation lets you trace, taste
continent's history with dishes both familiar and exotic
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jessica Harris pops a compact disc into the stereo. To
the sway and beat of African tunes, she tosses a cut-up chicken
with her bare hands in a bath of peanut oil, fresh lemon juice and
translucent-thin onion slices. Then she adds an extra flavor burst
_ a fork-pricked, orange-hot habanero pepper.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the beginning of the Senegalese classic, Chicken
Yassa, and of an afternoon of cooking with the renowned African
food scholar and cookbook author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Chicken Yassa my good luck dish,'' says Harris, who
is touring the country promoting her latest effort, ``The Africa
Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25.) ``It was
my first taste that let me know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, this dish defines African food _ at once
familiar and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   That defining moment came to Harris on her first trip to Africa
in the early '70s. She and her mother ventured off the beaten path
in Dakar, Senegal, and into a small restaurant, where the tables
were set with tie-dyed fabric and lampshades made from woven
baskets. One bite of the Chicken Yassa and, ``it's been love ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decades that have followed, she has traversed the
continent, seeking out exotic spices in the open-air markets of
North Africa, eating blood sausage on a dare in Kenya. Her research
has resulted in a collection of cookbooks on African foods and the
cuisines it has inspired, including Caribbean, Brazilian and
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can trace a whole history in a bean fritter,'' says the
51-year-old Harris, a New York native and English professor at
Queens College. The akara, or white bean fritter, is the definitive
dish of Nigeria, she explains. But that fritter gives way to the
porridge fritter in East Africa, the black-eyed pea fritter in
Brazil, the bean fritters of the Caribbean and the corn fritters of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to ``the matrix'' of so many cuisines was the goal of
``The Africa Cookbook,'' Harris says. From Africa come radishes,
onions, okra, watermelon, black-eyed peas and coffee. And foods
such as tomatoes, potatoes and chiles arrived there from other
continents so long ago _ the early 16th century _ that most
Africans would be hard-pressed to acknowledge they are not
indigenous, Harris explains.
</P>
<P>
   But while those foods, and the stewing, grilling and frying of
them, are so prevalent in other cultures, including ours, African
cuisine remains a mystery to most Americans. Harris says that's
because we tend to ignore Africa _ which is oceans away
geographically and culturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be hard for us to understand Africa since we live in
the country of the TV set, the Big Gulp and the wide highway,''
Harris says. ``One way to learn is through something everyone is
intimately connected with. That's the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in African food has grown steadily since she began her
work years ago, Harris says. Immigration has increased, and so has
cultural and business exchange with the continent.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the growing interest is the slew of cookbooks
released in recent years focusing on African and African-inspired
cuisines, such as ``Soul and Spice: African Cooking in the
Americas'' and ``Mother Africa's Table''.
</P>
<P>
   Growing participation in Kwanzaa, held annually from Dec. 26 to
Jan. 1, also is fueling interest, especially in the
African-American community, she says. Several cookbooks offering
menus based on traditional African and African-American dishes have
been written in the past five years to help guide the estimated 13
million participants in the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says immigration has played a key role. First, because
friendships formed on a personal level open culinary doors.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Eartha Whitfield, mother of Atlanta
Falcons player Bob Whitfield. She learned how to make a dish called
palaver from a recent Ghanian immigrant. It's now a favorite among
some Falcons such as Jamal Anderson and Morten Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   More often, immigrants open restaurants, Harris says, and they
attract not only other immigrants but adventurous eaters as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In D.C., you see a lot of Ethiopian restaurants, in New York
it's Senegalese. It all depends on who migrates into a neighborhood
or a community,'' she says. In Atlanta, at least three new African
restaurants have opened in the past year, joining a handful of
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   At Queen of Sheba, you can scoop up spicy beef tips with the
spongy bread called injera. At the Moroccan-themed Casbah, you can
use your hands to dig into mounds of couscous with grilled lamb or
fish. And at 10 Degrees South, you can sample South African
specialties such as ostrich filets or sosaties _ tangy kebabs
seared on a grill.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity among the restaurants and cuisines illustrates the
wide array of foods from the continent. That also is apparent in
the kitchen with Harris, who can be authoritarian and exact or
loose and relaxed, depending on what the moment _ and the dish _
requires.
</P>
<P>
   Harris demonstrates how to segment oranges with great precision.
Then she mixes the wedges with grated radishes and a splash of
orange flower water. One taste and you greet Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   In more free-form fashion, she blanches tomatoes and okra and
douses them with a little vinaigrette for a simple taste of popular
African staples.
</P>
<P>
   For a dreamy dessert, Harris cooks mango chunks slightly, then
forces them through a strainer. She then folds this mush into
sweetened whipped cream and tops it with toasted coconut _ a dish
from Cameroon that blends European traditions with local
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the yassa. After allowing it to marinate for
several hours, Harris sears the chicken on a hot grill for a few
minutes. Then she dumps it into an iron stewpot with carrots,
pimento-stuffed olives, a touch of Dijon mustard and that sassy
habanero. Sounds simple, but the three stages _ marinating,
grilling and stewing _ give the dish a fabulously complex flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Harris admits that, with the mustard and the olives, it's a
jazzier version than that first taste in Dakar. But variation on a
theme is how African cuisine became so influential _ it can be
adapted to the times, the place, the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We improvise everything we put our hands on,'' Harris says.
``We have riffs in clothes, in music, in writing and in food.''
</P>
<P>

fritters or want to cook more African recipes, this list of

 &HT;    Experience the diverse tastes of a continent
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If we are guided by pervasive images in the media, we
might believe that there is no such thing as African food.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch TV, you see Africans starving to death. We
think they don't eat at all,'' said Eartha Whitfield, mother of
Atlanta Falcons player Bob Whitfield. ``In fact, they eat very
healthy, very delicious food.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield discovered this when she struck up a friendship with
an immigrant from Ghana, who introduced her to palaver, a spicy
mixture of meat and spinach. She's made it for many of the Falcons
and it's become a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The palaver is best when cooked in a cast-iron pot or Dutch
oven, as are many African dishes. Major culinary techniques derive
from the traditional three-rock stove, which is an open fire inside
a border of three large rocks.
</P>
<P>
   With that as the principle source of heat, recipes were
developed around boiling in water, steaming in leaves, frying in
deep oil, grilling beside the fire, roasting in the fire and baking
in the ashes. That's why in traditional African cooking stews are
so popular, baked breads not so.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those traditional techniques cross with modern means and
indigenous foods meet intercontinental influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cuisine is largely Portuguese and Malaysian, with a French
influence,'' said Justin Anthony, owner of 10 Degrees South, a
South African restaurant in Atlanta. ``People in Atlanta have been
surprised to learn that South Africa is such a melting pot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the story across the continent. We offer here a culinary
tour of Africa intended to pique your interest and please the taste
buds.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA AND EAST AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way to eat in Ethiopia is from a large communal
platter lined with injera, a spongy, pancakelike bread. Instead of
utensils, more injera is torn and used to scoop up savory stews and
vegetables. Our recipe is adapted, coming close in texture. Serve
it with a national favorite, Doro We't, a rich, spicy chicken stew
with whole boiled eggs. Another favorite along the eastern coast of
Africa is fish curry. Here we offer a simple version combining
curry, coconut and black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Doro We't
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Marinating time:
30 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken (about 3 pounds), cut in small pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Berbere Paste (recipe below)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   Water as needed
</P>
<P>
   4 hard-cooked eggs, peeled, whole
</P>
<P>
   Remove the skin and score the chicken so the sauce will
penetrate the meat. Rub the chicken with the lemon juice and let it
marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-quart Dutch oven over medium heat, saute the onion and
garlic in the butter until browned. Add the ginger, pepper,
cardamom, nutmeg, Berbere Paste and paprika and cook for 2 to 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chicken to the pan and toss to coat. Stir in enough
water to form a thick sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat,
cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until the meat starts to fall
off the bone. Using a fork, poke holes all over the eggs, then add
them to the stew. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Serve with
injera (recipe at left). _ From ``Flavors of Africa Cookbook''

<P>
   In a hot skillet, toast the cardamom pods, cumin seeds,
peppercorns and fenugreek seeds, shaking constantly for a couple of
minutes until they start to crackle and ``pop.'' In a spice mill,
grind these spices to form a powder.
</P>
<P>
   In a blender container, combine the onion, garlic and 1/2 cup
water and puree until smooth. Add the chiles, cayenne, paprika,
ground toasted spices, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cloves and
continue to blend. Slowly add the remaining water and the oil and
blend until smooth. Remove to a saucepan and simmer the sauce for
15-20 minutes to blend the flavors and thicken. This very spicy
sauce will keep for 2 months in the refrigerator. Serve as a
condiment to grilled meats and poultry or add to soups and stews. _

nonstick skillet over medium heat until a drop of water bounces in
the bottom of the pan. Measure out 1/2 cup of the batter and pour
into pan like a pancake. Allow to cook until small holes appear on
the surface and it is set. Remove from pan. Injera is cooked on one
side only. The bread will appear slightly moist when done. Stack
the bread rounds on top of each other and cover with a light towel
until serving. Tear the bread and use to scoop up tastes. _ From

   A traditional Chicken Yassa combines three steps _ marinating,
broiling/grilling and stewing. Some are as simple as chicken and
onions; others, like this version that is a favorite of Jessica
Harris, has carrots and olives. It is well worth the three-step
process. Also from Senegal, we include peanut butter stew made with
lamb. Peanut (or groundnut) stews are widely popular in Africa,
with many variations. We found this one rich and wonderful _
reminding us of some of our favorite Thai dishes. More proof that
you just can't go wrong with peanut butter. The stew also can be
made with beef or chicken. Both come from Jessica Harris' ``The
Africa Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent.''

   1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   4 large onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon minced fresh habanero chile, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 frying chicken (2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds), cut in serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 habanero chile, pricked with a fork
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pimento-stuffed olives
</P>
<P>
   4 carrots, scraped and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   In a large nonreactive bowl, prepare a marinade by mixing the
lemon juice, onions, salt, pepper, minced chile and 4 tablespoons
of the peanut oil. Place the chicken pieces in the marinade, making
sure they are all well-covered. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
and allow the chicken to marinate for at least 3 hours in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Remove the chicken pieces, reserving the
marinade and onions, and place the chicken in a shallow pan. Broil
the chicken until it is lightly browned on both sides.
(Alternately, you can grill until chicken is seared on each side.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the onions from the marinade. Heat the remaining
tablespoon of oil in a flameproof 5-quart casserole or Dutch oven
and cook the onions slowly until tender and translucent. Add the
reserved marinade. When the liquid is thoroughly heated, add the
chicken pieces, pricked chile, olives, carrots, mustard and water.
When the dish has reached the desired degree of hotness, remove the
chile and reserve (it can be served separately to the
``chileheads''). Stir to mix well, then bring the yassa slowly to a
boil. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, or
until the chicken is cooked through. Serve hot over white rice.

 &HT;    Kitchen counter on cutting edge of curative cuisine
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New technology and cutting-edge nutritional research have led
many medical and scientific experts to conclude what everybody and
their great-grandmother have known forever _ that real and
substantial relief can come from over the counter _ the kitchen
counter, that is.
</P>
<P>
   People from all cultures have always known that curative
cuisine, from chicken soup (they don't call it Jewish penicillin
for nothing) to soups and teas made with curry, chile peppers,
ginger, garlic, citrus, horseradish and a host of other foods often
provide real relief for the ills of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   What we call ``feeling better,'' scientific researchers are
calling the effects of phytochemicals. Medical science has begun to
test and recognize that substances called phytochemicals, which are
neither vitamins nor minerals but are found in most fruits and
vegetables by the tens of thousands, contain potent therapeutic
properties that often dramatically relieve and sometimes even
eliminate certain illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much interest in these ``nutraceuticals'' that
public and private laboratories, including the National Cancer
Institute, are stepping up research by spending millions of dollars
to see how best to identify, extract and use phytochemicals to
create new drugs that in coming decades may be used to fight
diseases from the common cold to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At
http://www.phys.com/bnutrition/01selfanalysis/05colds/colds.html, a
site sponsored by Conde Nast in collaboration with Tufts
University, you can find the latest in this exciting field of
nutritional research. But the best part of the site is how we can
use what is known now in our own kitchens to whip up culinary
curatives when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   In a section called ``The Culinary Chemist,'' you will find
detailed information on phytochemically rich foods along with
recipes that can help relieve debilitating symptoms of a number of
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Symptom Advisor'' asks you to check off certain symptoms
you may be experiencing, from congestion to nausea to diarrhea to
headaches, and then ``prescribes'' a dish that may help. It also
advises, of course, that under certain circumstances you should see
a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other interesting sites to visit:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At ``Flu Food,'' at
http://www.ab.sympatico.ca/Contents/Health/HEALTHYWAY/recflu.html,
you will find informative articles from various sources including
Better Homes and Gardens, CNN, Redbook and others concerning
kitchen remedies. There also are lots of recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Http://www.naturalland.com/ is an interactive site where you
chat and pick up tips about healing foods, fitness and nutrition.
It changes daily. A recent tip of the day: ``Celery juice has a
mild diuretic effect, similar to many drugs that are prescribed for
high blood pressure. The juice is highly nutritious and can be
helpful for people who need to balance their blood pressure.''
Another imparted this bit of nutritional wisdom: ``For optimum skin
repair and healing, increase intake of foods rich in vitamin A and
zinc. Good sources for vitamin A are carrots, sweet potatoes,
butternut squash and mangoes. Zinc is found in wheat germ, lima
beans, legumes and nuts.'' Good stuff here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At
http://www.ivillage.com/food/articles/0,3035,221(tilde)77,00.html,
you will find an excellent article entitled ``Cures in Your
Cupboard'' by nutritionist Sue Gilbert, who, while she doesn't go
into phytochemical research, does gi/ve sound nutritional
information about different foods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And, finally, at
http://www.betterbaking.com/baker2/delisou.html you will find the
classic, Jewish penicillin.

   SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Bronchitis Broth
</P>
<P>
   Makes 15 servings of broth and vegetables; may be served
separately Preparation time: 40 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour, 10
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Pulmonary specialist Dr. Irwin Ziment at the University of
California-Los Angeles faxed the recipe he gives his patients, and
we started from there. After cooking the chopped vegetables for 30
minutes, you can refrigerate the broth and complete it up to two
days later. For a light broth, strain out the vegetables before
adding the garlic and other ingredients. (Don't discard the
vegetables; they're terrific over brown rice or couscous.) By the
way, this soup is delicious even if your breathing is fine.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 pound carrots (6 or 7 medium), peeled, scraped and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch (1 1/4 pounds) celery with leafy tops, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   12 cups low-sodium canned chicken broth, or water or half of
each
</P>
<P>
   2 heads garlic, cloves lightly smashed, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   5 dried whole red chile peppers (finger-size peppers)
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped medium
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh mint, chopped medium
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh basil, chopped medium (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped medium (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Squirt of fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons each kosher salt and pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion,
carrots, celery, curry powder and cayenne pepper and cook for 20
minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft. Add
broth or water and bring to a boil on high heat. Reduce heat to
medium and simmer 30 minutes. Add garlic, chile peppers, cilantro,
mint, basil and parsley; cover and bring to a boil on high heat.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes. Remove peppers
with a slotted spoon and discard. Add lemon juice and salt and
pepper to taste. Strain, if desired, and serve vegetables over
brown rice or couscous. Serve hot. _ From ``Tonics'' by Robert A.

</P>
<P>
   Minted Pink Grapefruit Sorbet
</P>
<P>
   Makes 9 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 15
minutes Cooling time: 20 minutes Freezing time: 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   If you can find ruby-fleshed grapefruit for this light,
refreshing dessert, snap it up. The sorbet is undiluted, so it's an
appealing tea-rose color. If you like a sweet sorbet, add more
sugar. And if you use yellow-fleshed grapefruit, you might want to
add even more sugar, as they can be bitter.
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 pounds ruby- or pink-fleshed grapefruit (4 to 6, depending
on size)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch fresh mint,
</P>
<P>
   washed and stemmed, divided and several leaves reserved for
garnish; remainder chopped
</P>
<P>
   16 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Juice grapefruit to yield 4 to 4 1/2 cups juice. Collect pulp
from juicer and add it to the juice. In a saucepan, combine 1 cup
juice with sugar, chopped mint and cloves. Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and
cook until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and
simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool,
about 15 minutes. Strain the cooled liquid through a fine sieve
into the remaining juice, pressing down with a spoon to extract
liquid. Stir in lemon juice and vanilla. Pour into an ice cream
maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions. If you
don't have an ice cream maker, pour mixture into two 9-inch pie
pans or 4 ice cube trays and freeze until hard, about 4 hours. When
ready to serve, let sit at room temperature about 5 minutes to
loosen up. If using pie pans, break sorbet into chunks and process
in a food processor in two batches until smooth and light in color,
about 3 minutes per batch. Serve topped with the reserved mint
leaves. The sorbet can be packed into tightly covered plastic
containers and frozen. Since it doesn't contain a lot of sugar,
which acts as a preservative, it should be used within 3 or 4 days.

 &HT;    Making a mark of distinction a matter of basics not gimmicks
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The heyday of hemp and hashish has long since faded,
as distant from the here and now as Woodstock or Jefferson
Airplane. But hemp had been around, in many uses, long before the
'60s. It's what we made rope from, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But beer?
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, people have made beer from whatever
indigenous materials were at hand, whether they be cassava root or
cactus, and no doubt hemp was pressed into service for brewing as
well as smoking. But today the science of brewing is
well-established, its basic ingredients fairly standard around the
world: malted barley (sometimes with additions of wheat, oat or
rye), lager or ale yeast, hops and water. It's the art that varies,
from style to style and brewer to brewer. What malts and in what
proportions? Which hops and at what stage of the brewing process?
Which yeast strains? How long the fermentation?
</P>
<P>
   It is both art and science.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Frederick Brewing Co. had nothing hallucinogenic in
mind when it decided to add crushed hemp seed to the grist. It was
looking for something to set its Hempen Ale apart from so many
other brown ales.
</P>
<P>
   If it piques the curiosity, so much the better. But, as
brewmaster Tim Keck says, it wasn't something just tossed in for
the fun of it. ``Hemp,'' he says, ``can be hard to work with. You
don't always get the clarity you want, so you have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Done well, brewing with hemp seed can impart a subtle earthiness
to the flavor. Rye _ also difficult to work with _ is used for
similar reasons, although its effect is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim was to make a brown ale, but one that was a little
spicier than most,'' Keck says.
</P>
<P>
   Hempen Ale is certainly that, not spicy in the manner of winter
seasonal beers but noticeable enough that you know it's not the
usual brown ale. This is, in fact, quite a good one, fuller bodied
than most (but not heavy) and more complex in taste.
</P>
<P>
   As an accompaniment to food, a brown ale is usually relegated to
the nuts and the side dishes. But this is a brown ale that can
stand up to steaks and to slathery burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp makes up about 10 percent of the grist, the rest being
barley, and the Cascade hops in the finish give it a robustness
seldom found in a brown ale. English-style brown ales are typically
a beginner's ale, soft on the palate but with nothing much in the
way of complexity. Of late, American craft brewers have been
redefining the category in innovative ways, and what could be newer
_ or older _ than hemp?
</P>
<P>
   What works in one beer, though, doesn't always work in another.
Hempen Gold, a companion beer from the Frederick, Md., brewery, is
called a cream ale, meaning a light-bodied, very pale brew of low
alcohol content and almost no hop character.
</P>
<P>
   Cream ales have a long history in the United States and have had
their devotees. At one time, they were enjoyed as alternatives to
the growing dominance of mass-market lagers. But some cream ales
were ales in name only, and others were odd mixtures of ale and
lager.
</P>
<P>
   Hempen Gold, with hemp constituting 20 percent of the grist, is
top-fermented like all ales, but it is a beer whose flavor _ what
there is of it _ is entirely in the foretaste. It hits you and
almost evaporates. A real beer will unfold its character in the
mid-taste and leave its signature in the aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   This beer was designed for other purposes. ``We were aiming for
more of a mass audience,'' Keck concedes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're intent on using hemp, a better way to reach that
audience might have been the way Lexington Brewing of Lexington,
Ky., has. Instead of trying to make an extremely light ale, it
brewed a Coors-like lager and even used rice (10 percent), the
ingredient that gives mass-market beers their crispness but also
their blandness.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Hemp Beer is different in another way, too. Hemp is
used in the hopping process rather than as part of the grist, the
aim being to give the aroma a slight earthiness. But in a beer so
lightly hopped to begin with, the effect goes all but undetected.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder what the point really was. The best way to set your
beer apart is still the old-fashioned way, choosing your malts with
care and balancing the hops like a painter with his colors. Do it
well and you don't need the odd, eye-catching ingredient. The beer
will speak for itself.

MINNESOTA ENVELOPE MAVERICK OFFERS WISDOM ON SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The man who built his career around selling
envelopes has come out with another mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   Bestselling author Harvey Mackay's latest motivational book,
``Pushing the Envelope All the Way to the Top,'' doesn't fit neatly
into any sort of career category. He warns executives about why
companies fail, explains how he has attracted workers to his Mackay
Envelope Corp. in Minneapolis and describes the traits that help
people rise to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay is the author of such other books as ``Swim With the
Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive'' and ``Beware the Naked Man Who
Offers You His Shirt.'' Here are some of his observations, taken
from the new book and an interview earlier this month:
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies get in trouble for three main reasons: arrogance,
arrogance and arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mackay recalled how a friend named Don Burr
sat with him and scribbled ideas on a napkin about the airline that
Burr wanted to create. ``Fifteen months later, his picture is on
the cover of Time magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr's airline, Peoples Express, became a huge success _ and
then a huge failure. Mackay said Burr later attributed much of the
failure to arrogance; company leaders were so pleased with their
success that they didn't think about how larger competitors could
move into their routes and clobber them.
</P>
<P>
   Workers run into the same sort of complacency, Mackay said. They
think a job will be theirs forever, so they don't work as hard as
they can to keep it, or worry about networking to set up other job
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to work, it's a boundaryless company,'' Mackay
said. ``You don't fall in love with your corporation because the
corporation may not love you back.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Many times determination makes the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was first starting out,'' Mackay writes,
``and asking a colleague I respected how many calls he would make
on a prospect before giving up. He told me: `It depends on which
one of us dies first.'''
</P>
<P>
   Job hunters can benefit from the same sort of determination. In
the book, Mackay describes how a recent college graduate dealt with
getting rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``One busy personnel manager, flooded with applications,
suggested the hopeful applicant check back in 10 years. `No
problem,' the young woman responded. `Would a morning or afternoon
interview work best for you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Determination also helps people keep jobs while their colleagues
are being laid off, Mackay said in the interview. ``There will
always be a place in this world for anyone who says, `I'll take
care of that,' and then performs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't stifle creativity.
</P>
<P>
   One chapter lists 25 things people say that kills creativity,
including ``Great idea! Let's form a committee to tackle it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Know how to recruit and hire good people.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay has been heavily involved in hiring Mackay Envelope
employees. The two he makes sure he always hires are the president
and the receptionist, the latter because the person who answers the
phone can do an awful lot to encourage or drive away business.
</P>
<P>
   When hiring, Mackay said he makes sure to meet the prospect's
spouse so that the spouse can understand the corporate culture, and
he uses an industrial psychologist to advise him on which
candidates are particularly attractive or unattractive. He also
looks for a good sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to walk the factory, I want to walk the offices and I
want to hear laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   When people are hired, the company and the employee put together
an agreement for the next several years, Mackay said, outlining
what is expected of the worker and what the employee can expect to
receive for achieving those goals. ``Our whole philosophy is this:
Agreements prevent disagreements.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the company rewards employees frequently with perks like
tickets to sporting events, and stresses the attitude of not only
succeeding on your own, but helping co-workers to succeed. In the
book, he mentions how important it is to share the company's values
with employees, including how valuable time is for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The book describes Mackay's shock as he interviewed a
prospective sales representative named Jane for the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my interview with Jane, I popped one of my favorite
questions, `Jane, how many hours a week do you work?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a `sound barrier' number. Instead she blurted,
`Oh, about 20 hours.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Twenty hours? Wait a minute, what did you say your dollar
volume was last year in Chicago?'
</P>
<P>
   ```$2 million.'
</P>
<P>
   ```We can check, you know.'
</P>
<P>
   ```So check. That's what I did, and I can do it for your
company, too, and even better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It checked. I hired her. I don't ask her how many hours she
works. I don't care. This year her W2 form will be six figures.''

NEW YORK FARMERS WAIT FOR END OF CASTRO REGIME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We were sitting around one night not too long ago
_ me, Henry Zwack and a bunch of farmers from Rensselaer County,
N.Y. We were all thinking pretty much the same thing: Wouldn't it
be great if Fidel Castro died? Everything would be so much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was the Tavern at Sterup Square, a top-drawer
restaurant in the heart of this suburban Albany county of 154,000
souls. Zwack is a shrewd, calculating, bespectacled lawyer of 45
who serves as the Rensselaer County executive. He was throwing a
fancy dinner for a couple of Cuban diplomats from Washington. The
idea was to interest Cuba in buying food from Rensselaer County
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The county has a gritty little city, Troy, and some gracious
suburbs. But much of Rensselaer County is farmland populated by
people who vote Republican. Coincidentally, Zwack is a Republican.
His idea of a creative American foreign policy would be to wean the
Cubans away from communism on a diet of Rensselaer County beef,
mutton, apples and vegetables _ not to mention processed dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans would be delighted with that, actually. Things got so
bad in Havana a few years back that family cats were scrambling to
avoid a closer association with rice and black beans than cats
usually find congenial.
</P>
<P>
   For about a century now, ever since we Americans threw the
Spanish out, Cuba has been even less stable politically than
Zwack's Rensselaer County. And, believe me, that's going some. The
Cubans never really got the idea of democracy. Every time one side
won an election, the other side picked up guns.
</P>
<P>
   When Zwack was 5 years old, Castro was a hot-blooded communist
lawyer who raised an army and chased out Fulgencio Batista, a
tyrant who'd staged his own military coup some years earlier. All
green fatigues and gray beard, Castro turns 73 this year as the
only major remaining communist leader in the hemisphere. Recurrent
rumors of his physical ailments bring bright smiles to the lips of
South Florida's prosperous expatriate Cuban community, which has
demonstrated an impressive gift for nursing a grudge for four
decades now.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has suffered a stroke. Big grin. Did you hear? Fidel has
Alzheimer's disease. Champagne, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   But the champagne has been on ice for a while now as Castro has
clung selfishly to life. His country is a shambles, thanks to
communism's shortcomings as an economic system, to general
mismanagement and to a strict trade embargo imposed by the United
States, which classifies Cuba as ``a terrorist nation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Castro hangs on, the U.S. government pretty much sticks to
its embargo, despite pleas from the pope and even from aggressive
Republican politicians like Zwack.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Zwack and his farmers despise communists every bit as much
as anybody else might despise communists. They would love the
opportunity to feed them, though. They would love to sell them
apples, for example, at a better price than the Cubans can buy them
now from China. One Rensselaer County farmer, George Messick, would
be thrilled at the chance to sell the Cubans meat from bisons. He
raises the huge things, and he figures buffalo steaks would be a
treat for them.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture is a tough business. Farmers everywhere are always
looking for new mouths to feed. This market is a natural for
Rensselaer County farmers. Cuba is just 200 miles in a straight
line from downtown Miami _ a suburb, really. And it's much closer
to the Port of Albany than to the Port of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that, so far, the U.S. government hasn't given
Zwack and his farmers permission to go there and even talk,
although the Cubans are even more eager to buy food at decent
prices than the Rensselaer County farmers are to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The complication is that the victims of the Cuban Diaspora wield
great political power in Florida, a key state in presidential
elections. They want no U.S. trade with Cuba for as long as Fidel
Castro draws breath.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Zwack hopes to land with a trade delegation at Jose
Marti International Airport as early as next month. If he's lucky,
he'll get to represent Rensselaer County at Castro's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   And the champagne finally will flow.
</P>

TINKY WINKY GETS ALL THE INK, BUT `DIPSY' REFLECTS A DEEPER ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On CNN last weekend, the Rev. Jerry Falwell issued an unusual
denial. He claimed that another author had written the
controversial ``Tinky Winky'' piece appearing in one of his
newsletters.
 &HT;    Seems Falwell had never seen a Teletubby -- much less concluding
that one was gay.
 &HT;    The editorial previously attributed to Falwell had ``outed''
Tinky Winky of the PBS children's show, ``Teletubbies.'' The writer
claimed that since Tinky Winky was purple, has an antenna shaped
like an inverted triangle, carries a purse, and sometimes wears a
skirt, he must be gay.
 &HT;    The article further warned parents that ``Teletubbies'' could
undermine the morals of American children by desensitizing them to
the dangers of homosexuality.
 &HT;    As parents of a 1-year-old, my husband and I are avid
Teletubbies fans. Long before Jerry Falwell noticed -- or did not
notice, as he now claims -- we suspected Tinky Winky might be gay.
And we were not the first. Tinky Winky's British fans turned him
into a gay-rights icon months before the show ever aired in the
United States. In the wake of the Falwell-Tinky Winky affair, one
gay activist group invited the Teletubbies to be the marshal at
their annual parade.
 &HT;    In this case liberal parents, gay-rights groups and Jerry
Falwell agree: Tinky-Winky bends gender.
 &HT;    If Falwell considers this further, he might object to Teletubby
theology. There are only four Teletubbies and the other three are
straight. Therefore, Tinky Winky must have been born ``that way.''
In Teletubbyland, homosexuality is nature, not nurture.
 &HT;    Is Tinky Winky dangerous? He does not recruit other Teletubbies
and he appears to be celibate (although Teletubbies do bathe
together and sleep in the same room). The other Teletubbies love
him and he loves them -- platonically.
 &HT;    The danger, it appears, is that Teletubbies love Tinky Winky
without reference to his sexual orientation. If Tinky Winky was
born gay, then the Christian response is to love and accept him
just as good Teletubbies all love and accept each other.
Teletubbies thus undermine pre-schooler morality -- by teaching
toddlers to love others.
 &HT;    Teletubbyland is an inclusive and pluralistic place. Falwell
failed to mention that Dipsy, one of Tinky Winky's friends, is a
Teletubby of color. As the Teletubbies love and accept Tinky Winky
without reference to his orientation (and questionable taste in
handbags), they also love and accept Dipsy without reference to his
darker skin.
 &HT;    For many children, loving and accepting Dipsy may be a more
difficult and important task than determining Tinky Winky's
ambiguous sexuality. A young friend confided to me that her best
friend ``didn't like Dipsy.'' When I asked why, she reluctantly
confessed, ``Because he doesn't look right.'' Recently, when my
very blond, blue-eyed daughter carried Dipsy through an airport,
two African-American women asked to see him, commenting ``how
cute'' he was.
 &HT;    While the Tinky Winky controversy reveals some interesting
dynamics of the current argument in American churches regarding
sexuality, it also obscures the deeper issue of racial prejudice in
those churches. Some people -- like Jerry Falwell -- willingly
display homophobia in public. Yet many of the same people resist
the idea they may be racist. In 1999, most Christians would never
dream of attacking Dipsy as ``dangerous.'' Forty years ago,
however, their grandparents did.
 &HT;    In American churches, racism is a deeply embedded prejudice. It
is harder to address and often more difficult to discern. It is an
underground evil, poisoning much of our national life with little
notice. Even in this still-puritanical nation, we would rather
discuss sex than race in public.
 &HT;    Gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals should take heart -- the
prejudice against them is ``out.'' When one knows the enemy, the
battle is easier. But in the war against racism, the enemy is still
within. And facile political correctness has closeted racism even
deeper in our souls.
 &HT;    When it comes to Teletubbies, Dipsy is the quieter -- and almost
invisible -- Teletubby. Last Christmas, boxed Dipsies still lined
the shelves at my neighborhood store. Po, Laa-Laa, and Tinky Winky
all sold out.
 &HT;    Perhaps Dipsy witnesses to the real danger in American society
-- our silent prejudices. When my little daughter kisses Dipsy, I
envy her. I wish I had grown up in a world where white girls loved
dark-skinned dolls without hesitation. To her, Dipsy is just one
more cherished Teletubby. I hope and pray it will always be that
way.
 &HT;    If Tinky Winky's over-the-top stereotype undermines a
``morality'' of prejudice against gays and lesbians, more power to
him. In Teletubbyland all our prejudices -- overt and covert -- are
thankfully undermined.

without reference to his orientation (and questionable taste in
handbags), they also love and accept Dipsy without reference to his
darker skin.
 &HT;    For many children, loving and accepting Dipsy may be a more
difficult and important task than determining Tinky Winky's
ambiguous sexuality. A young friend confided to me that her best
friend ``didn't like Dipsy.'' When I asked why, she reluctantly
confessed, ``Because he doesn't look right.'' Recently, when my
very blond, blue-eyed daughter carried Dipsy through an airport,
two African-American women asked to see him, commenting ``how
cute'' he was.
 &HT;    While the Tinky Winky controversy reveals some interesting
dynamics of the current argument in American churches regarding
sexuality, it also obscures the deeper issue of racial prejudice in
those churches. Some people -- like Jerry Falwell -- willingly
display homophobia in public. Yet many of the same people resist
the idea they may be racist. In 1999, most Christians would never
dream of attacking Dipsy as ``dangerous.'' Forty years ago,
however, their grandparents did.
 &HT;    In American churches, racism is a deeply embedded prejudice. It
is harder to address and often more difficult to discern. It is an
underground evil, poisoning much of our national life with little
notice. Even in this still-puritanical nation, we would rather
discuss sex than race in public.
 &HT;    Gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals should take heart -- the
prejudice against them is ``out.'' When one knows the enemy, the
battle is easier. But in the war against racism, the enemy is still
within. And facile political correctness has closeted racism even
deeper in our souls.
 &HT;    When it comes to Teletubbies, Dipsy is the quieter -- and almost
invisible -- Teletubby. Last Christmas, boxed Dipsies still lined
the shelves at my neighborhood store. Po, Laa-Laa, and Tinky Winky
all sold out.
 &HT;    Perhaps Dipsy witnesses to the real danger in American society
-- our silent prejudices. When my little daughter kisses Dipsy, I
envy her. I wish I had grown up in a world where white girls loved
dark-skinned dolls without hesitation. To her, Dipsy is just one
more cherished Teletubby. I hope and pray it will always be that
way.
 &HT;    If Tinky Winky's over-the-top stereotype undermines a
``morality'' of prejudice against gays and lesbians, more power to
him. In Teletubbyland all our prejudices -- overt and covert -- are
thankfully undermined.

   GA-LEGIS-TEXAS _ Part of Gov. Roy Barnes' health-care reform
plan being announced Wednesday will deal with the right of insured
clients to sue their health care provider under a malpractice
statute if the provider refuses to pay for a procedure that later
turns out to have been necessary. The proposed legislation, to be
introduced as a separate bill, is draw on the Texas law enacted
last year but is said to be more contentious toward the providers.
A quick look at the Texas law: what it has done and where it has

   TEX-LEGIS-PERMITS _ For the third time in as many legislative

   TEX-LEGIS-UTMONEY _ UT-Austin needs at least $54 million in new
general revenue from the state to provide badly-needed compensation
for staff, faculty and graduate assistants. In all, they are asking
for more than $70 million. The Legislative Budget Board only has
$13 million appropriated for the flagship and lawmakers seem to
have little sympathy for UT after big salaries of coaches and
administrators and a fancy new club have been publicized. They say
if they provide more money, they want it to go to increasing
minority enrollment and graduation rates for starters. UT was not
the only college looking for money at the Legislature. Several
others are requesting more general revenue andcollectively, they
are requesting $804 million in special items. That is on top of
General Revenue funding. How much they get will depend on the size
of the tax cut. (Brooks, Austin American-Statesman).

CAMPAIGN OPERATIVE EXPECTED TO RUN FOR SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Clint Reilly, a millionaire real estate investor
who previously worked as a campaign consultant, is expected to
announce his candidacy for mayor of San Francisco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has hinted at his ambition to take on Mayor Willie Brown
for more than a year, and recently put together a campaign team.
With his announcement, Reilly steps out from behind the scenes
where for years he served as a player in city and state politics,
running campaigns for other people and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown has been busy getting endorsements from key
political groups such as labor and the Democratic Party in
preparation for the November election, Reilly is considered his
first viable challenger. Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano
and Supervisor Leland Yee have not ruled out mayoral campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly does not hide his dislike for Brown. He ran incumbent
Frank Jordan's unsuccessful campaign for re-election against Brown
in the race four years ago. More recently, he fought Brown over the
ballot measures for a new 49ers football stadium and sponsored
another ballot drive to strip Brown's control over the development
of Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant and outspoken, Reilly has made his own headlines over
the years. He's been sued for sexual harassment by a former
employee and in 1993 he sued the San Francisco Examiner, alleging
that Executive Editor Phil Bronstein assaulted him during a meeting
in the newspaper's editorial offices. Bronstein never conceded
culpability. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an
undisclosed sum.

   RENOVATE (Undated) _ Okay, so it's not a palace. Maybe you just
bought it. Maybe you just looked around and, as if for the first
time, spotted the cracked plaster, the 20 or 30 coats of paint, the
dark stains on the floors, the exposed electrical conduit and the
unmentionable kitchen. Maybe it's time for a renovation. If you
have neither the inclination nor the budget for a large-scale,
architect-designed renovation _ a project that could easily run to
$75,000 or $100,000 for a one-bedroom apartment _ you'll probably
turn to a general contractor, someone experienced ed to handle the
whole job, including plumbing, wiring, tiling and carpentry. How to
weigh the widely varying _ and often impenetrable _ bids when they
arrive? The questions are as nervewracking as finding the apartment
or house in the first place. By Tracie Rozhon.

   KITCHEN-TECH (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Maybe Mr. Java is just shy.
But when asked to produce a cup of coffee for a stranger last
Thursday, he sat as still as a child frozen on stage. ``I don't
understand,'' said Kristin Hall, a project coordinator at the Media
Laboratory at MIT, founded 14 years ago to, in the phrase of its
director, Nicholas Negroponte, ``invent the future.'' Mr. Java is
an Acorto 2000s automatic expresso machine wired to a personal
computer _ a kind of HAL for latte, when he works. He is also the
first piece created by Counter Intelligence, a new five-year
research program inaugurated in October to invent a technological
future for the home kitchen. By William L. Hamilton.

   VISIONAIRE (New York) _ ``It's our dream,'' Stephen Gan said,
surveying the vast, gleaming-white new home of Visionaire, the
avant-garde quarterly that changes format with each issue and which
has developed an international cult following among the
increasingly entwined worlds of art and fashion. By Christopher
Mason
</P>
<P>
   IKEA-SPACE (New York) _ She's always organizing, but her house
is a mess. He leaves his running shoes all over the apartment. Her
heel-less pumps multiply on the closet floor. The children are
having turf wars over their toys. Disputes over space _ especially
the lack of it _ can turn a happy marriage into the bitter,
chandelier-swinging finale from the divorce film, ``War of the
Roses.'' With that in mind, on the eve of Valentine's Day, Ikea in
Elizabeth, N.J., brought together two psychotherapists and an
interior designer to help customers sort out, or maybe even shelve,
their issues. By Julie Iovine.

<P>
   QUILTS-DECODED (Undated) _ One scholar compared it to the
``Rosetta stone,'' said Jacqueline L. Tobin, the author, with
Raymond G. Dobard, of ``Hidden in Plain View,'' a new book that
makes a startling claim about quilts: that some quilts were
patterned as a code to direct escaping slaves. A quilt with
monkey-wrench pattern hung in a cabin window signaled slaves to
gather tools for the escape. Tumbling blocks indicated imminent
departure. The number and placement of knots represented dates. The
book, just published by Doubleday, has become a surprise hot
seller. The story of its origin is as intriguing as its theory. By

   TINKY WINKY GETS ALL THE INK, BUT `DIPSY' REFLECTS A DEEPER
ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Teletubbyland, which we've all been reading about lately, is an
inclusive and pluralistic place. The Rev. Jerry Falwell failed to
mention that Dipsy, one of Tinky Winky's friends, is a Teletubby of
color. As the Teletubbies love and accept Tinky Winky without
reference to his orientation (and questionable taste in handbags),
they also love and accept Dipsy without reference to his darker
skin.
</P>

<P>
   MID-LIFE SPIRITUALITY SHUNS `QUESTION-AND-ANSWER' RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   The spirituality of growing up and being grown-up is not the
same. Youthful spirituality seeks answers for big questions: Who is
God? Who am I? Who will be my life partner? What am I to do in the
world? A quest for order engulfs the young as they become
independent persons. As a result, religions with strict moral
boundaries and clear-cut beliefs appeal to teen-agers and young
adults, providing direction to those otherwise adrift.
</P>
<P>
   By forty, spirituality is no longer about order. Rather, it is
about meaning. For most of us, those ``big questions'' have been
resolved. As the last baby-boomers turn forty, an entire generation
is moving away from question-and-answer religion to narrative faith
-- a shift likely to produce profound consequences for America's
religious institutions and political landscape. (Slugged

Y2K PROBLEM SPARKS BRISK SALES OF GENERATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. _ New York's power companies say they expect
few, if any, blackouts because of the millennium computer glitch.
But some New Yorkers aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, buying generators to supply backup power in
the event things don't work as well as officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of power generators and other equipment in New York state
are skyrocketing. Manufacturers are churning out popular models at
record rates, and customers are waiting months for some models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes sense to be prepared,'' said David Triller of
the upstate New York town of Clifton Park. ``All I keep reading is
nobody really knows what's going to happen. That's kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Triller waited three months to get a 5,000-watt Honda for his
house. He also ordered two more _ one for a friend, and one for his
guitar store to keep the fragile wooden instruments from freezing
if the power dies.
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists fear that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume
it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   For those who worry about the year 2000 computer glitch, or
``Y2K problem,'' the biggest concern is that the electricity will
go out for a long time. Power companies say they are well aware of
the problem and expect to be Y2K-compliant before the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists who have been following the Y2K problem say they
expect, at the worst, temporary outages in a few places that won't
last more than a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K isn't the only reason to buy a generator. Headlines about
natural disasters during the last two years _ hurricanes in the
southern United States and Central America, landslides in
California and floods in the Midwest _ get people worried.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather news means good business for Joe Farina, manager of
Albany Honda. ``There's been a tremendous increase,'' he said.
``It's like buying fire insurance on your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda, one of the bigger generator sellers in the United States,
has doubled its sales in the past year, according to a Jan. 1
letter sent to its dealers. The company has given up producing a
wide selection, concentrating instead on the more popular models in
an effort to produce more. And despite that, there's still a
months-long waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K has been an especially powerful sales incentive because of
all the advance publicity and speculation about impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   All the fuss and worry may be for naught. At a recent New York
Assembly committee hearing, officials from power companies around
the state testified that their computers would be Y2K-compliant by
the end of June. Other power experts say they believe the worst
problem that will occur the first week of January is a few spotty
outages that will not take long to repair.

GOOD FOOD, GOOD FORTUNE IN THE YEAR TO COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our neighbors in the Far East know how to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The lunar new year kicked off Tuesday. People will be partying
for the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chinese and Koreans, this will be the Year of the
Rabbit; for the Vietnamese, the Year of the Cat. For all concerned,
it's a season of eating, gift-giving and symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Houses are cleaned to rid them of bad fortune. New clothes in
bright colors (particularly red) are readied. Homes are stocked
with food and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you are,'' says Chinese master chef Martin
Yan, ``you try to go home for the new year.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the main reasons for going home again is to get some
of the dishes that foster good fortune and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food for New Year's has a long history of symbolism and
superstition,'' Yan says. ``Even Chinese menus will change names of
dishes during New Year's. A lobster becomes a `dragon' on a menu
because it looks like a dragon, which is a symbol of power and
vitality. A chicken on a menu becomes a phoenix because it's a
bird. Fish are important because the word for fish is a homophone
for the word for abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red is the most important color because it is the color of
blood and symbolizes vitality. That's why parents give their
children money at New Year's in a red envelope, and poems are
written on red scrolls. And sweet and sour dishes are red.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapes also have importance at the holiday table.
</P>
<P>
   Round shapes, symbolizing coins, denote prosperity. Long, uncut
noodles promote a long life. Duck, chicken and fish are served
complete, again meaning affluence. (Even if a fish or chicken is to
be divided at the table, it is presented assembled.)
</P>
<P>
   As with all holiday fare _ here or abroad _ the meal plan is in
the memories. Following are typical New Year's dishes from ``Martin
Yan's Feast: The Best of Yan Can Cook'' (Bay Books, $34.95).
</P>
<P>
   LION'S HEAD MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   6 dried black mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Meatballs:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound regular-firm tofu, drained
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound ground pork OR ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons oyster-flavored sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20
minutes; drain. Discard stems and quarter the caps.
</P>
<P>
   Mash tofu in bowl. Place in a clean towel and squeeze to remove
excess liquid. Return to bowl and add remaining meatball
ingredients; mix well. Divide mixture into 12 equal portions. Roll
each portion into a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking oil for deep-frying
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound napa cabbage, cut into 3-inch sections
</P>
<P>
   1 small carrot, thinly sliced diagonally
</P>
<P>
   16 snow peas, trimmed and cut in half diagonally
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   In wok or 2-quart saucepan, heat oil for deep-frying to 350
degrees. Fry meatballs, half at a time, turning frequently, until
browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with slotted
spoon/spatula; drain on paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Place meatball in 2-quart pan. Add broth, wine and soy sauce.
Heat to simmering. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add mushrooms,
cabbage and carrot. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Add snow peas
and cook until all vegetables are tender-crisp, about 2 minutes
longer. Stir in sesame oil.

</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup boiling water
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   Place flour in bowl. Add boiling water, stirring with fork or
chopsticks. Gradually stir in cold water, mixing until dough holds
together. On a lightly floured board, knead dough until smooth and
satiny, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound ground chicken, beef OR pork
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped green onions

   1/4 cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce

<P>
   2 teaspoons sesame oil
</P>

   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine filling ingredients in bowl; mix well.
</P>
<P>
   On lightly floured board, roll dough into 9-inch-long cylinder.
Cut cylinder into 18 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Roll a portion of dough into 3 1/2-inch circle about 1/2 inch
thick; keep remaining dough covered to prevent drying. Place
rounded tablespoon of filling in center of dough. Gather edges of
dough around filling; pinch to seal. Roll filled dough into a ball;
flatten with palm of hand to make a disk 1/2 inch thick.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``When should we begin to teach our child to use the potty?''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most common questions I am asked by parents _
especially lately, since this issue has been in the news.
</P>
<P>
   I still offer the same advice I've always given: Only a child
can decide when the time for toilet training has come. Any pressure
parents may feel from grandparents, nursery schools or friends
should be ignored. It's got to be the child's achievement, not
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain signs of readiness that parents can look for
to know when it's time to begin training. These include a good
understanding of words, concepts and instructions; a desire to
imitate important adults; an urge to put things where they belong;
and the waning of negativism. This will probably happen sometime
during the third year. I like to start at the age of 2 to show
children what we expect of them. Each step can then be theirs, if
parents watch their signals.
</P>
<P>
   When the time is right, here's what I recommend:
</P>
<P>
   1. Give the child a potty chair on the floor, so he can take it
wherever he wants. Call it his and let him get used to it as his.
</P>
<P>
   2. After a week, take him to sit on his toilet, in his clothes,
while you sit on yours. Read to him or give him a cookie to keep
him there momentarily. This is just to establish the daily routine
of sitting on it. If you take his clothes off, it's too invasive
and may frighten him.
</P>
<P>
   3. The next week, ask him if it's OK to take his diaper off so
he can sit on the potty, once a day. You sit on your potty, he sits
on his. Tell him: ``This is what Mommy and Daddy do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   4. The third week, take him to his pot with his dirty diaper,
undo it, then drop it in the toilet. Meanwhile, say something like:
``This is where you can go someday to do your b.m. This is what
Mommy and Daddy do. This is your pot. This is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't flush his b.m. away while he watches. The child feels it
is part of him and wonders where it goes when it disappears. Don't
get rid of it until he loses interest and walks away.
</P>
<P>
   5. The next step is completely at the discretion of the toddler.
In fact, if at any time he resists a step, forget training for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   If he's been interested in the previous steps, however, you can
offer to take his clothes off and let him run around with a bare
bottom. Offer to put the potty in his room so he can go to it
himself when he wants to. Then, offer to remind him every hour to
try to go.
</P>
<P>
   If he's ready, he will be able to cooperate on the pot. If he
does produce something, congratulate him, but don't overdo it. Too
much praise can take away his own excitement about his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   6. If he's really ready, you can leave his pants off for longer
periods. If he has an accident on the floor, go right back to
diapers. Don't make a fuss. Simply say, ``We'll try again. There's
no hurry. Someday you'll do it like Mommy and Daddy.'' You are
depending on his desire to imitate and identify with you.
</P>
<P>
   Each step must be at his timing. If he gets worried or
resistant, pull back quickly. Offer him back his diapers, and try
to forget training for a while. He knows now what you are expecting
of him, and he'll do it when he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   7. Night training shouldn't begin until he's dry at his nap and
until he gives some signal that he wants to stay dry at night. Wait
until he has dry diapers or no urine for at least four to six hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   A child will have to be really ready to cooperate to make night
training worthwhile. Unless he asks you to help _ or does it
spontaneously _ I'd eliminate nighttime as a project until he's at
least 3. Most children aren't ready until 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   As a society, we are far too uptight about pushing children to
be trained. The incidence of failures _ including children
withholding b.m.s and urine _ is rising today. Perhaps this is due
to the pressure on busy parents to have children trained by 3 for
nursery school. Fight that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's due to confusion children feel when their parents
share the training steps with day-care providers. Don't do this.
For the best chance of success, toilet training should be something
personal between you and your child.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 9-year-old son is in the gifted and talented
program at school. Though he excels in music and arts and his
intelligence level is way beyond his years, he is easily
frustrated, cries frequently and does not do what he is told.
</P>
<P>
   His teachers call me all the time, telling me he is a discipline
problem and will not finish his work. He also does not seem to get
along with other children and is very unorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Could he be ADHD _ even though he makes straight A's when he
chooses to do his work? _ R.H., Guilford, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder _ doesn't occur to me. Too many adults
(teachers and parents) use it as a sort of wastebasket diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I would think that your son is feeling too much
pressure to perform. He may be a perfectionist and may not want to
take chances on being anything but perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The gifted program may be too pressured an environment for an
already inner-pressured child. Hearing that other children shun him
and that he is disorganized worries me. I urge you to have your son
evaluated by a child psychologist or therapist. It sounds as if he
may be feeling overwhelmed or depressed.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Our 26-month-old son is very loving and well-behaved,
but when he gets mad or frustrated he acts out by hitting, kicking
or throwing things.
</P>
<P>
   What would you suggest we do? When we put him in timeout, he
gets frantic and more out of control _ not calmer. _ R.H., Missouri
City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: His out-of-control, hurting behaviors are a mark
of how frightening it is to lose control. He needs you to help him
regain control and to help him understand his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hold him or contain him when he gets out of control (a timeout
is just for that purpose). As soon as you break the cycle, tell him
that you understand how upset he is but that you also want to help
him learn to control himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's too frightening to everyone (including him) when he loses
it.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: When my 4-year-old son wakes up at night, he comes
into our bed, saying he is afraid. We welcome him with open arms
and do not take him back to his bed. My question: By allowing him
to come into our bed, are we preventing him from learning to
overcome his fears and anxieties? Or is he learning a sense of
love, security and self-importance from us? _ M.J.M., Boca Raton,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Both. You are certainly offering him security by
accepting him. But you aren't helping him overcome his
age-appropriate fears and nightmares. These are normal at his age,
when he is learning about his own aggressive feelings.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, he will need your help with those fears and your
understanding. He will best learn how to handle angry and
aggressive feelings from you and your spouse by modeling on you
both as you handle your own feelings.
</P>
<P>
   I won't tell you when to begin helping him go back to his own
bed, but it should be a goal. He'd be proud if he could learn to
handle his own fears.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I am very upset about my 4 1/2-year-old grandson. He
is a bright, happy, verbal youngster at home. However, in
daycare/nursery school, he will not speak with the children or
teacher. This has been the problem since he started daycare at 2
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   His parents have been going with him to therapy for 16 months _
with two different therapists. He still won't speak in school,
though he participates in all activities.
</P>
<P>
   What are your thoughts? _ R.W., Baltimore, Md.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I assume that his parents have gotten an
evaluation from the therapists about whether your grandson has a
hypersensitive hearing problem or a sensory integration problem,
which can lead to an autistic-like interference in handling complex
environments. If he hasn't been evaluated, he should be.
</P>
<P>
   But if your grandson is not plagued with such a problem, he may
just be a child who participates visually. I have seen children who
are part of the group without ever participating openly.
</P>
<P>
   If no one pushes him, he'll probably start communicating on his
own.
</P>
<P>

INDIAN GROUP PLANS MEETING PLACE FOR EXPATRIATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, N.Y. _ On a derelict farm with crumbling barns and
rusted tractors, a Native American dream is growing along the
Mohawk River.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of the Keepers of the Circle is a gathering place for
expatriates of various Native American nations who, far from their
reservations, have made their homes in the cities and suburbs of
the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   When completed at a projected cost of $10 million, the 29-acre
site will preserve the languages, rituals and food of the Indian
nations. It would serve as a focal point for Native Americans, a
public education center and, possibly, a magnet for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the roadside souvenir stands that dot highways around
the country, ``This isn't the 10-cent tourist trap where you go by
a plastic teepee and not a Native American in sight,'' said Vince
Dwyer, a Tonawanda Seneca and chairman of Keepers of the Circle.
``The whole purpose of it is for Native Americans to have a place
where they can come and congregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Based now in Albany, the Keepers, an 8-year-old nonprofit group
formed to promote the culture of Native Americans, has been looking
for a home for years. It rejected sites in urban areas, unsuitable
for a group that, for reasons both practical and spiritual, wanted
a location that would express the Native-American concepts of
living in balance, harmony and interdependence with Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Schenectady County authorized the $170,000 purchase
of the 29-acre tract in Rotterdam Junction. The land includes a
house that will be rehabilitated for offices.
</P>
<P>
   The land, set in a river valley that was home to Mohawks long
before the Europeans came, has some strong connections to its
proposed use. A 1714 deed conveying a portion of the property to
Jan Mabee, written on sheepskin, bore what appears to be the
upside-down wolf seal of a Native American.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Dwyer said, also featured a trading post that was the
last stop for hunters and trappers headed along the Mohawk River
into what was then a vast western wilderness. ``It's just really
rich in history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the county, the idea was a good fit, said Joe Ryan, the
deputy public works commissioner. The site includes 13 acres of the
Great Flats Aquifer, a source of drinking water. Plans are to carve
trails through the lowlands over the aquifer, protecting it from
development. Dwyer has been collecting wildflowers to seed the
land.
</P>
<P>
   The property is also next to the historic Mabee farm, owned by
the Schenectady County Historical Society and scheduled to open
fully as a museum in 2001, Ryan said. The two sites could serve as
a joint attraction, perhaps incorporating programs on the
interaction between the early Dutch and Native Americans who, in
peaceful periods, taught settlers survival techniques for the New
World.

PAINTINGS THAT TELL THE STORIES OF A CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by MOUNT-BLACKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The great allure of 19th-century American
art stems as much from history as it does from aesthetics _
especially when it comes to an artist like William Sidney Mount,
the subject of the Amon Carter Museum's newest show.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent genre painter of his time, Mount was a skillful
technician who knew his art-historical sources. But Mount's forte
was his feel for the tellingly typical story, visually recounted.
So we look to Mount in search of America's past, seeking history in
its more intimate forms.
</P>
<P>
   And we need look no further than ``William Sidney Mount: Painter
of American Life,'' which presents a succinct selection of Mount's
paintings, preparatory drawings and printed reproductions. About 60
works are on view, including the artist's acknowledged masterpiece,
``Farmers Nooning'' (1836), and such important canvases as
``Bargaining for a Horse'' (1835), ``The Power of Music'' (1847),
``Dance of the Haymakers'' (1845) and ``Eel Spearing at Setauket''
(1845).
</P>
<P>
   The installation begins with early works that reflect Mount's
germination as a self-taught artist. If his rendering is somewhat
awkward, we nonetheless can see his knowledge of works by old
masters like Jacques-Louis David. In ``School Boys Quarreling''
(1830), for example, Mount's composition obviously borrows from
David's ``Oath of the Horatii'' (1784) _ an allusion that would
raise Mount in viewers' esteem, but also flatter viewers for
recognizing the art-historical source.
</P>
<P>
   David's painting is about morality, honor and self-sacrifice.
Mount's picture shows boys arguing about what likely is a trivial
matter. One has had his nose bloodied; his friends raise their
fists in his defense while the apparent aggressor glares at them
and points his finger accusingly _ and steps, literally, on the
toes of one of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The main figures are rendered convincingly, if not subtly,
although the worst caricaturing is reserved for a black youth, who
is looking on from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an underlying commentary, too, suggested by Mount's
inclusion of a book bearing the legend ``Ocular Analysis'' _ in
other words, visual perception as it applies to art. With this,
Mount addresses the ideological dispute between the upstart
National Academy of Design and the establishment American Academy
of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mount's other major canvases reflect a similar,
ideological perspective. This isn't really surprising from a
painter who lived in turbulent times _ when society was becoming
increasingly urbanized and industrialized, when political power was
transferring from an enlightened aristocracy to a more populist
base and when economic speculation would contribute to the Panic of
1837. And let's not forget the brewing tensions that led to the
Civil War in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   A crisper commentary _ simpler in composition and more obvious
in its symbolism _ comes in ``Politics of 1852 _ or, Who let down
the bar?'' (1853). Here, we see two men standing on either side of
a fence whose top two rails have been moved so that someone could
climb over. A poacher stands on the near side of the fence. On the
far side is the farmer who has caught wind of his activities. In an
attempt to deflect the farmer's anger, the poacher assumes a casual
pose and starts reading from the ``New York Herald.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Mount is referring to the 1852 presidential election, in
which the Democratic and Whig candidates agreed on a number of
major issues, thus lowering the bar on, or blurring, distinctions
between one party and the other. Too, the ``Herald'' was a notably
nonpartisan publication that straddled the fence on a number of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Mount also was interested in the apolitical theme of music,
as seen in his portraits of musicians and in his pictures of people
enjoying music _ listening to it, dancing to it and playing it on
fiddle and banjo.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mount's best-known and most beloved musical images is
``Dance of the Haymakers,'' in which two men dance a robust jig on
the floor of a sturdy barn.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is replete with the sort of detail that must have
delighted viewers then and certainly delights us today.
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of men and children look on as the pair jounces
about to a tune played by a fiddle player, with the beat drummed by
a boy against the barn's open door. Onlookers include a couple of
farm children peering down from the hayloft and a more urbanely
dressed man seated on an upturned crate with a jug placed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, farm tools have been cast aside and the ground is
littered with chaff. A short-haired brown dog gazes attentively at
a cat that is hiding in the building's rock foundation. And,
perhaps as a purely painterly conceit, Mount also has included a
nicely painted, Dutch-inspired still life that rests on the
building's threshold.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other, perhaps sobering, themes underlying the
celebration this picture represents. Life may or may not have been
simpler and happier back then.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Mount's ability to evoke a scene, to tell a story, is
sufficient reason to enjoy this and any number of other pictures on
view.

 &HT;    TIPS FOR TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
 &HT;    With ONLINE-PRIVACY. For release Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    Eds: This is an added graphic element for a package of stories
that moved Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Experts say it's difficult to protect your privacy
in the computer age. But there are some preventive measures you can
take to reduce the amount of personal information that makes its
way into databases.
</P>
<P>
   You can take extreme measures, as outlined by California author
Don Ray on his Web site (http://www.privacyrights.org/donray.htm).
He offers more than 100 tips to privacy fanatics, including
everything from ``get married overseas'' to ``don't drop business
cards in the 'Free Lunch' bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island-based ``Privacy Journal'' newsletter suggests
less aggressive measures, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Protect the confidentiality of your Social Security number.
Don't provide it unless you have to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attach conditions to sensitive information you provide to
companies or organizations. Insist in writing that it not be
disclosed or that it be erased after a set number of years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never provide personal information over the telephone unless
you initiated the call and know to whom you're speaking.
</P>
<P>
   _ List your telephone number but not your address in the
telephone book. This makes it harder for those who compile data to
produce consumer profiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a telemarketing company calls you, tell them: ``Under the
federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, I want to be on your 'do
not call' list.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask the post office not to disclose your change of address to
commercial mailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be discreet in filling out application forms. Don't feel an
obligation to fill in every blank.

   RENOVATE (Undated) _ Okay, so it's not a palace. Maybe you just
bought it. Maybe you just looked around and, as if for the first
time, spotted the cracked plaster, the 20 or 30 coats of paint, the
dark stains on the floors, the exposed electrical conduit and the
unmentionable kitchen. Maybe it's time for a renovation. If you
have neither the inclination nor the budget for a large-scale,
architect-designed renovation _ a project that could easily run to
$75,000 or $100,000 for a one-bedroom apartment _ you'll probably
turn to a general contractor, someone experienced ed to handle the
whole job, including plumbing, wiring, tiling and carpentry. How to
weigh the widely varying _ and often impenetrable _ bids when they
arrive? The questions are as nervewracking as finding the apartment
or house in the first place. By Tracie Rozhon.

<P>
   KITCHEN-TECH (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Maybe Mr. Java is just shy.
But when asked to produce a cup of coffee for a stranger last
Thursday, he sat as still as a child frozen on stage. ``I don't
understand,'' said Kristin Hall, a project coordinator at the Media
Laboratory at MIT, founded 14 years ago to, in the phrase of its
director, Nicholas Negroponte, ``invent the future.'' Mr. Java is
an Acorto 2000s automatic expresso machine wired to a personal
computer _ a kind of HAL for latte, when he works. He is also the
first piece created by Counter Intelligence, a new five-year
research program inaugurated in October to invent a technological
future for the home kitchen. By William L. Hamilton.

   VISIONAIRE (New York) _ ``It's our dream,'' Stephen Gan said,
surveying the vast, gleaming-white new home of Visionaire, the
avant-garde quarterly that changes format with each issue and which
has developed an international cult following among the
increasingly entwined worlds of art and fashion. By Christopher
Mason
</P>
<P>
   IKEA-SPACE (New York) _ She's always organizing, but her house
is a mess. He leaves his running shoes all over the apartment. Her
heel-less pumps multiply on the closet floor. The children are
having turf wars over their toys. Disputes over space _ especially
the lack of it _ can turn a happy marriage into the bitter,
chandelier-swinging finale from the divorce film, ``War of the
Roses.'' With that in mind, on the eve of Valentine's Day, Ikea in
Elizabeth, N.J., brought together two psychotherapists and an
interior designer to help customers sort out, or maybe even shelve,
their issues. By Julie Iovine.

80-foot-long dormitory wing sleeps 25. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   QUILTS-DECODED (Undated) _ One scholar compared it to the
``Rosetta stone,'' said Jacqueline L. Tobin, the author, with
Raymond G. Dobard, of ``Hidden in Plain View,'' a new book that
makes a startling claim about quilts: that some quilts were
patterned as a code to direct escaping slaves. A quilt with
monkey-wrench pattern hung in a cabin window signaled slaves to
gather tools for the escape. Tumbling blocks indicated imminent
departure. The number and placement of knots represented dates. The
book, just published by Doubleday, has become a surprise hot
seller. The story of its origin is as intriguing as its theory. By
Phil Patton.

GOOD ENOUGH COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The asterisk work throughout the article should be replaced
with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most compelling reason to buy a computer these days is to
get access to the Internet. The most compelling reason not to buy a
computer is cost.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is becoming less of an issue. It is now possible to get an
Internet-ready computer for less than $500, and last week one
company even announced that it was going to give away free PCs and
Internet access to people who agree to fill out detailed personal
questionnaires and to be irradiated with Internet advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, computers will be given away in
Cracker Jack boxes, as soon as they get small enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been testing the cheapest system I could buy, the
$399 ``emachines etower 300k,'' coupled with a $100 ``emachines
eview 14'' monitor. Hey, for $499, what do you expect, capital
letters? At least emachines throws in some asterisks and
parentheses, like ``((asterisk)price after $50 rebate)'' and
``((asterisk)price does not include monthly Internet access
charges).''
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? The system works surprisingly well, if all you
want to do is connect to the Internet, send and receive electronic
mail, browse the web, balance the checkbook and check your
portfolio, write letters and school reports, play some simple games
and use educational software, go shopping on line, visit chat and
news groups, and listen to audio CDs while you work. And you may
even have some money left over to buy software and a printer.
</P>
<P>
   This computer is not for everyone, but it is an impressive
bargain for $500, and if that is the budget, this is the machine. A
lot of people are on a tight budget, apparently. The first
emachines reached stores in November, and by the end of December
emachines was nearly tied with Apple Computer Inc. for retail sales
in North America, according to the market research firm ZD Market
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   A joint venture of two Korean technology companies, Trigem and
Korea Data Systems, emachines plans to sell 100,000 mass-produced
computers a month.
</P>
<P>
   Back at my high school there were two guys who came to school in
strikingly different vehicles. One was a flame-red Lamborghini
Miura, a sleek Italian sports car whose speedometer did not even
start until 20 miles per hour. The other was a hot rod whose body
was rebuilt largely with scrap plywood, junkyard treasures and
stolen cafeteria chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles got their drivers to school and back. Both
required obsessive maintenance, and both attracted equal attention
from girls ((asterisk)and from the police).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, both did all the basic things cars were supposed
to do then, except that one was wildly expensive and the other cost
substantially less than an emachines etower 300k ((asterisk)not
counting all the oil it burned). Some people are willing to spend
for performance and cachet, others just want something that runs.
</P>
<P>
   The etower 300k, however, is not assembled from junk. Under the
hood the etower 300k mainly uses quality parts.
</P>
<P>
   The ``300k'' in the computer's name stands for the 300-megahertz
K6-2 Advanced Micro Devices microprocessor, which is a feisty
little chip that is completely Windows compatible. The company also
offers a 333k model for $499, as well as an assortment of ``i''
models (using Intel Celeron chips) and ``c'' models (Cyrix chips).
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive emachines desktop computer is the $599 etower
333id, which uses the Celeron A 333 chip and includes a DVD-ROM
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The AMD-based etower 300k comes with 32 megabytes of SD-RAM
memory, the bare minimum for doing anything useful with Windows 98,
which is already installed. One can add more memory up to a maximum
of 256MB, although if you need 256MB of memory, you do not want
this computer. The 2.1-gigabyte Samsung hard drive is relatively
puny.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has a 24X CD-ROM drive, which works just as well as the 32X
drives used in more expensive machines. It has a 56K V.90 fax
modem, the same as the fancier computers. And it comes with an
offer of 30 days of free Internet access through Netcom ((asterisk)
requires signing a monthly contract, $9.95 for 10 hours a month,
$19.95 for unlimited access.)
</P>
<P>
   The ATI Rage IIc 3D AGP graphics card comes with 4MB of video
memory, which means it can do a respectable job on 2D and 3D
graphics. The Crystal sound card is nothing to sing about, and
neither are the pair of fist-sized stereo speakers, but the sound
is better than the transistor radio my hot rod buddy had dangling
from his rear view mirror. This is hardly a game player's dream
machine, but neither is it a complete drudge.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is decent, the mouse is cheap, and the 14-inch
monitor will frustrate anyone who does a lot of Internet browsing.
As a starter system it will do. There are two Universal Serial Bus
ports, including one on the front of the computer, and one free
expansion bay and one open PCI expansion slot, and two ISA slots.
</P>
<P>
   I was impressed with the small touches that emachines offers,
like clear setup instructions and color-coded cables for attaching
the keyboard, mouse, monitor and speakers. While it does not
challenge the Apple iMac for ease and speed of setup, it comes
pretty close, and costs half as much.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, emachines plans to introduce its own Windows-based
version of the colorful, all-in-one iMac this summer, for about
$750.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the machine itself, the customer support plan is abysmal.
The company provides free setup support for only 15 days, although
the calendar does not start until the first call. After the 15 days
expire, technical support calls cost $25 per problem.
</P>
<P>
   An extended 3-year service warranty costs $59 extra and entitles
the owner to free telephone support for 36 months ((asterisk)you
pay the long distance tolls) and free replacement if the computer
breaks ((asterisk)assuming it is not your fault). At these prices,
it is cheaper to replace the broken computer than to fix it, but it
also means that if your important data are stuck in a crippled
machine, the company has no incentive to rescue it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Why spend more for a computer, when this one does the basics so
well? In general, more money means bigger, better and faster, and
eventually most computer users lust for bigger, better and faster.
For first-time PC buyers, however, more money can mean greater
peace of mind and enjoyment. Spending more for better features can
also delay (but not avoid) the need to upgrade the system later.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, at $399 some people may be content to use the
basic etower 300k until it runs out of gas, then either hand it
down or turn it into a planter, and buy a newer and better model
for even less money.
</P>
<P>
   If I could squeeze another $300 out of my budget, I'd probably
choose the $799 Compaq Presario 2286, which includes a Cyrix
333-MHz chip, 32MB RAM, a 4GB hard drive, a 32X CD-ROM, better
sound and graphics cards, JBL pro speakers and a 14-inch monitor.
It also comes with a better assortment of software, which is an
important consideration when evaluating low-cost PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The actual components are not as important as the support behind
them. The Compaq comes with a full year's warranty (parts and
labor), a year of toll-free technical support, and access to
Compaq's Internet support system.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some folks would not invite a personal computer into
their homes even if it was free. For the rest of us, these cheap
PCs are an attractive way to tap into the Internet ((asterisk)junk
mail, system crashes, virus hoaxes and bad jokes included).

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left in the world
really matter.
</P>
<P>
   And not one has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy king with scores of
mistresses, the self-described ``randy rabbit.'' In the fifties, he
became the father of Cambodian independence from France and the
slippery Cold War neutralist.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who
doubled as a film-maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead
of the genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's
gilded prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with slim
prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he was as good an actor as
Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable
role of his checkered career.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, history has cast him as the indispensable pacifier in a
country still traumatized by the Vietnam War and the subsequent
butchery of up to 2 million Cambodians in the ``killing fields'' of
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12 million Cambodians are frightened that without
the king to balance the factions, Cambodia's 20-year civil war
could burst out again. Others fear that Sihanouk's death would
remove the last roadblock to dictatorial rule by Cambodia's Prime
Minister Hun Sen, a former communist with close ties to Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have the king around with us,'' says former
government adviser Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of the Cambodian
Center for Conflict Resolution. ``But we have to ask ourselves how
to prepare for the day when he is not around. It is too easy every
time there is a problem just to turn to the king to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected that then-Prince Sihanouk would make so much
difference when the political parties agreed to allow him to
reclaim his throne in 1993, after United Nations-brokered
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was head of Cambodia's 800-year-old royal family and a
descendant of Cambodia's great 12th century god-king Jayavarman
VII, he was relegated by the new constitution to ``reign but not
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that handicap, Sihanouk had been beset with colon
cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and several minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six years, Sihanouk has emerged as a mixture
of Machiavellian politician and godlike Buddhist patriarch who is
summoned at the last moment by the squabbling politicians to save
his 12 million ``children'' from chaos. And for now, his cancer has
gone into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The king commands no armies. But when he enters a room, his
subjects kneel and try to touch him. When he wants to tame the
rival factions, he often does it by pulling one of his virtuoso
dramatic exits.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, King Sihanouk brought Prime Minister Hun Sen to heel
when he suddenly left his palace for the airport and caught a
commercial flight to Beijing, ostensibly for routine medical
treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stay in Cambodia with those republicans because they
are terribly unjust and barbarous to me,'' complained Sihanouk, in
a message to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a newspaper loyal to Hun Sen chastised Sihanouk,
saying if he couldn't be a full-time king, he should ``let someone
else be a real king for Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, Hun Sen backed down. ``We want to invite him
back,'' said the prime minister. ``The presence of the king is very
important for the continuity of the state . . . I beg the
newspapers not to criticize the king so harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Sihanouk's importance increased. Another round of
elections produced an uncomfortably narrow edge for Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party over the royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by
the king's 54-year-old eldest son Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, almost all ministries were paralyzed by
factional struggles, as the two main parties resisted a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of coups roiling the city, the king put out the word
that he was leaving Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen all but begged Sihanouk not to leave the country until a
government was formed. ``If the king leaves, we will miss legal
procedure,'' said a spokesman for Hun Sen. ``For example, who would
be the acting head of state if one were needed?''
</P>
<P>
   After a show of reluctance worthy of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
king canceled his departure and spent a month conferring with one
faction and then another. Finally he worked out the coalition: Hun
Sen would become the sole prime minister, and Prince Ranariddh
would become president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As the king approaches the 58th anniversary of his first
coronation this April, the Cambodian capital has been in the grip
of the latest royal intrigue: who will succeed Sihanouk?
</P>
<P>
   He does not have the power wielded by the late King Hussein of
Jordan, who just weeks before his death stunned his family and
nation by withdrawing the title of crown prince from his brother
and conferring it upon his son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh, who has commanded Cambodian troops and served
as co-prime minister in the early 1990s, is easily the best-known
of the princes. But he is not the consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sihanouk's current wife, Queen Monique, is widely suspected to
be collaborating with Prime Minister Hun Sen to arrange for the
eventual accession of the king's oldest son by Monique, Prince
Sihamoni, 46. Sihamoni _ a ballet dancer and U.N. official living
in France -- is viewed by many as a less contentious choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian constitution leaves it to the Council of the
Throne -- made up of Buddhist leaders and top parliamentary and
government figures -- to choose a male successor from the royal
family within one week of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   Though few believe it, King Sihanouk insists he won't be part of
the closing drama. ``I have no right to designate (or suggest the
designation of) my successor or a regent,'' he said.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ If life in this faded regal city were a
Russian novel, the heroine's tragic death would not have been in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   But the chronicle of Galina(CQ) Starovoitova's life is not
fiction. In the ugly world of Russian politics, there is no
storybook consequence to her murder last fall at the age of 52.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a political assassination last November,
the federal legislator from St. Petersburg was shot three times in
the head as she climbed the stairs of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was viewed by her allies as a martyr whose
shocking death would surely inspire some essential changes to
Russia's faulty experiment with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But three months later, her death is merely nother in the long
list of grisly murders that have distinguished the state of
post-Soviet affairs in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has not been solved; her political movement has not
been galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   With its crude democracy and volatile economy, Russia often is
compared to the American Wild West. If so, Starovoitova was viewed
by many as one of the white hats. She was an articulate and popular
campaigner for human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prime ministers and 10,000 mourners attended her
funeral. Some 1.8 million households in Russia dimmed their lights
on a night last November in her memory, according to the national
power company.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin and the nation's top leaders promised
that her killers would be caught and justice would be swift. A bank
offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and
conviction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals expressed outrage at Starovoitova's murder and promised
to work together to carry on her dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democrats are fighting among themselves,'' Ruslan Linkov,
a Starovoitova aide who was seriously wounded in the Nov. 20 gun
attack, said in a recent interview with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after these tragic events. A lot of people cannot
overcome their political and personal ambitions,'' he said from the
sanatorium outside St. Petersburg where he is convalescing.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made and the investigation into her death
has been clouded by charges that prosecutors are on a political
witch-hunt -- against Starovoitova's allies and journalists
covering the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound about the motive for her killing: published
reports in Russian newspapers that she had possessed incriminating
evidence linking St. Petersburg's incumbent governor Vladimir
Yakolev with organized crime; another report suggesting it was an
inside job by her own allies looking to manufacture a political
crisis; a third alleging that she had extensive business interests
and the murder may have been over money, not ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Many here, in St. Petersburg believe the truth will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested parties surrounding this crime are just clouding
the investigation,'' said Mikhail Ivanov, St. Petersburg editor of
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova emerged as a public figure in the energetic days of
perestroika, when the Soviet Union was compelled to relax its grip
on the people. She was pointedly anti-communist and worked to
protect dissidents and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of Yeltsin, she became a prominent legislator
in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best intentions of Russians who had hoped to find
meaning in Starovoitova's murder, the political void was too big
for one dead gentlewoman to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic movement, dynamic at the start of the decade when
the Soviet Union was crumbling, is now tainted by failure. It is
marked by years of Yeltsin's inability to produce a working
democracy, and by rabid profiteering and corruption that has
produced an elite class of wealthy Russians and masses of poorer
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains in the throes of an economic crisis that began
last summer, and still delivers more pain. Little wonder that
Russians believe, not in the promises of their politicians, but in
trying to feed and clothe themselves. In opinion polls, the
Communist Party continues to cling to its lead in Russia, though
with no more than 20 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russians wholly embrace neither communism nor democracy. There
are no dead martyrs in today's Russia, just as there are no living
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to raise this symbol, and there is no one like
that,'' said Leonid Kesselman, a democratic activist and political
analyst in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate in a country with a broken economy and the
elections of a new parliament and president scheduled to take place
in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the so-called ``young reformers'' fired last year from
government amid the country's economic turmoil -- including Boris
Nemtsov and former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko -- have formed a
loose political coalition that thus far has failed to gather
momentum. They seem to be vying for the relatively sparse
constituency of an existing minority party, the Yabloko headed by
Western-style liberal Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, had she lived, Starovoitova did not appear to
have a niche to fill in today's ambiguous political landscape,
though there was talk she may have been intending to run for the
regional governorship in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   While popular and prestigious, she had little real power. In
part, Starovoitova was hampered because she was a woman. Men still
hold most positions of power in Russian politics and in this
male-dominated society there is no popular sentiment for that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more of a public, than a real political figure. She
didn't affect anything . . . Galya(CQ) had authority over the
population, but she didn't have the authority to unite them,'' said
Kesselman.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Maybe because she was a women, maybe because she was
(seen as) naive -- today's condition requires a bit of cynicism.''

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ These are among the twists and turns in
King Norodom Sihanouk's life:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1941 _ The French-educated prince is placed on the
throne at the age of 18 by Vichy French colonial administrators who
considered him pliable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1940s _ Sihanouk takes his cousin Norodom(CQ) as his first
official wife and forms liaisons with scores of palace concubines.
``As king, we were not allowed to have more than one queen, but we
were allowed hundreds of mistresses,'' Sihanouk would later tell an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 _ Sihanouk divorces Norodom and takes up with Monique
Izzi, the daughter of a French-Italian father and a Cambodian
mother, whom he spotted in a beauty contest. Monique would become
his lifelong companion and is now his Queen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1953 _ Sihanouk travels to France and convinces a weakened
French government to grant Cambodia independence. He remains bitter
at the United States because the U.S. State Department gave him a
brush-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1955 _ The king dumbfounds Cambodia by abdicating in
favor of his father. Retaining his princely prerogatives as
``Citizen Sihanouk,'' he would rule Cambodia as an autocratic prime
minister denying Cambodians democratic rights, but giving them
nearly 15 years of peace, prosperity and international prestige.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1955 _ Resisting American pressure to join the Southeast
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Sihanouk becomes a Cold War
neutralist. He reaches world prominence at the Afro-Asian
nonaligned conference in Bandung and befriends Yugoslavia's Tito,
India's Nehru, Indonesia's Sukarno and China's Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1963 _ Angry at American intervention in South Vietnam,
Sihanouk calls on Cambodians to wear red arm bands in celebration
of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and the
deaths of two right-wing Southeast Asian dictators. The three will
``all meet in hell,'' Sihanouk exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1965 _ Bored with statecraft, Sihanouk throws himself into
cinematography, horseback riding and playing jazz saxophone. In the
next four years, he writes, directs, and produces nine feature
films, sometimes acting the romantic lead opposite his wife
Monique.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By 1966 _ Sihanouk makes a secret military alliance with North
Vietnam, under which the North Vietnamese win permission to station
troops inside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  October 1967 _ Sihanouk signals a warming with the United
States by receiving the widowed Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy in
Cambodia's famed temples at Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  January 1968 _ Sihanouk tells U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles
that he wouldn't protest if American troops crossed into Cambodia
in ``hot pursuit'' of enemy Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1969 _ With Sihanouk silent, President Nixon orders a
secret operation in which B-52s drop 100,000 tons of explosives on
Cambodian villages and Viet Cong strongholds in eastern Cambodia
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1970 _ Sihanouk is overthrown in a military coup led by
Cambodian Gen. Lon Nol. Though the right-wing general had tacit
approval from mid-level U.S. intelligence contacts, no clear
evidence has emerged to support Sihanouk's insistence that the CIA
overthrew him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1970 _ Sihanouk goes into exile as guest of the Chinese and
North Korean rulers. He serves as figurehead leader of an alliance
of pro-Sihanouk and pro-Chinese guerrillas fighting against the Lon
Nol government. Sihanouk nicknames the latter group the ``Khmer
Rouge'' (Red Cambodians).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1975 _ Ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge guerrillas seize the
Cambodian capitol Phnom Penh, ordering a mass evacuation for forced
labor in the countryside. A murderous reign of terror begins under
the leadership of Pol Pot in which up to 2 million people perish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1975 _ Pressured by the Chinese, the Pol Pot regime
allows Sihanouk to return to Cambodia as its nominal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1976 _ Upset by sights of destruction, Sihanouk tries to
resign and return to Beijing, but the Pol Pot regime refuses.
Instead, he and Monique begin three years of house arrest inside
the royal palace in Phnom Penh. Sihanouk later says that the Khmer
Rouge occupation led to the deaths of his five children, 14
grandchildren and four cousins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1979 _ Vietnamese invaders defeat Pol Pot, capture Phnom Penh
and free Sihanouk, who flies out to resume his exile in Beijing.
Sihanouk becomes head of a guerrilla coalition that includes
remnants of the defeated Khmer Rouge. The coalition, now backed
both by the United States and China, aims to end Vietnam's military
occupation of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1991 _ With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vietnamese
forces pull out of Cambodia. Cambodian factions agree to a United
Nations call for a cease-fire. The following month, Sihanouk
brokers a crucial agreement among the factions that leads to a
peace settlement, along with the decision to place him back on the
throne.

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left in the world
really matter.
</P>
<P>
   And not one has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy king with scores of
mistresses, the self-described ``randy rabbit.'' In the fifties, he
became the father of Cambodian independence from France and the
slippery Cold War neutralist.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who
doubled as a film-maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead
of the genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's
gilded prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with slim
prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he was as good an actor as
Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable
role of his checkered career.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, history has cast him as the indispensable pacifier in a
country still traumatized by the Vietnam War and the subsequent
butchery of up to 2 million Cambodians in the ``killing fields'' of
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12 million Cambodians are frightened that without
the king to balance the factions, Cambodia's 20-year civil war
could burst out again. Others fear that Sihanouk's death would
remove the last roadblock to dictatorial rule by Cambodia's Prime
Minister Hun Sen, a former communist with close ties to Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have the king around with us,'' says former
government adviser Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of the Cambodian
Center for Conflict Resolution. ``But we have to ask ourselves how
to prepare for the day when he is not around. It is too easy every
time there is a problem just to turn to the king to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected that then-Prince Sihanouk would make so much
difference when the political parties agreed to allow him to
reclaim his throne in 1993, after United Nations-brokered
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was head of Cambodia's 800-year-old royal family and a
descendant of Cambodia's great 12th century god-king Jayavarman
VII, he was relegated by the new constitution to ``reign but not
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that handicap, Sihanouk had been beset with colon
cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and several minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six years, Sihanouk has emerged as a mixture
of Machiavellian politician and godlike Buddhist patriarch who is
summoned at the last moment by the squabbling politicians to save
his 12 million ``children'' from chaos. And for now, his cancer has
gone into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The king commands no armies. But when he enters a room, his
subjects kneel and try to touch him. When he wants to tame the
rival factions, he often does it by pulling one of his virtuoso
dramatic exits.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, King Sihanouk brought Prime Minister Hun Sen to heel
when he suddenly left his palace for the airport and caught a
commercial flight to Beijing, ostensibly for routine medical
treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stay in Cambodia with those republicans because they
are terribly unjust and barbarous to me,'' complained Sihanouk, in
a message to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a newspaper loyal to Hun Sen chastised Sihanouk,
saying if he couldn't be a full-time king, he should ``let someone
else be a real king for Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, Hun Sen backed down. ``We want to invite him
back,'' said the prime minister. ``The presence of the king is very
important for the continuity of the state . . . I beg the
newspapers not to criticize the king so harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Sihanouk's importance increased. Another round of
elections produced an uncomfortably narrow edge for Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party over the royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by
the king's 54-year-old eldest son Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, almost all ministries were paralyzed by
factional struggles, as the two main parties resisted a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of coups roiling the city, the king put out the word
that he was leaving Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen all but begged Sihanouk not to leave the country until a
government was formed. ``If the king leaves, we will miss legal
procedure,'' said a spokesman for Hun Sen. ``For example, who would
be the acting head of state if one were needed?''
</P>
<P>
   After a show of reluctance worthy of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
king canceled his departure and spent a month conferring with one
faction and then another. Finally he worked out the coalition: Hun
Sen would become the sole prime minister, and Prince Ranariddh
would become president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As the king approaches the 58th anniversary of his first
coronation this April, the Cambodian capital has been in the grip
of the latest royal intrigue: who will succeed Sihanouk?
</P>
<P>
   He does not have the power wielded by the late King Hussein of
Jordan, who just weeks before his death stunned his family and
nation by withdrawing the title of crown prince from his brother
and conferring it upon his son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh, who has commanded Cambodian troops and served
as co-prime minister in the early 1990s, is easily the best-known
of the princes. But he is not the consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sihanouk's current wife, Queen Monique, is widely suspected to
be collaborating with Prime Minister Hun Sen to arrange for the
eventual accession of the king's oldest son by Monique, Prince
Sihamoni, 46. Sihamoni _ a ballet dancer and U.N. official living
in France -- is viewed by many as a less contentious choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian constitution leaves it to the Council of the
Throne -- made up of Buddhist leaders and top parliamentary and
government figures -- to choose a male successor from the royal
family within one week of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   Though few believe it, King Sihanouk insists he won't be part of
the closing drama. ``I have no right to designate (or suggest the
designation of) my successor or a regent,'' he said.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ If life in this faded regal city were a
Russian novel, the heroine's tragic death would not have been in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   But the chronicle of Galina(CQ) Starovoitova's life is not
fiction. In the ugly world of Russian politics, there is no
storybook consequence to her murder last fall at the age of 52.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a political assassination last November,
the federal legislator from St. Petersburg was shot three times in
the head as she climbed the stairs of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was viewed by her allies as a martyr whose
shocking death would surely inspire some essential changes to
Russia's faulty experiment with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But three months later, her death is merely another in the long
list of grisly murders that have distinguished the state of
post-Soviet affairs in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has not been solved; her political movement has not
been galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   With its crude democracy and volatile economy, Russia often is
compared to the American Wild West. If so, Starovoitova was viewed
by many as one of the white hats. She was an articulate and popular
campaigner for human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prime ministers and 10,000 mourners attended her
funeral. Some 1.8 million households in Russia dimmed their lights
on a night last November in her memory, according to the national
power company.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin and the nation's top leaders promised
that her killers would be caught and justice would be swift. A bank
offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and
conviction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals expressed outrage at Starovoitova's murder and promised
to work together to carry on her dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democrats are fighting among themselves,'' Ruslan Linkov,
a Starovoitova aide who was seriously wounded in the Nov. 20 gun
attack, said in a recent interview with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after these tragic events. A lot of people cannot
overcome their political and personal ambitions,'' he said from the
sanatorium outside St. Petersburg where he is convalescing.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made and the investigation into her death
has been clouded by charges that prosecutors are on a political
witch-hunt -- against Starovoitova's allies and journalists
covering the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound about the motive for her killing: published
reports in Russian newspapers that she had possessed incriminating
evidence linking St. Petersburg's incumbent governor Vladimir
Yakolev with organized crime; another report suggesting it was an
inside job by her own allies looking to manufacture a political
crisis; a third alleging that she had extensive business interests
and the murder may have been over money, not ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Many here, in St. Petersburg believe the truth will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested parties surrounding this crime are just clouding
the investigation,'' said Mikhail Ivanov, St. Petersburg editor of
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova emerged as a public figure in the energetic days of
perestroika, when the Soviet Union was compelled to relax its grip
on the people. She was pointedly anti-communist and worked to
protect dissidents and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of Yeltsin, she became a prominent legislator
in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best intentions of Russians who had hoped to find
meaning in Starovoitova's murder, the political void was too big
for one dead gentlewoman to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic movement, dynamic at the start of the decade when
the Soviet Union was crumbling, is now tainted by failure. It is
marked by years of Yeltsin's inability to produce a working
democracy, and by rabid profiteering and corruption that has
produced an elite class of wealthy Russians and masses of poorer
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains in the throes of an economic crisis that began
last summer, and still delivers more pain. Little wonder that
Russians believe, not in the promises of their politicians, but in
trying to feed and clothe themselves. In opinion polls, the
Communist Party continues to cling to its lead in Russia, though
with no more than 20 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russians wholly embrace neither communism nor democracy. There
are no dead martyrs in today's Russia, just as there are no living
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to raise this symbol, and there is no one like
that,'' said Leonid Kesselman, a democratic activist and political
analyst in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate in a country with a broken economy and the
elections of a new parliament and president scheduled to take place
in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the so-called ``young reformers'' fired last year from
government amid the country's economic turmoil -- including Boris
Nemtsov and former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko -- have formed a
loose political coalition that thus far has failed to gather
momentum. They seem to be vying for the relatively sparse
constituency of an existing minority party, the Yabloko headed by
Western-style liberal Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, had she lived, Starovoitova did not appear to
have a niche to fill in today's ambiguous political landscape,
though there was talk she may have been intending to run for the
regional governorship in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   While popular and prestigious, she had little real power. In
part, Starovoitova was hampered because she was a woman. Men still
hold most positions of power in Russian politics and in this
male-dominated society there is no popular sentiment for that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more of a public, than a real political figure. She
didn't affect anything . . . Galya(CQ) had authority over the
population, but she didn't have the authority to unite them,'' said
Kesselman.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Maybe because she was a women, maybe because she was
(seen as) naive -- today's condition requires a bit of cynicism.''

PORTRAYING BLACKS, FROM MOUNT'S PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies MOUNT-EXHIBIT) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ From where I sit _ white, middle-class,
female _ both the best and worst of William Sidney Mount's pictures
are representations of black people.
</P>
<P>
   I'd stand by that opinion under any circumstance. But right now,
I want to put it out there because it's Black History Month, and
the Amon Carter Museum is presenting the most comprehensive Mount
exhibition to date.
</P>
<P>
   Mount painted pictures of everyday life in the mid-19th century
_ in the North, before, during and after the Civil War. For him,
that meant representing African-Americans, as well as
European-Americans. His perspective is that of a white man who
opposed abolition. Nonetheless, almost all of Mount's pictures of
black men, women and children stand in direct opposition to typical
(for the times) representations of them as carefree, childlike
creatures or craven idiots.
</P>
<P>
   That said, his pictures consistently communicate the
marginalization of blacks in 19th-century Northern society. He does
not gloss over the situation, which makes his sensitive portrayals
all the more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   But, regardless of the reality of that world and Mount's
interpretation of said reality, those viewing his pictures today
will see them differently. There are two or three exceptions _
early works, crudely rendered _ that harshly caricature blacks and,
to a lesser degree, whites. Virtually anyone would agree with that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest are up for grabs, which is where each of us applies
our own experiences to viewing them.
</P>
<P>
   I look for whatever little positive evidence I can find of
racial good will.
</P>
<P>
   So I dwell endlessly on ``Eel Spearing at Setauket,'' in which a
black woman is joined in her labors by a white boy. Powerfully
built, she is the dominant figure in terms of the classical,
triangular composition. She also has strength, secure footing and
the requisite keen eye and quick reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this is one of the most beautiful, masterfully
composed pictures in American art. The sense of serenity, the
subtle layering of landscape and reflections of landscape, figures
in boats and other elements are magical and compel us to conclude
that this is an important subject, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Dance of the Haymakers.'' This is a
heartbreaking picture, because the little boy beating out the time
cannot be inside the barn with the white dancers and the white
musician. But there is another black youth, a girl, in the company
of a white girl: Both are viewing the scene from the hayloft,
sharing that perch with what seems to be comfortable intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mount pictures include individual portraits of black
musicians that are a far cry from minstrel-show caricature. Based
on Dutch baroque compositions, they sparkle with individuality,
warmth and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the ambiguity of the work considered Mount's
masterpiece _ ``Farmers Nooning,'' in which a black field hand has
fallen asleep after a morning's labor.
</P>
<P>
   He lies, vulnerable, in the midst of a handful of white men and
youths, while the youngest boy tickles his ear with a bit of hay.
Is the sleeping man the butt of a joke, unwitting entertainment for
his white companions? Is he a symbol of African-Americans being
cynically (in Mount's view) roused by abolitionists? Or is he among
friends who would do the same to any other of that company?
</P>
<P>
   We can learn as much as we can about this picture but, in the
long run, we read it according to our own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter presents other opportunities to interpret historical
black experience, however. It owns other pictures on that theme,
and two have been added as a coda to the Mount exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   One is Thomas Hovenden's ``Chloe and Sam'' (1882); the other is
Francis William Edmonds' ``The Flute'' (circa 1859). Both are by
white Northern artists who were influenced by Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chloe and Sam'' represents an elderly couple who were the
artist's neighbors in rural eastern Pennsylvania. This is a tender
depiction that, like the historic European works that inform it,
represents poverty almost as a state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   In its turn, ``The Flute,'' at first glance, reverses the
blacks-entertaining-whites cliche. Here, the flutist is a young
white man, while his audience is composed of two black boys. But
the boys are not taking this music as entertainment. Instead, it
seems to come to them almost as a revelation _ and their demeanor
is almost reverent. Arguably, then, the flutist plays a superior
role in this picture. But, even so, he is sharing directly and
without apparent condescension.
</P>
<P>
   But ... those are only my readings. They are not the final truth
about any of these pictures. Not that any final truth about art is
possible.

CHEF MARTIN YAN'S MISSION IS TO BRING THE EAST TO THE WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Yan is not a comedian, but he plays one on TV.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years and 1,500 episodes of ``Yan Can Cook,''
he has been telling jokes that verge on the lame. He makes faces
while dancing his cleaver over carrots and rehydrated black
mushrooms. Every show features at least one rat-tat-tat of knife
work that brings applause from his studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   In town to promote his new book, ``Martin Yan's Feast: The Best
of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay Books, $34.95), Yan is nothing like his TV
persona. He is intense and serious. He explains the dual
personality succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on a serious show like `60 Minutes,' they end with
something funny like Andy Rooney,'' Yan says.
</P>
<P>
   He's earned the right to find humor where he may.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Canton a year after the communist takeover; his
father's restaurant was nationalized, and his mother worked at a
grocery. ``We didn't have much food or much to eat,'' Yan says.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, he moved to Hong Kong, where he learned and slept in a
hotel kitchen until he was 18. That's when he emigrated.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration led to the University of California, Davis, where he
earned bachelor's and master's degrees in food science and got a
start on the road to teaching. To afford college, he taught cooking
classes for the university's extension service.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far different route than most food celebrities take.
Yan is quick to compliment trained chefs (Emeril Lagasse and
Wolfgang Puck get high marks), but he sayd that today's chefs too
often think of themselves as artists, without being grounded in the
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   And fusion cuisine (which Yan calls the cuisine of the future),
the palette for a lot of these young artists, can suffer from a
lack of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it incorrectly, it is confusion cuisine,'' Yan says.
``If you're making a French sauce, it's fine to add something like
oyster sauce, because it is velvety and savory. But it's not right
to use hoisin sauce in that sort of sauce, because it's coarse and
spicy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yan is quick to point up the strengths of Chinese cooking _
widely acknowledged as one of the world's great cuisines, along
with Italian and French.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 13 to 15 techniques in Chinese cooking. There's
stir-frying, deep-frying, pan-frying, braising, stewing, poaching,
barbecuing, smoking. In Peking duck, you use three different
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Yan lives in San Mateo, Calif., with his wife and 6 1/2-year-old
twin sons.
</P>
<P>
   He gives two months of his year to his TV show and cookbooks. He
records 52 shows in 13 days and calls it the ``fun part'' of his
year. The rest of his time is devoted to the moneymaking enterprise
of consulting with food companies such as Libbys, Tyson, Nestle and
Kikkoman. He is also a consultant for restaurant projects such as
the Empress Court in Caesars Palace. On that project, as well as
giving input on design and menu, he recruited and hired chefs from
locations as diverse as Hong Kong and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   For the TV audience, it may look like fun and games. To Martin
Yan, it's very serious business.

FORT WORTH'S MODERN PRESENTS A THOUGHTFUL EXHIBITION ON THEME
PARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The world is divided into two kinds of
people.
</P>
<P>
   People who love Disneyland because it's a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   And people who hate Disneyland because it's a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   Some people enjoy having their dreams set in concrete; other
people prefer that they remain ineffable.
</P>
<P>
   Some people enjoy flights of fancy that need little or no
stimulation. Others, however, like to have a jump start _ something
to look at, listen to or ride on that opens the door to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Both sorts will find something to appreciate in the Modern Art
Museum of Fort Worth's new exhibition, ``The Architecture of
Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks,'' on view now.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a companion display of photographs of Disney motifs
by Catherine Wagner, the exhibition features some 350 architectural
renderings, artists' scenic sketches and paintings _ all presented
in color-coded frames on gaily painted gallery walls variously
devoted to Tomorrowland, Frontierland, Main Street USA and other
sentimental evocations of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Architecture of Reassurance'' lays bare the intensely
personal vision and canny strategies that led to Disneyland, Disney
World and the theme parks in Japan and France. Viewing it, even
casual observers will appreciate the care and control that went
into conceiving and realizing those sites for managed amusement.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was organized by the prestigious Canadian Centre
for Architecture in Montreal, its first stop. It has shown at the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which presents cutting-edge
exhibitions of art and design; the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and
Cultural Center in Los Angeles, which presents a mix of shows on
art and design; and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   As the show's last stop, the Modern claims little or no
precedent for an exhibition on architecture and design _ much less
amusement park design. But it has reason to look at architecture,
what with its own new building set for construction in the new
millennium and the connections between Disney and the Bass family
of art patrons: The Basses own a big chunk of Disney, and their
profits from same have contributed much to Fort Worth's cultural
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Disney's utopian parks are international cultural
phenomena. They may not be works of fine art, but they are applied
art forms that have influenced fine art just as they have popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a masterful and visually compelling analysis
that, with the invaluable book accompanying it, becomes a sort of
curatorial work of installation art _ one that permits us to
analyze Disney and analyze the analysis of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Having made the above attempts at distanced observation,
however, I ought to file a disclaimer:
</P>
<P>
   I went to Disney World in the early '70s, and it gave me the
creeps. And, regardless of my kids, I will not go back again, if
only because I don't want to find out that it's not so bad, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   So, obviously, my fear and resentment of Disney have nothing to
do with working for a newspaper that was briefly owned by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   It's as simple as this: They can't make me smile if I don't want
to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it used to be much easier for me to boycott most of
Disney's offerings. We didn't have a TV set when I was little, the
stock of Disney toys was relatively limited, and the original
Disneyland didn't open until I was 2 years old (that was in 1955).
</P>
<P>
   The '50s, for whatever reasons, weren't good times for amusement
parks. But Walter Elias Disney somehow knew better: He would let
visitors be part of the spectacle, he would validate their taste
along the way and he would advertise Disneyland on ``Disney's
Wonderful World of Color.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he would communicate his own vision of how a
community should work. Understanding that, we realize that recent
Disney projects _ like the picturesque residential/retail community
of Celebration, Fla., and Disney's redesign of much of Times Square
_ are direct extensions of Uncle Walt's vision of the good life.
Which is to say small-town living, based on a boyhood in Marceline,
Mo., and a view of the big city as something both glamorous and
vaguely menacing.
</P>
<P>
   The show also places Disneyland into the historical context of
carnivals, architectural follies, pleasure gardens, world expos and
other types of constructed amusement and public spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   It tells us there are precedents for Disney theme parks _ even
if Disney products have become something altogether different, have
achieved a whole new level of unreality or reality, from the Tivoli
Gardens, various world's fairs, Henry Ford's Greenfield Village,
Coney Island, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the exhibition reflects just how refined Disney
parks always were to begin with and continue to become.
</P>
<P>
   It presents them as consumer products that have become
increasingly sophisticated in concept and design, whose fabrication
is state-of-the-art. We see how adroitly the product maintains a
certain level of traditional wholesomeness, even as it meets
diverse cultural expectations and reaffirms popular values.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is little, if any, apparent dumbing-down. Content is
intelligent and just sassy enough to avoid pedantry. Intentions,
apart from those to make money, are the best.
</P>
<P>
   The product is reliable _ or, as they say, reassuring _ be it an
entire environment or a ``Pooh'' video.
</P>
<P>
   And the merging of package and content is almost seamless.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we realize that the fantasy Disney makes and sells
has become real in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Not fake anything, but real Disney.

PAINTINGS THAT TELL THE STORIES OF A CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by MOUNT-BLACKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The great allure of 19th-century American
art stems as much from history as it does from aesthetics _
especially when it comes to an artist like William Sidney Mount,
the subject of the Amon Carter Museum's newest show.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent genre painter of his time, Mount was a skillful
technician who knew his art-historical sources. But Mount's forte
was his feel for the tellingly typical story, visually recounted.
So we look to Mount in search of America's past, seeking history in
its more intimate forms.
</P>
<P>
   And we need look no further than ``William Sidney Mount: Painter
of American Life,'' which presents a succinct selection of Mount's
paintings, preparatory drawings and printed reproductions. About 60
works are on view, including the artist's acknowledged masterpiece,
``Farmers Nooning'' (1836), and such important canvases as
``Bargaining for a Horse'' (1835), ``The Power of Music'' (1847),
``Dance of the Haymakers'' (1845) and ``Eel Spearing at Setauket''
(1845).
</P>
<P>
   The installation begins with early works that reflect Mount's
germination as a self-taught artist. If his rendering is somewhat
awkward, we nonetheless can see his knowledge of works by old
masters like Jacques-Louis David. In ``School Boys Quarreling''
(1830), for example, Mount's composition obviously borrows from
David's ``Oath of the Horatii'' (1784) _ an allusion that would
raise Mount in viewers' esteem, but also flatter viewers for
recognizing the art-historical source.
</P>
<P>
   David's painting is about morality, honor and self-sacrifice.
Mount's picture shows boys arguing about what likely is a trivial
matter. One has had his nose bloodied; his friends raise their
fists in his defense while the apparent aggressor glares at them
and points his finger accusingly _ and steps, literally, on the
toes of one of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The main figures are rendered convincingly, if not subtly,
although the worst caricaturing is reserved for a black youth, who
is looking on from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an underlying commentary, too, suggested by Mount's
inclusion of a book bearing the legend ``Ocular Analysis'' _ in
other words, visual perception as it applies to art. With this,
Mount addresses the ideological dispute between the upstart
National Academy of Design and the establishment American Academy
of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mount's other major canvases reflect a similar,
ideological perspective. This isn't really surprising from a
painter who lived in turbulent times _ when society was becoming
increasingly urbanized and industrialized, when political power was
transferring from an enlightened aristocracy to a more populist
base and when economic speculation would contribute to the Panic of
1837. And let's not forget the brewing tensions that led to the
Civil War in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   A crisper commentary _ simpler in composition and more obvious
in its symbolism _ comes in ``Politics of 1852 _ or, Who let down
the bar?'' (1853). Here, we see two men standing on either side of
a fence whose top two rails have been moved so that someone could
climb over. A poacher stands on the near side of the fence. On the
far side is the farmer who has caught wind of his activities. In an
attempt to deflect the farmer's anger, the poacher assumes a casual
pose and starts reading from the ``New York Herald.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Mount is referring to the 1852 presidential election, in
which the Democratic and Whig candidates agreed on a number of
major issues, thus lowering the bar on, or blurring, distinctions
between one party and the other. Too, the ``Herald'' was a notably
nonpartisan publication that straddled the fence on a number of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Mount also was interested in the apolitical theme of music,
as seen in his portraits of musicians and in his pictures of people
enjoying music _ listening to it, dancing to it and playing it on
fiddle and banjo.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mount's best-known and most beloved musical images is
``Dance of the Haymakers,'' in which two men dance a robust jig on
the floor of a sturdy barn.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is replete with the sort of detail that must have
delighted viewers then and certainly delights us today.
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of men and children look on as the pair jounces
about to a tune played by a fiddle player, with the beat drummed by
a boy against the barn's open door. Onlookers include a couple of
farm children peering down from the hayloft and a more urbanely
dressed man seated on an upturned crate with a jug placed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, farm tools have been cast aside and the ground is
littered with chaff. A short-haired brown dog gazes attentively at
a cat that is hiding in the building's rock foundation. And,
perhaps as a purely painterly conceit, Mount also has included a
nicely painted, Dutch-inspired still life that rests on the
building's threshold.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other, perhaps sobering, themes underlying the
celebration this picture represents. Life may or may not have been
simpler and happier back then.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Mount's ability to evoke a scene, to tell a story, is
sufficient reason to enjoy this and any number of other pictures on
view.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She's always organizing, but her house is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his running clothes all over the apartment. Her pumps
hog the closet floor.
</P>
<P>
   The children are having turf wars.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over space _ especially the lack of it _ can turn a
happy marriage into the bitter, chandelier-swinging finale from the
divorce film, ``War of the Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, on the eve of Valentine's Day, Ikea in
Elizabeth, N.J., brought together two psychotherapists and an
interior designer to help customers sort out, or maybe even shelve,
their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your thinking is too linear,'' Janice Simonsen, an Ikea
designer, advised a young woman who had split from her roommate.
Ms. Simonsen wasn't talking about the relationship but her approach
to closets. ``Most people can't see beyond that one rod in the back
of the closet,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   A more liberating way is to think how every surface can lead a
double life. Shoe bags on the inside of the door; hooks on the
outside. Boxes on the floor; baskets on top of them. ``You have to
think `subdivide' and the space suddenly expands with
possibilities,'' Ms. Simonsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Next in search of insight was a man who needed a clever way to
store his bicycle. (Wall racks are for Seinfeld wannabes.) Ms.
Simsonsen suggested hanging it from inside the door of a deep
closet. ``It's space most people forget about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the ready to counsel couples about how to cope with
relationship problems that may stem from cramped quarters were
Julie Iannone and Michele Mandel, psychotherapists from the Center
for Marital and Family Therapy in Manhattan. ``We'll help you find
space in your home and your relationships,'' Ms. Iannone called out
to a passer-by, who said he'd think about it but kept moving.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandel has had firsthand experience with confined spaces.
She lives in a two-bedroom Manhattan apartment with her husband and
15-month-old baby. Her daughter's bedroom doubles as an office for
her husband, a computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The two psychotherapists, in dark suits, were posted in front of
a model apartment chockablock with Ikea furnishings. They created
an eddy of calm as Saturday shoppers streamed by, driving heavily
loaded carts, as if they were cowboys rounding up unruly strays
from the herd.
</P>
<P>
   When Laurie Frey said that her youngest son, 1, was wrecking her
4-year-old son's Lego castles, leaving him angry and frustrated,
Ms. Simonsen suggested that she buy containers with little padlocks
``that'll make him feel more in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip and Patricia Harris agreed that it has gotten too
claustrophobic in their three-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, and
not because of their five children. Harris complained that his
wife's dresser is stacked to the ceiling with her clothing, and the
drawers under the bed can't be opened because her proliferating
shoe collection blocks them. With romantic _ and commercial _
intent, Ms. Simonsen suggested an Ikea closet with 16-inch doors.
Each one would hold two shoe bags. (Total: 24 pairs of shoes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you gain a lot more space if you just threw stuff
away?'' Harris asked. She disagreed. She was eyeing an extra-large
armoire.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with organization, not space, preoccupied David and
Michele Grimley and their two sons. ``Our real quest is to find
safe hooks, not the kind that, if you leaned back, they'd go
through your neck,'' said Michele Grimley as she admired
Shaker-style pegs installed around a child's bed. Lack of
organization, she continued, ``can affect the whole dynamic of a
relationship.'' Just having space isn't enough. ``When you can't
find something,'' she said, ``you get aggravated with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simonsen explained the basic principles of clever storage
(careful to suggest Ikea products).
</P>
<P>
   First rule: prioritize. A blanket bench at the foot of the bed
is best for storing blankets in frequent use, and as a place to put
on shoes. Woolly covers can be stored at a greater remove,
``reachable by a ladder once or twice a year,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Weisleder, 26, on his way home to Fort Lee, N.J., stopped
by for tips on how to keep things neat. ``My Mom always told me,
`Never have a girl in the apartment when it's a mess; it leaves a
bad impression,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Look for storage space where you wouldn't normally think to find
it, Ms. Simonsen advised. Halls that are three and a half feet wide
offer plenty of room for an etagere. Weisleder chatted with the
psychotherapists. He said his girlfriend, who lived in
Philadelphia, wasn't able to come up for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disappointed,'' Ms. Iannone said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much space,'' Ms. Mandel sighed.

HITS AND MISS OF A NET SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the wealth of information available on the Internet, the
answer to virtually any gardening question is available. But
finding the answers may not always be as easy or efficient as
simply picking up the phone or cruising to the local nursery.
</P>
<P>
   A search for a remedy for black spot, a common disease of roses,
provided a good example.
</P>
<P>
   The search engine Yahoo turned up 537 Web pages in that
category. The first reference had nothing to do with black spot on
roses. The second had tips from Garden Gate Magazine on pruning to
discourage black spot in midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   (After initial bloom, when Japanese beetles or black spot damage
becomes evident, the gardener prunes roses back by a third,
depriving the beetles of a food source and eliminating foliage
disfigured by black spot.)
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo search eventually provided a detailed description of
the disease with decent pictures, information on the disease cycle
and recommendations of cultivars with resistance and fungicides for
control.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was nothing obvious in those search results in the
way of a home remedy. A search of black spot at the Mining Co.
(www.miningco.com), yielded a home recipe: 1 tablespoon of baking
soda in a gallon of water, sprayed every few days until the spread
is halted.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Web site of the American Rose Society
(www.ars.org), which would actually have been a very good starting
point, resulted in a nice feature with a variety of information,
including a note that baking soda provided only ``moderate
control'' of black spot but appeared to be effective as a
preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
   When searching the Internet, rendering black spot as one word
seemed to work most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   For gardeners who have the time, forums can provide loads of
helpful firsthand experience that is generally entertaining as well
as informative.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly fascinating exchange on one forum not long ago
had to do with controlling deer. Human hair tied up in pantyhose
and hung in the garden was said to work, as well as fuzzy plants
like lambs' ear.
</P>
<P>
   Deer were also said to have been repelled by soap (in this case,
Irish Spring) nailed to stakes placed every few feet. Apparently
they didn't like the smell.
</P>
<P>
   One contributor noted that body odor also seemed to stifle them.
Another gardener suggested that an old shirt worn for a couple of
days and then placed in the garden effectively repelled deer,
raccoons, groundhogs and ``most other critters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the gardener continued, ``the black bears in
northern Wisconsin didn't think much of it. In fact, one of them
not only got the corn, he also left with one of my nightshirts.'' &QL;

<P>
   It seemed a simple undertaking to Dr. J.Matthew Hogendobler. He
wanted moss to use as a filler around landscaping stones near his
newly installed pool. He called his local newspaper for an expert,
who suggested three names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one returned my call,'' said Hogendobler, a dentist in
Virginia Beach, Va. ``I went on Ebay and _ bam _ moss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hogendobler did not bid on it. He sent an e-mail message to
the seller saying he needed lots of the stuff. His source quickly
complied, going beyond his wildest expectations. Not only did she
send a large box of moss (he thinks he paid $10), but she also
included a recipe for blending it with buttermilk and pouring it
into the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yards of it, and she sent me a recipe to hundredfold
it,'' he said. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would seem farther from digging in the garden than the
Internet. But the Internet _ with its wealth of information,
products and contacts _ has become fertile ground for gardeners.
Enthusiasts have begun linking up with sources around the world
(not to mention one another).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet has made gardening a lot easier,'' said
Larry Sommers, who is in charge of Internet publishing and strategy
at the National Gardening Association (www.garden.org), a nonprofit
group. ``You can get what you want, when you want, for where you
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent an estimated $26 billion on lawn and gardens in
1997, according to the most recent figures available through the
National Gardening Association. About 10 percent of that, $2.6
billion, came from direct-marketing sales; some 90 percent of that
would be from mail-order sales, with 10 percent thought to come
from Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet accounts for a small portion of the
overall gardening business, thousands of sites are vying for the
attention and dollars of consumers, changing the way established
companies are doing business. New alliances are striking up,
leading to more accessible and detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Escape (www.garden.com), a leading online retailer, took
nearly a year to build a service that allows customers to plug in
their ZIP codes to establish what gardening zones they live in,
information that can be used to select appropriate plants.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Escape, which is in the process of changing its name to
Garden.com, helped develop the Horticulture magazine site and
provides services to it. The company's chat group reaches well
beyond the United States, including a group of avid Canadian
gardeners who cannot even buy plants from the company because of
quarantine regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies, once limited to publishing annual catalogs, have
Web sites packed with features about their products and
regionalized tips; they also answer consumers' questions. The
W.Atlee Burpee seed company (www.burpee.com), for example, includes
a feature with Martha Stewart in its test gardens, picking her
favorite plants (including, in case you were wondering, the African
Queen, a yellow impatiens that tolerates deep or partial shade),
and the company has aligned itself with the National Gardening
Association to get questions answered within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have excellent content, well-displayed and
interesting products,'' said Don Zeidler, direct marketing manager
at the seed company, which is more than 120 years old.
</P>
<P>
   From details on how to grow the rarest orchid to the spore
biology of ferns, the Web can help with a number of gardening
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of information available,''
Sommers said. The sources include ``university databases, libraries
that are phenomenal and only previously made available to
researchers and students _ now that's at the tip of your fingers,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The number and variety of products being sold on the Web are
also growing. A quick spin through sites could easily leave a
consumer wondering whether all paths lead to something to buy. The
Virtual Garden (www.vg.com), a popular site that provides a summary
of what many gardening magazines are featuring, includes the
Time-Life Plant Encyclopedia. If users click on Marketplace, they
wind up at Garden Escape, which recently bought the Virtual Garden
site.
</P>
<P>
   Such tightly knit relationships, and the nature of the Internet
itself, can make it difficult to tell when information is being
provided and when a sales pitch is being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``In print, you've got the separation of church and state,''
said Sommers, referring to the delineation between advertising and
editorial copy. ``On the Internet, you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He said customers needed to remember that what they were really
doing was mail-order buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a credible source,'' he said. ``Look for
good guarantees and secure transactions. Is the guarantee good
enough without mailing back the plant at your expense?''
</P>
<P>
   He added that gardeners should also remember that the size of a
plant might be different than what they are used to buying at a
nursery. ``A bare-root tree or shrub might look like a twig,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seem undaunted by the new medium. While overall
figures on growth were unavailable, Garden Escape, a privately held
company based in Austin, Texas, that put up its Web site in March
1996, has seen its business increase about 300 percent a year, said
Eileen Caetano-Isola, director of public relations for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Killough, a master gardener who started using the
Internet for information she could not find in books, graduated to
selling seeds. Ms. Killough said she would make enough money
selling seeds this year to help finance a trip to the Chelsea
Flower Show in England. She marveled at what people would buy and
the amounts they were willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had packets of milkweed seed sell for $35,'' said Ms.
Killough, who lives near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Killough, who works at a local nursery, said it was hard
to imagine that the Internet could ever replace a trip to the
garden center.
</P>
<P>
   The draw that gardeners feel to be out among plants on a sunny
day ``is just something that's imbedded,'' she said. Also, it is
easier to diagnose a problem or determine what will work in an area
by looking at real plants, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature in the leaf may be stiff competition, but online
garden companies are making it easier to determine what will work
by allowing gardeners to plug in details about their gardens _ like
soil and light conditions _ and what they want to accomplish and
then use that information in their shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl M. Trine, who put up Garden Net (www.gardennet.com) in
1994 in an effort to provide information to gardeners and make
money by referring them to commercial sources, said she believed
that the Internet was attracting younger people to gardening as a
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 20-somethings,'' she said. ``In terms of the
information revolution, it's actually bringing in the next
generation of gardeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Baer, a graphics supervisor for an investment bank who
just turned 30, relied heavily on the Internet when he landscaped
the backyard of his home in Jersey City. With no car and no nearby
garden center, he had little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ZIP code feature of Garden Escape, he found out the
gardening zone he was in. Then he used resources that suggested
appropriate plants based on factors like desired colors, blooming
time and the conditions where the plant will live (shade, sun,
etc).
</P>
<P>
   After he found a plant he liked, he clicked on a feature that
suggested companion plants, plants that would work well with the
one he was selecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to have color from the first snowdrops all the way
through when the last coneflower falls in the fall,'' he said. He
planted the garden last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting to see if it works,'' he said. ``It's either going
to be really tacky or a Crayola box.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogendobler said that although basic sites had helped him tackle
his landscaping in a ``logical and correct fashion,'' his appetite
for more detailed information and less common plants had led him to
move deeper into the Internet, reaching growers like L.S. Layman in
South Carolina, known as Smoky on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Layman, a retiree who sold a resort and went in search of a
quieter life, finds herself drawn into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she and her husband moved to a new house on five acres
with four peach trees. She wanted to dress it up and turned first
to perennials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long until she was on the Internet exchanging seeds
and information with people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times I would be out working with something and I would
come in, get on the Internet and ask, `How do you work with this
seed?''' she said. There were so many bulletin boards and search
engines that she always got her question answered.
</P>
<P>
   Simple suggestions she gets on line open doors. ``I probably
have 90 roses now, and that's because I met someone in a chat room
that was a real rose person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That person piqued her interest with a suggestion that a
gardener planting a rose should put a banana peel in the hole with
the plant. Ms. Layman took the tip and made it her own: she keeps
her banana peels in the freezer and mixes them with a little water
in the blender when she is ready to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just funny the little things that people say they do and
you try, leading you to new things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Layman has cultivated the Internet with much the same
enthusiasm she has for her garden, which started on a five-acre
plot and grew by five acres to accommodate her needs. She has an
active life on Ebay selling and trading dozens of plants a week.
She has put up her own Web site
(www.stormpointe.com/smoky/home.html), where she lists her flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to take a lot of work,'' she said. She already
receives 25 to 30 e-mail messages a day, but she does not seem to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet made me a gardener,'' she said. Without that, she
said, ``I would never even have known about all these different and
unusual plants.''

POST-IMPEACHMENT THOUGHT: AMERICA FINDS LEADERSHIP WHEN NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We Americans have been very fortunate. Whenever we
have needed strong, enlightened leadership to steer the republic
safely through perilous seas, we have found it.
</P>
<P>
   That was true when George Washington, John Adams, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison, Ben Franklin and Alexander Hamilton
molded 13 small colonies on the Atlantic seaboard into a fledging
nation. We hope that will be true today in the wake of the divisive
impeachment trial of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders who have come to the fore in time of need have not
always been brilliant, but they have been courageous and dedicated.
They may not all have been presidential greats, but they have
served their country well.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard Nixon resigned a quarter century ago, the job of
healing the nation's post-Watergate wounds fell to Gerald Ford, a
decent man who performed the task with the skill of a political
professional who also happens to be a humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the current scandal, the healer could be the
man who ignited the impeachment crisis and then fueled it with
deceptive declarations for a year. When Clinton rode out the storm
and retained the presidency, the duty of binding the lesions left
by bitter debate and angry denunciations fell to the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the major differences between the scandal that
ended Nixon's presidency and the one that eroded Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton apologized for his actions and declared that we have
entered a time for reconciliation and renewal. But if he is to
leave a legacy other than that of his impeachment trial, he must do
as much as he can in less that two years to benefit the American
people, safeguard the republic and demonstrate that he can be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   He must be diligent in seeking the bipartisan cooperation of
Congress on strengthening Social Security, Medicare, the
educational system and our national security and on such other
vital matters as economic prosperity and tax relief for the working
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   He would only compound his troubles and further weaken his
presidency if he were to seek revenge against those on Capitol Hill
who believed his indiscretions fit the high-crimes-and-misdemeanors
criteria established by the Constitution for removing a president
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton can achieve those objectives is uncertain. We
could experience nearly two years of stalemate until a new
president is sworn in _ or a period of unprecedented accomplishment
by a Democratic White House and a Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although two thirds of the people continue to approve Clinton's
presidential performance, a Gallup Poll last week showed that 59
percent believe he has lowered the stature of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who dominate Capitol Hill have little to crow
about. Having watched the public reject their efforts to unseat
Clinton, they cannot afford to be seen as mere obstructionists who
simply oppose Clinton's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and the current Congress cannot lead America out of
its morass, then in 2000 we will elect a new president and a new
Congress that may do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the birth of the republic 210 years ago, the American people
knew exactly the leader they wanted: Washington, a stalwart soldier
and statesman who had guided them to military victory against the
forces of George III and presided over the 1787 convention that
wrote the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1800 the people elected Jefferson, an illustrious visionary
and author of the Declaration of Independence who doubled the size
of the young nation with the Louisiana Purchase and dispatched
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on a monumental expedition of
discovery up the Missouri River, across the Rocky Mountains and
down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With westward expansion, people on the frontier wanted a
president who would fight for their interests. They found him in a
colorful, fiery Tennessean named Andrew Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   From Jackson's presidency, which ended in 1837, to the beginning
of the Civil War, the republic did not have strong presidents. But
in 1860, the people elected Abraham Lincoln, a lanky lawyer from
Illinois, a courageous humanitarian who possessed a wealth of humor
and a determination to preserve the union.
</P>
<P>
   The period from the assassination of Lincoln in 1865 to the
beginning of the 20th century was another fallow time for
presidential leadership. But in 1901, after the assassination of
William McKinley, a 42-year-old force of nature named Theodore
Roosevelt burst upon the American scene. He introduced much-needed
reforms to benefit the common people rather than the rich and
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Since Roosevelt, we have had in this century several recessions
and one Great Depression; wars in Europe, the Pacific, Korea,
Vietnam and the Persian Gulf; at least three major scandals that
reached into the White House, and various other crises that
demanded able leadership. For the most part, we have found it when
we needed it or we have replaced a failed leader with a good one.
</P>
<P>
   And we will do so again.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, 1974, when he picked up the presidential torch that
had fallen from Nixon's hands, Gerald Ford told the American people
that ``our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works.
Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the
people rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words are worth remembering at this time of transition
even for those who disagree with the Senate's exoneration of
Clinton.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Typing class is one of those dreaded high-school rituals,
ranking right up there with (ugh) physical education class. If I
had only had a nice computer program back then to teach me, instead
of the bored teacher who was saddled with me, I might have actually
learned to type.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I spent many fruitless hours banging away at an IBM
Selectric, hoping that some of the letters would be right.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 17 years ago. Today's typing student has a wide
variety of engaging software to choose from. With most programs,
you stick to the old tried-and-true method of typing instruction:
learn the home row keys (a, s, d, f, j, k, l, ;) and branch out
from there until your fingers are trained to find all the keys.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of technology allows the computer to respond directly
to the student's keystrokes and analyze them, in the ultimate
one-on-one tutorial. In many cases, users can even adjust the
program's skill level for a custom fit. Instead of pounding out
coma-inducing practice texts about cork trees in Algeria from
oversized typing manuals, students can spice up their lessons with
audio, video and electronic games.
</P>
<P>
   Now that computers are ubiquitous, it's not just secretaries and
writers who need to know how to use a keyboard. Typing as a
professional skill has been around for more than 100 years, and it
was even enthusiastically adopted by Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Although some scholars dispute his recollections, Twain himself
recalled writing ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' on his trusty
Remington typewriter and is credited with inventing the typed,
double-spaced manuscript format still in use in the editorial
world.
</P>
<P>
   Early examples of Twain's practice pages show them to be riddled
with typos. To be fair, however, there wasn't a lot of typing
instruction to be had at the time. Imagine what Twain could have
done with an iMac and a copy of Mavis Beacon.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the Great Paradoxes of History file: the first
successful typing machine in America _ a device intended to make
writing faster and more efficient _ used a keyboard layout that
made typists slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Although scholars debate the motivations behind this layout,
called the Qwerty keyboard for the letters above the left hand when
it is on the home keys, the popular legend remains: In 1868,
Christopher Latham Sholes, along with his friends Carlos Glidden
and S.W. Soule, patented an early version of what would become the
Type-Writer a few years later. But he couldn't stop the keys from
jamming if they were hit too rapidly in succession.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was not possible to fix this internal hardware glitch,
the story goes, Sholes replaced the sensible alphabetic arrangement
of the keys with the now-famous (and infamous) Qwerty keyboard. By
scattering commonly used letters around the keyboard, Sholes
effectively slowed down even the speediest typists of the late 19th
century. But by eliminating jammed keys, the new layout actually
speeded up the overall typing process.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the hunt-and-peck method (still used by
many today), there was no prescribed typing method for the early
machines. Typists were expected to look at the keys to see what
they were typing, and two fingers were thought to be perfectly
adequate (four fingers for overachievers) to work the Type-Writer.
</P>
<P>
   The first textbook to outline a typing method, ``Handbook of
Instruction for the Type-Writer'' by Edward F. Underhill, was
published in 1880. But few people bought the 16-page handbook,
preferring instead to take their typing advice straight from the
Bible: Seek and ye shall find.
</P>
<P>
   The Dvorak keyboard, patented in 1932 by August Dvorak and W.L.
Dealey, provided a more sensible arrangement of keys that let 70
percent of the typing take place in the home row. Perhaps Dvorak
just made too much sense for most people. The Qwerty keyboard, in
its most basic form, has survived to this day and is the standard
for the English-typing world. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Typing Instructor Deluxe, Version 9 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Individual Software; $29.95; Windows 3.1 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to get the attention of wandering minds, Typing
Instructor takes the somewhat dry notion of typing lessons and
bends the practice into a globe-trotting theme. Upon starting the
software, the student enters the Main Terminal of a virtual
airport, and the travel motif continues throughout the program.
</P>
<P>
   You set your skill level in the Typing Passport, get your
Boarding Pass to start your lessons and gradually earn stamps for
it by passing typing tests that feature pictures of different
countries along with the test text.
</P>
<P>
   Students can choose from more than 20 musical styles _ like
Dixieland, Latin, Broadway, funk, dance and rock _ for the music
playing in the background as the typing lessons commence.
Fortunately, much of it sounds like that airy pseudojazz often
heard in supermarkets, so the impulse to quit the program and go
out to a club is quashed.
</P>
<P>
   The travel backdrop of this program has been well thought out
and will probably appeal to adult students. The theme is carried
out consistently. A digital Magazine Rack, much like those found in
airports, holds typing practice material from more than 300 books,
articles and short stories to keep the student engaged in the
routine of practicing.
</P>
<P>
   No typing program is complete these days without games to entice
students to hone their emerging skills through video combat. With
seven action games, Typing Instructor plays primarily to the male
gaming crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A mountain-biking contest called Xtreme Typing is designed to
improve typing speed, and Tomb Typer encourages accuracy, but _
sorry, boys _ there's no Lara Croft here. You might, however,
actually learn to type. &QL;

   Disney's Adventures In Typing With Timon And Pumbaa &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Disney Interactive; $19.95; Windows 95 and later, and Power
Macintosh.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where are we going?'' the warthog asks his buddy, Timon the
meerkat, in the opening cartoon in Disney's Adventures in Typing
With Timon and Pumbaa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going on an adventure, Pumbaa,'' the meerkat replies.
``An adventure to broaden our horizons!''
</P>
<P>
   Broadening a young computer user's horizons by building keyboard
proficiency is the goal of this CD-ROM. The program uses three
popular characters from Disney's 1994 animated film ``The Lion
King'' _ Timon, Pumbaa and Rafiki the baboon _ to teach children
how to type.
</P>
<P>
   The program relies on a nice framing device to lure kids to the
keyboard. After Timon and Pumbaa tell Rafiki that they plan to go
on a jungle adventure, the wise old baboon realizes that the two
hapless friends will most likely get into trouble and will need a
little help to get back home again. With that, Rafiki presents the
user with a keyboard made from leaves and rocks, and the lessons
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The program is paced for young students. With on-screen
animations, the first lesson focuses on correct posture and hand
positions on the keyboard, as well as half of the home-row keys.
Lesson 2 picks up the rest of the home row.
</P>
<P>
   As the student works through the drills, the key combinations
gradually move from simple key repetitions (like ddd, fff, lll,
aaa, sss) to simple words (like sad, dad, falls) that help the user
see where all this is going. The rest of the keyboard is learned
quickly in subsequent lessons and then speed and precision are
emphasized.

   The program offers five games in which the student may aid Timon
and Pumbaa with typing. There's a Smack-a-Bug game in which little
insects with letters on their backs pop out of the ground to insult
the warthog, and the student can help the frustrated pig exact his
revenge by typing the proper letter. By completing the games and
the lessons, the student helps Timon and Pumbaa return home safely.
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 animated lessons from the old baboon in the
program. Lesson-by-lesson progress reports showing words-per-minute
typing speed as well as typing accuracy are available by clicking
on a program icons. The child can print out an award certificate at
the end of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest selling point for this program is the fact
that it carries over much of the look of the ``Lion King'' movie,
not to mention the brand name. Adventures in Typing has much of the
wisecracking attitude of the film, and the animation is definitely
Disney. &QL;

<P>
   Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, Version 9 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Mindscape; $39.95; Windows 3.1 and later, and Macintosh.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You will master the keys by typing them repeatedly,'' the
teacher commands.
</P>
<P>
   She's not kidding. Mavis Beacon, the grande dame of
instructional typing software, rules her classroom with a firm yet
guiding hand. Keyboard drills are presented and repeated until the
student passes muster, but Mavis forgives early mistakes. ``This is
the hard part,'' she says. ``Keep going and soon it will get easier
_ I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is perhaps the most popular product
in the category, with more than six million copies sold since the
program's debut in 1987. Mavis Beacon Version 9 was released last
fall; it combines snazzy 3-D graphics and the calming voice of
Mavis with responsive, flexible programming that helps the user and
the software adapt to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Beacon can analyze a student's keystrokes and spot problem
areas, like transition rates between keys, shift-key errors and
doubled keys.
</P>
<P>
   The program is set in the Mavis Beacon Typing Institute, which
you see upon starting the software. Mavis greets you at the desk
and offers a variety of options.
</P>
<P>
   You can proceed directly to the lessons or visit some other
areas of Mavis' world. There's a Media Center, which has a Video
Viewer to demonstrate proper posture, typing techniques and office
ergonomics in video clips. A Practice Area lets the user select
different kinds of texts, including fiction and history, for a
keyboard workout.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis' Game Hallway offers eight games that are designed to
improve speed, proficiency and typing rhythm. The animated Shark
Attack, Penguin Crossing and Creature Lab games aim to strengthen
speed and accuracy by having the student rapidly type words as part
of the play. The Playing Ragtime game has students type letters to
the beat of a ticking metronome on an old piano.
</P>
<P>
   The student must repeat a drill to Mavis' satisfaction or there
is no moving on. Lessons can be modified to the user's tastes. For
example, users can import custom text that they would like to
practice on and can choose different types of music to type by.
</P>
<P>
   One warning: in the Country category, most of the tunes sound
like the schmaltzy 1970s-era Nashville Sound as played on a Kimball
Swinger Organ. The Classical category, however, provides quite nice
music to type by.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Beacon isn't the flashiest typing program on the block
anymore. But even though Mavis is a creation of the Mindscape
company, her no-nonsense approach, familiar personality and
diligent, wide-ranging focus on all aspects of typing (plus an
extensive user's guide included with the CD-ROM) make her a most
comfortable teacher _ which is just what you want. &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   Typing Tutor '99 Platinum Edition &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure/Simon &AMP; Schuster; $49.99; Windows 3.1 and
later, and Power Macintosh.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stressing accuracy from every direction, the Platinum edition of
Typing Tutor '99 comes not only with the program CD-ROM but also
includes another disk, called 1001 Essential Letters, and a
paperback dictionary and thesaurus set. In addition to all this,
Typing Tutor provides something called the CETM Lesson Module.
</P>
<P>
   Although the title sounds like something from NASA's astronaut
school, you soon find out that CETM stands for Conceptual Effects
Typing Method. It is a series of exercises that dispenses with the
home-row methodology in favor of introducing the student to the
keyboard layout finger by finger.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the drill for the Left Little Finger has a series
of q-a-z combinations repeated over and over to help foster skill
memory. At first, CETM seems a little weird and annoying, but as
the 10 fingers learn their motor skills, it begins to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   The main Typing Tutor program, however, uses the traditional
method of learning the keyboard. The program will first ask you how
many words per minute you want to be able to type; after each
lesson, bar charts will show you how accurate you were in striking
each particular key and how fast you typed.
</P>
<P>
   Typing Tutor '99 includes only a few games, the most memorable
being Letter Invaders, which is based on Space Invaders, an arcade
staple.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other typing applications, the program contains a
video area. But instead of showing video clips of proper ergonomic
behavior, as the Mavis Beacon program does, Typing Tutor '99 lets
the student select a category like Newsreels or Sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsreels category contains digitized clips from historical
films, like ``Statehood for Alaska'' and ``F.D.R. Asks for War
Aid.'' The program displays a portion of practice text related to
the video clip, and once the student has completed the drill, the
video clip plays.
</P>
<P>
   Typing Tutor '99 is thorough and has quite a lot going for it.
The software will read aloud text passages so the user can practice
taking dictation, and it offers a Library List that provides
summaries and additional information on texts used as exercise
material.
</P>
<P>
   These features are found in the Bookshelf area, which mainly
serves to let students select famous literary works as practice
texts (as do most of the other programs tested). A notable
selection for typing software _ in a delightful sense of cosmic
justice _ is Mark Twain's ``Adventures of Tom Sawyer.''

<P>
   According to the American Medical Association, carbon monoxide
poisoning is one of the leading causes of accidental deaths in the
United States. Each year, there are more than 10,000 cases of
reported health injuries attributed to carbon monoxide exposure.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter months, the incidence of carbon monoxide
poisoning rises because people remain indoors with the windows
closed. Since carbon monoxide is produced by incomplete combustion
of carbon-based fuels (natural gas, heating oils, gasoline, wood,
kerosene), any malfunction in a heating or venting system can allow
this deadly gas to enter into the home environment.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims are not even aware when they are exposed to carbon
monoxide because it is a colorless, odorless gas, and the early
stages of carbon monoxide poisoning produce flu-like symptoms:
headaches, fatigue, nausea and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in preventing carbon monoxide poisoning in the
home is to make sure that the heating system gets an annual tune-up
by a qualified heating specialist. The tune-up should include
burner cleaning and adjustment and a carbon monoxide test.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most efficient burners will produce some carbon
monoxide, but this usually presents no health hazard because the
combustion gases are expelled outside through the exhaust system.
Most home exhaust systems, however, rely on the natural buoyancy of
hot air to pull the exhaust gases outside; no fans are involved.
</P>
<P>
   The air that is expelled must be replaced by fresh air from the
outside. Sometimes, in newer homes, problems develop because the
structures are so tight that replacement air cannot enter. This
causes the combustion gases to build up in the system and
eventually drift into the living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is exacerbated if the house is fitted with exhaust
fans in the bathroom and over the stove. A clothes dryer will also
function like an exhaust fan when it is running. These fans force
air out of the house, and if fresh replacement air is not pulled in
from the outside, the fans will suck the combustion gases from the
heating vent system back into the house. This condition is known as
``backdrafting.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbon monoxide can also seep into the house through an attached
garage when an automobile is warming up on a cold morning. Safety
experts point out that in 1992 more than 45 percent of the
accidental carbon monoxide deaths were the result of auto exhausts
entering the home through the garage. Other sources of carbon
monoxide are a malfunctioning kitchen gas range, a smoldering fire
in the fireplace and a cracked flue in the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Because carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless and tasteless, it
may go undetected even when there are high concentrations in the
air. You can protect your family by installing carbon monoxide
detectors in the house. These inexpensive devices (most sell for
less than $60) are designed to sound an alarm when the carbon
monoxide concentration becomes dangerously high (400 ppm for 15
minutes) or when low levels persist for more than 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Detectors are available as battery-operated models or plug-in
units. The plug-in units connect to a standard electrical outlet.
An obvious drawback is that they are useless in the event of a
power failure _ which is when people are most likely to turn to
backup sources like woodstoves and kerosene heaters, both potential
sources of carbon monoxide. Battery-operated units are not affected
by power failures, but you must replace the batteries periodically.
The best line of defense is install both types in your home.
</P>
<P>
   When purchasing a carbon monoxide detector, look for the
Underwriters Laboratory Logo (UL) to make sure the model meets the
official standard. Other important features include indicator
lights: one that shows the unit is receiving power, and another
light that glows when the alarm sounds. Battery- operated units
should have an indicator light to show when the battery is weak.
Another important feature is a test and reset button, so used to
make sure the unit is functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   Install the detectors where they can be heard from the bedrooms
even with the doors closed. For more complete protection, install
detectors near potential sources of carbon monoxide _ the furnace,
the kitchen range, the fireplace and the garage. Do not, however,
install the detectors within 15 feet of fuel-burning appliances,
and do not install them in potentially humid areas like the
bathroom or laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors should not be
installed on the ceiling. Instead they should be mounted on a wall
at eye level (some companies offer table-top detectors), so you
will notice and test them weekly. Be sure to carefully read the
manufacturer's instructions so you can clean and maintain the
detector properly. &QL;

 &HT;    Third time may not be a charm for bill to limit debate on
permits
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Janet Jacobs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ For the third time in as many legislative
sessions in Texas, a bill being proposed to cut down on the amount
of public debate on permits is taking heat.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 801 would take the public hearings out of the
environmental permitting process, and though it does provide for
input, it is not considered a positive change by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is unnecessary, according to legislators
sponsoring the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means does it outlaw public participation,'' said Mike
Sizemore, office manager for state Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria.
Armbrister is expected to sponsor the bill if it makes it to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will change the way permits are opposed, but it won't
make protests impossible, according to state Rep. D.R. ``Tom''
Uher, D-Bay City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a streamlined process to review permits and have public
input,'' Uher said. ``In my opinion, this opens up the door for
more people to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Uher, the proposed bill would allow people
statewide to comment in writing on any permit, but it will
eliminate the public hearing process now used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide for that if they send a comment; it's part of the
record,'' he said. ``We encourage the agency to review the comments
as they come in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't have the adversarial system we have now, but we will
have a similar system because people will be able to take
depositions, and if someone is trying to be cute, they're going to
be caught at it,'' Uher said.
</P>
<P>
   Uher said the proposed system is the same one used by the
Environmental Protection Agency and many other states.
</P>
<P>
   It could dramatically cut down on the length of the permitting
process, according to officials with TNRCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contested case hearings, if eliminated, will shorten it by
several months,'' said Terry Hadley, spokesman for TNRCC.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an average permit for wastewater or air emissions
takes several months, Hadley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen everything from 30 days to extremes of several
years in terms of low-level radioactive waste,'' Hadley said. ``In
general terms, it is a several-months process.''
</P>
<P>
   If the process is cut down, it shouldn't be a free ride,
according to state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff was a sponsor of a similar bill in the last session, but
he dropped his support of the bill when residents complained that
it would give local industries too much of an advantage in the
permitting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we probably do need to streamline the process,''
Ratliff said. ``I don't know if this is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we do make it easier to get a permit, we ought to
make it a lot tougher when they are violated,'' Ratliff added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like, over the years, we've gotten to the point
that anybody who applies gets a permit. And the permit may require
a lot of things, but once the permit is issued, we have a lot of
people who just sort of routinely violate the permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no teeth in the enforcement,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding teeth to the enforcement should include heavier fines or
even rescinding permits, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much problem streamlining the process, but if
we're going to do that, I think we need to make sure that if we do
that, we need to make sure those people who routinely violate the
process pay for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's environmental office does have some problems with
that, Hadley said, but he said the TNRCC does levy fines on
industries that violate permits and can take away permits issued.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, a maximum of $10,000 per day per violation
can be fined. The TNRCC has levied fines that heavy in a few cases,
Hadley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest penalty was around $2 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking away permits is certainly a lengthy process, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is a compliance issue,'' Hadley
said. ``The compliance issue should be a concern for everybody.''

OFFICIALS RACE Y2K CLOCK TO AVERT DISASTER AT PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the nation's petrochemical capital, Houston faces a
unique array of potential problems, ranging from the catastrophic
to the merely troublesome, because oil and chemical plants are
controlled with thousands of computer chips that may be vulnerable
to the much-publicized Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are racing the clock to identify and correct
plant systems containing date-sensitive chips that won't read 2000
properly. At the same time, companies are reviewing and refining
their contingency plans in case they don't find all the problem
chips and the computer glitch causes an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   With a flood of recent reports on the Y2K bug's threat in other
computerized areas of modern life, the additional specter of fires,
explosions and toxic clouds at petrochemical plants might seem like
premillennial jitters or technophobia.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the warnings are coming from people and
groups more noted for their expertise in the industry's complex
workings than for any tendency toward doomsaying, and who are
taking care to distinguish their concern from alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hoax,'' said Ray Skinner, area director of the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Houston South
office. ``It's a real issue and something that's very, very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials not only are trying to prevent problems in
their own plant systems, but also are alert to the disastrous
potential if the Y2K bug somehow cuts off electric power to their
facilities for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angela Summers, a chemical engineer and safety consultant
who works with many petrochemical companies, imagines such a
scenario:
</P>
<P>
   It's early morning on Jan. 1, 2000. Dancing lights sparkle on
the Houston Ship Channel's murky waters. They aren't reflections of
anyone's millennium party, but dozens of safety flares that have
roared into action at oil and chemical plants along the channel.
The improbable suddenly has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston will be well lit'' if that happens, Summers said. ``It
will look like a big birthday cake from the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The cheerfulness of that image is actually fitting. Planned
shutdowns of large oil and chemical plants take days, even weeks,
to ensure safety and pollution problems don't crop up. Any
unplanned shutdown is riskier, but the successful activation of all
those flares would be the best outcome, because they burn gases
that otherwise might escape disastrously.
</P>
<P>
   The safeguards in place at petrochemical plants have become
increasingly dependent on computer technology in recent years,
necessitating the correction of software and other items that might
fall prey to the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, plants increasingly have been laced with
thousands of devices employing date-sensitive computer chips, which
help workers control chemical reactions, monitor operating
conditions and carry out safe plant shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If even one or a few chips can't read the year 2000 properly,
those systems might not work properly. The prospect of several
simultaneous failures is particularly worrisome to safety experts,
as is the prospect of one failure causing other devices to
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Other facilities like offshore oil platforms and pipelines,
which form a spider's web beneath the Houston area, also depend on
``embedded systems,'' so named because computer chips are embedded
in them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`TRIAGE' SITUATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word ``triage'' frequently crops up in descriptions of
industry efforts to find and correct systems susceptible to Y2K
problems. Because there may not be enough time left to find all
date-sensitive items _ especially for some late-starting or
slow-moving companies _ many efforts are focusing on systems
critical to plant operations and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials say that if a company is not far along
in its efforts to become ``Y2K-compliant'' by now, it should now
work intensively on contingency planning for a possible emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporations, trade organizations, government agencies and
academic experts are paying attention to the issue and stepping up
their efforts to address it.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent refrain is that large petrochemical companies will
probably avoid major Y2K-related problems but that small and
mid-size enterprises _ including facilities that use but don't make
toxic chemicals _ may lack sufficient awareness or resources to do
the necessary detective work and retrofitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sizable concern, which I share, that there may be
people who are not attentive to this issue and that it could cause
serious problems at their facilities,'' said Dr. Jerry Poje, a
toxicologist and member of the Chemical Safety and Accident
Investigation Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, they might have a plant shutdown,'' Poje said.
``But even if it's a safe shutdown, the period of time (to
accomplish that and then safely restart operations) is too painful
for small businesses and work forces to absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing criticism from some chemical safety advocates,
government agencies at the state and federal level are pursuing a
nonregulatory approach that emphasizes communicating the need for
potentially affected companies to take preventive action.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the state's
principal environmental protection agency, has confined its
involvement to form letters advising regulated facilities that
Y2K-related corrections may be needed to assure public health and
safety. The letters provide references to sources of information on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LIMITED RESOURCES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have the resources to offer the regulated
community any kind of technical assistance,'' TNRCC spokesman
Patrick Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have focused on working with industry
organizations, such as the American Petroleum Institute and
Chemical Manufacturers Association, to spread the word to member
companies about the need to fix Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in these discussions, we told trade associations we were
not approaching them as a regulator, but were trying to partner
with them, to increase awareness, develop surveys and make them
public,'' said Don Flattery, sector outreach coordinator for the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Project Y2K Management Team.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders have made clear they have little interest
in granting extra powers to federal agencies to address the issue
now, either with regulation or detailed advice on corrective
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specific technical guidance would be very difficult,
particularly at this juncture, at this stage of the game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's Skinner said efforts aimed at finding and correcting Y2K
problems are widespread at Houston-area plants, at least those
visited recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every plant we've dealt with, they're working on it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he voiced concern that plans to get prepared for
computer-glitch complications at certain plants could increase
safety risks, especially for workers.
</P>
<P>
   He worries, for instance, that companies' concerns about a
Y2K-triggered shortage of oil or processed chemicals might prompt
them to stock up, refilling older process vessels near plant
control buildings that are now kept empty to enhance worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, such companies may assign additional
workers to these now more-vulnerable buildings in case they need to
perform more control functions manually when Y2K problems afflict
plant systems.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies with Houston-area plants _ OxyChem and Rohm and
Haas _ described their Y2K-readiness efforts in December at a
special meeting of the Chemical Safety and Accident Investigation
Board in Washington, D.C., on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
18,000 ITEMS TO CHECK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a consultant, OxyChem identified 18,000 items
in its 34 plants' control systems that needed to be checked _ a
much-larger number than plant personnel had found in their own,
more limited inventory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Employees developed a screening method to identify those devices
with possible Y2K problems _ looking for those that generate a
real-time date, for instance, or share digital signals with another
device, said Dan Daley, the company's maintenance director.
</P>
<P>
   This screening winnowed the 18,000 devices to fewer than 500,
which are now being fixed, undergoing further testing or which
require extra guidance from their manufacturer to assess, said Dan
Daley, the company's maintenance director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nominally, by midyear we hope to have all remediation
complete,'' Daley said. ``Our objective is to run through the key
Y2K dates, but there are still issues that we need to deal with,
including whether our electric suppliers and the overall
electricity grid will be supplying our plants adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Like OxyChem, Rohm and Haas is combining its search-and-repair
efforts with contingency planning, including an evaluation of
whether to temporarily shut down plants before Dec. 31 as an extra
precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one is to stop production at some point before the
millennium, but that's only one option,'' spokesman Ken Gedaka
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`SHUTDOWN' MODE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Rohm and Haas plants are typically shut down between
Christmas and New Year's Day anyway, and the company may place
others that operate at that time in a ``ready-to-shut-down mode,''
Gedaka said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now testing some corrected items, Gedaka said,
and expects to finish a final step of reintegrating all repaired
systems into plant operations by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials and other experts fear, however, that
not all companies are that far along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard any customer say they've found a (Y2K-related)
failure that would have caused an explosion, but they've found a
lot of little things that failed, which in combination may result
in an incident,'' said Summers, the La Marque, Texas-based director
of Premier Consulting and Engineering, part of Triconex, a company
that makes emergency shutdown systems for petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with some companies with process systems that are
archaic, with safety systems that are 20 years old,'' she said.
``Some companies are spending a lot of money to fix these problems
and some are not spending anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she believes some plants may not be able to avoid
all computer-related safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the companies without adequate Y2K preparation,
it's likely that some kind of incident will occur _ a potential
fire, explosion or toxic release,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With that prospect in mind, experts such as Manan, a chemical
engineering professor at A&AMP;M and director of its Mary Kay O'Connor
Process Safety Center, see a need for public officials in
communities near petrochemical facilities to make sure they are
ready for Y2K-related emergencies there.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a local government perspective, do Houston's emergency
coordinators know the total number of facilities that might have
problems?'' he asked. ``Do they have response mechanisms in place,
and do they have their own Y2K problems in emergency response?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole area of contingency planning needs a quick
going-over.''

<P>
   Maybe Mr. Java is just shy. But when asked to produce a cup of
coffee for a stranger last Thursday, he sat as still as a child
frozen on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' said Kristin Hall, a project coordinator
at the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass., watching the empty cup. It was a
comment heard frequently during a visit to the 14-year-old
silver-tiled building designed by I.M. Pei. As the Media Lab's
director, Nicholas Negroponte, is fond of saying, it was founded to
``invent the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Java is an Acorto 2000s automatic espresso machine wired to
a personal computer _ a kind of HAL for latte, when he works. He is
also the first piece created by Counter Intelligence, a new
five-year research program begun in October to invent a
technological future for the home kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen is the heart of the home and the hub of the
family,'' said Michael Hawley, an associate professor of media
technology and the principal investigator, as researchers are
called. ``We're not trying to invent the foodless kitchen;  &UR; please &LR; 
don't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawley, a round-faced, red-haired man wearing a shooting jacket
with a quilted shoulder, is a computer scientist who is practicing
for the Van Cliburn piano competition, bobsleds and is a national
yo-yo champion. He is the architect of the first digital edition of
Shakespeare. He helped George Lucas pioneer the super-computed
cinema that produced ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to work in a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where you have the most complex human interactions and
the most convoluted schedule management and probably the least use
of new technologies to help you manage all that stuff,'' Hawley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is also already wired. ``And it's begging for a
network,'' said Dr. Andrew Lippman, the associate director of the
Media Lab. ``Right now your toaster doesn't talk to your television
set, and your refrigerator doesn't talk to your stove, and none of
them talk to the store and tell you to get milk on your way home.
It's an obvious place screaming out for connectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Java is the advance guard of Phase 1: an army of smart
domestic devices being explored in prototype in a series of work
spaces at the Media Lab that look like messy children's rooms
separated by doors with security touch pads.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a tag reader beneath his coffee spigot, Mr. Java
basically takes the order encoded in plastic tag glued to the
bottom of a coffee mug. He supplies both a drink and through a
computer monitor, Internet-based news, music, stock quotes or
weather. He is a virtual coffee house with genuine foam.
</P>
<P>
   Counter Intelligence has built a bagel-cutting laser that can
also engrave cooking instructions or games on food. When Martha
Stewart visited recently, it etched her picture on an eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably trying to grow the seeds,'' said Joseph Kaye,
an MIT undergraduate who helped develop Mr. Java and whose idea the
study of kitchens was.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a digital ``nose,'' originally developed for drug
enforcement agencies to find cocaine in suitcases, that will now
suggest spicing for food, a talking oven mitt, wired with sensors
and a voice microchip, that can tell the baker when the bread is
ready and an electronic tablecloth, embroidered with conductive
thread, that could moderate a family discussion or invite an online
guest as a fourth for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream tablecloth would actually move the things on the
table,'' said Lippman. ``You throw the silver down on it and it
sets the table.'' Lippman, who has a mad-looking cartoon-puppet
brush mustache and a demeanor to match, was wearing a small Batman
pin on his sweater. ``I collect pins from guests,'' he said.
Executives from Time Warner had been through that day.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Media Lab's faculty and students are a virtual
aristocracy of the digerati, and because the subject of kitchens is
food, which can be stubbornly analog, as project members described
it, there is a strong smell of blind men barbecuing an elephant.
The future can be tough territory for the present. Counter
Intelligence investigators interviewed several local food shops and
chefs, who were asked to name useful tools and favorite appliances
and to characterize what puts people at ease when they sit down to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we all spoke with our mothers,'' said Hawley, the
principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, the student, has lately been trying to train a glass
counter top to assemble the ingredients for making fudge by reading
electronic tags on jars of mini-marshmallows and chocolate chips,
then coordinating their quantities with a recipe on a computer and
directing a microwave oven to cook it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floating chip is programmed to be vanilla,'' the screen
explained,
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the intelligent counter seemed to be on brief
sabbatical with Mr. Java. Fudge, like the future, remained only a
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   But at its conceptual best, Kaye's dessert recipe is an exercise
in inventory management. With product bar codes and appliances that
were cable-connected and continuously on line, kitchens could shop
for and stock their own food. They could also comparison-shop
between suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the future has had a habit of showing up early. This
month in England, Electrolux introduced what it calls the first
Internet-con nected refrigerator, which can reorder groceries
through a bar-code scanner built into the door.
</P>
<P>
   With its lovable low technologies like mixing bowls, its
nostalgic connectivity to memory and its unscientific satisfactions
like hanging out and getting fed, does the kitchen need the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``With the living room disappearing, the kitchen is changing its
focus, returning to a more social, community-oriented space,'' said
Judith Donath, an assistant professor of media arts and sciences
and a principal investigator. Ms. Donath is helping develop the
Visiphone, a prototype of a audiovisual environment that would
allow extended families or groups of friends to convene in a
kitchen electronically, much as they have traditionally done.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in communications which are ostensibly about
nothing in particular,'' said Ms. Donath, who is confident that the
more sophisticated technologies now emerging will remove the raw,
surveillant quality of today's video conferences and speaker
telephones and allow conversations as casual as dropping in for
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   If Counter Intelligence sometimes seems less than serious,
Hawley is quick to remind the visitor that he wants to make the
future of the kitchen fun. And like many educators, he contends
that entertainment can teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eating more and more processed food, we're spending less
and less time making it, and it gets consumed with what I would
call a minimum of fun,'' Hawley said. ``One thing we're after
specifically is ways for kids to have a lot more fun in the
kitchen.'' Counter Intelligence doesn't mean to leave them licking
the spoon. Imagine instead ethnic foods, with genetic bar coding,
that speak with foreign accents as the kitchen scans and prepares
them.
</P>
<P>
   Welcoming children into the kitchen is more than instructive
fun. They are the next generation of consumers, and they are
especially at home with technology, which they help sell to their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technologies don't just trickle down,'' said Lippman, the
Media Lab's associate director, speaking of innovations like pagers
that have moved from the office to the home. ``They burble up now,
from kids. One of the ways that you might find electronic
tablecloths appearing in the world is with the American Girl
Collection,'' he said, referring to a popular doll company. A child
playing with the doll's tablecloth would introduce its technology
to her mother, who might then buy a full-scale version for the
family. ``Maybe you break out this stuff from the bottom up, as a
toy,'' Lippman said.
</P>
<P>
   Counter Intelligence is not developing anything that is more
than 15 years away, in terms of technology. Most of it, including
the talking oven mitt, is inexpensive enough to mass-produce now,
said Ted Selker, a visiting professor and IBM fellow who developed
the mitt.
</P>
<P>
   Frivolous or not, Media Lab inventions could easily be the next
wave of kitchen products for everyone from AT&AMP;T to Kraft Foods,
both Counter Intelligence sponsors. With sales uncomfortably slow
because of a lack of innovation and the buyer's basic reluctance to
replace something that still works, the appliance industry looking
with new envy to powerful computer electronics and its market for
frequent upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance between them in the kitchen, like the one Counter
Intelligence proposes, could be difficult to resist. Though the
Media Lab doesn't manufacture its inventions, it owns any patents
sought by its researchers based on their work there. Commercial
sponsors have a two-year exclusive right to license the patents.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley, with the wonder of a boy with a frog, discussed what
Media Lab believes is the most radical _ and most logical _ edge of
the domestic universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, kitchens and bathrooms will monitor the food we eat
so closely that health care will disappear,'' he said. ``We will
move from a world in which the doctor gets a pinprick of data every
blue moon, to the world in which the body is online. Heart patients
who are at high risk, or diabetics _ what will two tablespoons of
peanut butter do to your system? Your kitchen will be the finger on
your pulse.'' The Media Lab has developed a thermometer that can be
swallowed, recording data as it passes through the body. It is
working on a similar DNA analyzer.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley, a bachelor who rarely uses his kitchen, dismissed a
future that produces only a laser bagel-cutter, which, with an
academic scowl, he compared to the electric knife. .
</P>
<P>
   But he knows enough to play to the crowd. ``People would have
thought a bread-making machine was pure science fiction 100 years
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley smiled. ``But they're kind of nice,'' he said. ``People
love them.''

   Provided they're old enough to keep the mouse out of their
mouths, there's something for nearly every child in Wonderland, at
the Web site of Sony Wonder, the entertainment company's children's
label. Wonderland bills itself as ``a safe place to play and
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonderland's Wading Pool (``The perfect place for 2- to
3-year-olds to get their feet wet in the World Wide Web'') offers
toddlers the chance to play Click-a-Part Choo Choo, an animated
computer game ``inspired,'' Sony Wonder carefully notes, by a John
Denver children's CD the company distributes.
</P>
<P>
   For 4- to 6-year-olds, there are slightly more complex games
that are mostly inspired by videos released by Sony Wonder, like
William Wegman's ``Mother Goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, older children who might have been interested in a
Barbie album called ``Beyond Pink'' could have won a prize for
filling out a long questionnaire to see if they were a ``Beyond
Pink kind of girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wonderland site, far from being an anomaly, is typical of
many Web pages geared toward youngsters. While many parents are
worried that their children may be exposed to pornography on the
Web, children are far more likely to spend time looking at
something else altogether: advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has become an irresistible tool for many marketers
looking for ways to capture some of the estimated $130 million a
year children spend as well as the $500 million in purchases they
influence. One of the chief methods marketers use is to combine
advertising and interactive content until, as on the Wonderland
site, the line between the two is almost obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the use of the Web to sell to children has attracted
little of the attention that television advertising has attracted
over the years. But a small number of critics warn that by focusing
almost exclusively on the dangers of online sex and violence,
parents may be missing an arguably more widespread problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelming,'' said Dr. Michael Brody, a child
psychiatrist in Washington who studies the impact of advertising on
children. ``In general in our society, content and advertising have
become blurred. But on the Internet it's a blitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advertising-heavy sites for children are operated by
companies like toy and cereal makers that have traditionally aimed
at children or by popular entertainment companies like Sony and
Nickelodeon. But sites that are billed as educational, like the PBS
Kids pages, the Knowledge Adventure Encyclopedia and the Kids'
Almanac, also feature advertising, usually in the form of click-on
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies unrelated to children's products, like the oil
giant Chevron, have Web sites for youngsters. The Chevron site
features games, toys, videos and homework sections touting the
importance of _ what else? _ the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few sites aimed at children directly offer
merchandise for sale. One such site is a popular one offered by
Nickelodeon, which links directly to an online toy store called Red
Rocket. But many companies are indirect, offering attractive, free
entertainment to build a profile for their products and, in some
cases, to gather marketing data.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's as if companies are entering our homes and
picking the brains of our children for commercial purposes,'' said
Dr. Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media
Education, a nonprofit lobbying group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly television and other media have long been used to sell
to children, but advertising on the Web is virtually unrestricted.
There are voluntary advertising guidelines for the Web and
traditional media set by the Children's Advertising Review Unit, an
organization operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus and
financed by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   While the voluntary rules for Internet advertisements are
generally the same as the voluntary guidelines adopted by major
television networks for advertising in their medium, there are some
significant differences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, guidelines forcing a clear separation between
content and advertising on television do not apply to the Web. And
the ban on characters, real or animated, acting both as content and
pitchmen does not affect the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Tony the Tiger can act as a host on the Kellogg's site, Planet
K, whereas no television network would be allowed to accept a
cartoon show based on the Frosted Flakes mascot (except in the
unlikely case that Tony the Tiger was the host of a show that was
not sponsored by Frosted Flakes).
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lascoutx, a vice president of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus and director of the Children's Advertising Review
Unit, said the standards simply reflected the differences between
the media. ``It's easy to make the separation on television,'' she
said. ``You can say, `We'll be back in a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the most intensive research into the
Internet's power as a means of selling to children has been
conducted by the advertising industry. Kid Connection, a unit of
the agency Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, has twice commissioned studies from
cultural anthropologists and clinical psychologists, what the
company refers to as ``psychocultural youth research.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent study involved clinical psychologists
interviewing 84 young people between the ages of 6 and 20 and then
analyzing their dreams, drawings and reactions to symbols. The
anthropologists camped out in houses watching other children use
the Net for about 500 hours. As well, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi has a panel
of about 300 children it communicates with regularly by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the really critical findings of the study is how rich
digital media are in the lives of children,'' said Johann Wachs,
vice president for strategic planning at Kid Connection. ``They
provide an enormous developmental push. It's bound to have a major
impact on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of that impact is determined by how the approach is made.
Based on its research, Wachs said that Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi had
learned that merging content and advertising was the only effective
way to reach children from moderately affluent families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a generation with a very ambivalent attitude about
advertising,'' Wachs said. ``They know and perceive of themselves
as a target market. But they are actually very open to advertising
and enjoying being courted by advertisers if it's something that
adds value by being entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical results of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi's research can be
seen at You Rule School, a game site developed by the agency to
promote cereals and snack foods made by General Mills. Once
visitors register and get a personal locker number, they have the
option of playing a number of elaborate games, like the Fruity
Obstacle Course, where a bug-eyed animated character crosses a
cavern in a cartoon version of a General Mills' Fruit Roll Ups
factory.
</P>
<P>
   It is a memory game that involves building a bridge by matching
Fruit Roll-Ups coming off an assembly line with their appropriately
shaped packages. Users can also gobble a yard-long maze of General
Mills' Fruit by the Foot and blow off steam by stomping on some
General Mills' Fruit Gushers before rounding out their day swinging
Tarzan-style from a General Mills Fruit String Thing.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns many critics is that the children being lured into
attractive, multimedia corporate Web sites are unwittingly being
used for market research.
</P>
<P>
   For example, children who want to earn points that can be
exchanged for free merchandise on Kidscom.com _ a Milwaukee-based,
advertising-supported site with games and other features _ must
answer 21 questions. Several focus on the family's computer
equipment, hobbies and favorite activities.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Beauchamp, general manager of Circle 1 Network, the company
that owns Kidscom, said that advertisers could get only aggregated
data about users of the site; no personal information about a
specific child is ever offered. That information is used in-house
to judge a user's technical capabilities and to match children in
an optional e-mail pen pal service.
</P>
<P>
   But some questions appear to have psychological overtones. Among
other things, users who want to collect Loot Locker points are
asked to give their career dreams and to complete the statement,
``If I could shift into anything I wanted to be, I would change
into, ...'' The suggested answers are a bird, a fish, an animal or
a plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is developing rules to bring into
effect the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act, passed by
Congress last year, which is intended to protect the privacy of
Web-surfing children.
</P>
<P>
   Child advocacy groups are not calling for an end to Web
advertising aimed at children. But Dr. Montgomery does not agree
that the nature of the Web should necessarily dictate policies for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is something we as a society have created,'' she said,
``and it's not locked in stone that commercials have to be
integrated into content. Something is wrong with this picture.''
She said she would prefer to see some commercial-free Web areas set
aside for children, ``just as we have public playgrounds in the
real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some children's sites with advertising are trying to adhere to
limits. Kevin Dando, associate director for education and online
communications for the Public Broadcasting System, said the PBS
pages designed for children would not be topped by banner
advertisements _ unlike the pages aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   PBS has also instituted ``bridge'' pages between its own site
and the rest of the Web so surfers who click on a vivid blue logo
for Rice Krispies that lies at the feet of the four Teletubbies is
not immediately whisked away to Kellogg's Planet K.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge pages issue a warning that the user is about to leave
PBS and offers the option of heading back rather than plunging into
the cyber cereal world. ``As well as being a pause, we want to use
the bridge page as a place where children learn something,'' Dando
said. The Nickelodeon site has adopted a similar system.
</P>
<P>
   For Wachs at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, parents' fears about Web
advertising, like many issues related to the Net, are a product of
ignorance, born of the concern that ``the kids are doing something
they don't understand and therefore it may be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that intermediate steps like bridge pages would not
slow the merger of advertising and content on the Web. On the
Internet, he said, ``advertising is going to develop more and more
into entertainment content; advertisers have to play along.''

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not long ago, Wall Street mocked socially
responsible funds. No more.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, baby boomers have started pouring more money
into the nation's 144 socially responsible mutual funds, with
assets hitting a record $529 billion last year, according to the
Social Investment Forum, a nonprofit organization in Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the performance arena, these stock funds gained 18.5 percent
in 1998, compared to 14.3 percent for the average domestic stock
fund, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sign of success: about 40 percent of socially
responsible funds have earned top 5-star and 4-star ratings from
Morningstar Inc., compared to 30 percent of funds in other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a very good showing overall,'' said Jon Hale, a
Morningstar analyst who follows socially responsible funds.
``People were skeptical of them as investment vehicles, but now
there's a growing respect and recognition. As an investment
approach, it's here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   These funds often specialize, carefully sorting out companies
that have exceptional environmental and human rights records or, in
the case of one fund, invest in companies that are deemed good for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pei, a San Francisco banker, and a former co-worker pooled
$50,000 from friends in 1993 to start the Women's Equity Mutual
Fund, which invests in companies that the fund managers believe
have pro-women policies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fund manages $8.7 million in assets and holds stock
in 50 large-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   Run by portfolio managers Heidi Soumerai and Bill Apfel at U.S.
Trust Company Boston, the fund enjoyed a 28.76 percent gain last
year, edging the Standard &AMP; Poor 500's 28.72 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, we were told the social criteria for our
investments would limit us, and we couldn't possibly outperform
other funds,'' said Pei, 54, the president of the fund. ``Now, so
many socially responsible funds are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pei is betting that clients will continue to invest with their
financial minds, and their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make money while following your heart, why not?''
Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   Pei and Leslie Christian, a former Salomon Brothers executive
who is now managing director at Progressive Securities in Portland,
Ore., began the fund in part because they believed that
businesswomen had made little progress in breaking the glass
ceiling in corporate boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and said, `What happened?' In the '70s
and '80s, we thought we'd be at the forefront, a new vanguard of
businesswomen,'' Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to start a mutual fund, using money as a voice
for women. Pei registered the fund with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They hosted a wine-and-cheese party for 100 friends,
who pitched in $50,000 to start the fund.
</P>
<P>
   They also started hunting for good stocks, large-cap companies
that treat women well in the workplace. Among their criteria: Women
in executive ranks; equal pay for women; career development
programs; pro-family benefits, including child care and maternity
leave; contracts with women-owned companies; and positive images of
women in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the companies must be top performers in their
industries, with well-run management, strong market share and high
earnings potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the fund's holdings are in technology (19
percent), health care (17 percent) and financial services (15
percent). Top holdings include Lucent Technologies, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, Sanmina and Cisco Systems.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One tough decision Pei and her fund managers must make soon:
whether to hold or dump 180,000 shares of BankAmerica, the San
Francisco corporate institution taken over last year by NationsBank
of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some departing BankAmerica women executives have accused the
NationsBank management of discrimination, charges denied by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in touch with bank executives to find out what's going
on there,'' Pei said. ``Were these disputes involving employees, or
part of corporatewide practices?''
</P>
<P>
   While lacking the raw clout of giant mutual funds and pension
plans, Pei hopes her fund will show that women are a force in
finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, we have a lot of power,'' Pei said. ``That's an
important message to get out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not long ago, Wall Street mocked socially
responsible funds. No more.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, baby boomers have started pouring more money
into the nation's 144 socially responsible mutual funds, with
assets hitting a record $529 billion last year, according to the
Social Investment Forum, a nonprofit organization in Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the performance arena, these stock funds gained 18.5 percent
in 1998, compared to 14.3 percent for the average domestic stock
fund, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sign of success: about 40 percent of socially
responsible funds have earned top 5-star and 4-star ratings from
Morningstar Inc., compared to 30 percent of funds in other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a very good showing overall,'' said Jon Hale, a
Morningstar analyst who follows socially responsible funds.
``People were skeptical of them as investment vehicles, but now
there's a growing respect and recognition. As an investment
approach, it's here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   These funds often specialize, carefully sorting out companies
that have exceptional environmental and human rights records or, in
the case of one fund, invest in companies that are deemed good for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pei, a San Francisco banker, and a former co-worker pooled
$50,000 from friends in 1993 to start the Women's Equity Mutual
Fund, which invests in companies that the fund managers believe
have pro-women policies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fund manages $8.7 million in assets and holds stock
in 50 large-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   Run by portfolio managers Heidi Soumerai and Bill Apfel at U.S.
Trust Company Boston, the fund enjoyed a 28.76 percent gain last
year, edging the Standard &AMP; Poor 500's 28.72 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, we were told the social criteria for our
investments would limit us, and we couldn't possibly outperform
other funds,'' said Pei, 54, the president of the fund. ``Now, so
many socially responsible funds are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pei is betting that clients will continue to invest with their
financial minds, and their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make money while following your heart, why not?''
Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   Pei and Leslie Christian, a former Salomon Brothers executive
who is now managing director at Progressive Securities in Portland,
Ore., began the fund in part because they believed that
businesswomen had made little progress in breaking the glass
ceiling in corporate boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and said, `What happened?' In the '70s
and '80s, we thought we'd be at the forefront, a new vanguard of
businesswomen,'' Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to start a mutual fund, using money as a voice
for women. Pei registered the fund with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They hosted a wine-and-cheese party for 100 friends,
who pitched in $50,000 to start the fund.
</P>
<P>
   They also started hunting for good stocks, large-cap companies
that treat women well in the workplace. Among their criteria: Women
in executive ranks; equal pay for women; career development
programs; pro-family benefits, including child care and maternity
leave; contracts with women-owned companies; and positive images of
women in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the companies must be top performers in their
industries, with well-run management, strong market share and high
earnings potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the fund's holdings are in technology (19
percent), health care (17 percent) and financial services (15
percent). Top holdings include Lucent Technologies, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, Sanmina and Cisco Systems.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One tough decision Pei and her fund managers must make soon:
whether to hold or dump 180,000 shares of BankAmerica, the San
Francisco corporate institution taken over last year by NationsBank
of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some departing BankAmerica women executives have accused the
NationsBank management of discrimination, charges denied by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in touch with bank executives to find out what's going
on there,'' Pei said. ``Were these disputes involving employees, or
part of corporatewide practices?''
</P>
<P>
   While lacking the raw clout of giant mutual funds and pension
plans, Pei hopes her fund will show that women are a force in
finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, we have a lot of power,'' Pei said. ``That's an
important message to get out.''

DIGITAL GUARDIANS OF SIBLING PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I cannot say whether Ella's suspicions were justified, but she
seemed quite convinced one day last week that her older sister had
read her diary. In retaliation, she drew a primitive skull and
crossbones on the book, then scrawled, ``Next time, Keep out or DIE
_ that means you ZOE.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I judge the accuracy of her older sister's hunch that
someone (Ella?) was sneaking red licorice from the trove hidden in
her dresser. Zoe had installed a security system by painstakingly
draping hairs over doorknobs, drawer openings and even the
licorice.
</P>
<P>
   This age-old childhood ritual _ sibling espionage _ seemed
harmless enough, if the sisters had in fact been carrying out
raids. But what if my daughters were becoming paranoid?
</P>
<P>
   I think I am amply qualified to recognize the signs. Over the
years I have been certain, at various times, that my sixth-grade
teacher was out to get me, that a dawdling counter clerk at
Starbuck's was out to get me and that the cats were out to get me.
I might have been wrong about my teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But the more practical problem in this instance was that Zoe, 9,
and Ella, 7, were using hopelessly old-fashioned ``Spy vs. Spy''
techniques to frustrate each other. How could they hope to generate
accurate field reports?
</P>
<P>
   To help, I suggested that my daughters embrace technology in the
form of a couple of new electronic toys called the Password Journal
and the Door Pass, which sell for $19.99 apiece. These anti-snooper
devices, which rely on voice-recognition technology and
irritatingly loud alarms, are among the first generation of
products from Girltech (www.girltech.com) and were created by the
mother-daughter design team of Janese and (12-year-old) Jackie
Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   I had some reservations, of course. Having experienced my
daughters' lukewarm reactions to most other microchip-enhanced
gadgetry _ even the Game Boy Color is moldering under a sofa _ I
was skeptical of Girltech's boast that the products could ``bring
girls closer to the world of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the test units arrived, I saw that my daughters
did, in fact, have an appetite for electronic devices. I learned
that while demonstrating the Password Journal, a bright purple
plastic box the size of a hardcover book. I explained that the
owner had to record a code word that would cause the box's top to
pop open. I showed them the little spiral-ringed notebook and
pencil stored inside. Also, I noted, there is a secret compartment
where you can hide your _ .
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Ella snatched the journal, clutched it to her chest and
shrieked desperately: ``You can have anything else that you want,
Zoe, even my Barbies, but this is mine! Mine!''
</P>
<P>
   In the next few hours, I observed a curious pattern. First Ella
would record a password _ say, ``Ella rules _ you know it'' _ then
pop the lid, write a secret entry, snap the box shut and challenge
the rest of the family to break in. After all our attempts
(including my husband's incredibly Ella-like falsetto) failed, the
journal would announce ``access denied'' in a tinny voice and
tattle to Ella, ``Three intruders!'' Then she would cackle
maniacally and run off to change the password.
</P>
<P>
   By the next morning, the rest of us were getting a little sick
of the Password Journal. But Ella would not be parted from it and
begged to take it to school. At the breakfast table, she made a
show of changing her password to ``Zoe stinks,'' prompting Zoe to
yell, ``That's not true!'' while the machine was still recording.
Conscientiously, the journal subsequently refused to open unless
the sisters repeated their chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Zoe was equally intrigued by the Door Pass, a green
and purple plastic box that she attached to her bedroom door via
its Velcro mount. Armed with a motion sensor in addition to
fearsome voice-recognition capabilities, the Door Pass challenges
any trespasser. If the intruder fails to repeat the secret password
(``Our cats love Mom''), an alarm sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home from school, Zoe was mystified to learn that
``one intruder'' had breached the premises _ until she realized
that her baby sister, Clementine, was in the hall clutching a
fistful of red licorice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it to me, Clemmie,'' she cajoled. ``No way! No way!''
Clementine yelled, running behind the bed and setting off the alarm
again.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by the simple, efficient design of these gadgets, we
also tested Girltech's Beam-It ($9.99), a flashlight that would be
especially useful at slumber parties. It enables the user to
project a written message on a dark wall.
</P>
<P>
   Another Girltech product, a programmable photo frame ($14.99)
that will speak a sentence to describe the friend in the photo, did
not hold my daughters' interest for long. But Clementine, age 1,
conversed with it as she pushed it around in her doll stroller. The
frame announced, ``My friend is brave and bold and inventive and _
''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way! No way!'' Clementine responded.
</P>
<P>
   The only real criticism I had was with the toy company's name,
Girltech. If your purpose is to enfranchise girls and offer them
more choices, why pick a name that implicitly limits choice by
implying that all the other toys out there must be ``boy tech''?
</P>
<P>
   When I phoned Girltech's founder, Janese Swanson, she told me
that she had heard that complaint before. But she said her research
showed that too many girls still thought of all technology as
belonging to boys. So Girltech's name is a conscious effort to
counteract that perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Ms. Swanson said, ``girls need to be able to
claim technology for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she told me about another toy in development, the Keepsafe
Box ($19.99). It will have a window in which you can display
valuables to tempt your enemies, er, siblings. It will drive them
crazy, of course, because the only person who can open the box will
be the owner, using a remote-controlled clicker. Call me paranoid,
but I think Zoe should keep her licorice in there.

OFFICIALS RACE Y2K CLOCK TO AVERT DISASTER AT PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Filed in ``a'' and ``f'' categories) 
 
By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the nation's petrochemical capital, Houston faces a
unique array of potential problems, ranging from the catastrophic
to the merely troublesome, because oil and chemical plants are
controlled with thousands of computer chips that may be vulnerable
to the much-publicized Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are racing the clock to identify and correct
plant systems containing date-sensitive chips that won't read 2000
properly. At the same time, companies are reviewing and refining
their contingency plans in case they don't find all the problem
chips and the computer glitch causes an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   With a flood of recent reports on the Y2K bug's threat in other
computerized areas of modern life, the additional specter of fires,
explosions and toxic clouds at petrochemical plants might seem like
premillennial jitters or technophobia.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the warnings are coming from people and
groups more noted for their expertise in the industry's complex
workings than for any tendency toward doomsaying, and who are
taking care to distinguish their concern from alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hoax,'' said Ray Skinner, area director of the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Houston South
office. ``It's a real issue and something that's very, very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials not only are trying to prevent problems in
their own plant systems, but also are alert to the disastrous
potential if the Y2K bug somehow cuts off electric power to their
facilities for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angela Summers, a chemical engineer and safety consultant
who works with many petrochemical companies, imagines such a
scenario:
</P>
<P>
   It's early morning on Jan. 1, 2000. Dancing lights sparkle on
the Houston Ship Channel's murky waters. They aren't reflections of
anyone's millennium party, but dozens of safety flares that have
roared into action at oil and chemical plants along the channel.
The improbable suddenly has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston will be well lit'' if that happens, Summers said. ``It
will look like a big birthday cake from the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The cheerfulness of that image is actually fitting. Planned
shutdowns of large oil and chemical plants take days, even weeks,
to ensure safety and pollution problems don't crop up. Any
unplanned shutdown is riskier, but the successful activation of all
those flares would be the best outcome, because they burn gases
that otherwise might escape disastrously.
</P>
<P>
   The safeguards in place at petrochemical plants have become
increasingly dependent on computer technology in recent years,
necessitating the correction of software and other items that might
fall prey to the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, plants increasingly have been laced with
thousands of devices employing date-sensitive computer chips, which
help workers control chemical reactions, monitor operating
conditions and carry out safe plant shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If even one or a few chips can't read the year 2000 properly,
those systems might not work properly. The prospect of several
simultaneous failures is particularly worrisome to safety experts,
as is the prospect of one failure causing other devices to
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Other facilities like offshore oil platforms and pipelines,
which form a spider's web beneath the Houston area, also depend on
``embedded systems,'' so named because computer chips are embedded
in them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`TRIAGE' SITUATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word ``triage'' frequently crops up in descriptions of
industry efforts to find and correct systems susceptible to Y2K
problems. Because there may not be enough time left to find all
date-sensitive items _ especially for some late-starting or
slow-moving companies _ many efforts are focusing on systems
critical to plant operations and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials say that if a company is not far along
in its efforts to become ``Y2K-compliant'' by now, it should now
work intensively on contingency planning for a possible emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporations, trade organizations, government agencies and
academic experts are paying attention to the issue and stepping up
their efforts to address it.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent refrain is that large petrochemical companies will
probably avoid major Y2K-related problems but that small and
mid-size enterprises _ including facilities that use but don't make
toxic chemicals _ may lack sufficient awareness or resources to do
the necessary detective work and retrofitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sizable concern, which I share, that there may be
people who are not attentive to this issue and that it could cause
serious problems at their facilities,'' said Dr. Jerry Poje, a
toxicologist and member of the Chemical Safety and Accident
Investigation Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, they might have a plant shutdown,'' Poje said.
``But even if it's a safe shutdown, the period of time (to
accomplish that and then safely restart operations) is too painful
for small businesses and work forces to absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing criticism from some chemical safety advocates,
government agencies at the state and federal level are pursuing a
nonregulatory approach that emphasizes communicating the need for
potentially affected companies to take preventive action.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the state's
principal environmental protection agency, has confined its
involvement to form letters advising regulated facilities that
Y2K-related corrections may be needed to assure public health and
safety. The letters provide references to sources of information on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LIMITED RESOURCES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have the resources to offer the regulated
community any kind of technical assistance,'' TNRCC spokesman
Patrick Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have focused on working with industry
organizations, such as the American Petroleum Institute and
Chemical Manufacturers Association, to spread the word to member
companies about the need to fix Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in these discussions, we told trade associations we were
not approaching them as a regulator, but were trying to partner
with them, to increase awareness, develop surveys and make them
public,'' said Don Flattery, sector outreach coordinator for the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Project Y2K Management Team.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders have made clear they have little interest
in granting extra powers to federal agencies to address the issue
now, either with regulation or detailed advice on corrective
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specific technical guidance would be very difficult,
particularly at this juncture, at this stage of the game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's Skinner said efforts aimed at finding and correcting Y2K
problems are widespread at Houston-area plants, at least those
visited recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every plant we've dealt with, they're working on it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he voiced concern that plans to get prepared for
computer-glitch complications at certain plants could increase
safety risks, especially for workers.
</P>
<P>
   He worries, for instance, that companies' concerns about a
Y2K-triggered shortage of oil or processed chemicals might prompt
them to stock up, refilling older process vessels near plant
control buildings that are now kept empty to enhance worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, such companies may assign additional
workers to these now ore-vulnerable buildings in case they need to
perform more control functions manually when Y2K problems afflict
plant systems.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies with Houston-area plants _ OxyChem and Rohm and
Haas _ described their Y2K-readiness efforts in December at a
special meeting of the Chemical Safety and Accident Investigation
Board in Washington, D.C., on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
18,000 ITEMS TO CHECK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a consultant, OxyChem identified 18,000 items
in its 34 plants' control systems that needed to be checked _ a
much-larger number than plant personnel had found in their own,
more limited inventory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Employees developed a screening method to identify those devices
with possible Y2K problems _ looking for those that generate a
real-time date, for instance, or share digital signals with another
device, said Dan Daley, the company's maintenance director.
</P>
<P>
   This screening winnowed the 18,000 devices to fewer than 500,
which are now being fixed, undergoing further testing or which
require extra guidance from their manufacturer to assess, said Dan
Daley, the company's maintenance director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nominally, by midyear we hope to have all remediation
complete,'' Daley said. ``Our objective is to run through the key
Y2K dates, but there are still issues that we need to deal with,
including whether our electric suppliers and the overall
electricity grid will be supplying our plants adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Like OxyChem, Rohm and Haas is combining its search-and-repair
efforts with contingency planning, including an evaluation of
whether to temporarily shut down plants before Dec. 31 as an extra
precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one is to stop production at some point before the
millennium, but that's only one option,'' spokesman Ken Gedaka
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`SHUTDOWN' MODE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Rohm and Haas plants are typically shut down between
Christmas and New Year's Day anyway, and the company may place
others that operate at that time in a ``ready-to-shut-down mode,''
Gedaka said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now testing some corrected items, Gedaka said,
and expects to finish a final step of reintegrating all repaired
systems into plant operations by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry officials and other experts fear, however, that
not all companies are that far along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard any customer say they've found a (Y2K-related)
failure that would have caused an explosion, but they've found a
lot of little things that failed, which in combination may result
in an incident,'' said Summers, the La Marque, Texas-based director
of Premier Consulting and Engineering, part of Triconex, a company
that makes emergency shutdown systems for petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with some companies with process systems that are
archaic, with safety systems that are 20 years old,'' she said.
``Some companies are spending a lot of money to fix these problems
and some are not spending anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she believes some plants may not be able to avoid
all computer-related safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the companies without adequate Y2K preparation,
it's likely that some kind of incident will occur _ a potential
fire, explosion or toxic release,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With that prospect in mind, experts such as Manan, a chemical
engineering professor at A&AMP;M and director of its Mary Kay O'Connor
Process Safety Center, see a need for public officials in
communities near petrochemical facilities to make sure they are
ready for Y2K-related emergencies there.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a local government perspective, do Houston's emergency
coordinators know the total number of facilities that might have
problems?'' he asked. ``Do they have response mechanisms in place,
and do they have their own Y2K problems in emergency response?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole area of contingency planning needs a quick
going-over.''

FEELING VIRTUAL WHEELS RUMBLE ON THE TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news in the auto industry is computers _ how many chips
are on board in each new car and how software is improving car
performance and revolutionizing car design.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies like Microsoft and Electronic Arts are
trying to build steering wheels and brake pedals into their video
games. Now that computers are powerful enough to bring road rumble
and potholes and centrifugal force to bear on the virtual driving
experience, games enhanced with force feedback put you in the
driver's seat, albeit in a hyperbolic automotive theme world where
pebbles feel like giant boulders and idling engines buzz like chain
saws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, steering wheels and driving games are nothing new.
Arguably, the first video-game steering wheel was the Atari 2600
paddle controller in 1978. Racing games for Atari and Colecovision
didn't have much in the way of special effects. But they did create
a competitive driving situation and, for a grade-school kid, that
was enough.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Sony and Nintendo introduced controllers that
vibrated, so if you crashed into a wall, you got buzzed. Around the
same time, makers of personal computer peripherals began making
bigger and more expensive versions of the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Now tactile feedback is standard. You can feel the road surface.
You can feel torque and resistance around a corner. There is a
difference between rolling over the planks of a covered bridge and
cruising down an asphalt highway. If you speed up, the car handles
differently. It's not just about the quantity of feedback. The
information has quality as well.
</P>
<P>
   And where there are differences in quality, there are
differences of interpretation. Case in point: Monster Truck Madness
2, published by Microsoft, apparently to showcase the
force-feedback overkill capabilities of its Sidewinder racing
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the version that comes bundled with the wheel is even
stronger and more rumbly than the version on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost shakes the wheel out of your hand,'' said Brett
Schnepf, the technical evangelist at Microsoft for Sidewinder game
devices. ``We joke about that when we go to developers _ the
Spielberg versus Newton implementation. Do you want to go Newton,
which is what the Flight Simulator guys do, versus the Spielberg,
which is more like Monster Truck Madness 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Need for Speed 3, published by Electronic Arts, doesn't quite
conform to Newtonian concepts of momentum and gravity, but it does
take a subtler approach. A valentine to car design, it offers the
player a chocolate box of high-performance name-brand automobiles
at their slickest and most shiny (a '98 Corvette C5, an Aston
Martin DB7, a Mercedes-Benz SL600, a Jaguar XK8, a couple of
Ferraris and a pair of Lamborghinis).
</P>
<P>
   Pebbles in the road are less important than the illusion that
you can tell the difference in handling between sports cars you're
never going to drive _ virtual connoisseurship, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Need for Speed 3 is a cartoon as well. But who wants
to drive 55 miles per hour in cyberspace, anyway? In the absence of
highway fatalities, auto insurance premiums and gridlock, racing
games are a virtual autobahn where you can drive as fast as you
want with complete disregard for speed laws or physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're flooring a Lamborghini Countach, your
immediate environment might as well feel like one big engine.
You're never going to drive that car in real life. Why not go for
the Spielberg version?
</P>
<P>
   There is the physical reality of driving: steering wheel,
pedals, rear-view mirror. And then there is the emotional
experience, the fantasy of driving, which begins the first time you
understand that the person in the front seat controls a car.
</P>
<P>
   Kids don't experience the physical reality of driving, but they
push toy cars around and say ``vrooom.'' They see pictures of cars
and learn about them. Later they fantasize about becoming race car
drivers. Playing computer games is part of that fantasy. Realism is
beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   But because steering a virtual car with a PC racing wheel
simulates the physical reality of a car (albeit with tremendous
distortion), it shapes your ideas about how driving should look and
feel, especially if you are too young to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   By the time teen-agers get car keys, many of them have been
driving for 10 years. They've been driving Indy 500 race cars,
monster trucks, jet skis, spaceships and 40-foot robots. They have
ideas about what a vehicle is and what it can do for you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they quickly find out that driving a car is not
nearly so dramatic as piloting vehicles through a video game. But
that's easy to accept because reality defines the difference
between a virtual car and a two-ton hunk of steel.
</P>
<P>
   Other disparities are harder to accept because they have to do
with the way you process information while you're driving. A real
car gauges fuel, speed, mileage, revolutions per minute. To read
that information, you have to look down, and you cannot change the
way it's displayed.
</P>
<P>
   In Need for Speed 3, your windshield has a heads-up display that
can be completely customized (analog or digital speedometer with
readings in miles or kilometers, a tachometer that magnifies around
the red zone, etc.). It's more like a fighter plane than a car and
without a doubt, it works better.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, when thin-film windshield displays roll off the General
Motors assembly line, car magazines will make a big deal about it.
And young adults will shrug because they will have 10 years of
experience driving with heads-up displays.
</P>
<P>
   And if they are nice, they will help their parents when the
windshield starts flashing ``12:00.'' &QL;

WHEN AN OFFICE STRIKES A POSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It's our dream,'' Stephen Gan said, surveying the
vast, gleaming-white new home of Visionaire, the avant-garde
quarterly that changes format with each issue and has developed an
international cult following among the increasingly entwined worlds
of art and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring 4,000-square-foot space at 11 Mercer St., which
includes a public gallery, is a luxury for the ambitious Gan, 33,
and his partners James Kaliardos, 32, and Cecilia Dean, 29, who
founded Visionaire in 1991 with $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Until two weeks ago, the three darlings of the Prada set were
operating out of a cramped space in a once-derelict carriage house,
a grim headquarters for a publication that is hand-assembled like
an artist's portfolio and strives to dazzle with a phantasmagoria
of visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   Like SoHo itself, which evolved from an artists' outpost to a
gallery haven to a minefield of designer boutiques and, most
recently, to the home of billionaires like Rupert Murdoch,
Visionaire is moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never worked in daylight before,'' Ms. Dean said, wearing
stark fashion black, as she glanced up at the huge skylight 30 feet
above her new desk. Even the cluster of crimson chairs from Herman
Miller appeared to strike a pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seven people working on top of each other, 15 during
deadlines,'' she recalled. ``It became insane when anyone dropped
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just anyone, of course. Last week, Isabella Blow, the wildly
eccentric stylist, arrived, wearing a twisted gold lame antler
headdress, a John Galliano ankle-length fur coat with
topaz-encrusted embroidery and fawn stilettos by Alexander McQueen.
``Aren't they divine?'' Ms. Blow, fashion director for The Sunday
Times of London, exclaimed, as Kaliardos writhed on the floor,
attempting to photograph her shoes. ``Don't you think they're so
Duchess-of-Windsor-on-acid?''
</P>
<P>
   A peril of their impressive new space, designed by the
husband-and-wife architectural team Neil Logan and Solveig
Fernlund, is the inevitable torrent of the fashionable who stop by
to pay court.
</P>
<P>
   Youthful models of astonishing beauty stopped by to drop off
their portfolios, the most ravishing surveyed by the bosses, while
a team of assistants sat mutely in awe.
</P>
<P>
   The public can drop in, too: the gallery opens Thursday, with a
lively exhibition of street scenes by the fashion illustrator Ruben
Toledo. The gallery's curved corners, Logan explained, ``were
designed to expand the sense of space and help create a futuristic
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   At $150 a pop, however, not everyone can afford Visionaire's
27th issue, ``Movement,'' which will be available at the gallery
and Rizzoli bookstores on March 1. The front cover presents the
supermodel Kate Moss on a swing, hurtling toward the viewer; on the
reverse, she is shown swinging from the back. The cover's
captivating overlapping images, by the photographer Nick Knight,
are reminiscent of the 3-D seaside postcards that wink saucily when
tilted. That technology, called multiphase lenticular imaging, can
now encompass 16 ``phases,'' permitting admirers of Ms. Moss to
savor her range of smiles, from winsome to euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured is the work of Sean Ellis, a young photographer _
artistic nudes of Joy Behrman, a Playboy model. ``Commercial work
pays the bills, but Visionaire provides artists with a platform for
more experimental work,'' Ellis said. ``I get to scratch a creative
itch.''
</P>
<P>
   Such experiments do not come cheap, even with the pro bono
exertions of friends like Ms. Moss and the couturier McQueen, who
styled her shoot and lent the dress. ``All our contributors work
for free, and we don't get paid salaries,'' Kaliardos said. ``It's
a tight operation.'' Circulation is a respectable 6,000, but
production costs for recent issues have rocketed to between 30 and
50 times the $10,000 start-up fund.
</P>
<P>
   So how can they afford a glamorous space, whose rent is said to
be nearly $100,000 a year? Income from other sources. Ms. Dean, a
former model, teaches design at the Parsons School; Kaliardos
moonlights as a makeup artist with the fashion photographers (and
Visionaire contributors) Richard Avedon and Steven Meisel. Gan,
Visionaire's creative director, whose magazine career began at
Details, most recently served as the art director for a Calvin
Klein jeans advertising campaign starring Ms. Moss. The ads are
appearing in 22 countries. ``It's Kate as the new Brooke Shields in
her Calvins,'' Gan said of a giant billboard dominating the corner
of Broadway and Houston Street.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a coincidence that the Calvin Klein campaign and
Visionaire's swinging Kate Moss cover surfaced the same week, or
slick synergy?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just turned out that way,'' Gan said coyly.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Visionaire was an escape from mass-market
fashion magazines. ``We all grew up looking at all those cheesy
high-gloss photos of models wearing ugly merchandise across from
ugly ads,'' said Gan. ``We wanted to do something purer, more
creative and personal.'' The issues are designed to be collectible
and free of advertising, which, Gan said, ``imposes certain
creative constraints.'' Innovative photographers like David
LaChapelle applaud the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having your work in a great group show,'' he said.
``You get the feeling of participating in a movement.''

 NEW YORK: a movement.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the magazine has transmogrified, however, from inexpensive
underground object to an ultraexclusive deluxe limited edition,
Kaliardos said, ``We're using more and more special effects, and
someone has to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's roster of established and emerging artists, as
well as its elite fashion following, draw corporate sponsors like
Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Prescriptives, the cosmetics company,
which underwrite issues (and receive lavish credit).
</P>
<P>
   Issue 18, ``Fashion Special,'' came wrapped in a custom-designed
satchel, courtesy of Louis Vuitton. For corporate sponsors eager to
improve their hip quotient, ``Visionaire is the ultimate marketing
tool,'' observed Tiffany Dubin, director of Sotheby's fashion
department. ``It's a subtler way to reach an elite audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they ever over budget? ``Each and every time,'' Gan said.
When an artist requires some expensive special effect, he added,
``Beauty usually wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The most extravagant issue was ``Light,'' the first
battery-operated publication. Its guest ``curator'' was Tom Ford of
Gucci, who conceived it as a light box containing transparencies by
24 artists, including the conceptualist photographer Inez van
Lamsweerde. Just 3,300 copies were made, and the price soared to
$425.
</P>
<P>
   One image that caused a few qualms was McQueen's contribution, a
photographic study of a penis. ``Tom Ford was delighted with it,''
Gan said, clearly impressed by such enlightened patronage.
</P>
<P>
   As the photographer Ellen von Unwerth said, ``The Visionaire
guys are still doing amazing, out-there work you can't publish
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, anyway. Gan's recent commercial triumphs may have given
him a taste for the marketplace. Looking around his giant office,
he expressed a sentiment that may seem heretical to Visionaire
purists. ``Right now, I'd love to start a new mass-market
magazine,'' he mused. ``With advertising.''  &QL;

THIS LITTLE PIGGY OFFERS ONE CUT THAT'S A GREAT BUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With one exception _ which savvy shoppers should note _
consumers aren't benefiting from the hard times hitting pig
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an oversupply of pigs, and farmers receiving $30 for a
hog that earned $60 a year ago, prices at the meat counter have
been steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for pork has risen 7 to 8 percent over the past two
to three years,'' says Robin Kline, director of consumer affairs
for the National Pork Producers Council. The increasing demand
allows supermarkets to keep prices at pre-surplus levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, you'll see some chains featuring pork chops,''
says Kline, ``but you're never going to see baby-back ribs on
special. Or tenderloins, because that's always been a highly
demanded cut.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one part of the hog has been on special regularly over
the winter months, and it's a prime part. Whole pork loins,
regularly priced at $3.99 a pound, are often featured at $1.99 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   This 6- to 7-pound roll of boneless pork is a boon for the
bargain-shopping home cook. Sold vacuum-packed and unfrozen, it can
be taken home and divvied up into a decent-size roast, stir-fry
pieces, cubes for kebabs, butterfly pork chops, and medallions or
scallops. And because there is no bone involved, only the most
basic butchering skills are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Start with one of the three pork loin recipes here.
</P>
<P>
   And remember when you're preparing pork that trichinae, our
mothers' great fear, are killed at 137 degrees. Cooking pork to
170-185 degrees, the temperature recommended in old cookbooks,
produces dry, overcooked meat.

scatter sliced garlic on bottom to provide a bed for the roast.
Place roast on garlic, fat side up. Place in middle of preheated
oven for 15 minutes. Turn oven to 300 degrees. Roast 1 1/4 hours
longer or until instant-read thermometer reads 150 degrees. Remove

</P>
<P>
   To prepare sauce, pour off fat and add wine to the roasting pan.
Bring to boil over high heat, scraping up any browned bits from the
bottom. Add stock and cook until the sauce is reduced by half. If
desired, strain the sauce. Taste and add salt and/or pepper as
needed. Slice pork and spoon sauce over the top.

   STIR-FRIED PORK WITH SPINACH
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1 pound pork loin, trimmed of external fat
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spinach, trimmed and well washed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoon peanut or other vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lime
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced scallion or 1/4 cup minced chives, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Slice pork as thinly as possible (it's easier if you freeze it
for 15-20 minutes). Cut slices into bite-size pieces, about the
size of a quarter. Chop or tear spinach coarsely.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, have all ingredients ready, including a
serving dish and cooked rice, if any. Preheat a wok or a large,
heavy skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Immediately
add half the peanut oil and all the pork. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until pork browns and loses all trace of pinkness,
about 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove pork to a bowl, and
lower heat to medium.
</P>
<P>
   Add remaining peanut oil to wok. Swirl it around and add garlic.
Stir once or twice. As soon as garlic begins to color _ about 15
seconds _ return heat to high and add spinach. Stir frequently,
just until spinach wilts, a minute or two longer.
</P>
<P>
   Add pork and stir for 1 minute. Add soy sauce and lime juice,
stir, turn off heat, garnish, and serve immediately.

total), trimmed of all external fat
</P>
<P>
   6 thin slices prosciutto

   6 large sage or basil leaves or 1 teaspoon dried sage or basil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil, or more if necessary
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine

<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic

<P>
   1/4 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup veal or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Using the flat side of a cleaver or meat mallet, gently pound
pork slices between two pieces of plastic wrap so that slices
measure 2 1/2 to 3 inches by 6 to 7 inches. They should be about
1/4-inch thick. Cover each slice with a slice of prosciutto and
place sage or basil leaf or a sprinkling of dried herbs on half of
each slice. Fold each slice in half over prosciutto and herbs; it
doesn't matter if some of the prosciutto sticks out around the
edges. Secure each packet with wooden toothpick. Season both sides
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in large, heavy skillet over high heat. Put in pork,
taking care not to crowd pan; fry in batches if necessary, adding
more oil as needed. Cook saltimbocca until lightly browned, 1 1/2
to 2 minutes on each side. Remove pork and set aside. Put in wine,
garlic and optional mushrooms and bring to a boil, scraping up any
browned bits from bottom of pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until wine
begins to reduce, then add stock and continue to boil until sauce
just turns syrupy. Taste for salt and pepper. Return saltimbocca to
pan and heat briefly in sauce to warm it through. (This time you
can crowd the pan if you need to.) Serve pork covered with sauce
and sprinkled with chopped parsley.

FARMERS HOPE TO REVIVE DEMAND FOR EMUS BY PEDDLING BYPRODUCTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When sizzling-hot grease popped out of the pan and singed the
wrist of a man frying funnel cakes at the Fort Worth Stock Show
this month, paramedics rushed the cook to a nearby booth where
North East Texas Emu was promoting new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some emu oil on his burn right away, and it worked just
great,'' says Buddy Williams, an emu farmer and distributor for
``Soft-as-Silk'' emu products.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wares have previously been called into emergency
service at a big event. Last summer, there was the Fire Ants
Festival in Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contestants try to see who can scoop the most fire ants into a
jar _ barehanded,'' Williams explains. ``There were two guys who
were stung from their fingertips clear up to their elbows. They
came running over to us, hollering, and we doped them down with emu
oil. Those fire ant stings didn't even fester.''
</P>
<P>
   On such testimonials are built the big bird's reputation for
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Although herds of the prolific birds have developed far more
quickly than the market for their meat _ leading to neglect and
abuse in a few well-publicized cases _ some emu farmers have begun
organizing co-ops to develop a market for oil, leather, feathers
and eggs, as well as the low-fat, iron-packed red meat.
</P>
<P>
   Only full use of the bird can return emu farming to the
profitable business it once promised, the Dallas-based American Emu
Association says.
</P>
<P>
   Emu oil, rendered from a layer of fat on the bird's back, was
first used as a traditional medicine throughout Australia by
aboriginal tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is popular in the alternative-medicine community for the
relief of skin conditions including psoriasis and eczema, contact
dermatitis, stretch marks, scars, rashes, rosacea, burns, chapped
skin and diaper rash. It is also used on skin after radiation
treatment and cosmetic peels. Lotions, bath crystals, lip balm,
shampoos, soap and jerky are among the new products being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Leonard of Marlow, Okla., who has a herd of 350 slaughter
birds, 40 breeders and about 600 eggs incubating, says people often
ask him what they should use emu oil for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, it's easier to tell you what not to use it for. Don't
use it for poison oak or poison ivy. It's good for everything
else,'' Leonard says. ``It's a carrier compound, used as a pain
reliever primarily. You can combine it with anything, and it will
carry it into the body.''
</P>
<P>
   To treat arthritis, sports injuries and other muscle and joint
sprains and strains, pain relievers including capsaicin, tea tree
oil, aloe vera, menthol and eucalyptus, are mixed with emu oil,
which better penetrates the skin and carries heat deeper into the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the emu oil has anti-inflammatory and
anti-bacterial properties. It penetrates and moisturizes,
revitalizes and restores skin with unsaturated and polyunsaturated
fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, laboratory testing has found that the oil
contains an unsaturated fatty acid known to ease joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Atkinson, sports medicine consultant and longtime trainer
for the Dallas Mavericks, says he has been using emu oil products
as part of his therapy programs for years.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson was formerly associated with Maxim Care of Temple, a
company that makes creams that are specially formulated for sports
injuries and arthritis, as well as formulations for skin care,
burns, insect bites and cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Care also produces gel caps of pure emu oil that can be
taken by mouth to help lower cholesterol and improve circulation,
provide arthritis relief and help regulate blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the emu trade are counting on the developing market for
emu-based products to keep their business viable. The initial
interest in the birds came in the late 1980s, when health-conscious
Americans began looking for alternatives to beef, and farmers
realized they could raise emus in small pastures under less
hospitable conditions than it took to raise beef.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole bird wasn't being used. The first emu oil products
produced in the United States did not hit the market until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working in the emu business for about 12 years, but
for a long time the birds were valued at a lot more for breeding
stock than for their products,'' says Sue Ricks, a spokeswoman for
Maxim Care. ``It was a breeders' market. Everyone was in the
breeding business.''
</P>
<P>
   Which meant that suddenly there were too many emus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very good at raising a lot of birds,'' Williams agrees.
``But somebody had to develop the market.'' To that end, he and
five other East Texas emu farmers recently formed a co-op to look
into the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to develop at least one segment of that emerging emu
byproducts market is Gary Gunn of Cresson, just southwest of Fort
Worth, who uses his emus' large, dark greenish-black eggs for
etching artwork. One egg takes him 10 to 12 hours to complete and
sells for about $150. Elvis, Marilyn Monroe and The Three Stooges
are among the famous likenesses etched into his beautiful eggs, but
he specializes in outdoor scenes and personalized custom designs.
With new emu products from oils to etched eggs being developed
every month and sale of the meat spreading worldwide, there should
never be an emu farmer who can't feed his livestock, says Donna
Womack of Fort Worth, who represents Texas on the national board of
the American Emu Association.
</P>
<P>
   A new brochure distributed by her organization claims that the
emu is totally usable livestock. ``Processed mainly for its meat,
hide and oil, it is also used for its feathers, eggs and
toenails.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, toenails. Jewelry is fashioned from them.
</P>
<P>

Texas Emu Association or where to find the products, call Donna
Womack at 236-3321 or the national office in Dallas at (214)

A NEW APPROACH TO KEEPING MORE AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An easy smile flashes across Brenda Gordon's face like sunshine
bursting through dark clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington, Texas, woman is remembering how her breasts
swelled during the last months of her pregnancy and the feeling of
fulfillment she had birthing her daughter, Genesis Alana.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Gordon says, she was the happiest she had been in her
life. For 10 years, nothing had been more important to her than
having a child.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a routine doctor's exam a year after the birth of
her daughter, she discovered that 12 of the lymph nodes in her
right breast tested positive for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For African-American women such as Gordon, such a diagnosis is
often viewed as a sure death sentence. Although black women have a
lower incidence of breast cancer, they continue to have the highest
breast cancer mortality rates of any ethnic group. According to the
American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for
African-American women is 70.6 percent, compared with 86.7 percent
for white women. And although breast cancer mortality rates
declined 6.1 percent for white women between 1990 and 1994, the
rate for African-American women dropped by about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Social, economic and cultural factors cause the difference,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Black women's cancer is often diagnosed at more advanced stages,
so educating them about the importance of self-examining their
breasts is crucial, said Debby Vigeland, chairwoman of the Tarrant
County Komen Race for the Cure, a fund-raiser of the Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to step up its attempt to reach this population and
reduce the number of deaths within it, the Susan G. Komen Breast
Cancer Foundation launched an African-American Women's Initiative
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dallas-based foundation has a long history of
funding national programs for the African-American community, this
is the first effort of its kind to bring together key experts in
the black community to come up with more effective ways of
educating women about breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very important to us,'' said Nancy Brinker,
Komen's founder. The mortality rate among black women ``screams one
thing: We have an obligation to help in this effort in any way we
can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the initiative, the foundation will identify existing,
community-based, early-detection programs that work _ including
some funded by Komen. Additional funding will be used to replicate
several programs in other parts of the country. Those programs
include the Witness Project, a national cancer education project
that targets churches and has an active program in Mount Pleasant;
the East-West Breast Express, which educates women through public
transit sites in Atlanta and Oakland, Calif.; and the Navigator
Program at Harlem Hospital Center in New York, which helps women
get from screening to diagnosis to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the best way to reach women is in venues in which
they are comfortable,'' Brinker said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with that philosophy, the Tarrant County affiliate
three years ago began an outreach effort in African-American
churches to drum up support for its Race for the Cure.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Wallace, a radiation therapist and chairwoman of the local
church teams, said that although more progress is necessary, great
strides have been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in one of three places,'' said Wallace, referring to
African-American women. ``In the mall shopping, the beauty shop or
the church. When I first started work on the race, there wasn't
much African-American participation. Now we have about 160 people
from 15 different churches. That was unheard of three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tarrant County affiliate raised $250,000 last year from its
race, Vigeland said. Of that, $10,000 was donated to the American
Cancer Society for use in its Church Connection Program. That money
was earmarked to fund early detection, education and patient
services, including screening and referral for underserved women in
the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's efforts have not been lost on Gordon, 46 and a
staunch supporter of the Race for the Cure, held across the country
to raise funds for breast cancer research, education and outreach.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, Gordon said, she shares her story as often as she
can, not only to encourage women who have breast cancer but also to
help raise awareness about the importance of self-exams.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon first inquired about the lump in her breast, she
said, her doctor explained it away, saying it was just milk. A year
later, when she went in for a routine exam, ``I asked him, `What
about my breast?' '' she said recently. ``He said, `What about it?'
''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Gordon said, she had a mammogram. A few days after
that, she had a biopsy and two days after that, a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon's story seems outrageous, it is hardly that unusual,
Vigeland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to be an advocate for yourself,'' Vigeland
said. ``Don't take everything someone tells you as the gospel
truth. Know your body better than anyone.''
</P>

Foundation, call (800) IM-AWARE or check the organization's Web

For more than 20 years, and 1,500 episodes of ``Yan Can Cook,'' he

dancing his cleaver over carrots and rehydrated black mushrooms.
Every show features at least one rat-tat-tat of knife work that
brings applause from his studio audience. In town to promote his
new book, ``Martin Yan's Feast: The Best of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay
Books, $34.95), Yan is nothing like his television persona. He's
intense and serious. He explains the dual personality succinctly.

The lunar new year kicked off Tuesday. But no one was sleeping

of weeks. For the Chinese and Koreans, this will be the Year of the
Rabbit; for the Vietnamese, the Year of the Cat. For all concerned,
it's a season of eating, gift-giving and symbolism. Houses are
cleaned to rid them of bad fortune. New clothes in bright colors
(particularly red) are readied. Homes are stocked with food and
flowers. ``No matter where you are,'' says Chinese master chef
Martin Yan, ``you try to go home for the new year.'' And one of the

 HOW SLAVES READ BETWEEN THE THREADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One scholar compared it to the Rosetta stone,'' said Jacqueline
L. Tobin, the author, with Dr. Raymond G. Dobard, of ``Hidden in
Plain View,'' a new book that makes a startling claim about quilts:
some quilts were patterned as a code to direct escaping slaves.
</P>
<P>
   A quilt with a monkey-wrench pattern hung in a cabin window
signaled slaves to gather tools for the escape. Tumbling blocks
indicated imminent departure. The number and placement of knots
represented dates.
</P>
<P>
   The book, just published by Doubleday, has become a surprise hot
seller. The story of its origin is as intriguing as its theory.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tobin, who is white, was first put on the trail in 1993 when
she met an African-American quilt maker, Ozella McDaniel Williams,
in the city marketplace in Charleston, S.C. Ms. Williams asked if
she knew that quilts had been used as a code on the underground
railroad. Returning home to Denver, Ms. Tobin, a professor of
women's studies at the University of Denver, enlisted Dobard, an
art history professor at Howard University and an African-American
quilter, to help research the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But in three years of telephone conversations with Ms. Williams,
Ms. Tobin was able to find out little more. Only when Ms. Tobin
returned to Charleston did Ms. Williams recite the code learned
from her mother: the Northern Star pattern suggested that escaping
slaves use the North Star for guidance; the Drunkard's Path pattern
advised taking an irregular course to avoid apprehension; Flying
Geese signaled the way north _ but only in the spring. These are
not exactly Rand McNally maps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a code has a long life in oral tradition.
Gladys-Marie Fry, a University of Maryland historian who
specializes in black folklore, said in ``Stitched from the Soul:
Slave Quilts From the Ante-Bellum South'' (Dutton) that a black
quilt was thought to indicate a safe house, for instance. Dr.
Robert Farris Thompson, a professor of art history at Yale
University and an expert in African-American esthetics, agrees that
the idea of a code makes sense. ``There is a distinct African
current in quilts that can absorb any number of codes,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But is the Rosetta stone as solid as it looks? Quilt codes are
not mentioned in contemporaneous accounts of the underground
railroad, and the code doesn't reach the systematic nature of, say,
the symbols scrawled on fences by tramps a century ago to set apart
friendly farms from hostile ones.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Michael Vlach, chairman of African-American studies at
George Washington University, reviewed an early proposal for the
book for a rival publisher and was not convinced. ``It's a nice
idea,'' he said, ``and it would be marvelous if we could prove it.
But from the evidence I don't see the smoking gun _ or quilt.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vlach argues that a quilt code goes against what we know of
slavery. While double meanings were an established part of slave
strategies of resistance, as in spirituals, a quilt code would have
been too risky. ``Penalties for taking slaves to freedom were so
severe that people would be much more circumspect,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was Ms. Williams, who died last May, really presenting the code
as a practical aid? As recited, it seems more inspirational than
navigational. Ms. Tobin recalled that Ms. Williams said over and
over of the code, ``It's all in your mind.'' To Ms. Tobin, this
meant the code was as much spiritual as practical. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tobin recognizes that Ms. Williams' account is a slim reed
on which to base a theory, and the authors buttress their text with
not one but three forewords from scholars in the field. ``She
played an incredible game of what I call `putting on the massa,'''
Ms. Tobin said of Ms. Williams, ``where you appear to be ignorant
or uneducated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams was, in fact, well educated, with a graduate degree
in chemistry. Ms. Tobin attributes her evasiveness to strong taboos
against sharing code information with whites. She hopes that
supporting evidence for the theory will emerge.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal of the story suggests that the most important
codes may be more abstract. Quilts have become powerful metaphors
in late-20th-century America, in sentimental books like ``How to
Make an American Quilt'' or in the political speeches of Jesse
Jackson. Quilt has largely superseded melting pot as an upbeat
metaphor for the juxtapositions of cultures.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Designs for escape or designs for the dream of escape, the
quilts raise a problem. To undervalue the oral and visual record
runs the risk of compounding the slave owner's crime of depriving
slaves of a written language. The faint signals of memorized codes
were among the few that slaves had power to send across the
generations. But to romanticize efforts to escape from slavery
underplays the hopelessness that made the institution so evil.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thompson suggests that quilts carry other codes. He praises
``their percussive flavors, vivid colors and offbeat visual
accents.'' African patterns survived in the quilts, working their
own random paths inside the box of the dominant culture, as the
quilt makers kept their identities alive inside the box of slavery.
They carry the emotional power of their makers' endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That code is forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sad but likely truth is that for many, if not most, quilts
were not the escape map but the only escape.

   Advertisers covet the youth market and the $130 million in
buying power it represents. Here are some ways parents can deal
with Internet advertising aimed at their children.
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER THAT THE WEB IS NOT TELEVISION: ``Not all
advertisements on the Internet look like commercials on TV,'' said
Jane Tallim, the education coordinator for the Media Awareness
Network. ``When you play games with product spokescharacters or
color and download their pictures, this is advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN ABOUT ADVERTISING: ``Kids need to know
they're being seduced, but you don't have to do it in a harsh
way,'' said Dr. Michael Brody, a child psychiatrist. ``It's like
dealing with sex in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CHILDREN UNDER 7: Many experts believe that
until age 7, children cannot distinguish between advertising and
content. ``I wouldn't let a child under 7 on the Internet alone any
more than I'd let them go to the 7-Eleven alone,'' said Anne
Taylor, co-director of the Media Awareness Network.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP AN EYE ON THE SCREEN: Parents should place household
computers in family rooms and other common areas where they can
monitor their children's Web habits.
</P>
<P>
   TEACH CHILDREN NOT TO GIVE OUT PERSONAL INFORMATION: Both
advertisers and critics agree about this issue. ``There is a hidden
cost when companies offer you free prizes, invite you to join a
club or ask you to register with their site before playing games,''
Ms. Tallim said. ``That cost is private information about you and
your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lascoutx, director of the Children's Advertising
Review Unit, an advertiser-financed agency that monitors adherence
to voluntary guidelines, backs a formal process by which parents
would have to give permission _ by phone, e-mail, fax or letter _
before children could turn over details that might allow others to
contact them. But Ms. Lascoutx acknowledged that the ability of Web
sites to collect data lags outstrips their power to notify parents.
``I wish they'd hurry up and give us a real neat technology to deal
with that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   BE WARY OF CHAT ROOMS: If your child does go into a chat room,
insist on the use of a nickname. ``Remember that companies or
others might be collecting information or guiding the discussion,''
Ms. Tallim said.

<P>
   In the waning moments of the 20th century, as the gap between
science fiction and science fact shrinks, technology fantasies are
becoming tougher to come by. Who, then, would not want to take a
bite out of the red planet?
</P>
<P>
   Mars 2112 (the year of this imagined convergence of the culinary
and the celestial), a new $15 million theme restaurant in
Manhattan, tries to create the experience of a meal on the planet
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fusion of fun and good food and fantasy,'' said
Paschal M. Phelan, an energetic businessman who is the founder and
principal stockholder in the company that operates the restaurant,
which opened in November.
</P>
<P>
   While not the first of its kind _ the Las Vegas Hilton in Nevada
houses Quark's Bar and Restaurant _ Mars 2112, with 33,000 square
feet, is the biggest, Phelan said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by way of a sunken plaza of the Paramount Building at
51st Street and Broadway, Mars 2112 exhibits higher technologies
from the first glance. A flying saucer 22 feet in diameter is
frozen in flight outside the front doors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is a shiny, slender space that looks like a Greyhound bus
station designed by NASA. Visitors are issued Martian Federation
visas and ushered to gates to await shuttles to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, shuttles _ really a motion ride that bumps, pitches and
sways for about five minutes through a computer-generated wormhole
to the fourth planet, tens of millions of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, patrons take a short walk over industrial-style
walkways suspended over pools of simulated bubbling lava. The
cavernous, 400-seat restaurant has two tiers and looks as if it's
ready for shooting to resume for the original ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   The only windows are those cut into the restaurant's rock walls
to offer glimpses of animated star fields and computer-generated
Martian landscapes. The restaurant has a bar for adults and a
computer-age arcade for youngsters called Cyber Street.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan said he planned to open restaurants in Boston, Washington
and, eventually, Europe, but he said technology had a special hold
on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it all started,'' said Phelan, who made his
fortune as a cattle farmer and beef processor in Europe. ``This is
where NASA is, the space program, Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not especially worried about whether the poor
performance of many theme restuarants these days would affect Mars
2112. He said his restaurant was built more around an event,
traveling to Mars, than around a theme.
</P>
<P>
   So what's on the table at Mars 2112? The fare ranged from the
familiar $10 hamburger and soda to ``Primary Orbits,'' which
included a $20 grilled salmon, $25 prime sirloin and $17 pan-seared
chicken breast served with lobster-tarragon risotto, which could be
washed down with a $75 bottle of Moet &AMP; Chandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole mission is to convince people that they are on
Mars,'' said Phelan. Besides, he said, beaming, it will be 113
years before anyone will know if he got it right.

SAN FRANCISCO FACES OVERHAUL OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The tentative settlement of a lawsuit that
sought to overturn the San Francisco's school desegregation system
would force the city to redefine diversity in the classroom and
rethink the means to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative settlement, reached Tuesday as a federal court
trial was about to begin, would topple the school district's
15-year-old admissions policy and phase out, by Dec. 31, 2002, the
annual $37 million in state aid that helps fund the desegregation
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the district will have to craft a
colorblind admissions system by mid-March, which is when school
assignments are made for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the desegregation policy was ordered in 1983, in
response to charges that the school district discriminated against
black children, the city's 62,000 students have been divided into
nine racial categories. No group could exceed more than 45 percent
of the students at any school, and at least four groups had to be
represented at every school.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Bill Rojas sees two key ways to ensure
integration without using race: redraw boundaries around schools to
enroll children from a variety of neighborhoods; or give enrollment
preferences to poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Students who live in public housing, for example, would have a
better chance at getting into a competitive school than a child
from a well-educated, middle-class family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new approach of looking at students' economic status is
cutting edge, and people consider it fundamentally more fair than
counting race,'' said Richard Kahlenberg, the author of several
books on class-based affirmative action, including ``The Remedy:
Class, Race and Affirmative Action.''
</P>
<P>
   The tentative settlement mandating the dramatic enrollment
changes comes five years after three Chinese-American families sued
the district, the state and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit alleged that the race-based desegregation
policy denied Chinese-American children the equal opportunity to
attend the schools of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tentative settlement, parents will no longer be
required to indicate a race when enrolling a child in school.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement stipulates that if the city's schools become
racially isolated, the NAACP will be able to go to court to ask for
a desegregation remedy, according to Daniel Girard, who represented
the Chinese-American plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also gives the district ample time to come up
with a financial backup plan to replace lost state funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1983 consent degree took effect, San Francisco schools
have received some $300 million to desegregate and create programs
aimed at boosting the academic performance of black and Hispanic
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the end of the consent decree money
is a serious hit to the district,'' said state Assemblywoman Carol
Migden, a San Francisco Democrat. ``But we will work together as a
Legislature to find ways to make sure San Francisco continues to
receive the support it requires. It won't necessarily be a
straightforward formula like it is now, but there are ways to
subsidize the district without pushing hot-button issues of race.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that government may use racial
quotas only in the rarest of circumstances, such as when state
authorities deliberately defy federal orders mandating
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Written statements made in recent months by U.S. District Judge
William Orrick, who signed the federal desegregation order in 1983
and was to preside over the trial, indicated that the district and
NAACP were heading for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks between the parties began last week and
continued through Monday, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard case to settle because everyone had a
deeply held principle,'' said David Levine, who also represented
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Steve Phillips, a defender of affirmative
action and an advocate for black children, said he was confident
the district would be clever enough to ensure diversity without
considering race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement does not mean the end of programs that are
necessary to address persistent inequities,'' Phillips said. ``This
is the beginning of a new approach to desegregation.''

A STORY OF LOVE, JOY AND LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a Valentine's Day story of a romance that managed to
flower 37 years after being nipped in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of Christy Kent and Bill Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   They first met while Bill was working as a teaching assistant
for Christy's father, Jack Kent, who taught physics and math at
Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was love at first sight,'' Bill said.
</P>
<P>
   They dated for four years. But, as Christy later told me, any
plans for marriage were discouraged by her parents. The couple bid
each other a painful farewell in May 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Bill graduated from A&AMP;M with a degree in physics. He moved to
California and went to work for North American Aviation (now Boeing
Corp.).
</P>
<P>
   Christy married and had two sons. She and her husband eventually
moved to Dallas, where the marriage ended in divorce after nearly
20 years. She later remarried, but that union was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Christy was a survivor. At 15, she was stricken with polio,
which left her left leg paralyzed. Then she survived the heartbreak
of her broken marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, she was told she had terminal breast cancer. She
had a double mastectomy, but doctors held little hope that she
would live. She was told to ``go home and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she opted to have radiation and chemotherapy. The
treatment was devastating, but she survived.
</P>
<P>
   Through all these years, she never stopped loving Bill Thurman.
She often wondered what he was doing. She assumed that he had
married.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she supported herself as a teacher in the
Dallas public school system. Several times, she tried to muster the
courage to find out Bill's address so she could write him a letter.
But being a child of an era in which women were not expected to be
so ``forward,'' she always backed away from the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Christy, Bill had contacted her parents in 1963 in an
effort to get her address. He said they declined to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, one of Christy's fellow teachers provided
sufficient encouragement for her to decide to write the man who was
still the love of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that A&AMP;M kept close tabs on former students, Christy
called the ex-students office and asked a clerk for the address of
William R. Thurman. The clerk not only provided an address in
California but also informed Christy that Bill had never married.
</P>
<P>
   So Christy, her heart pounding, wrote Bill. She simply said she
was hoping they could still be friends and asked that he give her
``one phone call'' so they could chat. There was no profession of
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``But her message came through clearly,'' he told me last week.
``... I had never stopped loving her. That's why I never married.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill received Christy's letter on Feb. 7, 1998. But there was a
problem: She had not included her phone number. A call to
information was futile. Christy had an unlisted number.
</P>
<P>
   So Bill wrote back immediately. She got the letter containing
his phone number when she returned home from school Feb. 11. She
called him immediately, and they talked for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bill was in Dallas two days later.
</P>
<P>
   They were married Nov. 14. Two days later, they flew to Italy
for a two-week honeymoon. That is where my wife and I met them.
</P>
<P>
   There were many stairs to be climbed, many hills to be navigated
as we toured Italy. Christy, with a cane in one hand and Bill
holding onto her other hand, managed to climb most of them. You
could tell it was painful at times. But Christy had learned long
ago to survive life's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   She and Bill told me their love story one morning while we ate
breakfast in a large dining room overlooking an orange grove in
Sorrento.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never know how happy he has made me,'' the
58-year-old bride said of her 62-year-old mate.
</P>
<P>
   I later shared their story with several of our fellow tourists.
``You should write about that in one of your columns,'' one told
me. ``It is such a lovely love story.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the middle of last month, I called to ask their permission
to tell their story. Christy was a bit reluctant but finally gave
her permission.
</P>
<P>
   I explained that I had a couple of other projects in the works
and that I would call back in a couple of weeks to fill in some
details.
</P>
<P>
   I made that call the night of Feb. 5. Bill answered, and I told
him why I was calling and said that I wanted to speak to Christy
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have terrible news for you, Phil,'' Bill said, grief etched
in his voice. ``Christy died a week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   She was stricken with a neurological seizure at Skyline High
School, where she taught English. That triggered a cardiac arrest.
She died in a hospital two days later without regaining
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it is a beautiful story that should be told,'' I
told Bill after recovering from my shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree,'' he replied. ``And I think Christy would have wanted
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thanked God for the months they had together.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is preparing to return to his home in California, where he
and Christy were going to live after her retirement next year.
</P>
<P>
   He will return home with a broken heart held together by the
memories of the happiest months of his life.

   More than 100 persons have been nominated for this year's Nobel
Peace Prize. Oh, great. Something else for people to fight over.
</P>
<P>
   On their trip to Mexico, Bill and Hillary Clinton spent nearly
three hours having dinner with the country's president and his
wife, who no doubt were careful not to serve peach mints.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is the second largest market for U.S. exports, behind
only Canada. Bet some of what the Mexicans buy is stuff to sell to
American tourists so they'll feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   For Valentine's Day, Mr. Clinton gave his wife a gold
heart-shaped pin. No word on what she gave him. Maybe her own vote
for acquittal?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore called the impeachment trial votes ``a reaffirmation of
the wisdom of our founders.'' This guy could have been president.
Why is he so happy?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the impeachment trial is over, Republicans seem to be
working to make sure people don't think GOP stands for Get Our
President.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says he's ``profoundly sorry'' for what he said and
did that led to the impeachment trial. That may have been the only
pro part to this whole amateurish affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton scandal note: If, a year from now, you can still
identify Andrew Bleiler, Lucianne Goldberg and William Ginsburg,
you need to get a life.

   Hillary Rodham Clinton is deciding whether to run for the Senate
from New York. The state, apparently, is now some kind of Arkansas

   Whatever was causing all those American Airlines pilots to be
ill must have been contagious. It quickly made passengers both sick

SNOWBOARDING BECOMES A SIZZLING ACTIVITY FOR ADULTS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIM McHUGH  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On any given slope in North America, it might appear that
snowboarders outnumber skiers.
</P>
<P>
   While statistics indicate that isn't true, snowboarders are
proliferating. Once dominated by teen-age boys rebelling against
their skiing parents, the sport is attracting children, young
girls, Generation Xers and people over the age of 40 in record
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A report from Snowsports Industries America indicates that
snowboarding is America's fastest growing winter sport, with
ridership up nearly 33 percent from 1996. Snowboard equipment sold
at chain sporting goods stores was up 86 percent over last year and
snowboard clothing increased a whopping 151 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers are indicative of the booming numbers of boarders
visiting resorts (23 percent of resort visitors are snowboarders)
and resorts project that, in five years, nearly 35 percent of their
guests will be riders.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so your child or children want to be part of this wave. The
first thing you want to do is get the proper equipment. To learn
more, pick up one of the major snowboard magazines: Plow, Snowboard
Life, Snowboarder, TransWorld SNOWboarding, and Fresh and Tasty.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about gear gives you a basic understanding of the boards
or ``decks,'' how to select a boot and binding system and whether
your child rides regular or goofy footed.
</P>
<P>
   Regular means your child stands on the board leading with his or
her left foot, while goofy is leading with the right. Before you
commit to the sport by purchasing gear for your child, rent. This
allows them the opportunity to check out various decks, as well as
the many boot and binding systems.
</P>
<P>
   Novice riders shouldn't attempt a trip down the slope without
two essentials: lessons and safety gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the leading causes of injury is learning from
friends,'' says Kevin Delaney who, with his brother Brian, operates
the Delaney Snowboarding Camps at Copper Mountain, Colo. ``You may
look like (bad) on the bus with your way-cool board and sunglasses,
but if you're crashing down the mountain all day, it is
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   A former International Snowboard Federation world champion,
Kevin Delaney believes that learning to snowboard without lessons
is like going scuba diving or skydiving without lessons. Don't do
it.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be a snap to encourage your grommet (slang for a
young snowboarder) to take lessons, it could be a harder sell for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest they disappear, take lessons away from the pack and
come back riding like a superstar,'' Delaney says. ``They'll have
sound skills and members of the opposite sex will be all over them.
In the course of a snow sport vacation, the first two days should
be devoted to lessons. Don't let your child near the slopes without
wrist guards, a tailbone pad, knee pads and a helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   During a fall, a snowboarder will try to break it by extending
his or her arms. This accounts for the high incident of wrist
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbles in any direction can lead to concussions, which is why
the helmet is so important. Be safety conscious and outfit your
child properly. Once your child has begun to master the sport, he
or she will gravitate toward a style of riding. Freestyle
incorporates tricks launched from the halfpipe, an area sculpted in
the snow for getting airborne and performing special maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   It also involves snow-covered ramps called kickers, which are
also sought for doing tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Freeriding includes traveling through powder snow or any stretch
of wide-open terrain, while bordercross combines aspects of
motocross racing and freestyle snowboarding. Finally, slalom
invites riders to race around gates, as in the recent Olympics in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   For teen-agers, snowboarding is more than an activity, it is a
lifestyle. It has its own personality, music, fashion and
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   This anti-establishment, extreme sport image is exactly what is
attractive to teens. As a side benefit to parents and teens, the
sport translates into exercise _ which is cool for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think snowboarding enables teens to go to the slopes with
their parents, but still maintain their identity,'' says Joan
Christensen, communications director at Winter Park Resort in
Colorado. ``They like that mom and dad are buying lift tickets and
lunch, but they can hang with their buddies. It's a win-win deal.''

<P>
   Not long ago, users of telephone headsets tended to be workers
like telephone operators, telemarketers and airline
reservationists. Corporate executives who wanted to free up their
hands during long phone conversations invariably chose speaker
phones _ despite the fact that they offered less privacy and
questionable sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   But the need for multitasking, at work and at home, has changed
that. Think of Tom Cruise screaming, ``Show me the money!'' into
the microphone of a headset in the movie ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be a stretch to say headsets are hip, but they are
certainly becoming more and more useful. A workplace populated with
cubicle dwellers means speaker phones are less practical. And
nobody can just talk on the telephone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone are the days when you put stuff in your Out basket and
gave it to your administrative assistant,'' said Tom Benoit,
marketing communications manager for Plantronics, in Santa Cruz,
Calif., which says it is the leading maker of headsets in the
United States. ``The demand on workers to perform many functions at
once has increased. Today, you'll probably have to do your own
filing while you talk on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of at-home workers has prompted large
retail outlets like Radio Shack and Staples to sell headsets, once
available only through employers or office supply catalogs. Now
anyone who needs to type on a computer, open mail, punch a
calculator or apply fingernail polish while talking on the phone
may want to buy a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Plantronics began selling headsets, a fairly simple technology
involving a speaker and a microphone, in 1962. Its products were
worn by astronauts on the Apollo space missions.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are 125 million workers in the United States, and
about 10 million use the phone four or more hours each day, making
them prime candidates for a headset, said a Plantronics
spokeswoman, Anne Friscia. She said the market for headsets was
estimated at $452 million in 1997 and was increasing at a rate of
17 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond multitasking, one reason for the growing popularity of
headsets is a heightened awareness among workers of the damage that
can be caused by cradling a telephone handset (or an ever smaller
cellular phone) between your head and your shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University,
said the practice of bending your neck and raising one shoulder to
hold the phone so your hands can be free could change the shape of
the spine. ``You end up with restricted range of motion and with
back, neck and shoulder problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge said maintaining such a posture for a prolonged period
could cause symptoms similar to those associated with carpal tunnel
syndrome, a common workplace ailment that involves tingling and
pain in the hands and fingers and is caused by compression of
nerves in the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The median nerve that goes down to the fingertips starts at
your neck,'' Hedge said. ``If you trap that nerve at the neck, you
get the same tingling sensation in the fingers that you get by
trapping the nerve at the wrist. There's some evidence that in a
number of cases of what's diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome, the
problem isn't inside the wrist, it's at the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers make headsets in a range of styles, including
traditional over-the-head models, headsets that fit over the ear or
inside the ear, ultralight models that weigh less than one-third of
an ounce and headsets for mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone headsets designed for office use range in price from
about $50 to $250, and most provide such features as mute buttons,
volume controls and automatic sound protection that keeps incoming
noise _ like that emitted by fax signals _ at comfortable levels.
</P>
<P>
   Good-quality headsets also have static-resistant components and
adjustable headbands, and many offer microphones with
noise-canceling capability to cut out background sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Customers should be wary, however, of changes in technology that
may make a headset bought today obsolete in a matter of months. A
cordless headset telephone manufactured by Aastra Telecom and sold
by Bed, Bath and Beyond for $89.99 failed to work when tested in
December, and the only advice from the company's technical support
line was to send it back and get a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But when a replacement was requested, a company spokeswoman said
the product was being discontinued in favor of another model using
new technology, to be offered sometime this spring.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of voice recognition technology and Internet
telephony, many manufacturers now make headsets that allow a user
to switch between a personal computer and a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The Andrea Electronics Corp. of Queens, N.Y., recently
introduced the first desktop device that lets headset users connect
to a telephone and a PC simultaneously, without having to pause to
switch back and forth. A user can have a conversation on the
telephone while simultaneously having a microphone pick up the
conversation and, through voice-recognition software, enter it as
text into a PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Andrea Connect Solutions Personal Computer-Telephone
Interface, or PCTI (list price, $149.95) and Andrea Provoice
Solutions headsets ($99.95 and $124.95) can be purchased via the
company's Web site, at www.andreaelectronics.com; the customer
service department, at (800) 707-5779, or though Wal-Mart on line,
at www.wal-mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   The headset models described here were tested on a home
telephone system. They range in price from about $70 to $220 (for
headset and amplifier). Two are designed to work with an amplifier
attached to a telephone. One is a telephone and the other a headset
that attaches to a telephone without an amplifier. There are other
models on the market; these are simply some of the more common,
easily available ones.
</P>
<P>
   GN NETCOM PROFILE SUREFIT 405-FLEX ($112).
</P>
<P>
   This is the only three-in-one headset (traditional headset plus
ear loops and ear hooks) on the market, and is made by Plantronics'
chief competitor, GN Netcom, based in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The headband can be converted to be worn with ear loops or ear
hooks, which are often preferred by people who wear glasses. The
MPA-II amplifier ($108) is relatively easy to install, and the
Profile headband is comfortable and weighs slightly less than the
Plantronics Duoset headset.
</P>
<P>
   Sound quality was generally good, but there was a bit of static
in the background. This model has a quick disconnect feature, which
allows you to unplug the headset from the unit easily. (GN Netcom
products are sold through distributors. To find one near you, call
GN Netcom at (800) 826-4656.)
</P>
<P>
   PLANTRONICS DUOSET CONVERTIBLE HEADSET ($100). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This headset can be worn over the head or with one of three ear
hooks of different sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The VISTA UNIVERSAL AMPLIFIER ($120) is easy to install and
allows you to use the headset with a phone.
</P>
<P>
   The headband is comfortable and sturdy. Sound quality is
excellent. The headset also has a quick-disconnect feature and a
cord that is slightly longer than GN Netcom's Flex headset.
(Information on buying Plantronics products can be found on the
company's Web site, at www.plantronics.com; to find a distributor
in your area, call (800) 544-4660.)
</P>
<P>
   RADIO SHACK SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT TELEPHONE HEADSET ET-153
($69.99). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a small phone attached to a headset, so no separate
amplifier is needed. The headset is noticeably less comfortable
than either the Duoset by Plantronics or the Profile by GN Netcom.
But sound quality is good.
</P>
<P>
   Because the telephone keypad is designed to hook onto your
waistband, the headset cord is very short. If you find it awkward
to hook the keypad onto your clothing, as I did, and would rather
leave the keypad on the desk as you type into your computer, this
headset is frustrating to use.
</P>
<P>
   There is no quick-disconnect function, so you can easily forget,
step away from your desk and find that the keypad has fallen on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   PLANTRONICS PLX-500 ($79.99). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This headset includes an amplifier. The headband is not as
comfortable as the Duoset or the Profile _ it is slightly heavier
and is difficult to adjust for a good fit. It would be acceptable,
though, for someone who is not on the phone for several hours every
day. The headset cord is long enough but is not flexible, so it
cannot be lengthened, as the more expensive Duoset and Profile
cords can.
</P>
<P>
   Sound quality is good, although the device has an annoying
tendency to fade in and out when the caller is dialing a number on
a touch-tone phone. One person who received a call reported a
slight echo.

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Microsoft never suggested in a 1995
meeting with Netscape officials that ``a line be drawn'' to
illegally divide the Internet browser market, a Microsoft executive
said Tuesday. Released testimony by Daniel Rosen in the federal
antitrust trial contradicted a potentially damaging assertion made
earlier by Netscape's chief executive officer, James Barksdale.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All right, so it's not a palace. Maybe you just
bought it. Maybe you just looked around and, for the first time,
spotted the cracked plaster, the 20 or 30 coats of paint, the
stains on the floors, the exposed electrical conduit and the
unmentionable kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time for a renovation.
</P>
<P>
   You're in good company. In the last quarter of 1998, homeowners
spent $87.9 billion on renovations, 15 percent more than in the
same quarter two years earlier, according to the Joint Center for
Housing Studies at Harvard University. But with every dream of
renovation, whether it involves building a sun room or adding a
closet rod, comes the inevitable panic: assuming you've decided not
to do the job yourself, using your house as a lab experiment, how
do you find the right professional to help?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the budget or inclination for a big
architect-designed renovation, which could run to $75,000 for a
one-bedroom apartment, you'll probably hire a general contractor to
manage the job, including plumbing, wiring, tiling and carpentry.
How to weigh the widely varying, often impenetrable bids when they
arrive? What will the contractor expect from you? The questions are
as nerve-racking as finding the apartment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The House &AMP; Home section set out to see what an average
homeowner goes through during the initial bidding process, in hopes
of making it easier to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   A friend had just bought a down-at-the-heels one-bedroom
apartment in the East 80s and had no idea where to start, so I
borrowed it in a test to see what could be learned about hiring an
all-purpose general contractor at a reasonable price. I started as
so many homeowners do: asking for recommendations from friends,
along with building superintendents and the real estate agent who
brokered the purchase. Then I invited five contractors to see the
apartment, checked their references and, finally, analyzed their
bids. Over a decade, I have acted as my own general contractor on
11 house and apartment renovations. I thought I knew the territory.
(New lesson: Don't greet a contractor with, ``Now, I don't want to
spend a lot of money on this job.'' They don't like it.)
</P>
<P>
   For all the reported rush to renovate, we found that New York
City is still full of contractors eager to work _ all five said
they could begin almost immediately. One offered an especially low
rate because, he said, ``February is a dead month.''
</P>
<P>
   The contractors bid on what the owner actually asked for. No
walls in the 900-square-foot apartment had to be removed and no
rooms reconfigured _ that would require building permits _ and it
was easy to separate the overall job into small ones. The entire
apartment was to be plastered with a light coat of wallboard
compound mixed with plaster (a ``skim coat'') and painted. All
floors needed to be sanded and given two coats of polyurethane. The
chipped baseboard was to be replaced with gutsy seven-inch molding.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen required complete remodeling. Old plastic-laminate
cabinets had to go, along with the orange and brown tile floor,
which looked like linoleum. We asked for custom-made raised-panel
cherry cabinets and new ceramic tiles. The plumbing had to be
changed, too, so the dishwasher could be nearer the table, and the
electrical conduit on one wall needed to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   To allow more room for a table in the kitchen, it seemed like a
good idea to move the doorway 18 inches to the right, also
improving the view from the front door: a visitor then would face
the Art Deco casement window, not a stove full of pots.
</P>
<P>
   The owner had one eccentric request: he didn't want to look at
the window air-conditioners nine months of the year, so we asked
the contractors to bid on a replacement window enclosure that could
be bolted in and then taken out in summer. They also bid on
building a new radiator front and adding a granite kitchen
windowsill. Finally, they were asked to remove the shelves in one
closet and replace them with a simple rod.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors did not have to supply materials: paint, new
appliances, a new granite counter or the new baseboard. Since they
were bidding on labor only, it would be easy to compare bids.
Although contractors would have preferred it, we didn't give them a
budget. We wanted to see what they would come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Nap, as he likes to be called professionally, was there
early, waiting by the curb in a fire-engine-red Jeep Cherokee. He
wore a satin baseball jacket the color of blueberry sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that your real name?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``No, it's Napolitano,'' he said with a certain
practiced air. ``You know, a fine Irish boy!''
</P>
<P>
   Nap, 50, hustled into the apartment and headed toward the ugly
air-conditioners. ``Is this building a landmark?'' he asked in
reference to changing the window. ``If it is, you can forget about
it.'' (It isn't, so no additional permit was needed.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bumpy walls and ceiling, Nap did not favor skim
coating. ``Forget about it,'' he said again. ``You'll save yourself
a bundle, and no one will know.'' But he agreed to estimate the job
both ways _ just repairing the cracks, then skim-coating and
painting the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Nap, who lives in the Bronx, advocated stock kitchen cabinets _
they're much cheaper _ but agreed to estimate the cost of
custom-made cherry cabinets, too.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes after he arrived, he was gone. ``All right,
sweetheart,'' he said, ``I'll be back to you in a day or two.'' And
he was. His bid: $30,363.
</P>
<P>
   Next to arrive was Thomas Breslin, 48, a soft-spoken man with a
workshop in Brooklyn. He noticed a thin molding separating the
curve of a white ceiling and beige walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to pull that molding off, you'll need to decide
how you're going to handle the transition,'' he said, the only one
who pointed this out. ``Do you want to paint the room all one color
or try to paint a straight line in the middle of the curve running
around the top of the room?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. The room, we decided, would be painted one light
color. He said that Benjamin Moore paint was reliable but that he
preferred Sherwin-Williams: ``Just as reliable, with more colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslin studied where the replacement window frame would go,
trying to figure out how he would attach Plexiglas or glass to the
existing frame. He decided to use glass encased in an aluminum
frame.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, he discovered a place where the half-inch
plywood subfloor could be seen under the tile. Like three other
contractors, he hedged his bid in case the subfloor was rotten and
couldn't be saved when workers removed the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin was the only contractor who gave his source for kitchen
cabinets. ``Go to the Little Wolf Cabinet Shop on 82nd and First
Avenue,'' he said. ``He'll come here and measure and install them.
Just tell him Tommy sent you.'' (The cabinetmaker's bid for the
cabinets _ $3,400 _ is figured into Breslin's bid.)
</P>
<P>
   He stayed to chat. ``Some contractors don't want to give
anything away,'' he said.``I figure I'm not going to lose the job
because of it, and maybe I'll get the job because I did.'' In the
end, Breslin bid $20,325, making him a definite contender.

 NEW YORK: definite contender.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Rooney, 34, a lanky man, was the most serious of the
group. He took extensive notes during his 20-minute visit. For the
walls and ceiling, he recommended fiberglass mesh on the old
plaster, then a skim coat. ``If you're going to go to the trouble
of skim coating,'' he said, ``you might as well do the job right.''
In my opinion, the walls weren't bad enough for so drastic a
solution. He agreed to bid the job as requested.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney, who is based in Queens, was the first to submit his bid:
$26,814, not including kitchen cabinets, which could easily add
more than $3,000. When he was informed that he was going to be part
of this article, he reacted angrily, saying he did not ``need any
publicity _ we've got plenty of work.''
</P>
<P>
   When David E. Lane, 33, is not working as a contractor, he's a
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who lives in Manhattan, furnished the longest list of
references: six pages. He was also the only contractor to arrive
with a contract, an involved document that was only slightly
off-putting. ``I like taking care of all these details before the
job starts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Lane considered laying new 12-inch ceramic floor
tile on top of the existing 8-inch tiles to save time. He said he
would replace the doorsill with a slightly higher one to make up
for the extra depth of the new tile _ an idea I found fraught with
peril, considering the unknown quality of the subfloor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his ``for February only'' price came in at $18,880.
</P>
<P>
   With his echo-chamber voice and black leather jacket, not to
mention his bearing, Mark William Stewart, 44, has to be an actor _
and he is.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a contractor with strong opinions. Stewart, who is
based in Manhattan, wrote in his bid: ``I've never heard of a
kitchen without a silverware drawer, and wouldn't want to leave my
silver sitting out in the grime, soot, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after he learned that his bid _ $32,250 _ was higher than
those of other contractors, he generously offered less expensive
suggestions, faxing a fact sheet on a Marvel under-counter
refrigerator that he said could be bought for $649. (It was a good
tip: the refrigerator is half the street price of the Sub-Zero
245.)
</P>
<P>
   For an owner, and even for an experienced renovator, choosing
among the contractors would be a tough choice. It isn't just about
the lowest bid; it's the quality of the work.
</P>
<P>
   So I visited projects that each man had given as a reference and
found Nap himself working on a job on Central Park West, fitting
the kitchen cabinets himself. At the other contractors' job sites,
already finished, the owners were pleased with the work and went
out of their way to praise the contractors for their spirit and
willingness to return to make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to analyze the bids, double-checking with the
contractors on points that were unclear. For instance, Stewart came
in significantly higher than the other contractors for the kitchen
cabinets. When questioned, he explained that he had added in the
cost of granite counter tops, to be supplied by the owner. Subtract
$1,200 from his bid. Stewart's figure for the kitchen floor
included a new plywood subfloor that might not be required. For the
electrical work, he added in items like track lighting, which he
said he was ``sure the owner would want later.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his bid, the highest of the group, Stewart said:
``Maybe I overanticipated. I knew what I would have done. If I had
just stuck to exactly what was stated, I would have come in lower.
I thought about it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Stewart's bid on the skim-coating and painting was
lower than those of the others because he knows an excellent
painter who was giving him a lower price ``as kind of a personal
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslin, whose bid for sanding and refinishing the floors was
lowest, explained that he knew an experienced floor sander who
would work cheaply. His $1,200 bid for moving the kitchen door was
also lowest. ``I had just done the exact same job in a doctor's
office,'' he said, ``and I knew exactly how much it costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a contractor also depends on his subcontractors, Breslin
offered to allay any uncertainty about the quality of his
subcontractor's paint job by sending him to the apartment to do a
finished patch on the wall if he landed the job.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, whose bid for painting and plastering was low, said he
planned to do the painting himself, cutting the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I found the bids, which varied by nearly $14,000,
within the bounds of fairness. And they could be fine-tuned _
Stewart's bid presents a good example of how a contractor, having
overestimated several items, will renegotiate. To choose among
contractors who have references like those of these five and whose
completed jobs reflect similar competence, a homeowner might best
follow the advice of Breslin, the philosopher-contractor:
</P>
<P>
   ``Go with your gut,'' he said. ``If you don't get along with the
contractor at the beginning _ or if he's late or full of excuses _
it's only going to get worse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Relating to Contractors: Prenuptial Agreements Can Help
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years' experience working with general contractors has
yielded these insights about what to look for and to look out for
in the first interview.
</P>
<P>
   PROMPTNESS If he can't show up on time for the initial meeting,
what will he be like after he's pocketed your down payment?
</P>
<P>
   GREED Does he rush to talk about payment? A contractor is smart
to ask when he can begin work: for one thing, he's trying to judge
if you're a serious customer. But too much money talk at this stage
is troubling. He should wait until he gets the job to hammer out
payment schedules.
</P>
<P>
   CAGINESS When you ask about references _ which you should do at
this point _ does he say he will get back to you (after he enlists
his brother-in-law)? Try to find out about his most recent jobs and
ask to see them. A continuing job is best: drop in without an
appointment and hope to find the contractor there, supervising. And
ask for proof of liability insurance, which is required if you're
in a co-op. (Even if you aren't, it's important.)
</P>
<P>
   RAPPORT Don't underrate it. You're embarking on a long, long job
(even if it's only a month), and lawsuits can make it a lot longer.
Don't be afraid to ask any question. Do it now rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors size up customers, too. Here is what they look for
and look out for in a client, based on interviews with the
contractors who bid on this job:
</P>
<P>
   STINGINESS The contractor has to be sure of getting his money if
he completes the work satisfactorily. Contractors say that one
client trick is not to pay the last third. (Jobs are usually paid
in thirds.) They say the homeowner knows a contractor probably
won't go to court over the payment. ``If the first thing out of
your mouth is, `Now, I don't want to spend a lot of money on this
job,' I'm already walking out the door,'' Thomas Breslin said.
</P>
<P>
   WILLINGNESS TO STATE A BUDGET Three of the five contractors
asked for a budget and were disappointed _ some more than others _
not to get one. They feel that if the owner is honest about what he
can spend, they can respond accurately: if the budget is low, they
won't include gold faucets and fancy woodwork in their estimate.
</P>
<P>
   RAPPORT This goes both ways. ``I'm essentially going to be wed
to these people, and it's a shotgun wedding,'' Mark William Stewart
said. ``The level of trust is paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   EXPERIENCE Ideally, contractors like it if the client has been
through at least one other renovation. ``It's the virgins who are
the worst!'' Stewart said.

NEWS WATCH: PALM-SIZED COMPUTER _ WITH ENHANCEMENTS GALORE

<P>
   The battle for the palm-sized computer market is about to become
a little more colorful. Compaq Computer Corp. is set to release its
new Aero 2100 unit next month, and one of the standout features of
the device is its 256-color high-resolution display. Although
3Com's Palm Pilot offers thousands of programs that run on the Palm
OS, Compaq is taking a different route with the Aero 2100. It uses
the Windows CE operating system, runs on a rechargeable lithium ion
battery and contains more on-board RAM (16 megabytes) than many
desktop PCs did just a few years ago. Pricing for the device has
not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 2100 also has a slot for interchangeable cards that can
add such enhancements as a 56K modem, a pager card, 20 to 40
megabytes of additional RAM or a bar code scanner. With all of its
ambitious features, the Aero 2100 is not likely to enter the
marketplace quietly _ it also has voice recording and playback
ability.

   A Different Kind of Mouse
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley company hopes to replace the mouse with the
parrot. The bird in question is not a piece of hardware but an
animated on-screen parrot that responds to voice commands.
</P>
<P>
   The parrot, named Prody, is programmed to perform certain tasks
like opening applications, notifying users when e-mail arrives and
permitting them to browse the Web via voice commands. It also can
remind users about forthcoming appointments, read news headlines
from the Internet in a synthesized voice and give real-time stock
quotes, so they can know when the portfolio has gone to the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The power behind Prody _ made by Mindmaker, a company based in
San Jose, Calif. _ is artificial intelligence and
speech-recognition technology that enables it to accept voice
commands and learn the user's preferences. In that regard, Prody is
not flying solo: a handful of companies are working with both
technologies to create on-screen digital assistants and, in some
cases, digital pets.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Prody, its makers contend the $100 multicolored
African parrot is a breed apart because it integrates numerous of
the functions into a single software beast.
</P>
<P>
   But lovers of the mouse need not fear its extinction. Even when
parrot users are on the telephone, talking to friends or otherwise
don't want their virtual parrot to be listening, they'll have to
switch off the microphone used to direct Prody and turn to the
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Chat Room to Telephone
</P>
<P>
   It's late at night in the online chat session. The virtual
discussion is getting hot and heavy, and it's time to take it to
the next step. No, not actual in-person interaction (that would
still would be too ``real''), but that old-fashioned form of
interplay known as a telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Enter AT&AMP;T, which is marketing a new service to let chatters
turn their online discourse into telephone talk, but with a catch:
the telephone connection will be dialed by a computer so that the
participants won't know one another's phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Chat 'N Talk'' is that chatters may want to
talk by phone, but also retain some of the anonymity provided by
the Internet. That way, they know they won't wind up being cold
called or harassed by the participant of some chat session gone
sour (or by some disappointed online romancer who finds out that
the object of his affections is not a 21-year-old Sports
Illustrated Super Model, but ``Hank,'' 49-year-old trucker from Des
Moines).
</P>
<P>
   The second catch is that the service is not cheap. It costs 15
cents a minute, which is charged to the credit card of the chatter
who initiates the ``Chat 'N Talk'' experience. Presently, the
service is available in chat rooms on two portals, Excite and
Lycos, is being integrated into I-village, a site geared toward
women, and AT&AMP;T said it also is negotiating for a similar
arrangement with Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   A Cartoon Series _ for the Web
</P>
<P>
   Showtime Networks Inc.'s new animated series, called
``WhirlGirl,'' will debut later this month, but not on television.
The show, about a 21st century super heroine who takes on the evil
high-tech media empire, is will be seen exclusively on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``WhirlGirl'' is the first Web-only production for Showtime, but
company senior vice president Tom Hayden, said the series is
designed to drum up business for the television network. Hayden
said the 28 episodes, each three to four minutes long, are designed
to attract 15- to 34-year-olds to sign up for Showtime. He said
that depending on the reception given ``WhirlGirl,'' the company
may ultimately develop it into a program for Showtime, the
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the other business opportunities associated with
the project, said Hayden, noting, ``we'll exploit any merchandising
opportunities along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the kind of media empire WhirlGirl might want to
take a crack at.
</P>
<P>
   Looks Like a Movie ...
</P>
<P>
   In light of a fascinating development in optics, the time is
ripe for a movie sequel: ``Honey, I shrunk the big-screen theatre
complex down to the size of portable headset.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the title might be unwieldy, but the ``i-glasses''
technology is not.
</P>
<P>
   Said ``i-glasses'' are a portable DVD player that displays
movies on a headset and gives users the sensation they are sitting
in a theatre, watching a movie on a big screen.
</P>
<P>
   The headset, made by a Silicon Valley optics company called i-O
Display Systems, looks like a bulky visor attached to sunglasses.
Using optics technology and mirrors, the movie is projected into
the inside of the headset, so that users watch the movie as if
staring at images on the inside of their sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   L.J. Simpson, marketing manager for i-O Systems in Menlo Park,
Calif. said the goggles give users the sensation that they are
inside a theatre, not sitting on an airplane, the couch, or in the
dentist's chair. And he's not kidding about the dentists. He said
many of the initial customers of the technology are dentists, who
show DVD movies to patients while they undergo gum surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of the i-glasses may want to try anesthetic when they
check out the product's cost. The whole package, including headset
and DVD player, is around $1,500.

FAMILIES OF VATICAN GUARD'S VICTIMS ASK MEDIA TO STOP FUELING
RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 C.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When the Vatican last week closed its investigation into
the killing of the commander of the Swiss Guards by one of his
junior officers, it hoped the concluding report would finally set
the scandal to rest.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. Wednesday, the grieving relatives of the slain Swiss
Guard commander, Alois Estermann, and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero,
who was killed at his side, issued a four-page letter addressed to
journalists and distributed by the Vatican press office. The letter
sought to shame the Italian press and implored the media to stop
printing rumors about the couple's marriage, but is likely instead
to draw still more attention to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The letter rejected ``categorically'' recent media reports
mostly prompted by coverage of a new book _ ``God's Word, Gay
Word'' _ a roman a clef about the love affair of a senior officer
in the Swiss Guards and one of his subalterns, inspired by Lt. Col.
Estermann, 43, and the corporal, Cedric Tornay, 23, who shot him
and his wife and then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not accept the slightest suspicion about presumed
hypotheses about tormented love stories or espionage with which
some have tried to stain Alois,'' the letter said. ``We would be
grateful if people would stop adding to the pain that we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the killings nine months ago, the Vatican has tried hard
to to dispel rumors that they were a crime of passion or the result
of some other scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a few days after the killings occurred, a few Italian
newspapers printed stories based on a farfetched rumor that
Estermann was an East German spy, but that line of speculation died
right away.
</P>
<P>
   In their final report last week, Vatican investigators said
Tornay carried out the killings when he became disgruntled after
being passed over for a decoration. They also said that traces of
cannabis had been found in Tornay's urine, as well as a cyst the
size of a pigeon egg in his brain that could have impaired his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But at the presentation of the new book, the author, Massimo
Lacchei, told reporters that a year before the murders he had
attended a private brunch at the home of an elderly and important
gay politician, where Estermann and Tornay were also guests. He
said they were lovers, and said he had doubts about the Vatican
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, Italian newspapers and other publications published
stories about the theory that Estermann and Tornay were gay lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Meza Romero, a younger sister of the commander's wife,
said she had seen news reports about the rumors in Venezuela, and
came to Rome this week with her sisters to meet with Estermann's
survivors and compose a joint letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we paid no attention to these news stories, but then
they started up again recently, with such lies and perversity,''
Ms. Meza Romero said. ``We decided we had to do it _ none of the
people who wrote about my sister and my brother-in-law had the
slightest knowledge of them as a couple. If they did, they wouldn't
write such unjust, false accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacchei now says he too feels like a victim, claiming that
Italian reporters distorted his words and made up quotes. ``If I
were a relative of Estermann or Tornay I would be furious, too,''
he said. ``The Italian press is so irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lacchei did not retract his claims or say anything that
might reassure the survivors. He said he had no proof that the two
Swiss guards were lovers, but that their presence at the gay brunch
_ and behavior there _ certainly made him think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so intimate and friendly for a subordinate and a
captain,'' he explained. He also said he had a subsequent encounter
with Tornay that confirmed his suspicions about the young
corporal's sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's La Repubblica, Lacchei's lawyer wrote a letter
laying out what his client had in fact said. It included Lecchei's
assertion that Estermann was a frequent visitor at the elderly
politician's gay salon, and brought Tornay, who might have been
killed because ``he knew too much, had met too many important
people.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly not the conclusion drawn by the Vatican,
which as a city-state has jurisdiction over crimes committed within
its walls. State criminal investigators were not shown the
evidence, though the Vatican did consult outside pathologists.
</P>
<P>
   Tornay's mother, who had long insisted that her son was innocent
and was the scapegoat of a broader conspiracy, does not accept the
Vatican explanation. But the relatives of Estermann and his wife
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``With deep pain and Christian forgiveness we accept the
conclusion of the Vatican judiciary,'' their letter stated.

INTERNATIONAL EXPO OPENED 60 YEARS AGO

 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   A million spectators were said to have turned out for the
parade; dignitaries gathered from every corner of the Earth
(although they knew by then that it was round); and The San
Francisco Chronicle ran a special section stuffed with ads  &LR; like
 &LR; the one from the City of Paris department store for clothing with
``Treasure Island Prints ... bound to make the wearer the center of
any throng.'' That was 60 years ago, Feb. 18, 1939, and it was
opening day of the International Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of stories described the glories of modernism as
exemplified in the exhibits and buildings: The Yerba Buena Women's
Clubhouse featured four lounges ``aimed at blending with the
temperaments of four different types of women''; a Hall of Sciences
exhibit told ``how to have a son or daughter as desired, the
methods of sex rejuvenation, causes and relief of sterility, (and)
the reason for masculine women and feminine men.'' As for the
architecture, The Chronicle was frank: ``Treasure Island is a good
job, perhaps architecturally not as good a job as the Acropolis
group or Rheims Cathedral, but those required a little more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the newspaper,  &UR; Eleanor Roosevelt &LR;  attended an
agricultural conference at Cornell University and spoke of the need
for the United States to be part of the world community; United
Press reported from Berlin that German prison authorities had
decided that no Jew, ``no matter how exemplary his behavior,''

Madison magazine he's not ashamed to admit that some of his movies
have been bad. ``It's not as if you're kidding anybody. It's out
there and it's a stinker, and everybody can see it. The truth is,
we're like everybody else. We're capable of total self-deception.
... Especially since there can be 20 other motives for making the
movie. Like, you want the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumet called it nonsense to think that a director has complete
control of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the word `print,' so that means I'm in control of the
moment-to-moment things. But to even use the word `authorship' is
nonsense. It's like Hollywood agents and studio heads who keep
saying, `What's your vision of the movie?'
</P>
<P>
   ``What vision? What are you talking about? Why use all the
hocus-pocus? I'm not  &UR; Mother Teresa &LR;  seeing the Virgin up there!

<P>
   _  &UR; Oscar London &LR; , an East Bay physician and writer, notes in an
essay about doctors and smell that white European males smell the
worst of all his patients. After London presented one exchange
student with a line drawing of a cylinder of deodorant with a
roll-on ball, the patient became angry, muttering to his
girlfriend. She blushed and said ``that he thinks I've just drawn a
picture of a penis and just what was I trying to tell him?''

eventually may be used to deliver DNA in gene therapy, &LR;  have named
them ``shell-cross-linked knedels.'' A report gleaned by

LIFE WAS NO CABARET IN MAKING GRAMMY-NOMINATED ALBUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The making of the Grammy Award-nominated
``Cabaret'' cast album was no picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such Broadway musicals are recorded in a single day.
With the ``Cabaret'' revival, however, the producers were faced
with a unique problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a band made up of actors that couldn't play very well _
as dictated by the story,'' says Jay David Saks, the BMG
Classics/RCA Victor producer who has received 37 Grammy nominations
for cast albums and classical work, including two this year for
``Cabaret'' and the long-running ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``Some of the cast learned an instrument for the role.
So that was an obstacle before we recorded a single note.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution: Call in some ringers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recorded it right in the theater, but we hired extra
professional musicians for some of the numbers,'' Saks explained.
``You don't want to put bad playing on a permanent document.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years at Columbia Masterworks, Saks joined RCA in 1974
as artist-and-repertoire producer for the respected Red Seal
classical imprint. Of the seven Grammys he has won, four are in the
category of best musical show _ ``Into the Woods,'' ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway,'' ``Guys and Dolls'' and, most recently,
``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   At BMG/RCA, Saks produces new classical and musical show albums
and supervises the company's staff of classical producers for new
and reissue releases. He's currently working on the album for
``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance,'' now on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, a Grammy nod _ especially if it wins _ means a
significant bump in sales,'' Saks offers. ``It really helps.
There's a lot of recognition in the press, and the record stores
put Grammy stickers on the CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to ``Cabaret,'' the making of the two-disc ``Ragtime''
album went along traditional lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew when it came time to record the show we'd make
a few changes and expand some tunes,'' Saks said. ``Some Broadway
albums are more elaborate and developed like this one. But it's not
so wildly unique.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many ``Cabaret'' albums on the market, Saks' concept
involved making the listener feel as if he were actually sitting in
the theater. The national touring version of the show opens next
month at the Wilshire Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the ideal would be to record it live one night,''
the producer said. ``But although we did cut it in the theater
without an audience, we created an audience atmosphere later on.
I'd never done a cast album that way before.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41st annual Grammy Awards show takes place Wednesday at the
Shrine Auditorium and will be telecast on CBS. Rosie O'Donnell is
the host.

   Q. I have two computers, each with a different e-mail account.
Is it possible to read the incoming mail from Computer A on
Computer B?
</P>
<P>
   A. If your Internet service provider for Computer A lets you use
a flexible e-mail program like Eudora Pro or Outlook Express, you
can set up a filter in the e-mail program to forward copies of all
the messages arriving at Computer A to the e-mail account on
Computer B.
</P>
<P>
   Filters, which most e-mail programs have (with the notable
exception of the America Online service), allow you to sort mail
into different mailboxes, forward messages and do a host of other
helpful organizational tasks, like program a particular sound to
play when mail arrives from a particular address, when you log on
to get your mail. Check the user's manual or the manufacturer's Web
site for information on how to set up filters for your particular
program.
</P>
<P>
   Some mail programs will also let you set up multiple e-mail
accounts from different ISPs on the same machine _ check your
program guide or call your provider.
</P>
<P>
   If you use America Online and want to get your mail on a
computer that doesn't have AOL software installed, you might try
the company's new Netmail feature. Although it doesn't work with
all browsers, Netmail allows you to read your incoming AOL mail
from your Web browser. You can read more about it at
www.aol.com/netmail.

 &HT;    Perlman roots into klezmer
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The crossover bug continues to bite classical
musicians. In the case of violinist Itzhak Perlman, it's also given
him a chance to explore his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman, 54, comes to Atlanta this week with ``In the Fiddler's
House,'' a program of klezmer music spun off from his 1995 PBS
special of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, PBS approached Perlman to host the special, which
was filmed in Poland, his parents' birthplace. ``I've heard
(klezmer music) all my life,'' the Israeli-born violinist said
recently in a telephone interview. ``But I'd never played it
before, and playing it never occurred to me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``the enthusiasm that this music gives the players is
quite infectious,'' and soon enough he found himself itching to
pick up his fiddle and join the klezmorim (klezmer musicians).
</P>
<P>
   Klezmer music, which has sometimes been called ``Jewish jazz,''
really isn't jazz, but it shares at least one characteristic with
jazz: the urge to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   Klezmer bands were composed of itinerant musicians who traveled
around the Jewish ghettos of Eastern Europe, playing at weddings
and festivals. They carried their instruments, which therefore had
to be portable: violins, clarinets, accordions.
</P>
<P>
   Their music was founded in Yiddish folk song and dance as well
as Jewish liturgical music, with healthy dollops of Romanian,
Ukrainian, Polish, Slavic, Greek, Turkish, Hungarian and Gypsy
music, used both for blend and contrast. Klezmer musicians treated
their source material as jazz treats classic blues or Tin Pan Alley
standards: After the basic sound of the group is established, the
instruments are free to wander at will along the song's harmonic
path.
</P>
<P>
   Klezmer music can be humorous or melancholy, but its sound is
unmistakable: nasal, like the cantors who led prayers in the
synagogue; heavy, like the feet in work boots and thick shoes that
danced at Jewish weddings; sweet-and-sour, like the inflections of
Yiddish itself, ending every sentence with ``nu?'' (``so?''). You
can almost hear it shrugging its shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman's classical background, which includes study at the
Juilliard School and the 1964 Leventritt Award that launched him on
an international career, hasn't kept him from other kinds of
crossover experiments, such as recording jazz classics with pianist
Oscar Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   His initial venture in klezmer goes back several years before
the PBS special, to the 1993 Oscar-winning film ``Schindler's
List.'' John Williams' score featured Perlman in a series of
klezmer-inspired melodic laments.
</P>
<P>
   The special introduced him to such groups as the Klezmer
Conservatory Band, Brave Old World, the Klezmatics and the Andy
Statman Klezmer Orchestra, all of which appear in the stage show.
Most of these ensembles, born in the 70s' klezmer revival,
represent various styles and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman, it has been said, plays klezmer like a classical
violinist, with clean scales and well-controlled ``blue notes.''
``Silk can't be wool,'' wrote New York Times reviewer Jon Pareles.
``Although he did carefully scratch a note every so often, the
rough-and-ready approach of klezmer's folk virtuosos isn't in his
vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done all the scholarship,''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman says of his musical comrades. ``I'm taking it from them.
I get (them) to give me sheet music, and I get to know it by
heart.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Bye, George: `ER' can operate without Clooney
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's self-righteous, narcissistic, somewhat self-destructive, a
pain in the bedpan to his friends, loved ones and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to miss Dr. Doug Ross, even though ``ER'' is
unlikely to suffer much, if at all, from his departure.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney takes his last walk through the swinging doors as
a regular cast member of ``ER'' tonight, although he'll pop back in
for guest appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about you,'' Ross's live-in love, Carol
Hathaway, angrily told him on last week's episode, although lately,
it has been all about Ross, as the No. 1 series on television has
been laying the groundwork for his exit.
</P>
<P>
   To recap: The pediatrician helped a desperate mother deliver a
fatal dose of painkiller to her terminally ill son, which has
prompted his superiors to suspend him and the state attorney to
ponder murder charges against him. He's betrayed his co-workers by
going back on promises, violated the rules of a drug study and
caused the closure of Hathaway's clinic for indigent patients. At
the end of last Thursday's show, disobeying another order, he drove
off to help children trapped in an overturned school bus, only to
crash his car into a parked truck.
</P>
<P>
   It'll take a lot of cute chin-tilting and puppy-eyed looks to
get Ross out of this mess, and the biggest question tonight is
whether he will scrape out some measure of redemption or leave in
total disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the loss of Ross will be completely different
from the exit of another beloved prime-time hottie, Jimmy Smits as
Detective Bobby Simone on ``NYPD Blue,'' a mere three months ago.
That became a nationwide deathwatch; Clooney's departure has been
played out in a much lower key, due mainly to a decision by Clooney
and NBC not to over-hype it.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Edwards, Clooney's co-star, says Ross' exit tonight is
``explosive and surprising in the way that 'ER' usually does
things, kind of against what would be predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney hasn't been giving interviews, although he did say while
in Atlanta last summer to promote the movie ``Out of Sight'' that
``I feel like I'm honoring a contract that was for five years. It's
better for a show like that to rejuvenate itself regularly, get
some fresh blood.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clooney won't be replaced, and the show will concentrate on
its cast of current characters, the largest on TV. That is the
show's strength; where ``NYPD'' rolled the dice (and won) by
replacing Smits with Rick Schroder, ``ER'' has so much going on
that not all its characters can get the screen time they deserve.
Take Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben); the HIV-positive physician's
assistant has barely been seen this season. That will be changing,
as Boulet's health reportedly will get worse even as her stories
get better.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other arcs getting attention: Carter (Noah Wyle) has
started messing around with his med student Lucy (Kellie Martin), a
no-no; and Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) is seething over the
loathsome, trollish Romano (Paul McCrane) being in charge of the
ER.
</P>
<P>
   So will Clooney be missed? A little. But Sherry Stringfield
walked out in the middle of a big romantic story, and the series
didn't miss a beat. (Next to leave: Emmy winner Julianna Marguiles,
who plays Hathaway, says she's gone at the end of next season.)
</P>
<P>
   Clooney could have left ``ER'' a couple of seasons ago. Although
he's not made it into the absolute top rank of feature film stars
(``four or five guys have to pass on a script, then I get to see
it,'' he likes to joke), he's certainly done better than most TV
actors who leave a show for greener pastures that eventually turn
out to be full of weeds and made-for-cable TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney has known his share of movie flops (``Batman and
Robin'') and modest but well-reviewed hits (``Out of Sight''), as
well as getting attention for his small role in Terrence Malick's
``The Thin Red Line,'' the type of part that gets Hollywood's
respect. He has production deals with both Warner Bros. and CBS and
will spend his time acting in movies and developing TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the works for Clooney:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Three Kings,'' a feature film about Gulf War vets
co-starring Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Leatherheads,'' a movie about the early days of pro
football, directed by Steve Soderbergh (``Out of Sight'').
Currently on hold.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Kilroy,'' a comedy for HBO that Clooney would produce but
not star in. It's a blend of fiction and reality (a la ``The Larry
Sanders Show'') in which a fictional actor would appear in other,
``real'' TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fail-Safe,'' a remake of the 1964 nuclear thriller for CBS.
Tentatively, it would be a live drama, in black-and-white, with
Clooney producing and taking a small role.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER''
</P>
<P>
   10 tonight on NBC

<TEXT>
<P>
   A contemporary proviso could soon be tacked onto the famous
pledge of the U.S. Postal Service: Neither rain, nor sleet, nor
snow nor a slow modem will be able to stop the mail from getting
through.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, when the Postal Service started testing a way
to allow consumers to buy postage online, a few hundred
small-business owners in San Francisco and in the Washington area
have forsaken their postage meters or their trips to the local post
office. Instead, they buy postage by registering financial
information online, then downloading and printing encrypted, bar
code-like stamps, as part of a test of the security and reliability
of electronic postage systems offered by two start-up companies,
Stamps.com and E-Stamp Corp. Pitney Bowes started testing its
online system in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more productive to have it done in the office than to
send someone to the post office,'' said one of the testers, Olivier
D. Long, a lawyer in Fairfax, Va., who gladly turned in his office
postal meter.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from efficiency, Long likes his Internet stamps for the
way they look. ``It's so professional looking to have the address
and postage all laser-printed,'' he said. ``It's impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tests are a major step for the Postal Service. Not since
1920, when the post office first permitted the red markings of a
postage meter, has any other means for providing ``evidence of
postage'' been permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The race to provide stamps-by-mouse is shaping up to be a
classic Internet battle: the two start-ups are sprinting to be the
first cyberspace stamp seller. Along the way, both are striking up
high-profile alliances, and both are months ahead of two old-line
postage meter companies, Pitney Bowes and one of its major
competitors, Neopost, based outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The business model for selling stamps in cyberspace is familiar:
add convenience to a commodity and charge for that convenience. The
commodity in this case is owned by the U.S. Postal Service, which
had revenue of $56 billion in 1996, the most recent year for which
figures are available. Meters, used mostly by large companies,
accounted for $21 billion of the total, while $12 billion came from
the lick or peel variety of postage. The rest of the revenue came
from express mail, parcel post, certified letters and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the first company to sell stamps online
nationwide was likely to be Stamps.com, a come-from-nowhere company
based in Santa Monica, Calif., that was founded in 1996 by three
business school students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as part of an effort to go digital and improve
technology at all levels, the Postal Service invited proposals for
the digital delivery of postage; the proposals were supposed to
require that the customer have a desktop device to keep
transactions secure. The invitation was based loosely on a white
paper presented to the service by E-Stamp Corp., based in Palo
Alto, Calif. E-Stamp, then the only player in the digital market
besides Pitney Bowes and Neopost, was founded by Salim Kara, who
ran a Canadian refrigeration business.
</P>
<P>
   The E-Stamp plan would require the purchaser to spend $99 on a
tamperproof desktop device to store postal information. It would
work essentially like a postage meter, authorization would be made
online.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Postal Service's specifications, Stamps.com
audaciously proposed a system with no special hardware; the
system's designers assume that even without special equipment,
online transactions can be made secure. Authorization is made
online, and the customer's own printer is used. Last August,
Stamps.com persuaded the post office to accept its concept. Since
then, it has attracted $36 million in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned there is a lot of pent-up demand by small
business that is tired of being under the iron grip of a
monopoly,'' said John M. Payne, 43, chief executive of Stamps.com.
Marvin Runyon, the recently retired Postmaster General, has signed
on as a Stamps.com investor and director.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp, now run by Silicon Valley veterans, also plans an
alternative Internet solution that will not require special
equipment, but required testing will put it months behind its
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that E-Stamp will recover because the
company has already lined up equity backers like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
and Compaq, which plan to integrate E-Stamp software into their
products for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal ``is to take a solution Pitney Bowes has done in
corporate mailrooms and bring it to the consumer,'' said Sunir
Kapoor, E-Stamp's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Both E-stamp and Stamps.com will charge transaction fees, which
will not be regulated by the Postal Service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Keenan, an Internet analyst in San Francisco who
publishes a weekly newsletter called Keenan Vision, predicted
online postal-transaction fees of $286 million annually in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stamps.com and E-stamp have deals to be listed on America
Online, which plans an online postal center. Both will pay AOL for
the privilege. Stamps.com says it has the better deal because its
software will be embedded in the millions of promotional CDs that
AOL distributes annually, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think Stamps.com is ahead of the game,'' said
Bonnie J. Brooks of Creative Strategies, a consulting company in
Campbell, Calif. Being first has a significant online advantage,
she said, because ``the first to market usually does well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service expects to expand the electronic stamp
program to 10,000 customers per company and to add the New York
area to the pilot program by spring or early summer, said Nancy W.
Russell, a spokeswoman. Other companies may still apply, she said.
Existing mail-sorting equipment can read the bar-coded stamp, she
said. It will take broader acceptance to determine if Internet
postage eliminates the estimated $100 million in meter fraud that
ignited the service's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the postage patriarch, Pitney Bowes, based in
Stamford, Conn., is counting on being the tortoise to the two
Internet hares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be second to market,'' conceded William T.
Shannon, director of the company's small-business division, which
is further behind in testing its own Internet postal system,
Clickstamp.com. But he added, ``We want to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Several obstacles may slow the acceptance of electronic postage,
he said. Right now, it is limited to postage for domestic
addresses. And consumers may balk at using Internet stamps if it
requires a switch from current software that is designed to print
documents with delivery addresses that are visible through envelope
windows. Such software is incompatible with electronic postage,
which performs three functions at once: verifying an address as
deliverable plus printing postage and recipient information.
</P>
<P>
   Either the software or the standard envelopes needs reworking,
Shannon said. ``We want to try to close down each of these
problems,'' he said. ``Until we can break some of these, this
market won't break wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   The laggard is Neopost, whose equipment is used on 15 percent of
domestic metered mail. The company's division in Hayward, Calif.,
won approval in January for another version of stamps online. It is
a secure desktop printer that customers could use to download $500
worth of postage from Neopost's site. The device would cost $50,
require a monthly rental and be replenished with adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   More hitches with electronic stamps are very likely to surface,
predicted Ray L. Boggs, director of small-business research for
International Data Corporation. How quickly they are ironed out
will probably prove a test for the public-private partnership, he
said. ``It's the slow-moving careful wheels of bureaucracy versus
the ready-fire-aim of Silicon Valley, he said, ``where if it
doesn't work, fire again.''

   The world's academic dissertations typically endure a bleak
destiny, languishing on university library shelves, their
cotton-bond pages unthumbed. Their themes, such topics as carbon
fluxes and Hilbert spaces, tend to lack a certain blockbuster
quality that heralds best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But today these obscure tomes are creeping into wider
circulation thanks to the vast distribution routes of the
cyberworld. Scholars who pour years of research into hundreds of
pages are finding modest rewards in online publishing.
</P>
<P>
   There are tiny royalties to be had. There are professional
connections to be made. And there is the hope for readership _ even
worldwide circulation _ as dissertations shift from card catalogs
to desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a fantastic networking tool,'' said Sonciray
Bonnell, an academic adviser at Portland State University in
Oregon, whose dissertation, a 100-year history of an Indian
boarding school in Oregon, has drawn many telephone calls and
e-mail messages from other researchers nationwide in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The online availability of Ms. Bonnell's dissertation also gave
her a convenient out when people requested copies. ``I wanted to be
able to distribute copies to the people I interviewed and not have
a lot of money out of pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow online academic, Professor Glenn McGee, correctly
figured that his online dissertation, ``Pragmatism and Human
Genetic Engineering,'' would never make the same splash as
``Perfect Baby,'' a traditionally published book he wrote on the
same topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I thought people would flock to the bookstores
to pick up my dissertation,'' said McGee, a bioethics professor at
the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. They did not. But
he has received about 100 e-mail messages from biotechnologists who
had seen his dissertation on line, and an invitation to speak at
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a critical part of advancing the state of
knowledge in the United States,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Bonnell are among several dozen people who have
published their doctoral dissertations or masters' theses at
Dissertation.com (www.dissertation.com), a site created in 1997 by
Jeff Young, a former marketing specialist whose brainstorm grew
from frustration with his own plodding masters' thesis research.
</P>
<P>
   For $149, writers can publish and sell their work on the site,
which Young operates from his Florida home. He assigns each work an
International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which also permits it
to be found and sold through bookstores and online sellers like
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Then, any search of books at Amazon.com, for instance, or at a
bookstore could locate a dissertation that Young had registered.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Dissertation.com can download a document in Portable
Document Format (PDF) for $6 or order a bound paper copy, starting
at $19.95. The writer receives a 40 percent royalty. McGee joked
that he had made barely enough to buy a latte, while Ms. Bonnell
has collected around $150 from sales of her dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Goetz, a research scientist at the University of Maryland
at College Park, has sold two copies of his dissertation,
``Modeling Carbon Fluxes, Net Primary Production and Light
Utilization in Boreal Forest Stands,'' through Dissertation.com.
``Very few people read a dissertation,'' he said. ``This is a
reward in that it's not just gone into obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said: ``The main benefit is you're establishing yourself
as an expert in this area. It's worth far more to have people read
your work. We get orders from bookstores all over the world and
libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said that his enterprise had not taken off. He has fewer
than 100 titles in his computerized storehouse, out of more than
40,000 dissertations and uncounted masters' theses that American
graduate schools produce each year. He said he has sold ``several
hundred'' copies.
</P>
<P>
   Young touts his site as more streamlined and user-friendly than
the granddaddy of dissertation archives, an Ann Arbor, Mich.,
company called UMI (www.umi.com). The company styled itself as the
dissertation publisher of record 60 years ago, when microfilm was
the latest technology and the firm's initials still stood for
University Microfilm International.
</P>
<P>
   UMI's climate-controlled vault contains more than one million
microfilmed dissertations and theses, published on demand for a
minimum of $29.50 per copy. UMI, which sells about 250,000 copies a
year, is switching to online publication by scanning its copies
into PDF digital format, for downloading at $19.50.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Moyer, vice president of UMI, said the company has
digitized about 110,000 graduate works, from 1998 forward. UMI
charges dissertation writers $50 to catalog their work and offers
royalties of 10 percent for sales of seven or more copies a year.
Orders are coming in at 100 a day for the download versions, Moyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate schools also are going electronic. Leading the way is
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, which
requires electronic submissions from all graduate students, then
offers them free on its Web site, scholar.lib.vt.edu, with the
students' permission.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech wants other schools to join its Networked Library
of Digital Dissertations and Theses, www.ndltd.org, envisioned as a
worldwide clearinghouse. West Virginia University recently came
aboard, its graduate program similarly mandating electronic
dissertations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that in 5 years or 10 years at the most that
this isn't the way that the majority of universities will be
handling them,'' said Gail McMillan, director of Virginia Tech's
Scholarly Communications Project.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear where that would leave the dissertation sale
sites, but the academic world is in no rush. Vanderbilt University
has a pilot project to put dissertations on line, said Amanda
Carson Banks, the school's senior information officer. The papers
have been available only on the campus server.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maine has made electronic submission an option
``while we try to work some of the bugs out,'' said Scott Delcourt,
director of the university's graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone questions readership interest, Virginia Tech's
experience has produced impressive results. One electrical
engineering dissertation was downloaded 75,000 times last year, Ms.
McMillan said, compared with 458 downloads for the most popular
work three years ago when the first batch went on line.

LEVI STRAUSS FACES BATTLE TO RECOUP LOST TURF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dickies. JNCO. Fubu. Pelle Pelle. These are some
of the labels responsible for Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.'s 13 percent sales
slide in 1998, the jean maker's largest percentage decline in at
least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young men's market is incredibly vibrant and Levi's is not
a part of it,'' said Robert Lohrer, editor of DNR, a New York-based
fashion trade magazine. ``Nobody in young men's is talking about
Levi Strauss.''
</P>
<P>
   But people are talking about whether San Francisco-based Levi
Strauss is on the right track to regain its footing in a market
that has become increasingly trendy and fickle. Since sales dropped
nearly 3 percent to $6.9 billion in 1997, the talk in the industry
has centered on how the company, founded by Bavarian native Levi
Strauss 146 years ago, stood by its classic styles when the world
was going baggy and flared.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement that sales had dipped further to $6
billion for the fiscal year ending Nov. 29 was disturbing but
hardly unexpected for both the company and analysts who follow the
brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the natural fallout of what has been happening. The
brand _ the 501 jean _ has been under attack,'' said Harry Bernard,
partner and chief marketing officer at Colton Bernard Inc., a San
Francisco marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   The attack has come from both hip, upstart labels, small and
nimble enough to shift their focus with the latest designs, and
some of the country's largest retailers, such as Sears, Roebuck &AMP;
Co. and J.C. Penney Co., which have eaten into the mainstream
market with their private label jeans.
</P>
<P>
   While Levi Strauss still is the best-selling jeans brand, its
market share has fallen 38 percent between 1997 and 1998 among
females in the 13- to 24-year-old age group, according to a recent
survey by the Zandl Group, a New York-based trend-spotting firm.
Among males in that same age group, the decline was 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss admits it got too comfortable being the largest
apparel manufacturer in the world. For more than 100 years, the
company has been the world's dominant denim manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the company has cut fat and revamped its image
in an effort to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company cut 1,000 jobs in 1997 and last year slashed another
6,400 jobs, or about a third of its work force, by closing plants.
It announced a restructuring of the strategy to become more
consumer focused and marketing driven rather than relying on its
relationship with its retailers to sell jeans.
</P>
<P>
   And, just last month, Levi Strauss President Peter Jacobi
announced he would leave the company after nearly three decades.
While a new president has yet to be named, Jacobi has insisted that
his replacement come from outside the ranks of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really do have on paper a new strategy,'' Bernard said.
``The key question remains, how will they implement it?''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss spokesman Gavin Power said the selection of a new
president is still months away. And while the 1998 results are
disappointing, Power said, those numbers do not yet reflect some of
the changes that have taken place or are yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company continues to work on a number of new styles,
such as a new Red Tab line featuring ``fashion-forward'' basics in
cargo, carpenter and other styles. Also, in an effort to reach out
to young people, Levi Strauss is sponsoring music tours and
introducing a line of clothing inspired by the ``Mod Squad'' movie
debuting in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're testing new ground,'' Power said. ``We want to come out
with new brands, sub brands and brand extensions that speak to the
diversity in the marketplace. The consumer base now is a lot more
complicated.''

FEDERAL AGENCY WARNS PEOPLE: `PREPARE FOR THE WORST' WITH Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' the
Federal Emergency Management Agency advised Wednesday as it issued
a guide for consumers to prepare for Year 2000 computer-bug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The agency stressed that the most important thing people can do
to avoid problems resulting from computer crashes is to ``stay
informed'' since institutions are varying widely in their response
to the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask your local government, your bank, your utility company and
other organizations that you rely upon what they are doing to be
ready'' for the Year 2000, or Y2K, problem, the FEMA guide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being prepared is key to dealing with any potential emergency,
whether natural or man-made,'' FEMA Director James Lee Witt said in
a statement. ``We need to take the same approach we use with
hurricanes, tornadoes or floods _ plan for the worst and hope for
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that there is no indication that the Year 2000
glitch will cause widespread disruptions in the United States, the
FEMA guide recommended that Americans:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep copies of their bills, bank statements and other records.
Consumers with investments should consider asking their banks and
brokerages to issue special statements of their accounts that would
give their investment values by this Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store enough food and clean water to last up to a week. Also,
people should buy candles, matches, batteries and flashlights for
possible power outages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect some of the problems stemming from the Y2K bug to begin
before Jan. 1. The guide said consumers should be prepared for
possible disruptions on July 1, when 46 states begin their fiscal
year 2000. Another date to watch is Oct. 1, the beginning of fiscal
year 2000 for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA also recommended that people with personal computers check
with their PC's manufacturer and with the manufacturer of the
computer's software to find out if they are Y2K-compliant, that is,
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Without being reprogrammed or having their microchips replaced,
many older computers, originally geared to recognize only the last
two digits of a year, will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, when the
machines will assume the 00 that they see means the year is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Systems could also fail when one that thinks the year is 1900
interacts with another that thinks it is 2000. Unable to sort out
the difference, the two systems would either stop or give out wrong
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we tell the American people everything we
know, for an educated public will always make the right
decisions,`` FEMA Deputy Director Robert M. ``Mike'' Walker said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, an independent federal agency that reports directly to the
president, helps communities prepare for and recover from all types
of disasters. The agency, which has often earned high marks for its
quick aid to communities hit by catastrophic events, most recently
provided assistance to victims of Hurricane Georges, which battered
the Gulf Coast and parts of Central America last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its warnings, the FEMA guide also contained several
pieces of good news. Among the things most Americans should not
worry about, according to FEMA, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Money. The banking industry has been working on the problem
for several years and at the end of 1998, 96 percent of banks were
said to be on track to be Y2K-ready by this June 30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Massive power outages. The guide said they are unlikely. The
electric utility industry has completed work on more than half of
its critical systems and expects to have finished them all by June
30. However, industry officials warn that minor outages _ those
lasting a day or two _ cannot be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flying. The Federal Aviation Administration has fixed more
than 90 percent of its critical systems and expects to have them
all reprogrammed within the next few months. In addition, airplane
manufacturers report that none of the problems identified so far
would present a safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government. More than 60 percent of its critical
systems are now Y2K-compliant, and officials they all will be
before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home appliances. Most home electronic products will not be
affected by the Y2K bug. However, FEMA recommends that people check
with manufactures to make sure any appliances they consider
essential are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the FEMA guide can be ordered by calling
1-800-480-2520 or by logging on to the agency's Web site at
www.fema.gov/y2k.

said to be on track to be Y2K-ready by this June 30.
</P>
<P>

all reprogrammed within the next few months. In addition, airplane
manufacturers report that none of the problems identified so far
would present a safety risk.

VIRTUAL GUIDED TOUR OF POMPEII'S RUINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To study the richness of Pompeii and Herculaneum, the Roman
towns buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, nothing
beats a round-trip ticket to Naples.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Internet. True, no sun, pasta or Mediterranean.
On the other hand, no visas, tipping or civil servants who may be
neither. You still get a good look at two of antiquity's most
celebrated sites, which, Vesuvius being what it is, may not be
around forever.
</P>
<P>
   You also get great online Pompeian graffiti that is not in
typical textbooks, like ``Samius to Cornelius: go hang yourself''
and ``Virgula to her fellow Tertius: You're disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Samius and Virgula are only two of many writers whose excavated
graffiti come alive again on an entertaining Pompeii site from
Amherst (www.amherst.edu/classics/class36/basilica.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``Phileros is a eunuch,'' one scrawl reads (in Latin, with
translations). Other graffiti list gladiators' records in the
amphitheater. One begins: ``Calling all lovers! I want to break
Venus' ribs with clubs and cripple the loins of the goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pompeii Forum Project (pompeii.virginia.edu) is a complex
venture sponsored by the University of Virginia, the National
Endowment for the Humanities and private donors. The nine-person
team, which includes two computer specialists, uses technology to
survey the central forum. The goal is to understand its evolution
from pre-Roman times. A major focus is the work on the forum after
a devastating earthquake in A.D. 62, until the eruption of 79
buried the city under volcanic ash, and how that work relates to
the older architecture of Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John J. Dobbins, a professor of classical art and archeology
at the University of Virginia who is the project leader, said the
issues faced then were still relevant today. He wrote by e-mail,
``You can almost hear the debates in the city council of Pompeii
about the proper way to repair downtown, the forum: Should we knock
down an entire section of the city center and build everything new,
or should we keep some of our old buildings because they are
important to us in a number of ways?''
</P>
<P>
   Diagrams of individual buildings include camera icons that not
only allow access to the images but also show the angles from which
they were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The site's Notes to Teachers and Students has a close-up of an
inscription, a dedication by the donor of a building, and its
translation. But that's just the start. What does the dedication
signify about the politics and social life of Pompeii? Who was the
donor? Why was it worded that way? What began as a simple picture
turns into a classical detective story. The teaching guide gives a
Pompeian wall painting a similar beneath-the-surface inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The forum site also has a link to an Amherst College site that
prints two eyewitness letters to Tacitus, the historian, by Pliny
the Younger. He describes the eruption of Vesuvius and the death of
his uncle, Pliny the Elder, who, as commander of the Roman fleet,
was trying to rescue the trapped population.
</P>
<P>
   A geology site focusing on Vesuvius is
www.geo.mtu.edu/boris/VESUVIO.html. Besides linking to current
volcano sites, this one has a detailed account of the eruption of
A.D. 79, which killed thousands in a cloud of darkness similar to
the blast at Mount St. Helens in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And don't miss The History of Plumbing: Pompeii and Herculaneum
(www.theplumber.com/pom.html).
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been overshadowed by the larger excavations at
Pompeii, the resort town of Herculaneum, buried by hot mud in the
eruption, may conceal a greater treasure. In the 18th century,
hundreds of papyrus scrolls, oxidized and congealed but many still
readable, were unearthed from a villa once owned by Julius Caesar's
father-in-law. Most contained the writings of Philodemus, an
Epicurean philosopher of the first century B.C. Some scholars
believe that the estate, now called the Villa dei Papiri, is likely
to have held a major library and that beneath 20 meters of
mud-turned-rock, there may still be readable scrolls of lost Greek
and Latin classics.
</P>
<P>
   The Philodemus Project, led from the University of California at
Los Angeles, is an international effort to piece together the
readable fragments properly, using modern techniques, and get
better translations
(www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/classics/Philodemus/philhome.htm). But
excavations have been halted because of a lack of money, as well as
flooding and rising methane gas, said Dr. David L. Blank, chairman
of the classics department at UCLA and the project leader, in an
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest problem here is that of conservation,''
he wrote, referring to an ongoing debate about whether to forge
ahead with new excavations or to focus instead on preserving what
has already been found. ``Many scholars,'' he said, ``would even
prefer that the unexcavated areas here remain that way, rather than
expose their treasures to the inevitable depradations of time,
weather, uncontrollable plant growth, theft, vandalism'' and,
finally, ``tourism on an enormous scale.''

ARTS ABROAD: GERMAN FILMS AT FESTIVAL TREAT NAZIS MORE FREELY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Since the end of the Cold War, the Berlin Film Festival
has given up its obsession with East-West issues in favor of
frequent evocation of Germany's earlier _ Nazi _ past. No surprise,
then, that this year's 49th festival should include two
documentaries and two feature films about the Nazi years. At a time
of intense debate here over both compensation for Nazi victims and
construction of a Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, the subject seems
more topical than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, ``Aimee and Jaguar,'' which opened the 11-day
festival on Feb. 10, represents a significant change in the way
German cinema addresses the Nazi era. By recounting a poignant true
love story set in wartime Berlin between a Jewish woman and a
non-Jewish mother of four, a German film has for the first time
dared use the Nazi regime simply as the context for a human drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this would not have been possible 10 years ago,'' Max
Farberbock, the film's director, said. ``In fact, without Steven
Spielberg's `Schindler's List,' it might still be impossible. What
Spielberg did was to eliminate the borders of what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunther Rohrbach, one of the film's producers, agreed. ``Feature
films about the Nazis have always been laden with emotion,'' he
said. ``But we did not feel we had a right to turn this subject
into entertainment. We felt we had to inform people, not move them.
But things have changed. Now I think we can and should do things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Erica Fischer's book, ``Aimee and Jaguar,'' the film
brings together the separate lives of Felice Schragenheim (played
by Maria Schrader), one of a group of high-living Jewish lesbians
living undercover in Berlin in 1942, and Lilly Wust (Juliane
Kohler), a German housewife who took a Nazi officer as a lover
while her husband was fighting on the Russian front. Felice fell
for Lilly, and eventually the love was reciprocated. Felice called
herself Jaguar and gave Lilly the nickname Aimee.
</P>
<P>
   Felice, who worked under an assumed name at a Nazi newspaper and
gave information to the local resistance, was eventually arrested
and sent to Buchenwald in August 1944; she is believed to have died
in the final days of the war. Lilly survived and mourns Felice to
this day. ``I can imagine nothing more wonderful than seeing this
tribute to Felice,'' Mrs. Wust, now 85, said after attending the
film's premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which has now been released in Germany, was well
received by German movie critics. `` `Aimee and Jaguar' is a
watershed in German cinema,'' Hanns-Georg Rodek wrote in Die Welt.
``We are no longer afraid of using these stories. We can view our
history with freedom and open-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Aimee and Jaguar'' was indirectly inspired by ``Schindler's
List,'' Fernando Trueba's new feature, ``The Girl of My Dreams,''
is likely to be compared with Roberto Benigni's ``Life is
Beautiful'' in that it too treats the Nazi era with humor. The
winner of seven Goyas, the Spanish academy award, it follows a
Spanish movie director and half a dozen Spanish actors who are
invited to make a movie in Berlin in 1938 as a symbol of the mutual
admiration between Hitler and Franco.
</P>
<P>
   With Penelope Cruz playing Macarena Granada, the gorgeous
starlet who is chased around town by Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's
propaganda chief, the movie spoofs both the Nazis and the
Spaniards. When the Spaniards complain that German extras cannot
pass as Andalusians, Eastern European Jews are brought under guard
to play the roles. But even when Macarena saves the life of a
handsome Russian Jew and they escape together to Paris a la
``Casablanca,'' the film's mood remains light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is daring to do this now,'' said Trueba,
whose film ``Belle Epoque'' won the 1993 Oscar for best
foreign-language movie. ``The Marx Brothers and Charlie Chaplin
were daring in their day. But I don't think Benigni and I are
taking big risks by looking back like this. There is the risk of
making a bad film, yes, but there are no political, ideological or
moral risks.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the two Holocaust-related documentaries shown here
are perhaps more traditional. ``The Specialist,'' written by Rony
Brauman and Eyal Sivan, edits down 350 hours of film of Adolf
Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in 1961 into a 128-minute courtroom
drama inspired by Hannah Arendt's report on the trial. ``The Last
Days,'' directed by James Moll and produced by Spielberg's Shoah
Foundation, retraces the experiences of five Hungarians trapped in
the Nazis' final drive to exterminate all Jews.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The challenge for major film festivals, of course, is to combine
the commercial with the unexpected. Thus, most American films being
screened here _ among them Terrence Malick's ``Thin Red Line'' _
are simply using the festival to earn free publicity before their
European releases, while the only American film to premiere here
was Alan Rudolph's adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's best-selling novel
``Breakfast of Champions,'' starring Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte and
Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   But some less-heralded European movies have awakened more
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Among these was ``Mifune,'' the first film that Soren
Kragh-Jacobsen has made following the rules of the Dogme '95
Manifesto, proclaimed by his Danish fellow directors, Lars von
Triers (``The Idiots'') and Thomas Vinterberg (``The
Celebration''). Dogme directors agree among other things to use
hand-held cameras, to shoot only on location, to use no special
lighting, to record their sound at the same time as their images
and to avoid ``superficial action (murders, weapons, etc. must not
occur).''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mifune,'' Kersten (Anders Berthelsen), a newly married man
who claims he has no family, suddenly learns that his father has
died and that his retarded brother, Rud (Jesper Asholt), is alone
on the dilapidated family farm. He heads home to bury his father
and to hire a housekeeper to look after his brother. The job is
taken by Liva (Iben Hjelje), a high-class prostitute who is fleeing
her own problems. The result is a touching tale of responsibility,
love and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Kragh-Jacobsen said the Dogme rules liberated him, enabling him
to return to the basics of plot and actors without interference
from modern technology. ``It gave me back the joy of filmmaking,''
he said. ``I came from making big European productions, so-called
`Euro-puddings.' It was like going from being the captain of a
supertanker to being on a small boat that you can take where you
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other films suggested that announcement of the death of
European movies might be premature. ``Between the Legs,'' a raunchy
Spanish film directed by Manuel Gomez Pereira and starring Javier
Bardem and Victoria Abril, is a comedy about the perils of sexual
addiction. ``Night Shapes,'' a German film directed by Andreas
Dresen, weaves together three stories set in Berlin on the night of
a visit by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also offered premieres of two French films: Thomas
Vincent's ``Karnaval'' tells the story of a bemused Moroccan
immigrant caught up in carnival celebrations in Dunkirk, and
Bertrand Tavernier's ``It All Begins Today'' is set in a nursery
school in a depressed mining town in northern France.

A LOOK BACK ON THE SCARS OF RACISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I sit staring at the card that I just drew from the bottom of a
drawer. It is a membership card I received 1976, when I was
inducted into Phi Theta Kappa, the national honor fraternity of
junior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   I read it, front to back, back to front, over and over, waiting
for some logical point to manifest itself, hoping for something
that will help me put it in its proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing comes, and I am left only with the memory of a cool,
driving rain, of a slender, old white man and his stinging words,
``How did you get in this?''
</P>
<P>
   I sit now feeling as I did then, like an undeserving foreigner,
covered only by the distinction of the evening. And as I did then,
I remind myself that I got ``in'' the same way my white
counterparts had: I worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   I had been jolted back to that time just hours earlier, during a
dialogue with the Rev. Laurie Feille, pastor of Arlington Heights
Christian Church in Fort Worth. Both natives of Mississippi, we had
been asked by University Christian Church to come and talk about
our experiences coming of age there in the 1960s and how those
events affected our faith.
</P>
<P>
   But leaving the church that night, I was struck by the strong
emotion with which I had recounted such a distant memory. Somehow
it didn't feel like my past at all. Maybe it is my present. I was
no longer sure.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I had been born black in McComb to parents with a
sixth-grade education, and Faille not more than 100 miles away to
white college graduates in Hattiesburg. From the time I was 12, I
spent most weekends and evenings working to help make ends meet.
She spent her time doing what children do.
</P>
<P>
   She was 32 when she learned that there had been bombings of
black residences in Hattiesburg. I grew up frightened and fully
aware of bombings occurring in McComb. The daughter of a college
professor, she enrolled at the University of Southern Mississippi
in 1976. I enrolled there in 1977, after graduating from junior
college. Even then, our worlds never meshed.
</P>
<P>
   A chance meeting last fall brought us together under the same
roof, and Sunday night we sat face to face, recounting our lives,
the roads we traveled, the signposts we either ignored or carefully
considered. We talked for nearly an hour like long-lost friends; as
the audience began asking questions, we talked some more.
</P>
<P>
   The event had been billed as a dialogue between me and Feille to
drive home the fact that racism happens. For me, it was more a
cleansing experience. I had never sat down and told a white person
how those experiences made me feel, and I was struck by the
audience's seeming willingness to listen and not judge or make
excuses; to try to find some way to close the gaping hole that
divides us.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't expect were the apologies offered at the end of
our talk. Soliciting regret was never my goal. Fostering
understanding was.
</P>
<P>
   My life has been my life, a mixture of triumph and tragedy, joy
and despair. That was my promise, if you believe Scripture, from
the day I entered this world.
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme of things, my experiences as a black woman may
mean nothing or they may mean everything to those I spoke with
Sunday. But one thing is for sure, they are why I hold fast to my
faith, why I am convinced that without God's grace, much of what I
endured would have left me bitter or dead.
</P>
<P>
   I am neither.

WE NEED CHEAPER WEAPONS IN AGING BATTLE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows that it is expensive to raise children. Even kids
know that it's economically challenging to feed, clothe and care
for them, because we remind them about it all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many times I've said, ``Son, do you know how
much those shoes cost that you're dragging across the pavement like
Fred Flintstone? Fred did not have brakes on his cavemobile, but
you do have brakes on that bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I guess I haven't said that very many times, but I've
thought it a lot. Anyway, I know all about the high costs of the
spring and winter of our lives. It's the fall, the middle aging,
that's caught me by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While some folks are adding shelves to their closets, we've had
to add more cabinets to our master bathroom to hold all the creams
and liniments that keep us in one piece from Monday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   My husband has a green bottle of tablets for backaches and a
brown bottle of capsules for his headaches. The main ingredient in
each is acetaminophen, but I guess the rest of those minor
ingredients tell the pills which part of the body is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   He has five strengths of analgesic cream to rub on those sore
muscles after he plays his weekly game of basketball. One measly
game. I remember the days when he played ball all day long and then
took me dancing. Nothing ever hurt him back then. He'd sprain an
ankle playing football and it would heal before he made it to the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a lot of mouthwash and hair-care products crammed
into that one drawer I've assigned to him. Well, it's a long
drawer. It's shallow, but it's long.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the bathroom is filled with my stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Those cavewomen had it made. Run the fingers through the matted
hair once a week, and no makeup. I have to wash the hair, condition
it, dry it straight, then curl it again and finally arrange it so
the gray strands don't reflect a blinding light into the eyes of my
companions. My pores get opened and closed more than the front door
at Wal-Mart. And where does all this dry skin come from? And this
hair, too? I found a hair on my chin the other day that was 6
inches long. My husband wanted it, but I tossed itto in the trash.
Is this normal? No one ever talks about this stuff. All we see is
the end product.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know that underneath the perfect exteriors of the nightly
news anchors are gallons of moisturizer and yards of tape. Yes,
duct tape. Forget that expensive plastic surgery. You'll be amazed
at what a few strips of strategically placed duct tape can do to
combat the effects of age and gravity. It's a miracle, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm suggesting that we start a national discussion on aging,
not only graciously but also inexpensively. There has got to be a
better way to do this. Surely there's a way to simply widen my
shoes rather than buying a new pair. And hair loss for a lot of
guys is a big issue. We women have these chin hairs that we don't
want. Can't we recycle this stuff somehow?
</P>
<P>
   Think of all the money we could save with just a little
ingenuity. Hey, just think of all the tape we could buy!

<P>
   JACKSBORO, Texas _ U.P. Wilson strides into a small visiting
room of the John R. Lindsey State Jail and sticks out his hand.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, the popular Fort Worth bluesman is lean and strong;
moreover, he's clear-eyed, steady of voice and friendly.
Surprising, because Wilson has spent more than five months in this
facility 62 miles west of Fort Worth, thanks to his second cocaine
possession conviction in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   His time in stir seems to have affected Wilson little, except
that he had to cancel many shows in Europe, where he has been a
regular on the blues-festival circuit for nearly a decade _ which
might be good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Huary Perry Wilson, you see, knows all about the rumors
circulating for years in local blues circles: That he's a crack
addict, that he's broke, that he blows all the money he makes
playing lucrative shows in Europe. None of that, he says, is true.
Sure, he has smoked crack for the past three or four years. Yes,
he's been arrested twice, in September 1997 and May 1998, both
times at his home.
</P>
<P>
   But to Wilson, that does not add up to crack addiction. Two
busts within eight months would indicate a serious problem to some
people, but he doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might smoke crack two, three days in a row,'' he says. ``But
only if I was around somebody who had it. It never had ahold of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he says, he is neither broke nor without a
career. Wilson says he is going right back to playing European
clubs and festivals this spring, to recording (he has released four
CDs on London's JSP Records) and to perhaps starting up his own
label. He has savings, his home _ he's hardly down and out, and he
wants everyone to know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made quite a few friends in here,'' he says. ``Maybe I
just needed a little time out. I'm fine in here _ I'm great. What I
miss most is my guitar; it's just everyday life in here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wilson admits that it's everyday life that has landed
him in such serious trouble. His increasing fame in Europe has
meant more downtime at home, more cash in his pocket _ and more
temptations.
</P>
<P>
   They say be careful what you wish for. U.P. Wilson got
everything he'd ever hoped for not too long ago, and it landed him
in a whole lot of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A HOME-GROWN HERO
</P>
<P>
   Born in Shreveport, La., Wilson began playing in Fort Worth and
Dallas clubs in the mid-'50s, first with Robert Ealey and then,
beginning in the '60s, as a solo act.
</P>
<P>
   Even back then he had a great local reputation. Fort Worth was
full of young guys, white and black, who wanted to play like
Freddie King and B.B. King, and Wilson was their home-grown guitar
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all used to go see him play; we'd all pick up ideas from
him,'' says well-known Fort Worth bluesman Sumter Bruton.
``Everybody in town did. There's a style of Fort Worth blues
playing _ a real hip, jazzy style _ and it comes from U.P., Cornell
Dupree and Raymond George.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was also known for driving audiences crazy with the
``table trick'': He would set the guitar on a table or a stool and
play a song with one hand while smoking a cigarette or drinking a
beer with the other. Guitarist/vocalist Dave Millsap remembers
playing the fabled Bluebird in the late '70s and seeing Wilson work
his magic on crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd make more money in 10 minutes than we did all night,''
Millsap says. ``People would go berserk when he came in. It was
like a preacher thing _ people would come up to him to give him
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1987, Wilson had little besides a great local rep to show
for all those years of working the clubs. All that changed in 1988,
when Wilson was approached about cutting a record by Eddie Stout,
bassist and owner of the small PeeWee Records. That CD, ``On My
Way,'' led to a first trip to Europe. Soon he was going to Europe
several times a year for up to six weeks at a time, getting $450
for 45 minutes' work and coming home with thousands of dollars. He
quit his job as a janitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd make the same money playing in a week as I would working
for a month,'' he says with a laugh. ``They love the blues in
France. Your dressing room is crowded over there _ they're in line
to interview you.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was where the problems started. Wilson had money, a
certain amount of fame _ and, between tours, long periods of time
on his hands. When friends came over with crack, he says, he began
smoking more or less just for something to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three, four years ago,'' he says. ``I'd smoke it on the
weekends. I smoked primo _ you crack the rocks up, sprinkle it on
weed or tobacco, and roll it up and smoke it like a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Meek, Wilson's drummer agrees, saying Wilson's problem is
less physical addiction than ``social addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His friends keep him in it,'' says Meek, who has been booking
him and accompanying him to Europe since 1993. ``If I keep him
touring, he doesn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The first arrest came Sept. 24, 1997, when nine officers entered
his home and found ``a small off-white rocklike substance on the
table in the living room'' next to where Wilson was sitting. Wilson
had no prior convictions. He was charged with possession of a
controlled substance, less than 1 gram of cocaine. On April 22, he
was sentenced to 180 days in jail; he was given two years'
probation and fined $200. On May 8, he was arrested at home again.
This time, according to the police report, Wilson admitted he
smoked crack but said he did not deal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just come back from France and I was taking it easy,''
he says. ``They found a little ol' tiny piece, not even a good hit,
and took me down for that.''
</P>
<P>
   A PACK OF TROUBLES
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, however, the home was awash in
drugs: Three small bags of crack were found, as well as five
separate pieces, a razor blade with white residue, and a pipe with
brown residue. Wilson was charged with possession of less than 1
gram of cocaine. His probation was revoked, and on Aug. 11 he was
sentenced to six months in a state jail.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson passed his time in Jacksboro quietly; he took classes
toward getting his GED, he says. He also played in the facility's
gospel band for a while, according to chaplain David McIntyre. ``He
can hammer on that guitar, but I'd tell him to tone it down some,''
McIntyre says. ``He has a lot of talent and a good heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The local bluesmen are rooting for him. Bruton, Millsap and
others have fond memories of him and sincerely hope he can keep
himself clean and active. ``I think this is a shame,'' Millsap
says. ``I hope he can walk the line. He might want to step back and
look at it and say, `This may be my last shot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question Wilson can continue to tour and record for
years to come if he stays out of trouble. But the drug issue is
still there; Wilson says he doesn't need crack, but not that he'll
never smoke it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' he says. ``I wasn't addicted then,
so I can't get addicted now. I was never jonesin' for it in here.
Some people will do anything to get crack. I can't see that. I'm
not a fool behind it. I don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   And really, he says, nobody should worry about him. He's fine,
he says, and champing at the bit to get back to playing his blues.
``I've done a lot of planning,'' he says, just before leaving to go
to lunch. ``I'm well-fixed for music and money. I'm in good shape.
I'm set. I'm ready. And they're ready for me.''

<P>
   BLACKHISTORY-VOICES-1900 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ America in the early
1900s was a nation in metamorphosis. Yet some things appeared stuck
in the 19th century. The nation's blacks, with more than 50 years
of emancipation behind them, were still brutally segregated and
subject to racial violence. More than 70 were lynched in 1920.
Abject conditions in the South prompted many to come north,
launching what would come to be known as The Great Migration.
George Cooper: ``The realization of racism came on me in a gradual
way. I think it came on most kids in a gradual way, both white and
black.'' Ellen Lee Jackson: ``Dayton was a prejudiced place. As far
as the jobs were, you didn't get to have the good jobs like they
have now.'' Yvonne Walker-Taylor: ``I liked school because I was an
only child and going to school was just my piece of cake.'' Ned
Wood: ``In the Depression, life sure changed. We lost our farm in
1931. One year, we had boll weevils.'' (Keilman, Dayton Daily News)

forces fought well. On the homefront, Ellen Lee Jackson continued
working in Dayton while two of her brothers served. Yvonne

 &HT;    When there's a tale to tell
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Collecting an oral history can be as easy as
sitting down with a tape recorder or notebook. But those who have
done it say it is far more effective if you follow a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be prepared. Annie Bonaparte, who has conducted oral history
sessions between teen-agers and seniors in West Dayton, says people
should think in advance about the things they're interested in
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just sit down and think of the questions you want to ask a
person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   You also should decide how you want to take down the history.
Many people use an audiotape recorder or a video camera, but if you
want a written account, Marlese Durr, a sociologist at Wright State
University, recommends a notebook and pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually think the notes are good,'' she said. ``Otherwise,
you can spend a lot of time transcribing the interview or paying
for a transcriber.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte says history collectors should make sure they find a
quiet place to conduct their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start at home. Many fascinating stories are probably within
your own household.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, talk to your relatives,'' said Sue Taylor, a
Howard University anthropologist who has collected oral histories
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get them to help write down things that they remember. Ask
them in a way like this: `What was it like when . . . ?' Have them
tell you from that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Try a group setting. The Dayton Stories Project, which
collected tales from 1,200 local residents, used story circles in
which a number people told accounts of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good activity to do during a family reunion,''
said Marilyn Shannon, who ran the project. ``You have a lot of
different people there who can be there from all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But the success of this approach depends heavily on ground
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anything like that you need a facilitator,'' Shannon said.
``One of the most important things any leader can do is make sure
people agree to a couple of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them is that people speak one at a time. No kibitzing,
no interrupting. That's very hard to do, but you can learn that.
And they have to agree to how much time they have. It's a really
democratic way to get everyone involved.''
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends asking people about specifics _ family
members, for instance, or various characters they once knew. And
don't worry if the conversation drifts a bit. It can remind people
of previously forgotten memories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be bold. Don't worry about being turned down by a potential
subject. Bonaparte said people are usually more than willing to
answer questions about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, remember why you're doing this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stories are different from a conversation,'' Shannon said.
``Stories have a meaning. You tell why things are important.''

 &HT;    Some black families never backed away from segregation, racism
in society
 &HT;    By Lisa Perry
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Acceptance into Piqua society came slow and hard
for black families at the height of the integration movement during
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But some, including the Elmer V. Harris family, didn't back down
to segregationist pressures and smoothed the road to integration
for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, health and civic clubs, educational and
occupational opportunities and social groups were among doors
closed to Elmer Harris, 76, the grandson of a freed Virginia slave;
his wife Willie Mae; son William and daughter Sue Randi.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris, 47, now president of Masonry Systems Inc. of
Piqua, remembers well that Wednesdays were the only nights open to
black kids at the YMCA pool or the roller skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would change the water Wednesday nights,'' he said.
Finally, through subtle pressure ``from within and without,''
Harris said he became the first black member of the YMCA when his
father signed him up for swim lessons and he was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   William, in the first grade at North Street Elementary School,
quickly made the swim team, and traveled to numerous swim meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never appreciated why my dad came to all those meets,''
William said. ``It was to cover my behind in case there was any
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the elder Harris' presence, his was denied participation
at many swim meets.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Elmer Harris' first encounter with racism. His mother,
Clara B. Harris, a 1908 graduate of Wilberforce University, was
unable to find work in the Piqua City School system as a teacher.
Instead, she labored as a domestic.
</P>
<P>
   Piqua schools integrated in 1885, combining white students with
black students who formerly attended schools at the Cyrene Church
and Boone Street Colored School, closed in 1872 because of low
attendance, said Piqua historian James C. Oda.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Harris graduated in 1941 and William Harris in 1969 from
the Piqua schools. Now, William's children, Lance and Laura,
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Though the elder Harris served honorably in the U.S. Navy and
lost a brother, also named William, a master sergeant chief line
mechanic with the Tuskegee Airmen, to an airplane accident in
Italy, blacks in Piqua found it necessary to create their own
Veterans of Foreign Wars post.
</P>
<P>
   The Stout-Harris post is named for William Harris and Alex
Stout, a black medic from Piqua killed in the D-Day invasion while
trying to rescue his commanding officer. On March 15, 1946, Elmer
Harris became quartermaster of the post.
</P>
<P>
   For those returning from the war, real estate was available only
in certain areas of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not sell to you if you wanted property where they
didn't want you to live,'' the elder Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   And blacks weren't allowed to sit where local theater managers
didn't want them to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 or 15 of us used to sit in the back rows'' reserved
for blacks at Schine's Piqua Theater, Harris said. When he and a
dozen or so of his fellow World War II veterans sat in the middle
rows and refused to move, management moved the whites away from the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Theater management was directed not to sell tickets to Harris,
who was labeled a ``rabble-rouser.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harris said he was determined to make his life and vocation
in Piqua. Now president of his own masonry company, he said that
being invited to bid for a project was a challenge for black masons
until affirmative action opened the door.
</P>
<P>
   Once he and son William walked through that door and showed what
they were capable of doing, there was no turning back. They count
among their projects the Montgomery County Jail, the Dayton Arcade
and Wright State University's Ervin J. Nutter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the mid-1980s, they accepted us for what we could do and
not because they had to have us,'' the elder Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Harris is quick to praise his father for sacrifices
he and others made during those volatile times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for what (my dad) did. He is a quiet leader of
change, vocal and forceful,'' William said.
</P>
<P>
   Though William said he still feels subtle racism on occasion, it
was ``nothing to what my dad went through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it possible for me and my friends to have what he
could not have,'' William said. And the lesson he learned from his
father he hopes to pass along to his own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give everybody the same benefit of the doubt,'' William said.
``I still don't get that today. Try to give everyone an even
break.''

 &HT;    Dream closer, but still elusive
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The end of the 1960s marked the completion of the
modern civil rights movement's most urgent battles. The
once-radical crusade had become mainstream, and many blacks reaped
the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Black people began claiming seats of power, from Congress to
corporate boards. New generations found opportunities their parents
could scarcely imagine. One of Ned Wood's sons became a surgeon.
George Cooper's daughter became a law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advances, discrimination continued. Many blacks
still found it too difficult to get loans and too easy to attract
police attention. And some complained of a leadership vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Many urban centers never fully recovered from the riots of the
1960s. When Ellen Lee Jackson returned to the city after living in
Tennessee, she couldn't find many of the black-owned businesses
that gave life to parts of west Dayton. The buildings had been
boarded up and abandoned. Drugs became an increasing problem in
some neighborhoods, including Wood's.
</P>
<P>
   As those born before the 1920s settled into retirement, many
looked back to conclude that things had indeed changed for the
better. The racism they had known as children was now socially
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some, such as Yvonne Walker-Taylor, saw progress stalling
and threatening to reverse. They feared for the future.
</P>
<P>
   But after 80-plus years of life, she and the rest of her
generation had done their part. Now it was up to others.

 &HT;    There's still a long way to go
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Editor's Note: The following dialogues were
culled from extensive sit-down interviews with each individual.
Reporter John Keilman conducted the tape-recorded interviews and
edited dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   THE STORY THUS FAR: George Cooper has become the Dayton city
government's first black department head. Ellen Lee Jackson has
moved to Tennessee with her husband, but finds the South a pleasant
place. Yvonne Walker-Taylor has encountered much worse treatment in
South Carolina during teaching stints there. Ned Wood has watched
white flight decimate diversity on the west side of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   As they near retirement age, they watch new opportunities open
for their children, and consider what the future might hold for
American race relations.
</P>
<P>
   YVONNE WALKER-TAYLOR: After my last divorce in the 1950s, I
tried to adopt but they wouldn't let a single woman adopt in those
days.
</P>
<P>
   And then I just gave up the idea and took on different students
to mentor. I have pictures of them all over the house. There were
twins who were the most like children. One of them lives in
Atlanta. ``Mama'' _ soon as I hear that, I know who it is.
</P>
<P>
   NED WOOD: My second son decided he wanted to be a doctor. So he
went to Indiana Tech for four years, and then Tennessee four years,
and Detroit four years. When he finished, he was a surgeon doctor.
He's a top surgeon now.
</P>
<P>
   I have a daughter who retired from the Post Office. My oldest
son worked at General Motors, and he'll have his 30 years in this
year. He's done janitorial work. But he gets almost as much as
someone on the assembly line _ $20 an hour. When I retired in 1973
I was getting $5.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE COOPER: My daughter Peggy went to Roosevelt High School
in Dayton. Her life has been much, much different than ours. When I
went to college, I had to work to earn money. Peggy worked while
she was in college because we were trying to help her develop a
work ethic, if you will. She didn't have to work, thank God.
</P>
<P>
   When she graduated, she said she wanted to go to New York and
think for a year. We said, ``Peggy, we've seen you through college.
If you want to go to grad school, we'll help you do that. If you
want to think, you'll have to do that on your own.'' She decided to
go and think.
</P>
<P>
   She got herself a little three-story walk-up in New York and
started working for the Northern Student Movement, $50 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN LEE JACKSON: Harriman, Tenn., only had maybe 5,000 or
6,000 population, I think. It wasn't very large. The people didn't
treat you mean as far as I could see, but they didn't have too many
blacks right away to work in the different businesses.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: I climbed the ladder at Wilberforce University
the hard way. I started out being just an instructor. Then I ran
the reading lab. Then I finally became an assistant professor and
then an assistant to the president.
</P>
<P>
   I went in little pigeon steps, all the way up, and finally I was
provost. I was running the school when the president was out
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1984, I became president.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I retired May 25, 1973, and left for California June 1. My
wife got a job, so I figured with her income and my retirement, we
could make it.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for a home for girls. It was a huge building. It
housed 59 girls. They were wayward girls, wards of the state. They
called it Penny Lane. My wife worked there while my son was in
college, trying to be a doctor. She and I both helped our son
through school.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: Once, we didn't hear from Peggy for three weeks. We
couldn't find her. You can imagine how we felt. She finally called
us and said she had been in the South, registering black people to
vote. She didn't want to let us know because she didn't want us to
worry. Toward the end of that year, she decided that she would like
to be a lawyer
</P>
<P>
   She went to Harvard, and that's where she met her husband. He
was in law school a year ahead of her. They got married, went to
New York to live. She was working in the legal defense fund for the
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mayor Ed Koch appointed Peggy a family court judge, and she
worked at that for a goodly number of years. She finally came and
said she was going to quit, because she had gotten the chance to
teach at one of the law schools.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I have accepted a job at the NYU law school. The
basic reason I'm going to take it is that I'm so dissatisfied with
the quality of law that's being practiced in this country that I
want to train some good lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Janet Reno asked her staff to look across the
country and find eight lawyers who were interested in trying to put
more humanity into the training of lawyers. Peggy was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: In Tennessee, as far as myself, I mixed very well with
the whites. In the block where I lived, well, we were the only
blacks. Around the corner from us there was maybe two blacks, I
think. Now, farther down there were a lot of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any kind of white flight in our neighborhood. I
believe it was because the man that I married was well-known. He
was a very likable person and I think that helped keep them from
thinking any differently about it.
</P>
<P>
   He passed in 1989. I came back five years later to stay with my
brother and his wife in Jefferson Twp.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: My third husband had had three children of his
own. Never a one came to see him till he died in 1983 and then they
just thought they were going to get this house. So weren't they
fooled when I had a prenuptial agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, those kids would have taken my house away from me. I'd have
been out in the street somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I came back to Dayton from California in 1976. My wife
came down with chronic arthritis and couldn't no longer work. I
came out of retirement and went into gardening.
</P>
<P>
   My garden was almost as long as this building. It was half an
acre. It was on Hoover. We had the biggest and best garden in the
city and all the surroundings. I started that up in 1977. My
brother shared it with me. We raised a whole lot of vegetables
there. We had sweet potatoes. I raised one that was a fraction
under three pounds. It was huge. We sold a lot of them, and some of
them we used for our own food.
</P>
<P>
   I worked in the gardens for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: After I got back from Tennessee, when I'd go out I
didn't know where I was half the time. There was such a big
difference in the town from what it was. All of the things boarded
up now.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is dead as a doornail on Fifth Street now. Most of
the things are gone _ a lot of them are gone _ and those that are
there are boarded up. Quite a change!
</P>
<P>
   I think that is sad because at the time when I was here, we
couldn't go out anywhere unless we stopped at some of these places
on Fifth Street. If we had a club meeting, we had to stop at some
of these clubs before we came home. It was always a joy. But now,
there isn't any kind of entertainment out there.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I retired in 1981. Since then, there have been a number
of instances one can talk about where institutions and even groups
of people have made contributions very quietly. But no question
about it, there's a leadership vacuum today. I don't really know
why it is so, because we have, as a people, progressed so
positively in the past two decades. The sheer brainpower for that
kind of leadership is here. It's available.
</P>
<P>
   While I grant you this is a different day than (the Rev. Martin
Luther) King's day, there is still a tremendous amount of work that
needs to be done in the area of human and race relations. The
brainpower is there. But I'm afraid _ and this may be following the
white pattern _ that money has become the prevalent factor.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: Name one. Name one black leader. Now, Colin
Powell would be a good one, but Colin is going to keep himself up
here and he's not going to come down and get dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson is an opportunist to me. He goes which way is
popular to go. That's what I feel about him, my personal feelings.
I don't feel any loyalty to Jesse Jackson. I don't feel the same
kind of love and respect for him that I did Martin Luther or for my
man, Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   There's nobody out there that you can say, ``Look! Here he's
coming up; he's going to be one of the leaders.'' And a leaderless
people is a confused lot.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: After I retired, I was living at 625 Dearborn. The crime
and the drugs didn't start until the mid-1980s. And it advanced.
They started selling heroin at first. That was too expensive. They
couldn't afford it. It was $25 a pop. Then they came up with the
crack. They mixed up cocaine with other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood really went down. That's why my sons and
daughter wanted me to move out. It was dangerous for me. I could
either get killed or get hooked on it. Them old addicts say, ``Hey,
take a hit.'' I'd say, ``You want me to be a damn fool like you? No
way.''
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I would say life is better for blacks today. Myself, I
have always been around white people so it's not any problem to me.
It's like where we were born. Right across the alley behind our
house was a white family that lived there and they were always
friendly toward us.
</P>
<P>
   They would come over and play in the yard with the boys every
day in the summer and that was every day in the summer. When I was
young they called me sis.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: It's better today for a black person than at any other
time in my life. No question about it. In the past two decades,
doors have opened for black participation which were never dreamed
of four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, if you wanted or needed a black nuclear
engineer, I doubt that you could have found one. Today I know six.
And I don't know a hell of a lot of people. That's progress.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: It hasn't changed much. I feel that it's
retrogressing. I feel that we're picking up and I feel that people
who have prejudices against blacks are resurrecting them now
because I think the lid is off. I predict some very stormy time
ahead for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if we respect each other or not. I see black on
black crime. Back in the 1940s and the 1950s you used to reach down
and bring somebody with you. Now you just get up there by yourself
and say, ``Look at me. I'm up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, well, look at Thomas, Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas. There he is up there with his white wife. He thinks the
world is his oyster. He came up, but how did he get there? And he's
so black that he bleeds black, so he can't deny being black. We are
known by the color of our skin.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I think it works out OK now. I think in days to come
you won't know who is white and who is black. That's what it's
leading up to.
</P>
<P>
   There shouldn't be any difference anyway. We were all born to
the same things and there really shouldn't be any differences in
the blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: One thing my great-grandchildren can take from me would be
become a born-again Christian. There's a passage in the Bible that
says, ``Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven, and all of its
righteousness, and all of these things will be added unto you.''
</P>
<P>
   I came back from World War II and repented and rededicated my
life to God, and I was baptized over again and lived a clean life.
I think that was part of the longevity of my life, living a clean
life most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: Whatever I am today, or whatever I was, goes back to
home in Washington, N.C. It also goes back to a woman named
Margaret Gillespie Cooper, my wife. She is not only a supporting
influence but a guiding influence, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   But life's been interesting. It's been good to us.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: When I die, sing no sad song for me, 'cause I've
lived a good life. A good life. I've had ups and I've had my downs
and my sadnesses and my joys. The only thing that I regret is that
I was never able to have my own children.
</P>
<P>
   I despair sometimes when I look, when I see what's coming up and
what's probably waiting for an unsuspecting group of youngsters who
want to demand their rights but don't quite know what those rights
ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   There's going to be a whole lot of changes, a whole lot of
heartaches. Man, there's going to be so many things. I'm going to
float around and look. I hope I'll be able to look down and see
what's going on down here.

</P>
<P>
   BLACKHISTORY-VOICES-1900 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ America in the early
1900s was a nation in metamorphosis. Yet some things appeared stuck
in the 19th century. The nation's blacks, with more than 50 years
of emancipation behind them, were still brutally segregated and
subject to racial violence. More than 70 were lynched in 1920.
Abject conditions in the South prompted many to come north,
launching what would come to be known as The Great Migration.
George Cooper: ``The realization of racism came on me in a gradual
way. I think it came on most kids in a gradual way, both white and
black.'' Ellen Lee Jackson: ``Dayton was a prejudiced place. As far
as the jobs were, you didn't get to have the good jobs like they
have now.'' Yvonne Walker-Taylor: ``I liked school because I was an
only child and going to school was just my piece of cake.'' Ned
Wood: ``In the Depression, life sure changed. We lost our farm in
1931. One year, we had boll weevils.'' (Keilman, Dayton Daily News)

Roosevelt issued an executive order banning discrimination in
defense industries and government jobs. And though he maintained
segregation in the armed forces, he allowed some blacks to become
officers for the first time. One of them was George Cooper. Black
forces fought well. On the homefront, Ellen Lee Jackson continued
working in Dayton while two of her brothers served. Yvonne
Walker-Taylor, who had married a Tuskeegee Airman, moved to a
military base in Alabama. George Cooper never made it to combat.

FEDERAL AGENCY WARNS PEOPLE: `PREPARE FOR THE WORST' WITH Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: FIXES 13th graf to delete reference to Central America)  
 (Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' the
Federal Emergency Management Agency advised Wednesday as it issued
a guide for consumers to prepare for Year 2000 computer-bug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The agency stressed that the most important thing people can do
to avoid problems resulting from computer crashes is to ``stay
informed'' since institutions are varying widely in their response
to the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask your local government, your bank, your utility company and
other organizations that you rely upon what they are doing to be
ready'' for the Year 2000, or Y2K, problem, the FEMA guide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being prepared is key to dealing with any potential emergency,
whether natural or man-made,'' FEMA Director James Lee Witt said in
a statement. ``We need to take the same approach we use with
hurricanes, tornadoes or floods _ plan for the worst and hope for
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that there is no indication that the Year 2000
glitch will cause widespread disruptions in the United States, the
FEMA guide recommended that Americans:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep copies of their bills, bank statements and other records.
Consumers with investments should consider asking their banks and
brokerages to issue special statements of their accounts that would
give their investment values by this Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store enough food and clean water to last up to a week. Also,
people should buy candles, matches, batteries and flashlights for
possible power outages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect some of the problems stemming from the Y2K bug to begin
before Jan. 1. The guide said consumers should be prepared for
possible disruptions on July 1, when 46 states begin their fiscal
year 2000. Another date to watch is Oct. 1, the beginning of fiscal
year 2000 for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA also recommended that people with personal computers check
with their PC's manufacturer and with the manufacturer of the
computer's software to find out if they are Y2K-compliant, that is,
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Without being reprogrammed or having their microchips replaced,
many older computers, originally geared to recognize only the last
two digits of a year, will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, when the
machines will assume the 00 that they see means the year is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Systems could also fail when one that thinks the year is 1900
interacts with another that thinks it is 2000. Unable to sort out
the difference, the two systems would either stop or give out wrong
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we tell the American people everything we
know, for an educated public will always make the right
decisions,`` FEMA Deputy Director Robert M. ``Mike'' Walker said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, an independent federal agency that reports directly to the
president, helps communities prepare for and recover from all types
of disasters. The agency, which has often earned high marks for its
quick aid to communities hit by catastrophic events, most recently
provided assistance to victims of Hurricane Georges, which battered
the Gulf Coast last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its warnings, the FEMA guide also contained several
pieces of good news. Among the things most Americans should not
worry about, according to FEMA, are:
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' the
Federal Emergency Management Agency advised Wednesday as it issued
a guide for consumers to prepare for Year 2000 computer-bug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The agency stressed that the most important thing people can do
to avoid problems resulting from computer crashes is to ``stay
informed'' since institutions are varying widely in their response
to the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask your local government, your bank, your utility company and
other organizations that you rely upon what they are doing to be
ready'' for the Year 2000, or Y2K, problem, the FEMA guide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being prepared is key to dealing with any potential emergency,
whether natural or man-made,'' FEMA Director James Lee Witt said in
a statement. ``We need to take the same approach we use with
hurricanes, tornadoes or floods _ plan for the worst and hope for
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that there is no indication that the Year 2000
glitch will cause widespread disruptions in the United States, the
FEMA guide recommended that Americans:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep copies of their bills, bank statements and other records.
Consumers with investments should consider asking their banks and
brokerages to issue special statements of their accounts that would
give their investment values by this Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store enough food and clean water to last up to a week. Also,
people should buy candles, matches, batteries and flashlights for
possible power outages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect some of the problems stemming from the Y2K bug to begin
before Jan. 1. The guide said consumers should be prepared for
possible disruptions on July 1, when 46 states begin their fiscal
year 2000. Another date to watch is Oct. 1, the beginning of fiscal
year 2000 for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA also recommended that people with personal computers check
with their PC's manufacturer and with the manufacturer of the
computer's software to find out if they are Y2K-compliant, that is,
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Without being reprogrammed or having their microchips replaced,
many older computers, originally geared to recognize only the last
two digits of a year, will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, when the
machines will assume the 00 that they see means the year is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Systems could also fail when one that thinks the year is 1900
interacts with another that thinks it is 2000. Unable to sort out
the difference, the two systems would either stop or give out wrong
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we tell the American people everything we
know, for an educated public will always make the right
decisions,`` FEMA Deputy Director Robert M. ``Mike'' Walker said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, an independent federal agency that reports directly to the
president, helps communities prepare for and recover from all types
of disasters. The agency, which has often earned high marks for its
quick aid to communities hit by catastrophic events, most recently
provided assistance to victims of Hurricane Georges, which battered
the Gulf Coast last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its warnings, the FEMA guide also contained several
pieces of good news. Among the things most Americans should not
worry about, according to FEMA, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Money. The banking industry has been working on the problem
for several years and at the end of 1998, 96 percent of banks were
said to be on track to be Y2K-ready by this June 30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Massive power outages. The guide said they are unlikely. The
electric utility industry has completed work on more than half of
its critical systems and expects to have finished them all by June
30. However, industry officials warn that minor outages _ those
lasting a day or two _ cannot be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flying. The Federal Aviation Administration has fixed more
than 90 percent of its critical systems and expects to have them
all reprogrammed within the next few months. In addition, airplane
manufacturers report that none of the problems identified so far
would present a safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government. More than 60 percent of its critical
systems are now Y2K-compliant, and officials they all will be
before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home appliances. Most home electronic products will not be
affected by the Y2K bug. However, FEMA recommends that people check
with manufactures to make sure any appliances they consider
essential are Y2K-compliant.

ARGENTINA MOVES TO CURB MIGRATION FROM POOR NEIGHBORING LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ With the economy slowing and street
crime rising, President Carlos Saul Menem has introduced a series
of bills to Congress to stem the flow of illegal immigration from
Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional debate on the legislation has not yet begun, but
the bills have already created tensions between Argentina and its
poorer neighbors. And they have prompted criticism from the
hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church and human-rights groups that
the government is unleashing a xenophobic campaign to make
scapegoats out of poor, defenseless people.
</P>
<P>
   But by raising an issue with widespread appeal, the ruling
Justicialist party may succeed in putting the opposition on the
defensive in a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the bills also highlights the growing rate of
migration of peasants and workers across borders throughout South
America, raising a potentially potent and divisive issue in not
only Argentina, but also Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws would impose fines of up to $500,000 on individuals
or companies who employ illegal aliens. They would give the
interior minister the power to deport any alien sentenced to more
than two years in prison. Anyone arrested for helping foreigners
enter the country illegally would be subject to prison sentences of
five to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about illegal immigration here are imprecise, and the
government and private groups disagree on the dimensions of the
problem. But experts seem to agree that Argentina has recently seen
an increase in the immigration of poor Bolivians, Paraguayans and
Peruvians, a phenomenon that dates from at least 30 years ago. Some
analysts have estimated up to 1 million Peruvians live outside
Peru, mainly in the United States, Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Argentine census figures, the number of
Paraguayans here increased, from 154,000 in 1960 to 250,000 in
1991. In that period, the number of Peruvians increased, from 5,100
to 16,000. Experts say the trend is accelerating as the regional
economy slows in response to the East Asian and Brazilian financial
crises.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern provinces, migrants frequently do backbreaking
work like picking cotton and strawberries. In the cities they shine
shoes and do other odd jobs. The alien migrants are rarely
unionized, and they are generally paid much less than Argentines.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition congressman, Juan Pablo Cafiero, has called the
move to tighten immigration laws ``a racist campaign.'' He added,
``What they are trying to do is blame our social problems on the
immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cafiero, the 70,000 or so immigrants in the Buenos
Aires metropolitan region make up less than 2 percent of the
workforce, so they cannot be blamed for an unemployment rate has
risen slightly over the last month, after decreasing under the
previous year. He said 2.5 percent of those found guilty of crimes
were foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the need for the new legislation, Hugo Franco, a
senior official in charge of immigration control, said the
government was merely interested in ``protecting legal immigration
and fighting illegality.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said at least 60 percent of those arrested for petty
crimes in Buenos Aires in recent months were foreigners. Critics
contest that estimate and note that foreigners make up a much
smaller percentage of the prison population.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivian President Hugo Banzer has publicly expressed concerns
that the new proposals will generate anti-Bolivian feelings and
asked for guarantees that the rights of Bolivian immigrants will be
respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Argentine authorities,'' Banzer said, ``to prevent
abuses and deportations.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ As the first American test tube baby,
17-year-old Samantha Steel is grateful her parents, Laurie and Jon
Steel, went to such extraordinary efforts to bring her into the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in a test tube in England, Samantha doesn't consider
herself a creature of science fiction but a miracle of technology
and her parents' enduring love.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Samantha, an American who was born in London, is among
the more than 500,000 children around the world who owe their lives
to in-vitro fertilization, which is the uniting of egg and sperm in
a glass container. The fertilized egg or embryo is then inserted
into the mother's womb where, if it implants, develops into a fetus
and nine months later, a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really lucky and so very grateful that I was born, that
I'm alive,'' said Samantha, who has lived in Kenwood, Calif., since
she was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 21, 1982, Samantha is among the first crop of test
tube babies approaching adulthood. Louise Brown, the world's first
baby conceived through in-vitro fertilization, was born near
Manchester, England, in July 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Distinctions about the first test tube babies get tricky, said
Laurie Steel, a computer specialist who works out of her Kenwood
home. Samantha's father, Jon Steel, is a Sonoma County
veterinarian. The couple met while attending Stanford University,
married and studied in England where they were able to have the
child they always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   She said Samantha is the first American and the world's fourth
child conceived through in-vitro fertilization. Samantha was born
in England two months before Elizabeth Carr, 17, of Westminister,
Mass., who is recognized as the first test tube baby actually born
in the United States. Carr, born on Dec. 28, 1981, was conceived in
vitro at the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   A willowy junior in high school, Samantha, cool and comfortable
about her beginnings in a glass dish, is embarking on a career as a
teen fashion model. On Valentine's Day she left for Tokyo and two
months in photography studios and on fashion runways. This summer
she will be modeling in Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock. I can't believe it's all happening. It's always
been my goal to travel the world and now it's happening,'' said
Samantha, an only child. She declines to say how much she's earning
but she says it's enough to finance her college education and buy a
car.
</P>
<P>
   It's Samantha's waif-like looks _ not her mysterious allure as a
test tube baby _ that is making her hot property in the fashion
world. She's 5 foot, 10 inches and a size 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fashion people don't even know I'm a test tube baby,''
said Samantha, who until recently worked part time at Squeezer's
Juice Bar in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   She attended Kenwood Elementary School and was a member of the
4-H and Girl Scouts. She plays the violin, kicks a soccer ball and
loves riding horses.
</P>
<P>
   For Samantha's parents, their beautiful child, produced through
what was once a revolutionary medical procedure, is a treasured
gift. And Samantha's birth is testament to Laurie and Jon Steel's
perseverance, borne of the belief that they were destined to be
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a miracle,'' said Laurie Steel, who could not conceive
a child. ``Obviously she was meant to be here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For 10 years, Laurie Steel sought help at fertility clinics but
couldn't get pregnant. She wouldn't give up, driven passionately by
her desire to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   Steel and her husband were U.S. students at Cambridge University
in England in 1978 when headlines screamed of the ``World's First
Tube Baby.'' Jon was enrolled in Cambridge University's veterinary
school and Laurie was studying violin. The couple had met at
Stanford University, married and then moved to England to finish
their education.
</P>
<P>
   Following the news of the scientific breakthrough, the Steels'
hopes for a child soared. But it would be more than two years
before they were accepted at an in-vitro fertilization clinic run
by the doctors who had perfected the procedure that produced Louise
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Steel graduated and worked as a veterinarian in England
while the couple waited for a chance at in vitro.
</P>
<P>
   There were thousands of women seeking the help of pioneering
fertility doctors Patrick Steptoe, a gynecologist, and Robert
Edwards who, coincidentally, had been Jon Steel's genetics
professor at Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Steel was the only woman in her group to become pregnant
during her session at the famed fertilization clinic _ called
Bourne Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, who has her father's eyes and her mother's mouth, was
born in London. The Steel family bounced between England and the
United States for several years before finally settling in Sonoma
County, where Jon opened his veterinary practice.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Steel said because Samantha was the first American test
tube baby, reporters for the National Enquirer, the supermarket
tabloid, were hot on their trail. To thwart the tabloid, the Steels
gave the Ladies' Home Journal their exclusive story, which was
published in January 1982. A photograph of Laurie and 2-month old
Samantha share the magazine cover with actress Goldie Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Samantha came to be has been openly discussed
among the Steels, who feel blessed and honored to be part of the
historic technology. Samantha said when she hears about her
parents' unrelenting efforts to have her she is genuinely touched
by the sacrifices that brought them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very loving family,'' Samantha said.

hair, blue eyes _ wicked combination,'' announces Fletcher (Red)
Brandon, the narrator, at the outset of Martyn Bedford's skillful
new novel, ``The Houdini Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Red is a magician who makes ``a tidy living'' working under the
name Peter Prestige, ``the Prodigious Prestidigitator.'' One
evening while drinking at an Oxford pub called The Eagle and Child,
the crowd he's drinking with asks him to do a trick and he chooses
Rosa, whom he has never met before, as his subject.
</P>
<P>
   He instructs her to hold out her hands palms downward and make
fists; then he asks her if she believes in ``the stigmata,''
meaning ``that we can be marked with the sign of Christ's suffering
on the cross.''
</P>
<P>
   When she says, ``Oh, sure,'' he dips his finger in an ashtray
and rubs ash onto the back of her right fist, announcing as he does
so, ``I shall cause the ash to pass through the hand and appear
like a stigma in the center of your palm.''
</P>
<P>
   When she unclenches her fist her palm is unmarked. The crowd
groans. Rosa smirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you left-handed''? he asks suddenly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She nods and slowly uncurls the fingers of her left hand. In its
center is ``an unmistakable dab of cigarette ash.''
</P>
<P>
   It is of course significant that the trick involves Christ's
wounds on the cross, for only a dozen or so pages later, Red will
announce that Rosa has died. They spent the night of the trick at
his apartment. The next day she moved in. But after living together
for a year, he was away on tour when two constables visited his
dressing room after a performance one night. They told him that
there had been ``an incident'' and that Rosa was dead. She
apparently had been killed as the result of jumping off a train.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant that the two of them met in the pub
called The Eagle and Child. For the mystery behind her death will
involve certain beasts that prey on young people. As for the
novel's title: Rosa's sudden disappearance makes her the ``Houdini
Girl.'' The suspense of the story is whether like the great escape
artist she will manage to reappear.
</P>
<P>
   At first, both Red and the police are confounded by Rosa's
demise. It turns out she had intended to leave Red for good, yet
her body was found without any luggage, and no suitcases or bags
were left behind on the train. Further investigation on Red's part
reveals that Rosa's surname wasn't really Kelly; that she had lied
to Red about her childhood, and that she had worked only three days
a week instead of the five she told him she did as a clerk with a
newspaper for Irish expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the story, Red alternately fills the reader
in on the year he and Rosa spent together, and recounts how,
following certain threads she left behind, he learned where she was
going when she left him, what her childhood was like and
particularly why she had never trusted his love for her. His
narrative is absorbing and well-paced by and large, with well-drawn
characters, particularly a children's magician who helps Red out, a
woman who turns out to have been on the train with Rosa, and Rosa
herself, a lively Irishwoman who has earned her cynicism 10 times
over.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's only serious flaws are a tediously overcomplicated
stretch toward the end, and the intermittent italicized passages in
which Rosa tells her story.
</P>
<P>
   While effective in their foul-mouthed frankness, these appear
out of nowhere and have no logical connection to the novel's main
point of view, unless you accept that the authority of all
narrative is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be what Bedford is saying, especially in the light
of his first novel, ``Acts of Revision,'' about a young man
avenging himself on his schoolteachers by revising the negative
reports they once wrote about him. (This book won The Yorkshire
Post first-novel award.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the meaning of what happened to Rosa is as
important to Red as the details, and he continually examines that
meaning _ Is her death an illusion? How did she perceive him? _ by
comparing what happened to her to the various classic magic tricks
he performs, like the Zigzag Girl, which involves displacing the
parts of his assistant's body, or the Living Doll, in which he
kisses a statue of his assistant to life.
</P>
<P>
   Red won't tell us how he does these tricks. ``Methods are seldom
as interesting as the feats performed by their means,'' he says at
one point; ``if I tell the audience how it's done, I diminish their
respect for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does dilate at length on some of the paradoxes of
performing magic, for instance that the ideal audience is one
comprising ``mathematicians, philosophers and scientists,'' because
``a logical mind, receptive to a connection between each apparent
cause and its apparent effect, is more prone to surprise when an
illusion reaches its `illogical' climax.''
</P>
<P>
   One paradox that interests him especially is that while
magicians and liars seem to resemble each other, ``magic is founded
in honesty,'' while ``lying is founded in dishonesty.'' As the
novel's epigraph, a remark by the magician Ricky Jay, puts it:
``The magician is supremely honest. He tells you he is going to
deceive you, then lives up to his word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another essential difference,'' Red reflects, is that ``once
the methodology _ the trick, if you like _ is exposed, magic ceases
to be magical, while a lie remains a lie even after the liar is
caught out.''
</P>
<P>
   Without giving anything away, it can be said that there is a
very good reason this distinction preoccupies Red. In his long
search for the truth, a lie is finally what explains everything.
Perhaps the most impressive accomplishment of ``The Houdini Girl''
is to have made this lie so powerful in its effect.

WILL `ER' SURVIVE THE LOSS OF DR. ROSS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ads for Thursday night's's episode of ``ER'' show a picture
of George Clooney's Dr. Doug Ross beneath the question, ``Gone for
good?'' So maybe someone should notify NBC's clueless ad company
that Clooney's absolutely certain exit from ``ER'' has only been
the month's hottest TV story, most notably on last week's TV Guide
cover, which loudly declared ``Bye, George!'' Yes, George Clooney,
he of the heavy-duty eye contact and the bobbing and ever-stubbly
chin, is saying goodbye to the No. 1 drama to pursue his movie
career. And the real mystery is not whether Clooney will go, but
how the writers will usher him out (no advance tape was available
for critics) and how well the show will survive his absence. ``Gone
for ill?'' may be the better question.
</P>
<P>
   And it's easy to wonder if Clooney's departure will hurt the
five-year-old ``ER,'' which has been in a bit of a creative slump
this season. With his naturalistic acting style, Clooney has turned
his maverick pediatrician into one of the show's most appealing and
multidimensional characters, both in and out of the ER. Because Dr.
Ross is so reckless in his need to help children, and so ready to
ignore callous parents and insurance companies, he has instigated
some of the juciest ethical dilemmas on ``ER.'' Indeed, he'll leave
County General Memorial Hospital mired in an interesting and
complicated situation involving the euthanasia of a dying
8-year-old boy whom we saw moaning from unstoppable pain. And
because Doug has been so reckless in his need to flee from
emotional commitment, and so ready to shed his scrubs for a
one-night-stand, he has stimulated some of the show's dishiest
melodrama, including an affair with his father's ex. He's been both
an anti-romantic and a romantic hero in the course of his tenure on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, of all the vivid characters in the ``ER'' ensemble,
including Gloria Reuben's Jeannie Boulet and Julianna Margulies's
Carol Hathaway, Clooney's Ross has had the fullest arc of
development. He is a different man from the womanizing hothead of
the first season _ and not just because he's been through a
veritable Us magazine of much-commented-upon hair styles. We saw
him bottom out after the overdose of a one-night-stand whose name
he didn't know; we saw him cope with the death of his father, who
was driving drunk and killed a father of six; and we saw him get
back together with Carol and patiently wait for her to feel safe
with him again. Part of the reason his renewed relationship with
Carol has been so satisfying to watch is that we've seen the two
weather so much together, with the sort of realism and thoroughness
not often found on TV dramas.
</P>
<P>
   But ``ER'' is in danger of losing some of its valuable realism
and thoroughness this season. The most glaring example was a garish
four-episode plotline involving guest star Mare Winningham as a
woman who passed herself off as a celebrated doctor and became
obsessed with Mark Greene. It belonged in a horror setting, it came
to an abrupt conclusion, and it dangerously resembled a better _
and similarly stunted _ story from last year, in which Greene was
involved with the fragile Cynthia Hooper. This season has also seen
the ill-advised downplaying of Jeannie, the silly coincidence that
has John Carter living in Kerry Weaver's basement, and a
consistently predictable relationship between Carter and student
Lucy Knight. Also, the fraught affair between Peter Benton and
Elizabeth Corday never really came to a head before it ended; it
petered out. There's only so much irresolution that we can chalk up
to the slick verite style of ``ER,'' before it starts to undermine
the show's life.
</P>
<P>
   The recent problems that have befallen Doug Ross, interesting as
they are, also have an inorganic feel to them. For one thing, Ross
hasn't been much of a loose cannon lately, as a result of his
emotional growth in the last two seasons. For him to steal trial
medication, ignore the punishment that forbade him to prescribe
narcotics, take a drug machine from Carol's clinic, and then show
the sick boy's mother how to give a lethal dose of dilaudid on the
machine _ it all seems very Season Three. Also, since Ross has
survived so very many of these mishaps, why is this one suddenly
exploding in his face? So far, Ross's final exit feels a little out
of character and sudden, even though Clooney announced his
intention to leave ``ER'' last March. And, unless there's a
surprise twist in Thursday night's's episode, last week's car-crash
cliffhanger seems rather gratuitous and manipulative.
</P>
<P>
   OK, no show is perfect. Even when it gets sloppy, ``ER'' is
superior drama, with an ensemble of strong actors and filming
techniques that are consistently amazing. Once Clooney is gone,
there are a number of well-drawn characters who could stand some
new emphasis. That's partly why NBC is downplaying Clooney's
departure: It doesn't want the show to look like damaged goods when
it still has so much promise. Let's hope that, just as the
declining ``NYPD Blue'' has made something positive from Jimmy
Smits's absence, ``ER'' turns Thursday night's's sad farewell into
a happy opportunity.

THE MARQUIS DE SADE REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Marquis de Sade, seriously. That's what's happening. In book
publishing's continuing fascination with literary biography, there
is yet again a revival of interest in the debauchee Sade and an
attempt to redefine his place in literature. Mostly it upgrades
him, from semihuman deviant and pornographer to satirist and almost
insouciant modernist, which is a dazzling bound in his reputation.
But there are naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this current interest in Sade is because we are not only
at the end of a dark century of wars and worse but also at the end
of the century of the exploration of the unconscious in which the
dank bottom was plumbed. ``He explored the bottom line of human
nature, the worst imaginable; he is modern because any writer who
explores the depths of human nature is modern,'' says Neil
Schaeffer, a professor of English literature at Brooklyn College
and the author of a new biography. Whatever the reason, this
fascination with Sade seems real. Schaeffer's book, ``The Marquis
de Sade: A Life'' (Alfred A. Knopf), will be published in April,
and Arcade Publishing will shortly issue ``Letters From Prison,''
letters written by Sade and translated chiefly by Richard Seaver,
the house's president.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Simon &AMP; Schuster published Francine du Plessix
Gray's ``At Home With the Marquis de Sade: A Life,'' which found
value in Sade's work, and the University of Chicago Press brought
out Laurence L. Bongie's ``Sade: A Biographical Essay,'' which
didn't. Neither was a big seller, but both were much discussed by
academics. Schaeffer's book will have a modest first printing of
about 15,000 copies. Sade's own writings are available in
bookstores but don't exactly jump off the shelves, although a 1965
Grove Press edition has sold more than 330,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   The case now being made by some for Sade in the United States _
it had been made in France earlier _ is literary. That is, he is an
important writer. This despite the fact that Sade didn't write very
well _ his prose often hammers the reader with numbing repetition _
and the stuff of his work was sodomy, murder, torture, incest,
self-indulgence of the wildest sort and other infamies. All well
beyond the feeble scribblings found in most pornography shops. And
not usually the subjects of intellectual huzzahs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray, whose book exposed both good and bad qualities in the
marquis, said in an interview: ``This man has a few things to teach
us. His work is bracing. You can be shocked, but it's beyond the
pale of sexual imagination. It's profoundly anti-erotic. I don't
think Sade ever encouraged anyone to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had manic energy, which is not unlike Jackson Pollock, and
the raw animal release of energy _ Titian, Beethoven _ is very much
at the center of the greatest art. That doesn't mean it necessarily
creates great art or did in his case; he taught me the importance
of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sade's work has all the thumping sensuality of a nudist
beach, to Ms. Gray ``his philosophy of the bedroom is hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's satire,'' she continued, ``a parody of erotic novels, a
grisly fascinating parody of many things that have been around
Western culture for centuries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schaeffer, too, finds satire in Sade. ``He has Norman Mailer's
best attack style, so excessive and extreme, and Mailer is the best
satirist since Twain,'' he said. ``Sade adopts positions in the
extreme. He intends to shock, but there was a gentle and idealistic
side to him. You see where you stand when you read Sade. He puts
the bottom to literature, the worst that could be written, the
worst that could be imagined. It's good to know the enemy; knowing
the bottom line of human nature is a very good sign of health at
the end of this violent century.'' Schaeffer's editor, George
Andreou, said that ``what's modern about him was his ability to
recreate himself, kind of Madonna-like.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Darnton, a Princeton history professor, says: ``The de
Sade industry is growing because people are less uptight about
their sexuality. There's an explosion of gay studies; women's
studies talk about the body and sexuality. Sade fits in; he's very
modern, no longer avant-garde, has lost his punch so to speak; he's
no longer in the `Hell' section of the libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is caught up with the marquis' satirical powers and
is willing to allow the marquis to make the leap from the
disgusting to the literary. Bongie does not buy the idea that one
can separate Sade's writing and his personal life and, therefore,
he has little use for the libertine. Roger Shattuck, in The New
York Times Book Review in March 1996, wrote that the revival was
``the model case of how we have blurred the distinction between
literature and pornography.'' He called Sade ``a vicious
evangelist,'' and added that ``some literary revivals defile us
more than they enlighten us.'' Do we want our grandchildren to read
Sade along with Austen, Dickens, Tolstoy and Cather, he asked.
</P>
<P>
   All this is the stuff of academic back and forth, but why this
interest to major publishers when the Sade industry has made so
little money? Four important Sade books within such a short time?
It's baffling, and it's a question that cannot be answered
logically. There's the convergence of several strands of wistful
thinking: the faint buzz from the academics, then a writer of Ms.
Gray's power leaped in. Clearly, a Sade moment was upon us. It
doesn't take much more than that to bring publishers to the gaming
table.
</P>
<P>
   Sade wrote to his wife from prison: ```The Iliad' bears but a
single reading. The `Italian Anecdotes' do not even bear that; they
are books that have a value for their chronology, works you keep on
your table to refer to but would never read any more than you would
a dictionary.'' Alas, certainly the books by the marquis and
perhaps those about him, too, are mostly destined to be picked from
the table on occasion and skimmed.

THOMAS A. MCMAHON, 55; INVENTED `TUNED' RUNNING TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held Friday for Thomas A. McMahon, a
biology professor at Harvard University who invented the ``tuned''
running track, explained how the South American ``Jesus Christ
Lizard'' appears to walk on water, and shared his enthusiasm for
science in several well-received novels.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McMahon died Sunday in his home in Wellesley, Mass., where
he was recovering from surgery. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   An authority on the physics of animal locomotion, Mr. McMahon
and his colleague Peter R. Greene designed the ``tuned'' running
track at Harvard's Gordon Indoor Track and Tennis facility that has
improved running times by about 3 percent while cutting injuries in
half.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually soft and springy ``tuned tracks'' were also
installed at Yale University, the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey,
and Madison Square Garden in New York City. When the Madison Square
Garden track was first used, 12 events were held and 11 resulted in
record times.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Mr. McMahon and graduate student James Glasheen
gained wide notice for experiments demonstrating how the basilisk
lizard, a Central and South American creature sometimes known as
the ``Jesus Christ Lizard,'' scampers across rivers fast enough to
``walk on water.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1987 novel ``Loving Little Egypt,'' about a nearly blind
genius who tapped long-distance phone lines to create an
underground network through which the blind could communicate, was
hailed by Globe reviewer Robert Taylor as a ``technological fable
crackling with the elation, nostalgia and suspense of scientific
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The book won the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Rosenthal
Award. Mr. McMahon was also the author of the ``Principles of
American Nuclear Chemistry: A Novel'' and ``McKay's Bees.''
</P>
<P>
   In a profile published in The Boston Globe on April 19, 1987, he
explained why he used scientists as his protagonists in his novels.
``I think that there are stories in the lives of scientists just as
there are everywhere. Relationships among people are the substance
of fiction and really nothing else. Most of the time you get
stories about police, undergraduates and English professors.
Science has stories at least as good as those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn on lights, use telephones and other inventions
every day,'' he said in a story published in the Harvard Gazette on
Oct. 11, 1993. ``But they know little about the inventors or the
circumstances that gave birth to these conveniences. I enjoy
weaving such elements into fictional stories that inform people and
divert them from their everyday cares.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Dayton, Ohio, and raised in Lexington. He
graduated from Cornell University and earned a master's degree and
doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Carol (Ehlers); a son, James R. of Atlanta;
a daughter, Elizabeth Kirsten McMahon; two sisters, Jean Humez of
Somerville and Nancy McMahon Swanborn of Duxbury; and a
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. at Story Chapel at
Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Mass.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than most of Martha Graham's works, ``Dark
Meadow'' is one of those dances meant to be sensed rather than
understood.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a line from former Sen. Dale Bumpers, ``It's about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But sex is always part of the grander scheme of things in
Graham. The nameless heroine in search of a sexual awakening amid
Isamu Noguchi's overtly phallic sculptures at the Joyce Theater
this week will also be in quest of rebirth and life's mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1946 to a commissioned score by Carlos Chavez and
revived on Tuesday night by the Martha Graham Dance Company, ``Dark
Meadow'' is a great but difficult work. It contains some of
Graham's most beautiful ensemble choreography, for a chorus of
archaic lovers who amplify the heroine's own search.
</P>
<P>
   Terese Capucilli as the archetypal female offered a wonderful
lyrical performance in a delicate role that makes her look
deceptively passive. ``Dark Meadow'' itself is a delicate work. It
would be easy to reduce the action to boy meets girl with a
matchmaker involved. But Graham, a student of Jung rather than
Freud, gives us something else: her own version of Jung's
collective unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter between the woman and the embodiment of a male
principle, hurried along by an earth mother priestess, is
meaningful to us precisely because Graham is dealing in archetypes.
One might even say that the sexual symbolism, in decor and images,
might look too obvious. But if the worship of the lingam, the
phallic symbol derived from the adoration of the Hindu god Siva, is
clear, the specific details on view would require a scholarly
treatise.
</P>
<P>
   These specifics are as usual open to interpretation. The title
comes from Empedocles: the dark meadow of Ate is where the soul
fell from the region of light.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that she was not depicting a ritual, but the success
of ``Dark Meadow'' lies in its ritualistic cast. As Noguchi's three
green branches sprout out of a tall knifelike form in the rear, the
action resolves into a ceremony of rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to reread your Greeks and your Jung to see that
something happens onstage each time that Katherine Crockett, in a
tight brown sheath with a crown of leaves, passes by. As She of the
Ground, she is deliberately limited in her movement by her costume.
Statuesque, treelike, angular and serene even in the strange
squatting walk she is given at one point, Ms. Crockett is striking
as the earth mother catalyst.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Capucilli is One Who Seeks, and she is initially surrounded
by five women in sarongs and bare midriffs. Their stamping evokes
the aim of all fertility rituals: to make the crops grow.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Capucilli's natural dynamic is toward the angular. But
Graham's choreography here is not percussive, and there is an
impressive flow to Ms. Capucilli's movement. Martin Lofsnes, as He
Who Summons, is the initiator. Graham's interest in ancestral
memory is suggested in her primeval imagery. Lofsnes' costume, with
its pleated tails, implies that he is still a human in evolution,
and the black cloth Ms. Capucilli manipulates may look awkward but
it also suggests a cave of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Lofsnes, in his best performance to date, has a breathtaking
dynamic power in a role that has more flexed feet and archaic
profiles than complexity. Together, he and Ms. Capucilli brought
their final duet to a full boil of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is not strictly one of her ``Greek'' pieces,
Graham makes use of a chorus that amplifies the action. The imagery
is tender for the lovers and full of sculptural embraces. Yet it is
also resonant of the abduction scenes of antiquity. You will get
the point when Ms. Crockett, in a green cape, embraces a yellow
phallic form and flowers bloom. But you will also have the same
sense of fulfillment when the couples embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Admirably precise in their alignment, these dancers included
Elizabeth Auclair, Theresa Da Silva, Jennifer DePalo, Sandra
Kaufmann, Virginie Mecene, Alessandra Prosperi, Ariel Bonilla,
Tadej Brdnik, Daniel Cardoso, Gary Galbraith and Christophe
Jeannot.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual initiation was treated with more extreme metaphors on the
same program in ``Errand into the Maze.'' Miki Orihara made a fine
role debut as the Theseus-Ariadne figure. She looked dazed rather
than tormented, offering a less powerful image than others but also
less convulsive and all the more persuasive. Galbraith's bull
figure, stronger than ever, had a new dramatic edge.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning its final week of the season at the Joyce, the Graham
company was in top form. Joyce Herring brought to the figure of the
Virgin in ``Primitive Mysteries'' power and concentration that made
a difference. She has a human warmth and earthy grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by ``Acts of Light,'' in which Peter
Roel and Ms. Auclair did not shy away from the eroticism of the
first section.

THOMAS A. MCMAHON, 55; INVENTED `TUNED' RUNNING TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held Friday for Thomas A. McMahon, a
biology professor at Harvard University who invented the ``tuned''
running track, explained how the South American ``Jesus Christ
Lizard'' appears to walk on water, and shared his enthusiasm for
science in several well-received novels.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McMahon died Sunday in his home in Wellesley, Mass., where
he was recovering from surgery. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   An authority on the physics of animal locomotion, Mr. McMahon
and his colleague Peter R. Greene designed the ``tuned'' running
track at Harvard's Gordon Indoor Track and Tennis facility that has
improved running times by about 3 percent while cutting injuries in
half.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually soft and springy ``tuned tracks'' were also
installed at Yale University, the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey,
and Madison Square Garden in New York City. When the Madison Square
Garden track was first used, 12 events were held and 11 resulted in
record times.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Mr. McMahon and graduate student James Glasheen
gained wide notice for experiments demonstrating how the basilisk
lizard, a Central and South American creature sometimes known as
the ``Jesus Christ Lizard,'' scampers across rivers fast enough to
``walk on water.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1987 novel ``Loving Little Egypt,'' about a nearly blind
genius who tapped long-distance phone lines to create an
underground network through which the blind could communicate, was
hailed by Globe reviewer Robert Taylor as a ``technological fable
crackling with the elation, nostalgia and suspense of scientific
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The book won the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Rosenthal
Award. Mr. McMahon was also the author of the ``Principles of
American Nuclear Chemistry: A Novel'' and ``McKay's Bees.''
</P>
<P>
   In a profile published in The Boston Globe on April 19, 1987, he
explained why he used scientists as his protagonists in his novels.
``I think that there are stories in the lives of scientists just as
there are everywhere. Relationships among people are the substance
of fiction and really nothing else. Most of the time you get
stories about police, undergraduates and English professors.
Science has stories at least as good as those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn on lights, use telephones and other inventions
every day,'' he said in a story published in the Harvard Gazette on
Oct. 11, 1993. ``But they know little about the inventors or the
circumstances that gave birth to these conveniences. I enjoy
weaving such elements into fictional stories that inform people and
divert them from their everyday cares.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Dayton, Ohio, and raised in Lexington. He
graduated from Cornell University and earned a master's degree and
doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Carol (Ehlers); a son, James R. of Atlanta;
a daughter, Elizabeth Kirsten McMahon; two sisters, Jean Humez of
Somerville and Nancy McMahon Swanborn of Duxbury; and a
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. at Story Chapel at
Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Mass.

   Pigs to the left, pigs to the right, pigs all around him,
Charles Burrus stood in the cacophonous center of his barn,
gesturing at the indignant squealers. He felt like squealing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we're going to do in the next three
months,'' said Burrus, oblivious to the stench of the 7,000 animals
around him. ``We're losing $10,000 to $15,000 a semi load.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrus, a 65-year-old whose gray hair peeks through his farm
cap, has seen some tough times in a life of hog farming, including
a fire that ripped through his barns in 1978 and roasted 1,200 pigs
alive. But nothing, he said, has ever been nearly so devastating as
today's prices. These days he is bleeding money so badly that he
worries about losing his 600-acre farm here among the cornfields
near Cantrall, Ill., 130 miles southwest of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've never seen in the livestock
business,'' Burrus said dolefully. ``We've never seen this heavy a
loss in the pork industry, not even in the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems on the Burrus farm, a sprawling collection of 14
hog buildings with temperature controls and automatic curtains on
the windows, underscore how the economic crisis that began 19
months ago in Thailand is knocking on the gates of the American
heartland. The only real chance of a rescue for Burrus would come
through an economic revival on the other side of the globe, in
Asia, where his hogs usually end up between chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the United States as a whole has been remarkably
impervious to the crisis, and much of American industry has
benefited from the cheaper oil and imports resulting from the
downturn elsewhere. Still, it is not clear whether the United
States can remain unaffected, and the crisis presents the country _
and the rest of the world _ with far-reaching political and
economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cuban missile standoff was a quintessential Cold War
crisis, then today's global economic upheaval may be a landmark
crisis of the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest challenge is for the United States to sustain its
strong growth rates. But the broader task will be to prevent
nationalistic cataclysms in the worst-off countries, like Russia
and Indonesia, and to contain the political and security risks of
explosive frustration if the crisis bites further into places like
China and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy has demonstrated tremendous flexibility and
resilience, but uncertainties arise because the American stock
market is 64 percent higher than it was on Dec. 5, 1996, when Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned about ``irrational
exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Brazilian crisis _ marking the failure of the
November bailout _ underscores that the storm has not necessarily
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent Brazil's problem is a reflection of slowing
economic activity,'' said Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist
who now runs his own consulting company. ``We have to consider
whether there is more to come. Developing countries are still
coming to grips with a slowdown in the global economy. If the
economic revival in Europe is subdued and the American economy
slows down, that is bound to put some pressure on other parts of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from Washington during these upheavals strikes some
foreigners as hypocritical. When Thailand and Brazil were hit, the
Clinton administration's message was firm: Raise interest rates,
cut government spending, put up with a recession if necessary,
allow banks to fail, be stoical.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in September when the crisis seemed as if it might strike
the United States, the administration had a change of heart.
President Clinton went into overdrive in September, welcoming three
interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, pressing Europe and
others to cut rates as well, and finally getting money out of
Congress for the International Monetary Fund. The Federal Reserve
even coordinated the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, a
hedge fund backed by wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cuts were precisely the opposite of the prescription
that the United States had handed out to everyone else. And these
days, there is a lurking fear in Washington that these
countermeasures may have worked too well _creating a false sense of
security.
</P>
<P>
   At Treasury and the Federal Reserve, officials were concerned to
see that their actions seemed to have moved millions of investors
from an excess of fear to a new spasm of exuberance, sending the
market to a new high. Officials say they worry that the eventual
fall, if there is one, may be that much farther.
</P>
<P>
   For all the condemnation of cronyism and mismanagement abroad,
there are signs in America and Europe of some of the
vulnerabilities that brought down Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis abroad was partly a consequence of success: Soaring
growth rates led to excess confidence, excess borrowing, excess
investment and excess capacity. Not everyone agrees, but some
economists see similar patterns in corporate giants like U.S. Steel
and even on farms like the one Burrus runs.
</P>
<P>
   When pig prices were 80 cents a pound of live weight, Burrus
borrowed from the banks to build new barns. In fact, he just
completed his latest barn a few months ago. But the high prices
were also driving every other hog farmer in the world to increase
production as well, and in hindsight it was a pig bubble that
popped.
</P>
<P>
   So now Burrus is getting 17 cents a pound for his pigs, even
though his costs are running 38 cents a pound. Bankers in Cantrall
are nervously eyeing hog farms the way bankers in Rio de Janeiro
are anxiously examining coffee plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of hours' drive from Burrus' farm is steel
country, the huge chimneys and fiery vats of molten steel that
represent the traditional sinews of American industry. These days
steel companies are crying foul and laying off workers, saying they
are facing a deluge of imports from Japan, Russia, Indonesia and
other countries. These nations worry about a new round of
protectionism, and on Friday the United States announced dumping
penalties against Japan and Brazil for selling goods in the United
States below cost.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, however, the steel companies' problem
reflects the pattern of excess capacity that one sees in hogs, cars
or Indonesian rickshaws. During the boom years, steel companies all
over the world invested huge sums in production, in anticipation of
the Asian market _ which then shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   So far U.S. Steel and Burrus are both exceptions, and the
American economy is still growing strongly. Yet apprehensions arise
because the global economy is a three-engine jet, with one engine
dead (Japan's) and another losing speed (Europe's). It all comes
down to how much fuel is left for the final, American engine. The
gauges are broken, the pilots are arguing and the journey has
already set a distance record _ the United States' longest
peacetime expansion, now almost eight years.

<P>
   SLENDER GAINS FOR SALAMET
</P>
<P>
   In the remote Indonesian town of Mojokerto, Salamet is in
mourning. Salamet, a rickshaw driver, was outside trying to get
rides one afternoon recently when his mother finally died in her
sleep on the floor of his little house.
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief, for she had groaned piteously from the pain of
breast cancer, and he had been unable to afford painkillers. Yet
Salamet now found himself faced with another bill he could not pay:
the $28 for the coffin and burial.
</P>
<P>
   In the end neighbors stepped in to lend him the money. But
custom dictates that a bereaved son not leave the neighborhood for
40 days. This made it more difficult than ever to find the rickshaw
rides that would buy food for his three hungry children and pay the
fees to keep his eldest son, Dwi, in the second grade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to keep it all in perspective, Salamet is in the worst-off
group _ the urban poor _ in the worst-off country of all,
Indonesia, and even he is managing to get by.
</P>
<P>
   In Salamet's neighborhood, no one thinks that the quality of
life has retreated even to the level of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how much the depression had pushed his life
backward, Salamet (who like many Indonesians uses only one name)
described the positive changes over the last decade, and emphasized
that these have been enduring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change was electricity, which came about six years
ago,'' he reflected. ``It cheers us all up, and at night there's
light. And then there's also television now as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second-biggest change is that the roads here got paved. It
used to be that in the rainy season, everything got so muddy you
couldn't go anywhere. But now we can get around in all seasons, and
I can drive the rickshaw and earn a living even after it's
rained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The third change is the toilets,'' he concluded. ``They were
built four years ago. Until then everybody just used the river, but
that was a problem at night. It was far away, and there were snakes
that used to bite people.''
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of gains are still fragile, particularly in places
like Indonesia, China and Russia, where there are serious risks of
political instability. But for now at least, they have not come
close to being undone.
</P>
<P>
   COULD ASIA'S WORST BE OVER?
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the striking thing about the economic news from
Asia these days is that so much of it is good. A year and a half
after the Asian crisis began, countries like Thailand and South
Korea are showing signs of bottoming out. Asia's currencies have
recovered sharply, with the Indonesian rupiah now standing at about
9,000 to the dollar, compared with 16,650 in June (or 2,500 before
the crisis).
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have fallen as well, and this has bolstered the
stock markets. They remain far, far below their pre-crisis levels,
but Asian stock markets were some of the best performing in the
world last year. South Korea's rose 121 percent in dollar terms in
1998, and Thailand's was up 34 percent _ both from abysmal lows.
</P>
<P>
   If countries like South Korea and Thailand really restructure
their economies in fundamental ways _ which so far has not
happened, despite a lot of promising talk _ then it is possible
that they will emerge that much stronger from the crisis, with
better banking systems, more open economies, stronger legal systems
and more democratic political structures. President Kim Dae-jung of
South Korea argues that the crisis will be remembered as a
blessing, because it is forcing essential economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that having to restructure our economy under the
agreement of the IMF is ultimately a big help for our economy,''
Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the recovery is slow or rapid, the emerging markets
eventually are expected to regain their pulse. Although they make
up just 7 percent of the global value of stocks around the world,
emerging markets account for 70 percent of the world's land, 85
percent of the world's population, and 99 percent of the
anticipated growth in the world's labor force.

   THE SANDWICH MAN
</P>
<P>
   Sirivat Voravetvuthikun offers a hopeful image of Asia's future,
one in which Asians manage to rebuild their lives in new ways and
thus achieve greater prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Sirivat, 50, a Chinese Thai businessman who went to high school
and college in Texas, was a successful investment manager and
property developer in Bangkok. With his brother, he built 28 lavish
homes in the middle of a vast golf resort, with no luxury spared,
from the swimming pools to the landscaping beneath mango trees and
coconut palms.
</P>
<P>
   The development cost $12 million, $10 million of it borrowed
from banks and much of the rest from Sirivat's savings. It is in a
lovely spot, nestled among the hills 115 miles northeast of
Bangkok, but just as it was being completed the property market
collapsed. Now the homes are empty and the main pool is green with
algae.
</P>
<P>
   The homes did not sell, and interest costs soared. Banks pressed
him for payment, and Sirivat could not meet the payroll for his
staff. He and his brother began quarreling.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Sirivat, like thousands of other businessmen
around Asia, decided to start again. Drawing on his years in the
United States, he decided to become a sandwich peddler. Sandwiches
are not a customary food in Thailand, so Sirivat decided it would
be a good market niche in a country whose young people are
increasingly experimental about foreign foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife started by making 20 sandwiches,'' Sirivat remembered.
``I told my staff we had to sell them on the street. I remembered
people in the states selling popcorn, carrying bags of it, and I
thought, we'll try this. It's illegal to have pushcarts or to set
up a table on the sidewalk, but I thought it would be OK if we just
carried the sandwiches in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirivat's business _ now known as Sirivat Sandwiches _ is
thriving, and he is turning a nice profit on it. The first 20
sandwiches took six hours to sell, but now daily sales have reached
550 sandwiches. Sirivat has rented another building in Bangkok to
make sandwiches and to experiment with new varieties. He aims to
emerge as the sandwich king of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be big,'' he boasted, adding that he was
trying to build a strong brand name and ultimately hoped to list
Sirivat Sandwiches on the Thai stock exchange.

<P>
   Rocky Roads, Resentments
</P>
<P>
   In assaying what comes next, some of the most fundamental
concerns are not economic but social and political.
</P>
<P>
   A growing backlash is evident against Western capitalism, and
especially against the Americans who exemplify it. This is most
apparent in countries like Russia, which has already defaulted on
its debts, but it is found even in Japan, where politicians heap
abuse on what they call Anglo-Saxon capitalism, deriding its
ferocity and lack of civility.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebellion against the American-led drive for free markets,
the finance ministers of the second- and third-largest industrial
countries, Japan and Germany, have both spoken about the need for
tighter controls on currency movements. And late last year, a
three-year-old international effort to achieve a Multilateral
Agreement on Investments _ which would have promoted globalization
and cross-border investments _ collapsed after France, applauded by
Australia and Canada, backed out of the talks. They all worried
about surrendering power to foreign companies and open markets.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, once a darling of international investors, went the
furthest in thumbing its nose at the markets. Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has denounced Jews and the West for conspiring
against him, and has warned that people in the developing world
will stage ``a kind of guerrilla war'' against Western corporations
that buy overseas companies at depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the West, Malaysia adopted capital
controls on Sept. 1. The controls, which are now being relaxed to
lure foreign investors back, seemed to help: The currency was
stable, the stock market more than doubled and foreign exchange
reserves rose sharply. Moreover, with interest rates of just 7
percent (compared with 38 percent in Indonesia), Malaysia is
expected to eke out a bit of economic growth this year _ even as a
continued dip is anticipated in Indonesia. Western officials worry
that other countries may adopt Malaysia's methods.
</P>
<P>
   Less dramatic capital controls, like Chile's system to encourage
long-term inflows rather than short-term ones, now are also widely
praised. Chile dismantled them late last year _ because at the
moment there is no problem with excess capital inflows _ but those
controls may become a model for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest worries in the West is about the future of
Russia. The stock market there plunged 84 percent last year in
dollar terms. President Boris Yeltsin, once seen as Clinton's ally
and the man who would tug Russia toward the West, has now faded
into the backdrop along with reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Sysuyev, a top aide to Yeltsin, sat in his immense office
in the old Central Committee Headquarters one day recently and said
that reforms very likely were dead for the next five years in
Russia. He added that unless the monetary fund gave in and offered
Russia major support, there were only two scenarios for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Sysuyev said as he chain-smoked Marlboro Lights, is
ruthless budget-cutting, which might lead voters to choose
old-style, totalitarian candidates in the parliamentary elections
in 1999 and the presidential elections in 2000. The second, he went
on, is hyperinflation. ``This scenario _ not as fast _ may lead to
the same consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AVOIDS THE CRUNCH
</P>
<P>
   As for China, it has evaded the crisis, and what saved it from
catastrophe may in part have been its unwillingness to listen to
Western economists. Urged to make its currency freely tradable with
the dollar, it resisted. If the Chinese yuan had been convertible,
then Chinese would have sent their money fleeing as Thais and
Indonesians did, and China might also be mired in a major financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   China claims economic growth last year of almost 8 percent _ a
tribute to the government's $1.2 trillion stimulus plan and
probably to the audacity of the statisticians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one troublesome parallel with the hardest-hit countries of
Asia is found in a vast hole in the ground in the Pudong district
of Shanghai. The hole, swarming with construction workers, is
scheduled to become the Shanghai World Financial Center, the
tallest building in the world. At 1,509 feet tall, it will be 27
feet taller than the Petronas Towers of Malaysia, which in 1997
surpassed the Sears Tower to become the tallest.
</P>
<P>
   Someday it may pay off. But for now it is scheduled to cost $625
million and provide 3.6 million square feet of floor space (twice
as much as the Empire State Building) just as the Pudong business
district finds itself with dozens of new buildings and an overall
occupancy rate of only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This real estate bubble is linked to Japan, for the World
Financial Center is backed in part by Japanese banks and is the
brainchild of Minoru Mori, chief executive of Mori Building Co.
Mori is a visionary in Japanese business circles, a man who reveres
the French architect and planner Le Corbusier and who also aspires
not just to put up roofs but to shape society.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is unabashed. He argues that while Shanghai property may
look like it is heading for a bust, in the long run there will be
another boom as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the abacus will show a profit for us,'' he said, but
he acknowledged that completion of the World Financial Center might
now be delayed a couple of years after the original target date of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of his boardroom, on the 37th floor of his Ark-Mori
building in Tokyo, is a painting from Mori's outstanding collection
of Le Corbusiers, bearing a large inscription by the artist: ``Je
revais,'' or ``I was dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The real estate glut in China is at the heart of a banking mess
perhaps more serious than anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese banks have lent heavily to construct buildings that are
now largely vacant and worth little. Three of the four major banks
are effectively insolvent by a huge margin, even though these are
boom times.
</P>
<P>
   So long as depositors keep their money in the accounts, the
banks can keep functioning indefinitely. But the moment depositors
start asking for their money back, the banking system in China will
face the possibility of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   China's bad bank debts are staggeringly large, totaling about 40
percent of gross national product, compared with 3 percent in the
United States during the savings and loan crisis. Nonperforming
loans (those that are not being paid back) are about 25 percent of
the total at the big banks, significantly higher than in other
countries when they were hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, there seems little prospect that China will face
an international currency crisis of the kind that hit Thailand and
Indonesia. Beijing has $145 billion in foreign exchange reserves,
exceeding the country's entire $131 billion foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the risks of political upheaval in China coming from
two directions, both economic.
</P>
<P>
   One danger for the government is a banking crisis, driving
furious depositors to the streets to demand their money back.
</P>
<P>
   The second risk comes from workers who lose their jobs at
state-owned companies. The Communist Party has reiterated its plans
to close down money-losing companies, but those workers may
represent the sternest challenge to the Communist Party since the
democracy movement in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, 11.5 million people are unemployed in China, but
that figure is not very meaningful because it excludes people who
have been laid off as well as rural workers and peasant migrants to
the cities. Estimates of total unemployment range up to 260
million, which is also not very meaningful, because many of these
people manage to get odd jobs or make money on their land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one doubts that there are tens of millions of Chinese
workers and peasants who are unemployed or underemployed and who
are a potentially dangerous element in the social mix. Outside the
southern city of Changsha, near where Mao grew up, thousands of
people clashed with police early in January, and one man was killed
when he was hit with an exploding tear-gas canister and bled to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, some 500 laid-off workers from a defunct wire-cable
factory marched through Changsha and were joined by several
thousand sympathetic onlookers who brought traffic in the downtown
area to a standstill for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Weilin, 45, one of the onlookers, acknowledged that these
protests might not lead anywhere, for workers are very careful not
to push too far or to come across as protest leaders, for that
might mean arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the frustrations were evident in the placards that
workers carried, declaring, ``We have no food,'' and ``We don't
want fish or meat, just a bowl of rice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' Wang said, ``have nothing to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   PANIC SPAWNS THE NINJA
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia offers frightening images of how economic distress can
tear a society apart. Optimists sometimes used to say there was a
possibility that China could turn out as well as Indonesia, but now
Indonesia seems less a model than a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian Muslims have been burning down churches, and
Christians have been attacking mosques. In the capital, Muslim mobs
have chased down and hacked Christian men to death as police
officers and soldiers stood by. And when there is no other target
around, rioters attack ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Java region of Indonesia's main island, mysterious
groups of men dressed in black have been killing Muslim religious
leaders, chopping up the bodies and throwing the pieces into
mosques. This has created a panic, leading to a witch hunt _
literally _ for the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Called ninja by local people, these killers are believed to be
sorcerers, and panicked mobs sometimes beat to death those whom
they think might be ninja. More than 200 people have been killed so
far, either by real ninja or by mobs looking for ninja, and crowds
have sometimes paraded the heads of their victims on pikes.
</P>
<P>
   Such brutality seems particularly incongruous because Java was
civilized before England and has an ancient culture emphasizing
harmony and restraint. The killings and mutilations have been a
gruesome reminder of how rapidly economic crises can cause
societies to mutate in horrific ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Mojokerto, even Salamet, the rickshaw driver, has joined a
posse to guard against ninja. He goes out each evening with a group
of men, armed with clubs and sickles. Salamet is the most
reasonable of the group, but some of the men spend their days
sharpening their sickles and talking proudly of hacking to death
any intruders they find.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from Salamet, a Muslim activist named Ahmed Banu
claims to have beaten two ninja to death, and he shows off a pair
of boots that he says belonged to one of the dead men. In fact, the
entire episode seems to have been fictional, but Banu is a
charismatic man with a growing following.
</P>
<P>
   After prayers on a recent evening, he held an open meeting of
local Muslims to deal with the supposed ninja menace. Salamet
stayed away, but 24 men attended, listening intently as Banu warned
passionately that the ninja were ready to destroy the neighborhood
and vanquish all Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we Muslims are being treated like animals,'' he said, his
voice rising, ``will we stand for it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' his followers yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catch the ninja, what should we do? Give them to the
police or kill them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kill them!''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   WHITE HOUSE BRAINSTORMS
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day last year, as financial markets worldwide were
tumbling in the aftermath of Russia's financial turmoil, an
impatient and annoyed Bill Clinton summoned his top advisers to the
Yellow Oval Room on the third floor of the White House. Clinton, in
cowboy boots, settled in his favorite chair by the fireplace, and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sat directly opposite, as he likes
to do, so that he could look the president in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted to attack the crisis more directly and
more openly. He also wanted his administration to lead the way in
remaking the global financial system, so as to reduce the risk of
another crisis down the road. He had been speaking on the telephone
with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and they had agreed that
world leaders should step out and convey a sense of urgency about
altering the international economic order _ and so he was
frustrated with Rubin's caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was leaning on Treasury for some action,'' recalled
one participant. ``He was leaning hard. And of course the Treasury
wanted to be cautious. It was telling the political types in the
White House that this is sensitive stuff _ you say one wrong thing
and you can mess things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem is that today's Bretton Woods economic
structure _ based on fixed exchange rates and the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund _ is widely regarded as outdated and
insufficient to steady today's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to establish a new system for the 21st century,'' said
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister of finance. ``You could
call it a new Bretton Woods. It's difficult, but it's got to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   But what precisely is to be done?
</P>
<P>
   While almost everyone agrees that the present system is
inadequate, there is no consensus on what would be better. Ideas
range from radical proposals for a global central bank and
semifixed exchange rates among major currencies to more modest
suggestions for tougher bank standards and curbs on hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland,
recently, some European officials urged the creation of an ``early
warning system,'' roughly equivalent to a weather satellite
alerting the world to approaching economic tornadoes. But the
technology simply does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue for an ``exit tax,'' which would require investors
to pay a fee for removing their money from a country quickly _ an
experiment that Malaysia is now trying. But Rubin fears the tax
could scare off investors.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton's enthusiasm for doing something seems to have
ebbed as the sense of crisis faded, there seems little chance that
the present debate will lead to any major changes soon in the
international economic system.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that for all the tragedies now unfolding in places
like Indonesia, supporters of the current economic system say that
overall, it has done an excellent job of promoting economic growth.
By some economic measures, Indonesians are better off materially
today, in the bust stage of their boom-bust cycle, than if they had
bought stability at the price of sacrificing growth in the boom
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All countries have benefited from the free market system,''
said Jurgen Stark, vice president of the Bundesbank, Germany's
central bank. ``I am a little worried about all the talk about a
`new financial architecture.' What's new? What would it
accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that although the metaphor is always ``new
financial architecture,'' the proposals for the financial system
are usually fairly small-bore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think architecture is a bad word,'' said John Heimann, who
recently stepped down as chairman of Merrill Lynch Global Capital
Markets to head a new bank-supervisor training institute. ``What
you need is more attention to the plumbing and electricity. That's
not as dramatic, but it's the plumbing and electricity that make
the house work.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of these kinds of changes are under discussion. At the
global level, the 22 leading industrialized countries proposed 44
initiatives, ranging from an international accounting code to
better supervision of banks, insurance firms and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are trying to take dull but important steps to
reduce the risks of crises: improving their legal systems; creating
a modern bankruptcy structure; fighting corruption, and hiring bank
supervisors. But these steps often run into entrenched local
interests, and the progress is slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the lessons been tough enough so that people in
individual countries are moving to actually fix their financial
market infrastructure?'' asked William McDonough, president of the
New York Federal Reserve Bank and chairman of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision. ``Probably not. Should the effort be made?
Yes. Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a simple or common solution to these types of
problems? I don't think so.''

   THE DANGER OF HUBRIS
</P>
<P>
   So what are the lessons of Asia and Russia as they apply to the
American economy?
</P>
<P>
   There is not much agreement on that. The lessons on which a
consensus has emerged seem surprisingly obvious and modest for an
economic catastrophe that has destroyed so much wealth and
transformed the prospects of nations from Indonesia to Russia to
Brazil. Historians may eventually elicit more subtle conclusions,
but for now the lessons are almost embarrassingly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   One is the danger of hubris. The crisis arose in part because
emerging-market countries built up too confidently, because Western
investors and bankers were too optimistic in their assessments of
risk and because Western governments were too convinced that they
had the right solutions. Throughout the crisis, expert predictions
have invariably been wrong and even miracle economies have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A second lesson is the importance of prudence in the banking
system, the pillar of any modern economy. Financial institutions
have generally been better supervised in America than in many other
countries, but the near-failure of Long-Term Capital Management
underscored the risks even in the most sophisticated and
best-supervised market in the West.
</P>
<P>
   And a third lesson is the danger of stock and property manias.
Many Asians say glumly that they have learned the hard way the
importance of scrutinizing the foundations of any economy, however
dazzling it seems. And as they say that, they look _ jealously,
resentfully and nervously _ at the American economy and especially
at the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a dispute about whether that lesson applies to
the United States. America has far less corruption and cronyism
than Russia or Indonesia, and no one thinks that America has built
a bubble on the scale of Japan's in 1990, so some analysts argue
that any parallel with Asia is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not accept the comparison between Asia and the United
States,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment
policy committee at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. and so far one of the most
bullish and accurate of Wall Street strategists. Ms. Cohen
emphasized that while Asia's boom was fueled by cheap credit _
artificially low interest rates _ this has not been true of the
United States. In addition, she noted that American accounting and
banking standards are more rigorous than those abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian economy has been having difficulty recovering
because banks have large portfolios of underperforming loans,'' she
said. ``But here the level of bank regulation has been much higher.
Regulators are really paying attention, and shareholders are paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists and policy-makers in Asia, with a biting skepticism
that comes from seeing their own economies swell and pop, are often
contemptuous of the American explanations. They point to the
banking crisis in Texas in the late 1980s as an example of the
foolishness that even highly regulated banks can engage in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it objectively,'' said Sakakibara, ``the United
States now has a bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics like him say that the United States has followed the
Asian pattern of an upward spiral whereby higher stock prices lead
to rising investment and consumer spending, which leads to higher
stock prices and pushes the spiral even higher. Moreover, the
United States is financing its growth the Thai and Indonesian way _
by borrowing from abroad, although it has the advantage of being
able to borrow in its own currency.
</P>
<P>
   The American stock market has also soared to its highest ratio
of market capitalization to gross national product (140 percent)
ever recorded in history, a ratio that compares with a previous
peak of 81 percent in 1929. The American ratio is more than twice
as high as Indonesia's or Brazil's at the time their crises hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, one of the central problems in Asia and
Russia was that investors were so used to success that they did not
contemplate catastrophe. In the same way, the long bull market in
the West since 1982 means that most stock market investors cannot
conceive of how devastating a bear market can be, even if the
market turbulence in the fall did shake them up.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kindleberger, an economic historian and author of the
book ``Manias, Panics and Crashes,'' said he was ``troubled by the
volatility'' of the American stock market today. ``I've been
thinking for two or three years that the market was too high,'' he
added. ``When it collapsed in August, I thought it might be
becoming sensible again. But it turned out that the Fed reduced
interest rates three times, and the market returned to its previous
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindleberger also expressed concern over the parallel with Japan
in the late 1980s. In the face of a global slowdown, Japan cut
interest rates to stimulate its economy, and the result was even
more frenzied speculation, which eventually collapsed and proved
catastrophic to Japan and the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   So, looking at the financial crisis, John Kenneth Galbraith, the
nonagenarian Harvard economist, concludes that ``the overwhelming
lesson is to be aware of the history'' of speculative mania, and to
be ``further aware that the United States is also part of the
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculative mood,'' he added, ``can pervade Wall Street as
much as Tokyo or Malaysia.''

<P>
   EXPLAINING A CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   Economists and government officials have offered an abundance of
neat explanations for the crisis. Some attribute it to crony
capitalism and fundamental weaknesses in overseas countries. Others
point to the fickleness of international capital flows and the
entire global economic system. Still others say that the culprit
was the United States and the monetary fund, or alternatively the
venality and incompetence of governments in Russia, or Indonesia,
or other countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economists will dispute for years which factors leading to the
crisis were necessary, and which sufficient, and which tangential.
But the causes seem so many and so intertwined that it is difficult
to fit them together in any neat equation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for all the talk in recent months about grand
solutions to crises, there is a growing sense that no good answer
may be out there, and that one price of economic development has
perhaps been a loss of control over the markets that nurtured the
development.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prosperity in general has led to what seems an
unstoppable trend toward steadily greater oceans of capital
sloshing around the globe, and all that cash in turn creates new
instability. For all the post-Cold War sense of triumphalism, for
all of the high-speed computer networks that in an instant can
graph the trend in the yen-dollar rate, fundamentally the world's
economies come across as corks bobbing in the sea. And, unless the
U.S. economy was badly hit, it would be difficult to imagine world
leaders galvanized to devise a new approach to international
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key causes of this crisis may lie not in economic
ratios but human nature. In explaining the way that international
economic crises have rippled around the globe, historians have
often concluded that the most important factor was psychology. The
same may be true today.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and ``rocket scientists'' and first-rate research have
yet to overcome the instinctive tendency of markets to overshoot up
and down. The herds went from mania to panic in an instant, and
this process trampled Asia and Russia. It is also what some
economists worry about when they look at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old human emotions of fear and euphoria still prevail,''
said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former head of Clinton's Council of
Economic Advisers. Ms. Tyson said that Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, had once made the same point to her, noting that
if one looked at a graph of jumps and dips in stock prices, it
would be impossible to tell whether one was looking at the 1890s or
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis suggests that the old high-tech tools are still in
frail human hands.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, musing on the crisis, said: ``I wouldn't be as severe
on the regulators as on those being regulated. When you are dealing
with insanity, one looks first at the insane and then at those
supervising them.''
</P>
<P>
   BACK ON THE HOME FRONT
</P>
<P>
   In Cantrall, not far from Burrus' hog farm, Mary Jo Paoni is
planning to retire in April from her job as a secretary. Whatever
the uncertainties, and despite her pension fund's loss of $2.7
million on Indonesian stocks, it has still ridden the boom in
American stocks and is in strong shape. Mrs. Paoni and her
generation of Americans will be able to retire without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is also embedded in her community, and these days it is
showing signs of vulnerability. The corn that surrounds her home
sold for $5 a bushel two years ago; now the global economic
difficulties have sent corn plunging to $2.12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried,'' she said, exclaiming: ``Good God, look what's
on TV now! How about the layoffs!''
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring and downsizing strike a particular nerve in
the Paoni household because the supermarket chain where Mrs.
Paoni's husband, George, worked for 32 years was bought out by a
distant company just nine months before his retirement. He did not
lose his job as a meat cutter, but he lost his holiday pay and five
weeks' vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paoni is apprehensive about stock market levels and also
about local signs of disquiet: With farmers in trouble, tractor
sales have slumped, and the nearby John Deere plant has announced
layoffs. Banks are nervously checking their exposure to the
agricultural sector. And Mrs. Paoni, after some reflection and
several hours of interviews, has decided that she is linked to the
global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit here in this kitchen and say I don't have anything to do
with Asia, but I do,'' she said. ``There's always some tentacles
out there. Asia will definitely have an effect on Iowa and
Illinois.''

ARTS AGENCY PLANS TO SPREAD THE MONEY AROUND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (Eds.: Originally skedded as NEA-WEBER) 
(rk) 
 By   BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In two speeches here this week, William J. Ivey, the
new chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, discussed
publicly for the first time his plans for spending an increase in
appropriations to the agency. Ivey was appointed to succeed Jane
Alexander, whose stormy tenure ended in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposed budget, delivered to Congress on
Feb. 1, included an increase of more than 50 percent in
appropriations for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's $150 million request for the endowment represents a
$52 million increase over the current budget for the agency, which
has been embattled throughout the 1990s and was until last year
targeted for dissolution by congressional conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some $50 million of the added money is earmarked for Challenge
America, a project addressing lawmakers' concerns that the
endowment's support has been unevenly distributed around the nation
and that its financing for individual artists whose work many
conservatives found offensive came at the expense of improving
access to the arts for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday at a luncheon for business leaders and arts
administrators at the Chicago Economics Club, and that evening at a
public address at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Ivey said that
Challenge America would target money for programs in five areas:
arts education, youth at risk, access to the arts, cultural and
heritage preservation and community arts partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does coincide with the congressional agenda,'' Ivey said in
an interview, ``but it is also a completely legitimate program of
activities for the agency to take on.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for added funds comes when partisan antagonism in
Washington is at a peak. Clinton's proposed budget has already been
criticized by some Republican lawmakers as a return to what they
have called big-government liberal spending.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial increase in arts funding, a sensitive issue in
Congress since 1989 despite the endowment's relative insignificance
as a budget item, could raise hackles again.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the president's budget request was realistic, Ivey
said: ``It's hard to tell. Now that we seem to be in general
agreement about the survival of the agency with flat funding, the
question is whether significant opposition will crop up as we try
to move forward. There will always be criticism of and opposition
to the endowment,'' he continued, ``but my sense is that the
bipartisan center will support an increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The new funds would be distributed in four ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 1,000 communities in underserved areas of the country
would receive grants of between $5,000 and $10,000 for specific
arts projects.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 150 arts institutions would receive grants of between
$50,000 and $150,000 for programs to expand their community
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between 10 and 20 unspecified partnership programs involving
national arts organizations and federal agencies would receive
funding.
</P>
<P>
   _ $20 million would go to state agencies for arts education,
regional touring programs that bring performing arts to underserved
communities, after-school arts programs and organizations devoted
to folk art and cultural heritage preservation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ivey said, next year the agency will ask congress
for additional funds to help stabilize arts organizations with
support for their own endowments, technological and management
consulting and new programs for developing individual and corporate
philanthropy. The details of that request will depend on a study of
arts organizations which the agency is conducting.
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment's current budget is $98 million, down
from a high of $176 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Republicans assumed control of the House of
Representatives, they marshaled their outrage over endowment grants
that in the late 1980s supported controversial works _ like Andres
Serrano's photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine _ and slashed
the agency's budget by 40 percent for the next year, planning to
dissolve it entirely. The Senate kept it alive.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the political attitude toward the agency changed
for several reasons: Congress had curtailed the endowment's ability
to give grants to individual artists, some conservatives had been
satisfied by the budget cuts, and last June a Supreme Court ruling
upheld a 1990 law requiring the endowment to consider ``general
standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values
of the American public'' in its grant making. In July the House
approved this year's budget, ending the threat of dissolution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his sold-out address at the museum on Tuesday, Ivey received
a warm welcome but also a reminder that his position as the
nation's leading advocate for the arts is not without political
pressure from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Four leading arts administrators in Chicago also spoke at the
event _ Abena Joan P. Brown, president of the ETA Creative Arts
Foundation; Carlos Tortolero, executive director of the Mexican
Fine Arts Museum; Nick Rabkin, program officer at the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and Robert Fitzpatrick, director
of the Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   The administrators said the endowment, under Ms. Alexander, had
submitted too easily to Congressional pressure. ``I can only hope
that the last shall be first,'' Ms. Brown said. ``And the arts have
been last for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Tortolero added: ``The arts have been playing not to lose, and
we have to play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   All four said the endowment needed to re-enter the business of
making grants to individual artists, the sentiment that received
the loudest applause of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said the time was not quite at hand for that, but that he
had ``unwavering'' support for the endowment's eventual return to
grants for individuals.

TURKEY EXULTS IN KURD'S CAPTURE AND VOWS A FAIR TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KURD-EUROPE) 
(bl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Jubilation enveloped Turkey on Wednesday
after the capture of the country's most-wanted fugitive, Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, but debate over his trial has already
begun to turn bitter.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Ocalan's lawyers was denied entry into the country
Wednesday, and the government said it would not permit foreign
observers at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign leaders and human rights groups issued a stream of
statements urging Turkey to give Ocalan a chance to defend himself
fully. Several Turkish commentators said the trial could prove a
crucial test of Turkey's much-criticized judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was captured late Monday night in Kenya, where he had
been living clandestinely under the protection of Greek diplomats.
Turkish commandos brought him to Turkey before dawn Tuesday, and he
has been taken to an island prison from which all other inmates are
being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The government's determination to continue pursuing Kurdish
guerrillas was made clear Wednesday as an estimated 3,000 Turkish
troops crossed into northern Iraq to attack what officers say are
guerrilla sanctuaries. Turkish troops have carried out such
operations regularly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit brushed
aside concerns about Ocalan's trial, which is expected to focus on
a few specific massacres that are said to have been perpetrated by
his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very free, a very just trial, because justice is
very free in Turkey, autonomous,'' Ecevit said. ``It need not last
too long because all the illegal actions, the crimes of the PKK's
leadership, are well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his government's refusal to allow Ocalan's lawyers
to enter the country, he replied: ``They want, more or less, to
inspect the Turkish justice system, but they have no right to have
any doubts about it. Also, the Turkish justice system has certain
rules about who can defend.''
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sermet Atacanli, later said Turkey
would not allow foreign governments or organizations to send
observers to Ocalan's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible for us to accept actions from outside
Turkey which might be an intervention in the Turkish judicial
process,'' Atacanli said. ``Thus we could not accept such things as
observers.''
</P>
<P>
   Atacanli said the trial would be open to the public, but that
``if people who give themselves legal titles such as observers or
lawyers come to Turkey to behave like an inspector, they will not
be allowed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Ocalan's legal team, Britte Boehler, a German
national who is based in the Netherlands, said after her failed
attempt to enter Turkey that she feared that Ocalan was being
tortured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling Turkey we are on this case and we intend to
stay on it,'' Ms. Boehler told reporters at the Amsterdam airport.
She said the fact that she was not permitted to visit her client
was ``a clear symbol of how the trial would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish newspapers Wednesday published new details about the
commando operation that resulted in Ocalan's capture. Many were
contradictory, however.
</P>
<P>
   Some reported that Greek Embassy officials in Kenya knew they
were sending Ocalan into a trap when they let him be taken to the
Nairobi airport. Others claimed that Kenyans had participated. Many
said the CIA had provided the first tip that Ocalan was in Kenya,
and several said Israeli secret services had provided advice or
other help.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interest of not disturbing those parties who took part
in this operation,'' Prime Minister Ecevit told one interviewer,
``I will use a local expression and say, `Let us eat the grape and
not ask where it came from.'''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television stations Wednesday broadcast a video showing
some aspects of the operation. In it, Ocalan is seen being led onto
a small plane, handcuffed and blindfolded. After being handcuffed
to a seat, his blindfold was removed, revealing his sweat-drenched
face.
</P>
<P>
   In what seemed to be a bizarre comment from a figure who has
portrayed himself as a fearless revolutionary, Ocalan is heard to
tell his captors: ``If the truth needs to be told, I love Turkey
and the Turkish nation, and I want to serve it. If I have the
chance, I would be pleased to serve. Let there be no torture or
anything. I would be happy to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ocalan was shown being led to a bed, unsteady and
apparently drowsy, as commandos gave each other high-five slaps and
flashed the victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   Statements urging Turkey to guarantee Ocalan good treatment and
a fair trial came from many world capitals Wednesday. The British
government said it would urge that the trial be conducted ``in
strict accordance with the rule of law and due process.''
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the chief United Nations investigator for torture,
Sir Nigel Rodley, said: ``Without in any way implying any
conclusion as to the facts of the case, I appeal to the Turkish
authorities for clarification of the circumstances with a view to
insuring that Ocalan's right to physical and mental integrity is
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Influential Turks made similar appeals. ``This is obviously a
great success in operational terms, but it could also be turned
against Turkey,'' Haluk Sahin, one of the country's most respected
commentators, wrote in a newspaper column. ``Turkey must now prove
to the world that it can give Ocalan a fair trial in keeping with
universal standards of justice and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting impulses seem to be raging in many Turkish hearts
this week. The emotional desire to inflict swift and preferably
excruciating punishment on Ocalan is at war with the realization
that the world will be carefully watching what Turkey does.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the jumble of emotions more visible than among the
mourners at Edirnekapi Sehitligi, an Istanbul cemetery where
soldiers killed in the Kurdish war are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would give him to us so we could torture and kill
him,'' one mourner at the cemetery, Fatma Elkan, said as she wept
at the grave of her son, who was killed in 1993 at the age of 21.
``But I know this is not possible. We have to count on the state to
give him the punishment he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mourner, Kazim Kalyon, who also lost a son in the war,
said Ocalan ``certainly deserves to be executed, but to protect our
image in the world, we need to give him a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that he will be sentenced to death but that the
sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment,'' Kalyon said.
``That might be even worse than dying.''

   BEIJING _ As cameras crowded in, the old man wore a grin as wide
as his ears. His thin body was nearly overwhelmed by the giant red
bow someone had draped across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Muqin, 63, was the third winner the other morning of a
gleaming new $15,000 Citroen _ the top prize in the public
lotteries that Beijing and many other Chinese cities are holding
all this week to raise money for victims of last year's floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy,'' said Hu, a retired forestry official. He said
he would give the car to his 30-year-old daughter, who was learning
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks surrounding the lunar New Year, or Spring
Festival as the Chinese call their biggest holiday, ancient temples
resound to drums and lion dances, and trains and buses overflow
with people visiting their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has drawn out the people of Beijing like the
lotteries that began last weekend at several parks and vacant lots
around the city, part of a national craze. Hundreds of thousands of
Beijingers have elbowed their way to the long rows of ticket
windows, heeding the giant red signs that say ``Make Your Dreams
Come True'' by buying wads of tickets at 24 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers get immediate results by scratching their tickets to see
what if anything they have won, and the lotteries are structured,
in the best Las Vegas psychology, to produce an impression of
constant winners.
</P>
<P>
   In the festive throngs around every lottery site a striking
number of people carry boxes of cheap glassware or stainless steel
bowls, items awarded by the hundreds of thousands here this week.
Others, luckier, struggle with microwave ovens, or have hired a
cart to haul their complete home-entertainment systems.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch the surface, and ticket buyers admit to a common
yearning for today's No. 1 prestige possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who comes here has just one goal, to win a car,''
said Ling Xiaoping, a migrant from southern China who mans a street
stall in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing else is important,'' said Ling, who bought 100
tickets, came up dry and was debating whether to fork out more
cash. ``I can't actually drive a car,'' he said, ``but I'd use it
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred Citroens, which are on display next to the ticket
windows, will be given out in Beijing in the course of the week.
</P>
<P>
   China has been notably unsuccessful at collecting personal
income taxes from its citizens. But, like Western governments, it
has discovered a politically painless way to supplement its
revenues even as it supposedly maintains a general ban on gambling.
</P>
<P>
   What the government calls ``welfare lotteries'' began in 1987,
and in the last few years they have really taken off. Reflecting
the aspirations of a fast-developing consumer culture, the grand
prizes, too, have evolved _ from color televisions to cars.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, the proceeds are significant. According to
the official press, the lotteries scheduled between October 1998
and June 1999 will sell tickets equivalent to $1.20 for every
Chinese. That is close to $1.5 billion _ with half the money
supposed to go for prizes, 20 percent for administration and 30
percent for relief programs of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   By regulation, most of the lotteries keep going until they sell
all of a predetermined number of tickets, usually the scratch-it
kind. But in some places, computer drawings, too, have been
introduced. In Shanghai, huge cash prizes are doled out weekly on a
popular television show.
</P>
<P>
   The rush in Beijing this week appears downright tame compared
with reported scenes in some southern cities, where frenzied hordes
have been reported to snap up millions of dollars worth of tickets
within a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Some faint voices of concern have appeared in the press. There
was the report of an old woman in Sichuan province who had a fatal
stroke when she heard she had won a big prize. In Jiangsu province,
an elated car-winner had a drunken party, then crashed and died in
his new car that very night.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of Jiangsu, a man who could not afford it
borrowed $120 to play and won nothing. His wife was so distraught,
the papers said, that she killed herself with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall in Sichuan, when a lottery was halted, supposedly by
accident, before all the prizes were awarded, buyers went amok,
looting the warehouse and setting banners on fire.
</P>
<P>
   An article this month in People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the
Chinese Communist Party, extolled the welfare lotteries, which by
regulation must be used to help ``the old, the handicapped,
orphaned and hard-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have worried, the article said, that the lotteries
encourage dangerous speculation by people of little means. ``But
the leader of the Welfare Lottery Committee believes this is
unwarranted,'' the article duly reported. ``The reasons are that
China's welfare lotteries are conducted by the government, and the
cost of tickets is kept low.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing this week, anyway, there were no visible signs of
sore losers or lottery addicts gambling the clothes off their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the New Year, so why not try your luck?'' said Zhang
Dafa, 30, as he scratched the last of his 100 tickets without even
winning a set of drinking glasses. ``And anyway, the money goes for
a good cause.''

U.S. WARNS AMERICANS ABROAD ABOUT VIOLENCE LINKED TO KURD CAPTURE

   WASHINGTON _ The State Department issued a worldwide travel
warning Wednesday and urged Americans to take special security
precautions abroad as a result of this week's violent protests in
Europe over the arrest of the top Kurdish rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greek diplomatic missions and personnel have been subjected to
violence and it is possible that this danger may extend to American
interests as well,'' the advisory said. ``Americans traveling or
residing abroad are urged to review their personal security.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, when a wave of violent Kurdish protests swept across
Europe, the department announced that it had stepped up security at
U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they feared that news reports
suggesting U.S. involvement in Turkey's apprehension of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan would lead to attacks on U.S.
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration spokesmen have denied that the United
States had any direct involvement in the capture of Ocalan, whose
rebel group has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But they have refused to comment on the possibility that the
United States had indirect involvement in the arrest, or on news
reports in Europe suggesting that Israeli intelligence officers
were involved in the arrest. Israel has categorically denied the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Greek embassies were the initial targets of the protests since
Ocalan had apparently been in hiding at the Greek Embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya, in the hours before his capture in Kenya late
Monday and transfer to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heightened our security posture and alerted Americans
in Turkey and elsewhere of the need for caution,'' said James
Foley, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department travel advisory, which was placed on its
Web site at www.state.gov, also urged Americans traveling or
residing abroad to contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate
for the latest information on security threats.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rain will brush the coast from the Carolinas to New England
Thursday as a series of weak low pressure areas move along a front
near the Atlantic Seaboard. A few rumbles of thunder will accompany
the rain in the eastern Carolinas early Thursday. Farther west,
mostly cloudy skies will linger near the Appalachians. Clouds will
yield to some sun as drier air arrives from the eastern Ohio Valley
to the interior Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will begin with patchy fog in parts of the Tennessee
Valley and southern Appalachians. Otherwise, ample sunshine will
prevail over most of the Southeast as slightly cooler air spreads
over the region. Meanwhile, scattered strong thunderstorms will
erupt in the warm, humid air over southeastern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A broken area of snow and rain will rapidly develop from the
southern Missouri Valley to the central Mississippi Valley as a
potent jet-stream disturbance moves southeast across these regions.
Vigorous upward motion will cool the air enough to promote
intermittent snow from eastern Nebraska to southern Iowa and
northern Missouri. Showers will develop farther to the south over
Missouri and Arkansas. Later Thursday night, the showers will
expand into the interior Southeast as low pressure gradually
strengthens over the Tennessee Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of fast-moving fronts will cause rain and
mountain snow from northern California to western Washington. The
heaviest rain is expected during the morning and midday when
onshore winds are strongest in northern California and southern
Oregon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Iris Blooms
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Iris sprung to life over the Philippine Sea late
Tuesday. Unlike the limited hurricane seasons of the tropical
Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, the western Pacific never
sleeps. Indeed, tropical storms and typhoons (the name given to
hurricanes west of the International Date Line) have been observed
in the western Pacific during each month of the year. Ceaseless
trade winds blowing over tropical Pacific seas push equatorial
waters westward, forming a thick layer of warm water a few hundred
meters deep that sometimes set the stage for a few tropical storms
in winter. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For almost a quarter-century, relations between
Indonesia, the world's fourth most-populous nation, and the United
States _ as well as the rest of the outside world _ have often
stumbled over the fate of half of an impoverished island so small
and so remote that even many Indonesians would have trouble finding
it on a map.
</P>
<P>
   But with the utterance of a few words by Indonesia's new
president last week, the territory, East Timor, suddenly appears to
be on the brink of independence. That has left the Clinton
administration and other governments puzzling over how to respond
to Indonesia's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, on the verge of economic and political collapse as a
result of the Asian economic crisis, seems eager to be rid of East
Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was invaded and annexed by
Indonesia in the mid-1970s over international protest. Since then,
the territory's name has become a rallying cry for human rights
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be bothered by East Timor's problems
anymore,'' Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, said last week.
``If someone asks me about East Timor, my suggestion is, give them
freedom. It is just and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   While welcoming the move toward independence for the 750,000
people of East Timor, administration officials and foreign
diplomats say that if the break with Indonesia is too sudden, it
could lead to chaos and even civil war as Timorese factions
maneuver for power.
</P>
<P>
   While the vast majority of the population is thought to favor
independence, East Timorese who oppose independence have formed
small armed bands to fight to keep the territory part of Indonesia,
with weapons provided to them by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesians can't just pull out and expect it to be normal
there,'' said Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs. ``Any viable solution in East Timor must
avoid the type of bloodshed that occurred in 1975, when Portugal
withdrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal abruptly pulled out of East Timor that year after
nearly four centuries of colonization. Indonesia quickly invaded,
and declared East Timor a province in 1976. The western half of the
island, a former Dutch territory, was already part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups have long accused the
Indonesian military of a campaign of killing and torture to enforce
the annexation of East Timor. Human rights groups say up to 200,000
East Timorese have died since 1975 as a result of human rights
abuses or fighting with government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Former Indonesian President Suharto, who resigned under pressure
in May after more than three decades in power, insisted that East
Timor would forever remain part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But his successor and former vice president, Habibie, recognized
that East Timor had helped turn Indonesia into a ripe target for
human rights activists, and that rights abuses there by the
military were damaging diplomatic and trade relationships at a time
when Indonesia was desperate for international help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is burdened with enough troubles now, without East
Timor,'' said Daniel Lev, an Indonesian specialist at the
University of Washington. ``This is a very sensible decision that
will work in Indonesia's favor. This would relieve Indonesia of an
international burden and the international criticism it has faced
since 1975.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this month Habibie agreed to remove the long-jailed
leader of the East Timorese independence movement from prison and
place him under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered Indonesia's foreign minister to meet at the
United Nations with his counterpart from Portugal, which is still
recognized by the United Nations as the territory's administrator,
to discuss greater autonomy or independence for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The fear, administration officials and foreign diplomats say, is
that Habibie may move too quickly, and that East Timor may find
itself granted full independence from Indonesia before it is ready
to govern itself, and with the territory awash in guns. Habibie has
said he wants the issue of East Timorese autonomy resolved by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony last week in Congress, Roth said the State
Department had received ``numerous reports that the Indonesian army
has been arming'' anti-independence militia groups in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States welcomed a recent statement by the
Indonesian government that it would would support an effort to
disarm the groups before a withdrawal of Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups wonder whether the military, concerned
that independence for East Timor could inspire independence
movements elsewhere in the vast, ethnically diverse Indonesian
archipelago, is trying to encourage turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups have called on the Indonesian government to allow
the United Nations to station monitors _ and possibly even
peacekeeping troops _ in East Timor to observe a transition to
independence and to prevent outbreaks of violence among East
Timorese factions and the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's urgent that there be an international presence on
the ground to prevent further escalation of violence,'' said Mike
Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch Asia. ``For
this process to have any kind of transparency, any kind of
credibility, it would obviously help to have some kind of U.N.
presence.''

BUSH `WARMING TO THE TASK' OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush responded Wednesday to weeks
of being urged to run for the GOP presidential nomination by
elected officials and political activists from other states,
saying, ``I'm warming to the task.''
</P>
<P>
   While hardly a declaration, Bush's statement marked the first
time that he has said he is inclined toward running.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, Bush has repeatedly said he is seriously
``interested'' but voiced reservations about taking his wife,
Laura, and twin daughters into the limelight of presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments after meeting privately at the Governor's
Mansion with South Carolina Lt. Gov. Robert L. Peel and three
legislators from New Jersey. The New Jersey lawmakers said they
urged Bush to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Peel did not speak to the news media, but another South Carolina
politician, House Speaker David H. Wilkins, publicly released a
letter signed by himself and 59 other Republican House members
urging Bush to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush best represents the ideals and goals of South
Carolina families,'' Wilkins said in a statement. ``He understands
government should work for the people and not lord over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said he would volunteer for Bush's leadership team if he
decides to run. South Carolina has one of the nation's earliest
primaries, currently set for March 4, 2000, and Republicans there
are considering moving the primary into February.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting marked the second time political leaders
from New Jersey have met with Bush. Senate Majority Whip Diane
Allen and state Sen. John Bennett said they were undecided before
meeting with Bush but now believe he should run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here wanting to listen to what George W. Bush had
to say, to look him in the eye and size him up. I've decided to be
a supporter,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex DeCroce, deputy speaker of the New Jersey assembly, said he
urged Bush to run because he has a proven record of electability.
He said potential Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, a
New Jersey resident, has never been elected to an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes, we don't know if he's electable. We know this
governor's electable,'' DeCroce said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week received a delegation from Iowa urging him to
run, and he previously received a letter from California Republican
lawmakers promoting his candidacy. About 50 current and former
members of Congress urged him to run last week and he has had a
trail of foreign dignitaries visiting Austin to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he will form an exploratory committee by next
month if he is inclined toward running.

A YOUNG VIOLINIST'S VIRTUOSITY AND VIGOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Musical prodigies grow up with lots of eyes on them,
and under pressures that can be as easily crushing as fortifying.
Maxim Vengerov, the violinist, seems to have come through those
demands intact. When he first performed in New York, he was barely
18 and won a large following with his finely polished technique and
interpretive assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vengerov is 24, and at his recital at Carnegie Hall on
Tuesday evening it seemed that the characteristics that first drew
attention to his playing remain firmly intact and have in some ways
become magnified. It also seemed, though, that he had not come
fully to terms with at least one corner of the repertory that
eluded him a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That corner is where the Brahms sonatas are shelved. Vengerov,
with Alexander Markovich at the piano, opened his concert with the
second of them, the A Major (Op. 100). His reading had its
attractions, not the least being a lovely bloom in his phrasing and
a glowing Elman-like vibrato in the andante tranquillo. Yet the
performance never cohered as more than a sequence of discrete,
passing moments, some beautiful, others nondescript. This made for
a peculiar sense of distance: Vengerov looked passionate about the
work, but that passion registered on the eye more than the ear, and
the ear more than the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Prokofiev, on the other hand, has long been one of Vengerov's
strengths, and in the Sonata No. 1 in F minor (Op. 80) Vengerov and
Markovich played with a relentless, captivating intensity. Vengerov
was fully conversant with the extremes that this work touches _ the
icy beauty of the quicksilver, pianissimo passages that appear in
the first and last movements, the steely power of the Allegro
brusco, and the lushness of the andante _ and he moved easily and
persuasively between them, with Markovich deftly mirroring these
shifts of mood and coloration.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter works on the second half of the program afforded
Vengerov an opportunity to show off the breadth of his palette and
his sheer virtuosity, and if the material was lightweight after the
exertions of the Brahms and Prokofiev, it brought a measure of
pure, vigorous entertainment to the evening. Sarasate's ``Caprice
Basque,'' a work with bags of technical trickery, left Vengerov
unfazed, as did a broken string in Waxman's wild pastiche of
``Carmen'' themes. He also offered an alluringly throaty rending of
Ravel's ``Tzigane'' and a few moments of unalloyed sentimentality
in Rachmaninoff's ``Vocalise.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, REPUBLICANS SKIRMISH OVER SOCIAL SECURITY, TAXES
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the impeachment battle behind them, President
Clinton and congressional Republicans skirmished Wednesday over
plans to save Social Security and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech from the White House East Room linked by satellite
to 41 college campuses, Clinton said the choice facing the country
was whether to use projected budget surpluses ``on a terrifically
appealing tax cut'' or to strengthen Social Security and Medicare
by reducing the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that Clinton's proposal would increase the
debt
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a proposed 10 percent across-the-board income tax
cut proposed by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House
Budget Committee, would ``spend too much of the surplus now and
invest too ... little of it for tomorrow. I believe it would target
the lion's share of the benefits away from the middle class ...
(and) reward consumption over savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using 62 percent of the anticipated surplus
over 15 years to reduce the debt and earmark the savings for Social
Security. He has proposed using another 15 percent of the surplus
to shore up the Medicare program and using some of the surplus to
provide 401(k)-style individual savings accounts to workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their idea sounds simpler, sounds good, even sounds fair _ 10
percent for
</P>
<P>
   everybody,'' Clinton said. ``Our idea will give you a stronger
economy, will save Social Security and Medicare, will stabilize
families, will strengthen the ability of the United States to lead
the world, and will make you feel a whole lot better 15 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans called Clinton's characterization of their position
unfair and his description of his plan inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair for the president to say it's a choice between
this and a tax cut when the Republicans have said that we would
hold 62 percent of the surplus until Social Security is fixed,''
said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the House Social
Security subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw noted that Republicans have not fully endorsed the 10
percent tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's John Kasich's position. The Ways and Means Committee
has not signed off on that, and I don't think that would be our
approach,'' Shaw said. ``We hope that there is enough surplus after
we save Social Security so we can give some tax relief, but we
haven't figured out how much that will be, or where it will be, and
we also want to pay down the accumulated national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, sent Clinton a
letter noting a Congressional Budget Office prediction that the
administration proposal would require raising the $5.95 trillion
debt ceiling by 2001. Without the proposal, the ceiling would not
be raised until 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued that Clinton's proposal would reduce
the ``publicly held'' debt _ the amount the government owes the
public _ but Republicans say it would raise the total national
debt, including what the government owes its trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your budget proposal were to increase total government debt
by adding large quantities of federal debt to the Social Security
trust funds, our children will be forced to repay this money,''
Archer said.

ASH WEDNESDAY SERVICES GROWING IN POPULARITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Ill., Mo., Colo.)  (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a midday service at Christ Church United Methodist
in Manhattan, the Rev. Stephen P. Bauman and his associate, the
Rev. Javier A. Viera, invited several dozen people to come toward
the altar. Each clergyman dipped a finger into a small bowl of
ashes and then smudged a cross onto the foreheads of those who came
up the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Dan Domingo, 39, a veterinarian, said, ``It's
preparing ourselves, reflecting on what we've done, and our
relationship with the Lord and with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash Wednesday services across the nation announced the start of
Lent, the 40-day period of prayer and penitence that precedes the
celebration of Jesus' resurrection on Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving ashes ``is a sign of our mortality,'' as well as
humility, said Sister Ann Rehrauer, associate director of the U.S.
Catholic Conference's liturgy office. ``One of the phrases with the
imposition of ashes is, `Remember you are dust and to dust you will
return.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among Roman Catholics, Ash Wednesday Masses typically draw not
only the dedicated, but those who rarely cross a church threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Ash Wednesday is also traditionally marked by Episcopalians and
Lutherans. But it is increasingly important among some other
Protestant churches, where interest in traditional forms of liturgy
has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices give people a formal means to express belief ``in
a time when so much seems confusing and unstructured,'' said Wes
Granberg-Michaelson, general-secretary of the 185,000-member
Reformed Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hoyt Hickman, retired director of worship resource
development for the 8.5 million-member United Methodist Church,
said the practice has become common among United Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very few Methodists that I knew of were doing it in the
'50s and '60s,'' he added, ``but it began to grow in the '60s and
'70s.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also grown among Presbyterians. ``Certainly, this has
been a phenomenon of the last 20 years,'' said the Rev. Brad Kent,
an official in the spiritual formation office of the 2.7
million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
</P>
<P>
   When he served as a minister in Kansas City, Mo., a decade ago,
Kent said his church began holding Ash Wednesday services with
three other congregations _ one Methodist, one Disciples of Christ
and one United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Churchgoers interviewed around the country Wednesday spoke of
finding various meanings in the beginning of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   At St. James Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, Cesar Vega, 28, an
air-conditioning technician, said he was returning to church for
the first time in 15 years. ``It's been a long time, I've forgotten
most everything, but it feels good,'' he said. ``Your spirit gets a
little clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Maria Evola, 37, a Catholic, said Ash Wednesday ``is
about a renewing of faith and a reminding of what is the practicing
of faith on a day-to-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston,
Gail Brazil, 51, a senior operations clerk at a bank, said Lent is
one of the most important times of the year, as it prompts her to
examine her spiritual life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of giving up something I'll take something on, whether
it's taking 15 minutes a day and saying I am go to meditate,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Denver, the Rev. Steve Swanson
said he has noticed an increase in recent years in the number of
people with ashes on their foreheads. ``People want to participate
in their religion, not just observe it,'' he said. ``Lent is a
journey, and I think people _ young people especially _ don't want
to just observe others practicing.''

FRENCH COURT CONVICTS WOMAN AND PARENTS FOR CUTTING GENITALS OF
GIRLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Gambia, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal)  By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A Paris court has sentenced an African woman to eight
years in prison for cutting the genitals of 48 girls between the
ages of a month and 10 years. The jury also convicted 27 parents,
who received suspended sentences from three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was the largest of its kind in France, which began to
prosecute genital cutting in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said the unexpectedly tough sentence was a new and clear
warning to France's large African immigrant population that their
painful tradition will not be tolerated here because it violates
the law against ``mutilation'' of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual cutting of young girls' genitals has become an issue
throughout Western Europe as the number of African immigrants who
practice it has grown, though France is the first country to take
them to court. In this and previous trials, prosecutors have
described the custom _ widespread in some Muslim countries _ as a
barbaric habit that aims to control women by reducing or preventing
their sexual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The practice involves cutting off all or part of a young girl's
clitoris and labia and sometimes stitching her vagina closed until
marriage. Doctors testified in court that the procedure often
causes infections and painful scars and may lead to lifelong health
complications.
</P>
<P>
   This case, on which the court ruled on Tuesday, has drawn much
public attention because it was brought by a victim, Mariatou
Koita, 23, a Parisian law student from a Malian family. She went to
a Paris judge four years ago to accuse Hawa Greou, who she said had
cut her and her sisters when they were children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greou, 53, who is also from Mali, apologized at the
beginning of the trial, saying she had intended to perform a
service, not to do harm. She charged $30 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the 48 children cut by Ms. Greou were tried as
accomplices. Most were from Gambia, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal.
Some argued that they had had their girls cut to make sure that
they would get husbands when they grew up.

Europe, will join training camp in Italy Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some compromises were made on both parts, and I have no
problem with the contract,'' Burns said. ``I always said I wanted
to start and end my pro career here. I tried a couple of things,
but my heart was always here. It was just part of the process. I'm
in a good frame of mind to go into the season, and I don't have bad
feelings toward the league or the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, of Marlborough, Mass., has captained the Revolution in 79
games over three seasons.
</P>

   The Revolution have 24 players on the roster and must cut to 22
by March 1. They opened their exhibition season Wednesday with a
1-1 tie against Prato.

   Giovanni Savarese scored in his first game for the Revolution,
on a rebound after Imad Baba set up Joe-Max Moore for a close-range
shot in the 15th minute.

   Walter Zenga played 30 minutes in goal, and the Revolution
surrendered the tying score 30 seconds after he was replaced by
Jeff Causey. Cosimo Mobile scored on a corner kick for Prato, which
is in seventh place in Italy's Serie C2A with a 9-6-8 record.

<P>
   Last year, Greg Bradsher, a senior archivist at the National
Archives, got an urgent request from Ford Motor &UR;  &LR; Co. not long after
the car maker was named in a lawsuit accusing it of profiting from
its German operations in the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's idea: To send a SWAT team of 30 historians and
researchers to a government document repository so they could hunt
down every scrap of paper dealing with Ford's activities in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradsher replied that there were not enough library carts
to accommodate such a team, Ford offered to ship its own carts.
Eventually, Ford relented, trimming its request to six people.
</P>
<P>
   For banks, insurers and companies like Ford, the mounting wave
of Holocaust-related lawsuits has created both a litigation and
public-relations nightmare. But the lawsuits also have created a
mini-boom for one unlikely group, historians and research
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think in terms of corporate memories,'' Bradsher
said. ``There is probably no one around who knows anything about
this stuff, and for many of them these lawsuits are hitting them
out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a growing number of corporations, from Ford to
General Motors to Bertelsmann, have hired well-known academics to
write their wartime histories or scour ancient file rooms worldwide
for damaging or exculpatory information. At stake are hundreds of
millions of dollars in settlements, potential public embarrassment,
and even business complications. And often the race is simply for
companies to find disquieting information before their adversaries
do.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures can be unsettling. Deutsche Bank &UR;  &LR; said recently
that independent historians it had hired had found records
confirming that the bank had helped finance the building of the
Auschwitz death camp.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have contracted out research to small companies
that use graduate students and others to pore over dusty records at
repositories like the National Archives. Plaintiffs' lawyers also
have assembled competing teams of historical experts, including
some with far darker views of corporate behavior than researchers
hired by companies.
</P>
<P>
   The rush by companies to hire historians also has touched off an
ethical debate in academic circles, including an exchange of fire
between opposing groups in journals like The Times Literary
Supplement.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article, Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, a professor at
Brunel University in London, asserted that companies that hired
academics to investigate their Nazi-era ties either tried to
hamstring historians or retained researchers who viewed corporate
wartime transgressions as unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among certain corporate historians, there is an ideology that
corporations are unfairly maligned and that they are less powerful
than they are made out to be,'' Pinto-Duschinsky said in a recent
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But academics hired by companies to investigate their wartime
roles insist they are given the freedom and resources to seek out
the truth. Saul Friedlander, a history professor at the University
of Tel Aviv, said he was approached recently by officials of
Bertelsmann, the German publishing company, after an article in a
Swiss magazine that accused the company of, among other things,
publishing pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic books in the Nazi years.
</P>
<P>
   Friedlander said he insisted before taking the job that
Bertelsmann give him and fellow researchers unfettered access to
its archives and that it forgo control over the fruits of that
research. Within 30 minutes, Friedlander said he received a fax
from Thomas Middelhoff, the company's chairman, agreeing to those
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me the strong feeling that he wanted this whole thing
cleaned up in every detail,'' said Friedlander, who also teaches at
the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The recent demand for World War II research began several years
ago, when Swiss banks were accused of keeping assets deposited
before the Holocaust by Jews and others who were later killed by
the Nazis. The World Jewish Congress hired young researchers like
Miriam Kleiman to review Nazi-era documents at the National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was between jobs, and I had free time,'' Ms. Kleiman said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pace of Holocaust litigation intensified, the stakes
rose. Ms. Kleiman was soon lured away by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld
&AMP; Toll, a class-action law firm in Washington that has filed many
Holocaust-related lawsuits. While some researchers at the National
Archives still wear blue jeans, it is not uncommon these days to
spot corporate researchers wearing suits and gold cuff links.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those people have limousines picking them up,'' Ms.
Kleiman said.
</P>
<P>
   With Holocaust legal battles being fought in the forum of public
opinion, the type of corporate firepower brought to bear on this
peculiar paper chase can be awesome. Soon after being sued in
March, Ford assembled two research teams with a total of 40 to 50
people, said Jon Spelich, a Ford spokesman. They hit document rooms
at the company as well as at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn,
Mich., where pre-1950 documents were kept.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the company turned to the National Archives, which keeps
its Holocaust-era records in College Park, Md. For that task, it
also contracted with companies like History Associates, a small
concern in Rockville, Md., that hires historians and graduate
students to prowl through government record rooms. Over the last
nine months, Ford research teams also have hunted through World War
II archives in Britain, Germany and other countries, Spelich said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal was to see if any documents existed that
undercut Ford's position that it lost complete control over its
Germany subsidiary, Ford Werke, before the United States entered
the war. Thus far, Spelich said the only new discovery is a $60,000
dividend payment by Ford Werke to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that we were going to dive into archives to see if
there is anything that had been missed over the years,'' Spelich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Ford retained professors like Simon Reich of the
University of Pittsburgh, but Spelich said it would soon announce
the hiring of yet another academic to examine whether the company's
research methodologies are up to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford is by no means alone in its quest for academic
all-stars. General Motors recently hired Henry A. Turner, a
professor of history at Yale University, to investigate the
activities of its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, during the Nazi
era. Degussa A.G., a German-based company accused of profiting from
gold looted from Holocaust victims, has retained Peter Hayes, a
professor at Northwestern University, to research its past.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers suing companies over World War II-era claims also are
assembling their own crews of historical experts, including some
who have investigated the darker part of corporate behavior in the
Nazi years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kleiman's law firm, for example, worked with a Dutch
professor, Cees Wiebes, the co-author of a book about how relatives
of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of
Jews from death camps, hid ties between the family's banking
business and the Nazis. Not surprisingly, the debate over
industry's wartime role has brought some old adversaries into
collision.

UNDATED: into collision .
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the case of Bradford Snell, who as a young government
lawyer in 1974 helped begin a Senate subcommittee investigation of
possible collaboration between both Ford and GM and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Snell, who later worked on a history of GM, has been
a corporate gadfly. His research was used in a television
documentary shown recently that accused GM of working to undermine
municipal trolley car and rail systems to pump up motor vehicle
sales. With the Holocaust lawsuits, he is the object of renewed
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, he said, he received a call from a
class-action firm in New York involved in Holocaust lawsuits asking
if he would work with them. And Turner, the Yale University
professor hired by GM, has also written to him.
</P>
<P>
   Snell said he was holding off working for plaintiffs' lawyers
until his book was finished but there is little doubt about where
his sympathies lie. ``I'm trying to write a history of General
Motors,'' he said, ``and they don't want this one written.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new gleanings of corporate files and archives
reveals new revelations about the Holocaust remains to be seen.
Some critics like Pinto-Duschinsky say the undertaking is little
more than an exercise in public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, for example, one small Swiss company that thought
it might attract attention because it, by coincidence, had the same
name as a leading Swiss Nazi sent a researcher to the National
Archives to see if company officials had done anything wrong during
World War II, said Bradsher, the archivist.
</P>
<P>
   It came up with a clean bill of health, but many other companies
might not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was the general counsel for one of these companies,''
Bradsher said, ``I would be looking to find everything I could.''

FERTILIZING HOUSEPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Can you address the question of fertilizing houseplants?
Should I fertilize year-round? If so, how often? Should I use an
all-purpose chemical fertilizer, or the liquid fish kind?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Your phrasing implies there is a single answer to this
question, instead of several million. But fertilizing houseplants
is like watering houseplants: there is no general rule, except that
the average houseplant is more in danger of getting too much than
of getting too little.
</P>
<P>
   The best course is to watch each plant for changes that will
signal its needs. Is it trying to put out new leaves? Do you see a
suggestion of flower buds? Or is it just sitting there looking
green? Plants are hungrier when they are in active growth or
preparing to bloom than they are when resting, and unlike people,
they won't automatically get bigger just because you feed them.
</P>
<P>
   Most foliage houseplants do keep slowly making leaves and
getting larger as long as they stay alive, but very little
fertilizer is required to maintain this status quo. Feeding time
comes when the plant is engaged in the sort of vigorous new growth
that is usually set in motion by brighter light and lengthening
days.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, many indoor gardeners do successfully
simplify life by using a very small amount of fertilizer each time
they water. If you want to try it, use the fish emulsion, diluted
to one-eighth the recommended strength. Fish emulsion isn't as
strong as the chemical formulations, so it's less likely to burn
roots or to lead to a damaging buildup of mineral salts in the
soil. &QL;

CAMBY NAMED IN BREACH-OF-CONTRACT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former University of Massachusetts basketball star Marcus Camby
probably regrets the day he became acquainted with would-be sports
agents seeking to represent him at the NBA level. Three years after
forgoing his final year of college eligibility to go pro and
admitting to taking money and gifts from would-be agents, Camby is
still being asked to answer for his transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   John Lounsbury, who claims he and Camby made an oral agreement
of reprsentation after he spent $40,000 in gifts luring the former
national player of the year, filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit
last month against Camby (now with the New York Knicks) and his
agents, ProServ Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lounsbury says Camby demanded money and gifts, including rental
cars and jewelry, between October 1994 and April 1996 in exchange
for a promise that Camby would hire Lounsbury as his agent once
Camby turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, UMass alerted the NCAA that Camby, who was chosen
by Toronto with the No. 2 pick in the '96 NBA draft, may have
committed violations by accepting cash and jewelry from agents,
including Lounsbury.
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who was traded by Toronto to the Knicks before this
season, said he accepted thousands of dollars from Lounsbury in
1995 and two necklaces and a diamond pendant from Wesley Spears, a
Hartford lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   UMass was stripped of its 1996 NCAA regional championship and
was forced to return the money it earned by making it to the Final
Four of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Lounsbury agreed not to act as a sports agent
for five years. That agreement with the Connecticut Department of
Consumer Protection stemmed from his purchase of airline tickets
for two University of Connecticut players, Ricky Moore and Kirk
King.
</P>
<P>
   Lounsbury's lawyer, John Williams, said Wednesday Lounsbury
sought his services last year. Williams said he decided to take on
the civil suit against Camby after reading a November New York
Times article that he said praised Camby while vilifying Lounsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said that John was a pimp. It was like it had been written
by (Camby's) publicist,'' said Williams. ``I have always
represented little guys being screwed over by big guys, and I
firmly believe that this happens to be just that. John Lounsbury
was a starry-eyed wannabe crushed by some big guys, so I took on
the case to hope to even things up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The new development came as a shock to Camby's agent, James
Bryant, who said ProServ reached a settlement with Lounsbury three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess in America you can always find an attorney that will
take any case,'' said Byrant. ``It's incredible because it was
three years ago and this is the first person in NCAA history to
ever get his money back in a settlement. We paid him his money back
for any influence he tried to have over Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when someone breaks the NCAA rules, they go away
quietly, and if they get paid they go away even quieter. Camby
settled this three years ago, and if (Lounsbury's) attorney doesn't
know that, he will be sued for malpractice and sanctioned by a
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he knew of the settlement, Williams said, ``I'm
not aware of any court documents, but I am aware of news accounts
and a letter that says ProServ paid a portion of what John
Lounsbury had laid out, and it was only a portion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They claimed it was to save him from loan sharks. They are
entitled to get credit for that, but I don't believe it was a
settlement. If they have a different view, it will be litigated and
whoever wins wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Johnson, vice president of ProServ Basketball, said he has
received documents naming the agency in a suit by Lounsbury twice
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then we get papers with John looking for more
money,'' Johnson said, ``and that's not going to happen. But I
think this time he's found a law firm willing to go all the way.
Anyone who has done their research knows the suit has no grounds,
but they think it does so we'll see them in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the case will be heard in Waterbury, Conn. ``Such
cases in Waterbury take four years from the return date (of the
suit) to the trial date,'' he added. ``My client is not happy about
(the four-year wait) but he doesn't have any choice.''

 &HT;        THE VERDICT IS IN: SPECTER AND SANTORUM BOMBARDED WITH
RESPONSE TO IMPEACHMENT VOTES   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 -- When Sen. Arlen Specter invoked Scottish
law and voted ``not proven, therefore not guilty'' in President
Clinton's impeachment trial last week, there was a pause of hushed
murmuring on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the response since then from residents of Pennsylvania and
around the nation has been deafening.
</P>
<P>
   From calls for Specter's resignation to cries of ``Why don't you
move to Scotland,'' E-mail letter writers from both parties
expressed surprise and confusion about the Pennsylvania
Republican's unique verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Andersen, of Rapid City, South Dakota sent a one word
letter to the senator: ``Why???''
</P>
<P>
   Specter spokesman John Ullyot said he had no comment about the
remarks made in the letters, but said Specter planned to respond to
``as many of them as he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter's office refused to release the number of calls and
letters received after the Senate voted Friday to acquit Clinton on
obstruction of justice and perjury charges. Ullyot declined to
characterize the response from constituents to Specter's ``not
proven'' verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a day to day breakdown of the responses
received,'' said Ullyot. ``We have heard from thousands of people
since the trial began. Sen. Specter believes it is time for the
Senate to move on to more pressing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than one thousand authors of e-mail letters who sent
their correspondence to Specter through a nonpartisan political
website, www.senatevote.com, agreed also to post them publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Many letter writers lambasted Specter's use of Scottish
precedent, which he said allows jurors three choices for a verdict:
guilty, not guilty or not proven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Specter!!! HELLOOOOOO. We don't live in Scotland, or
hadn't you heard? And you were a prosecutor??? If it weren't so
sad, it would be funny. I'm disgusted,'' wrote D. Kopsa, of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Art Stetson, of Chicago, wrote, ``I think you look good in
Kilts. You have nothing to hide under them.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``sham trial,'' Specter said last week the House
impeachment managers' ability to prove the charges was hindered
because the Senate wouldn't allow live witness testimony. He also
said he thought there was a lack of relevant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his intentions, Specter said he knew there was
a risk of angering both sides of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done that before,'' he said and laughed. Other letter
writers praised Specter for not attacking Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for wrapping up this silly thing called an
impeachment, it was really a witch hunt,'' wrote Tom Brian, of
Osceola, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Several letter writers said they thought Specter's position was
cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a spineless wonder you are,'' wrote Sonja R. Hassinger,
of Milton Pennsylvania. ``You are a coward without a conscience.
There was plenty of proof and evidence. I am sorry I ever pulled
the lever below your name and believe me I will never vote for you
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Santorum's office received several hundred
phone calls, letters and faxes, mostly lauding his expected votes
of ``guilty'' on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges,
according to his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calls were 98 percent favorable,'' said Robert Traynham, a
Santorum spokesman. ``They were very proud of their senator.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more than 1,000 letters posted on the website to
Santorum, R-Pa., reflected a slightly more mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your brave and honest votes on the impeachment
measures,'' wrote Patricia Kottke, of Fogelsville, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, you sold out to the right wing zealots you think will
help elect you in 2000,'' wrote Scott T. Redman, of Springdale,
Pennsylvania. ``You won't have my vote.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Israeli guards opened fire on Wednesday on dozens of
Kurds trying to occupy the Israeli Consulate here, killing three
people and wounding 16 in the worst violence since Europewide
protests erupted over the capture of a rebel Kurdish leader.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shooting began after about 55 Kurds tried to
enter the consulate in a tranquil Berlin suburb. The Kurds
apparently chose their target in response to rumors that the
Israeli secret service, Mossad, had played a role in Turkey's
capture of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in Tel Aviv
on Wednesday that the guards had fired in self-defense after Kurds
brandishing hammers and clubs entered the Berlin consulate. He
denied any Israeli role in Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not cooperate with any element in Ocalan's capture,''
Netanyahu said. ``We have to make this clear and emphasize this
because this is the reality and this is the truth.'' Israel, which
has a security cooperation agreement with Turkey, was the object of
``false accusations,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the shootings, blood from the wounded lay
spattered on freshly fallen snow in a wide area around the Israeli
consulate. Police officers had encircled two groups of shivering
Kurds, numbering about 30 in all, and refused to let reporters
speak to them on the grounds that they were ``under arrest.'' The
entire area was cordoned off, and helicopters circled over the
four-story consulate building near the Grunewald, a forest in the
western part of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The consul, Miriam Shomrat, was not in the building, but another
Israeli woman was briefly held by the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, whose followers have waged a long separatist war in
southeastern Turkey in which more than 30,000 people have died, was
seized in Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday in circumstances that remain
murky. Turkish security agents then flew him to Turkey where he
faces a possible death sentence on charges including treason and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The killings came in a second day of widespread Kurdish protests
initially focused on Kenyan and Greek missions in Europe. Ocalan
was arrested after leaving the Greek embassy in Nairobi, a sequence
of events that apparently led many Kurds to believe he had been
betrayed by the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television showing film on Wednesday of Ocalan being led
onto a small plane, handcuffed and blindfolded. After being
handcuffed to a seat, his blindfold was removed, revealing his
sweat-drenched face. Later an unsteady and apparently drowsy Ocalan
was shown being led to a bed as commandos gave each other high
fives.
</P>
<P>
   The swift violence of the Israeli response stood in sharp
contrast to the restraint of other embassies. ``Our people have
standing orders to prevent, with force if necessary, including by
opening fire, any attempt to take hostages and to defend
themselves,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   Avigdor Kahlani, the Israeli minister of public security, said
there were three Israeli guards at the consulate and accused German
authorities of exposing them through incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were supposed to do the work from Germany didn't do
their job,'' he said. ``The guards fired first in the air and then
fired to hit in order to save themselves and defend the
consulate.''
</P>
<P>
   A German police spokesman, Norbert Gunckel, said there were two
German police officers outside the consulate at the time the
protest began. He did not explain why protection was so light or
comment on the response of the two officers. ``There was a clash,
and several shots were fired,'' Gunckel said, but he declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   All Israeli embassies in Europe were ordered closed for the day,
and the United States urged Americans abroad to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the Kurdish protesters had no guns. Lukas
Billinski, who was walking his dog in the area, said he heard nine
shots inside the consulate building, followed by five more a little
later.
</P>
<P>
   There is intense debate in Germany over the large number of
foreigners here, and the violence on Thursday seemed certain to
feed a growing uneasiness. Gerhard Schroeder, the chancellor, said
after the shooting that Kurds who did not respect the law would be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those living here do not respect the law, they will have to
leave the country,'' Schroeder, a Social Democrat, said in a
statement reminiscent of the position of the Christian Democratic
government he replaced three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several German cities _ including Bonn, Leipzig, Stuttgart,
Frankfurt and Cologne _ were hit by Kurdish protests on Tuesday.
These incidents abated on Wednesday, but about 15 Kurds broke into
the offices of the Social Democratic Party in Hamburg, taking a
staff member hostage. A mosque and a Turkish restaurant in Hamburg
were also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No constitutional state can just wait and watch a civil war
being implanted into its midst by a foreign minority,'' declared an
editorial in the conservative newspaper Die Welt. ``This experience
comes in time to give us a lesson in the political naivete of an
undifferentiated citizenship law.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500,000 Kurds live in Germany and more than two million
Turks, by far the largest such populations in Europe. Schroeder has
proposed new legislation that would make it easier for them and
other foreigners to become German citizens.

   Elsewhere in Europe, most of the protests against more than 20
Greek and Kenyan missions ended. But in London, Kurds inside the
Greek embassy said they were on hunger strike and would set
themselves on fire if the police stormed the building.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, about 60 protesters continued to hold a
policeman at the Greek Consulate in Zurich, and the Greek Embassy
in Bern remained occupied by Kurds. In Sydney and Melbourne,
Australia, demonstrators and police officers clashed and 65 Kurds
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 Kurds today forced their way into the Geneva
headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
and left about three hours later after a spokesman for the agency
read a statement saying that the United Nations should send a
mission to examine the plight of the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa about 200 Kurdish protesters rushed a police barricade
in front of the Turkish Embassy, hurling rocks, snowballs, ice and
homemade gasoline bombs and burning Greek and United States flags.
The police retaliated with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20 million Kurds worldwide, and many of
those living in Turkey and neighboring countries have suffered
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan has used violent guerrilla methods over the last 14 years
to pursue a goal of Kurdish self-rule and civil rights in Turkey.
He has been met with a violent Turkish response, including
documented torture of Kurdish guerrilla suspects and secret trials
by state security courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bulent Ecevit, the Turkish prime minister, said on Wednesday
that Ocalan, who was being held in a prison on Imraili island in
the Sea of Marmara, would be given a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups, including Amnesty International,
expressed concerns over Ocalan's fate, and Ocalan's lawyers were
not allowed to enter Turkey on Wednesday after traveling from the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ocalan was first arrested in Italy last year, European
governments have been at a loss as to what to do, torn between
their rejection of the Kurdish movement's methods and their
abhorrence of the Turkish government's frequent flouting of human
rights in fighting the Kurds.

<P>
   The result has been confusion and buck passing. ``The reality is
that the Kurds are a nation, the Kurdish Workers Party is a party,
and the European Union is neither one nor the other,'' wrote Boris
Bianchieri, a former Italian diplomat, in the Turin daily La
Stampa. ``Maybe the Kurdish problem is insoluble. But Europe has
neither the courage to face up to it nor to deny its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurds are not recognized as a minority in Turkey, a status that
would give them the right to teach in their own language. Turkish
sensitivity to the issue is extreme. One factor in the discussion
of possible independence for the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo has
been the fear of opening a Pandora's box in which Kurdish demands
for a state would figure prominently, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the United States had expressed quiet
support for Ocalan's arrest and his handover to Turkey, a pivotal
NATO ally and an important base for American air patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish daily Yeni Yuzyil said on Thursday that Washington
had helped the Turkish government seize Ocalan in return for its
rejection of Iraqi demands to end American use of Turkish bases for
air missions over Iraq. But the Clinton administration has denied
any direct involvement in his arrest in Kenya.

PAKISTANI MILITARY COURTS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that special military courts and their recent executions of two men
were unconstitutional, scoring a victory for an independent
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The military courts were established last December in the port
town of Karachi to combat violence and were run by military
officers, not judges. The courts were under the command of the
federal government, and decisions could not be appealed to civilian
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Two men have been hanged by the courts, and a 13-year-old boy
was ordered to die for murder, but he was later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates hailed the unanimous court ruling, saying
it upholds the independence of Pakistan's judiciary, and blocks the
government's attempt to create a ``parallel justice system'' run by
the army that was not answerable to the Supreme Court. The decision
also spares 14 people facing death sentences ordered by the
now-illegal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders also praised the decision, saying it knocks
down a government effort to centralize power and limit rights.
Besides establishing military courts, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
government is lobbying for ``sharia,'' or Islamic law. It was
recently accused of attacking press freedom by withholding
newsprint and serving crippling tax notices on a newspaper chain
that did not obey demands to fire critical journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a humiliating defeat for the government,'' said Aitzaz
Ahsan, the lead attorney who argued against military courts, and
Senate president of the opposition Pakistan People's Party. ``The
government wanted to employ courts subordinate to itself to
victimize its political opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some independent lawyers disagreed, however, saying that even
though military courts were the wrong answer, the government's
intention was to suppress spiraling lawlessness, not peaceful
political dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally wrong to say it was directed against political
opponents,'' said Muhammad Bilal, chairman of the international
relations committee of the Pakistan Bar Council. ``Constitutionally
it's hard to support'' military courts, ``but with crime so bad, it
may have seemed necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling nullifies the military courts and transfers
their cases to special antiterrorism courts the government created
in 1997, but which remain under the Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court instructed antiterrorism courts to decide cases and appeals
within seven days, and called on the military to assist by
protecting witnesses or conducting investigations if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The government had argued that military courts were needed,
because other courts were not acting quickly enough. The government
also said crime dropped in Karachi after the courts were
established. They were under orders to decide cases within three
days. That was later extended to eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Political and sectarian murders in Karachi are estimated to have
hit 1,000 annually over the last three years. Battles are being
waged in Karachi between rival factions of the Muttaheda Qami
Movement, a small ethnic political party. Tensions also run high
between Urdu-speaking Muttaheda Qami Movement loyalists who came to
Karachi after partition from India and indigenous Sindhi-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling should end ``efforts to solve political problems
through instant justice, short-circuiting due process,'' said I.A.
Rehman, director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   By dispensing summary justice, the government was ignoring the
need to reform the police, the investigative process and judiciary
itself, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their faults, military courts were preferable to
government-sponsored killings, some lawyers noted. ``Under Benazir
Bhutto, the government dealt with crime by killing suspects during
so-called investigations,'' said Raja Imran Aziz, a High Court
advocate in Rawalpindi, echoing a complaint by human rights
activists about the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Mohammad Chaudhry Farooq said in an interview
that he did not consider the ruling a loss, because the Supreme
Court had shored up the resources and responsibilities of the
antiterrorism courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, the Supreme Court has undertaken the
responsibility to insure terrorism is eliminated in this country,
and people involved in terrorism are suitably dealt with,'' Farooq
said. ``I don't see any element of defeat.''

AMERICAN, PILOTS DISPUTE COSTS OF SICKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines presented its bill for damages to a U.S.
District Court judge in Dallas Wednesday, contending that its
revenues fell $58.7 million short of projections while the
airline's pilots continued their sickout in defiance of the judge's
order.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Pilots Association, which has already put $10 million
on deposit with the court, questioned the accounting and asked for
three months to analyze it. The judge, Joe Kendall, gave the union
until April 12.
</P>
<P>
   The union also agreed to an extension of the judge's temporary
restraining order against the sickout until May 10, with a hearing
scheduled for May 8 on whether that should be turned into a
permanent injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two parties continued negotiations on the
underlying issue: how pilots should be paid while American _ a
subsidiary of AMR Corp. _ integrates into its system Reno Air,
which it bought in December. Both sides said they were making some
progress on peripheral issues, but none at all on the union's main
demand that pay scales should be adjusted retroactive to Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who also demanded a $10,000 check from the union's
president, scolded him in court. ``I meant what I said, when I said
you would pay for what you broke,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The union has about $38 million in assets, counting the $10
million already on deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Richard LaVoy, the union president, said, ``We're going to
examine their methodology. It wasn't intuitive the way they did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy said he suspected that the airline canceled the least
profitable flights. American said it canceled about 6,600 flights
during the 10-day dispute. More than half those flights were
canceled during the three and a half days after the judge ordered
the pilots who called in sick to go back to work, but before most
of them did so.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it had not included extra overtime costs and
that its estimate was ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Railway Labor Act, which governs American's
relationship with the union, the dispute could end up in mediation
or arbitration. LaVoy said the union's intention was to reach a
negotiated settlement, but he complained that as far as its demand
that American should have immediately integrated the pilot lists,
at least for pay purposes, ``they don't even want to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Chiames, a spokesman for American, replied that such
an instant integration had ``never been done before.'' If the union
could dictate such terms, he said, ``that would essentially
eliminate our ability to pursue another transaction in the future,
should there be consolidation in the industry.''

TEXAS LAWMAKERS SEEK LOBBYIST FOR MILITARY AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an effort to keep military installations in
Texas, two lawmakers on Wednesday proposed hiring a lobbyist in
Washington to keep track of defense-related issues for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, and Rep. Judy Hawley,
D-Portland, proposed legislation that would hire the lobbyist and
expand the responsibilities of the state's Office of Defense
Affairs to make it the focal point for coordinating all matters
that affect the defense community in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are seeking $20 million over the next two years to pay
for the legislation, including the lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley said Texas needs a lobbyist in Washington to make sure
the state gets the most updated information about issues involving
the military and defense industry. The idea is to help Texas
communities avoid additional base closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to make sure all the communities that have
military interests in Texas are as competitive as they can possible
be when we're looking at (future) BRAC closures and that we are as
militarily aware as possible we can be,'' she said, referring to
the Base Closure and Realignment Commission, commonly known as
BRAC.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley said the military industry is worth some $37 billion to
the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would do anything to attract an industry that size to your
state,'' Hawley said. ``It's a very, very huge part of our economic
development in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   State Reps. Ruth Jones McClendon and Juan Solis, both Democrats
of San Antonio, expressed support for the legislation at a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember all too well being in city council on June 12,
1995, when we heard about the first round of closures (involving)
Kelly Air Force Base,'' Solis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved and acted immediately. But if we had had this
organization in place it would have been a lot different, I think.
We would have been better prepared, and I believe we would have
transitioned faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we start to think together as a
state,'' Solis said. ``In the past we made decisions in San Antonio
for ourselves, but we should no longer think like that but rather
as a whole state. I think the message has to be sent to Washington
that we're not ready to sacrifice our industry or our military
readiness for a few savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis said the money would fund efforts to keep existing
military installations, pay for the lobbyist and help fund some
transitional programs for communities affected by base closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more like preventive medicine,'' he said.

<P>
   BOSTON _ They call Louisburg Square (pronounced Lewisburg,
please, not Loueeburg) the most prestigious property, the most
exclusive enclave, the most treasured trophy address in Boston.
They call it the heart of Beacon Hill, that slope of brick-paved,
gas-lighted lanes long reputed to be a bastion of Boston
Brahminism.
</P>
<P>
   But peep into the townhouses here _ or rather, into their
real-estate records _ and Louisburg Square suddenly comes to
represent the exact opposite of Olde Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For on the little square where families like Cabot and Appleton
dominated a generation ago, a transformation is now complete: from
old Anglo to new ethnic names; from shabby gentility to $3-million
price tags on townhouses, but most important, from descendants of
old shipping and merchant banking fortunes that defined Boston for
generations to largely self-made go-getters who amassed their money
in the new high-tech, financial and other industries that are
reinventing the city.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard on Louisburg Square mirrors similar
transitions elsewhere from blue blood to new blood, from old money
to new money, urban scholars say, as in Pacific Heights in San
Francisco, or, to a lesser extent, Society Hill in Philadelphia or
the lakeside Gold Coast in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call it turbo-gentrification,'' sociologist Alan
Wolfe said, borrowing from a new book on the super-charged economy,
``Turbo-Capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But other scholars and participants describe it instead as a
sort of de-gentrification: a process in which meritocracy, or
marketocracy, periodically triumphs over breeding in the forming of
an elite. For a city's own good, if it wants to avoid economic
atrophy, the new money had better triumph, historians say.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``Young people and people with ideas and people who
like the tumble and tide are attracted to Boston and San Francisco
and Chicago and New York'' and a few other spots, said Kenneth T.
Jackson, an urban historian at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that St. Louis, New Orleans, maybe in some ways
Memphis, are cities that had an older elite that wasn't as open to
new people, and I think all those cities suffered a little bit,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, the effect of the old money's accession to new
is felt in subtle ways: the clutter of construction trash bins and
trucks on Beacon Hill and in the tony Back Bay, as new owners spend
millions more on interior renovations; the increasingly diverse
trustees of the Boston Symphony Orchestra or the Museum of Fine
Arts; in talk of the city's economic and cultural vibrancy and a
sense that the old Brahmin monopoly on financial and social power,
like the Irish monopoly on political power, has given way to
something more open and complex.
</P>
<P>
   On Louisburg Square the change comes into clear relief. These
days, neighbors say, they cannot name a full-blown Brahmin left in
residence. The current owners of the 27 townhouses include Chris
Gabrieli, a son of immigrants who made millions in software and is
now a venture capitalist; Robin Cook, a poor boy from Queens, N.Y.,
who bought his place after writing ``Coma''; Peter Lynch, the
Fidelity investment guru; Alan Friedberg, retired chairman of Loews
Theatres; Thomas Stemberg, who built the Staples office supply
chain; and Amos Hostetter, who built Continental Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new residents are ensconced not only in their own
paneled libraries but in philanthropic activities once the province
of Brahmins.
</P>
<P>
   While Hostetter would not talk about it, he is widely said to be
about to start the biggest private foundation in Boston. Gabrieli
has a family foundation and oversees a public-policy think tank.
Lynch announced this week that he and his wife were giving $10
million to Boston College's school of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it used to be, when your name had to be
something and your background had to be something,'' said
Friedberg, the retired Loews chairman, who serves on several
boards. ``Now it's more a question of, are you a valuable asset?
Not just in terms of money, but are you a straight shooter, are you
willing to roll up your sleeves and work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the game rules have changed. It's not about whether
you have the right ancestors, it's who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Who they are also affects to some extent how they direct their
money, Gabrieli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, it's somewhat less toward traditional culture
and arts _ though that's not to say there's no giving there, there
is _ and more heavily toward education and opportunity,'' he said.
``It's very entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people, myself included, are entrepreneurs. The pitch
that XYZ museum has been around forever and deserves a new
generation of stewards is less appealing _ not that it should be,
because those are great institutions _ but it's less appealing
than, `Here's a new idea that could really transform something and
really needs some drive behind it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The social transformation of Louisburg Square began to take on
steam in the late 1970s, said Thomas Townsend, a real-estate broker
and encyclopedic authority on the Hill. Old Brahmins' departures
and deaths opened the way to owners with a new kind of money _ a
dynamic cash crop very different from the long-husbanded fortunes
from shipping and foreign trade and banking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of the century, comes this latest change: a
combination of strong economy and restored city chic that is making
an impeccably preserved, conveniently walkable, tight-community
spot like Beacon Hill so hot that a former carriage house is on
sale here for nearly $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1970 the townhouses sold for around $100,000. The
first Beacon Hill sale to crack $1 million came in 1984 on
Louisburg Square, realtors say. Though a handful of more modest
rental units and condominiums remain, recent sales have exceeded $3
million and even $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   On ``the Hill,'' where the sweep of historical memory spans the
two centuries since it was built up by developers who also sliced
off its top, the influx of mega-rich appears to evoke mixed
feelings. No one seems to mourn the isolationist side of the
Brahmin reign, or the crumbling Boston of two or three decades ago
that brought prices so low back then and sent families fleeing to
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   And the strong sense of history prompts obvious parallels: Karen
Cord Taylor, editor and publisher of the Beacon Hill Times, pointed
out that Charles Bulfinch, the famed architect and developer whose
gems, like the State House, crown Beacon Hill, was something like
the Donald Trump of his day. And who were the original Beacon Hill
residents but entrepreneurs who happened to be in shipping and
import-export and banking rather than technology and media?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the nouveaux riches and arrivistes of their day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrival of this new wave is bringing some
consternation mixed in with the welcome for billionaire
block-busters.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lee, scion of an old Brahmin family and longtime resident
of a house that looks out on Louisburg Square but is not
technically part of it, said that many of the new rich residents
are laudably generous to community causes like the Friends of the
Public Garden, which he heads. But he worries, he said, that
``Money is a terrible destroyer of architecture. Poverty is a great
preserver.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I do deplore is that an awful lot of people have
moved into houses on Louisburg Square and elsewhere and gutted
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses may have needed gutting, commented Cook, the
novelist, who discovered the dirty little secret of Louisburg
Square when he moved in: The houses were largely built `on spec`
rather than by owners, and their grandeur sometimes hides
``pathetic'' construction flaws that require fixes like new
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lee and others are concerned about architectural
treasures being thrown out with the 19th-century heating systems.
And there seems an element of psychological discomfort as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes am a little appalled to look out and realize three
or four billionaires are living on Louisburg Square, let alone
millionaires,'' he said, sounding dryly amused. One recent
Christmas, he said, he saw a Porsche with a fat red ribbon around
it parked on the square _ ``probably a stocking present.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nonetheless, perhaps the most striking thing about the square's
social transformation is that, aside from the fanciness of the cars
parked on the dedicated spots that other Beacon Hill residents
would kill for, its looks have changed virtually not at all,
preserved under glass by powerful rules and even more powerful
public sentiment that Beacon Hill's beauty lies in its historical
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Its London-style little park, locked to all but the residents
who hold the keys, seems as unchanging as the houses' understatedly
grand facades. The replacement of the octogenarian residents who
dominated 20 years ago by younger mega-rich, Cook said, has meant a
new collective willingness to fix the lawn and the fence and the
road but not to make any major changes _ such as putting in the
fountain he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   For the octogenarians, he said, ``Spending more than $10 was
anathema.'' Now, ``People are probably willing to spend money but
everyone's a boss. So they don't want the fountain unless it's the
way they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Lee said, the new mega-rich of Louisburg Square are
not really a change, either, but only the continuation of a cycle:
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' he said, ``class in America has always been
wealth. In Boston, it got to be a little bit more than that because
Bostonians invest their money very prudently and lived simply and
therefore could pass it along from generation to generation. `
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, `All these things are only a matter of time. It
only takes two generations to get smug.`

WITH LOSS LIKELY, TALK OF NEW NEC SHAKE-UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ NEC Corp. of Japan, the world's second-largest maker of
computer chips, may be poised for a further board room shake-up
less than four months after the company forced its prominent
chairman out in the wake of a military-procurement scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The company refused to comment on reports in three Japanese
newspapers Wednesday that Hisashi Kaneko, its president, was on his
way out as NEC prepares to announce losses of more than 100 billion
yen, or $847 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it did little to quell speculation that change was afoot in
the executive suite and that Koji Nishigaki, the executive vice
president in charge of selling the company's computer
systems-integration business, would most likely be Kaneko's
successor as president.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, though, seemed more excited by the prospect that
Hajime Sasaki, executive vice president for NEC's semiconductor
operations and a darling of foreign investors, would become
chairman, a post that has been vacant since Tadahiro Sekimoto
resigned in October.
</P>
<P>
   Sekimoto lent influence and force to the chairman's job, which
is typically a largely ceremonial role here while decision-making
resides with the president. This sort of vigorous chairmanship
would most likely continue under Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   He ran NEC's U.S. operations and is considered attuned to the
international demands of the business, including the importance of
the cost of capital and of strategic planning, concepts that do not
always seem foremost in mind for Japanese executives.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the embattled semiconductor business, one that has
been roiled worldwide by falling chip prices, Sasaki won praise for
containing a potential disaster. While NEC has lost money on
semiconductor operations, the scale of the losses are smaller than
those of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to release revised estimates of its
losses in the fiscal year that ends on March 31. In October, NEC
forecast a loss of 35 billion yen, but the stronger yen and the
continued erosion of profitability in the
telecommunications-equipment and semiconductor markets have no
doubt carved a deeper hole in its bottom line since then.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the expected loss, Moody's Investors Service said
Friday that it was reviewing its rating on the company's senior
unsecured debt, which is now at A3, four notches above junk status
and just below that of a medium-investment-grade bond.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its rivals Toshiba and Hitachi, NEC has yet to announce
plans to overhaul its business, but analysts increasingly are
confident that it has a restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about restructuring in a way that, in my
experience, is quite new for NEC,'' said Scott Foster, a
high-technology industry analyst at ING Barings here, who met with
several NEC executives last week.
</P>
<P>
   The company has the weakest balance sheet of Japan's diversified
high-technology giants, with its net debt _ the liabilities that
would be left if the company spent all available cash to retire
debt _ exceeding equity by 187 percent. The Toshiba Corp., which
already has embarked on a wide-ranging reorganization of its
operations, has net debt that exceeds its equity by 142.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said the company already had begun to aggressively
address the problems in its Packard Bell subsidiary by cutting
excess capacity, contracting some manufacturing to Taiwan, laying
off workers and reducing the number of models of personal computers
it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell's woes were among the factors leading to Sekimoto's
departure. NEC has sunk at least $1.8 billion into Packard Bell,
whose share of the personal computer market has fallen drastically
since the Japanese company made its first investment in the
American-based producer in 1995.

 &HT;    INS TO HIRE 1,600 NEW AGENTS, INSPECTORS
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days after a congressman called for her dismissal,
Immigration and Naturalization Services Commissioner Doris Meissner
announced Wednesday 1,600 new border patrol agents and immigration
inspectors will be hired throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   INS plans to increase the number of border agents and inspectors
to handle a rise in the number of immigrants. The new positions are
part of the $3.9 billion INS budget that went into effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these deployments, the INS will continue to make great
strides in enforcing U.S. borders,'' Meissner said, later adding
that she does not plan to resign. ``The Clinton Administration is
committed to continued strengthening of our enforcement
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Just Thursday, Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas, and
chairman of the House Immigration subcommittee, sent a letter to
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno criticizing the INS's performance
and asking that Meissner be replaced if changes aren't made
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the Feb. 11 letter, Smith chided INS officials after reading
a newspaper article that said INS planned to release undocumented
immigrants with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, a top priority of the INS should be the strict
enforcement of the laws pertaining to criminal aliens,'' Smith said
in the letter. ``If the INS fails in this critical mission, it is
endangering the safety of countless citizens throughout the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner on Wednesday said the INS had not released any
undocumented immigrants with criminal records and is still
considering what to do with the criminal immigrants in their
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal Meissner discussed Wednesday, the INS will
add:
</P>
<P>
   1,000 new border patrol agents, mostly to the southwest border.
Texas will receive 485 agents, Arizona 395, California 83, and New
Mexico 15. Another 22 agents will be sent to three locations along
the U.S.-Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   100 new immigration inspectors to airports within the U.S. and
overseas affected by high immigrant traffic. The INS hopes the new
additions will cut passenger processing time to under 45 minutes.
Atlanta and Miami are among the airports targeted to receive new
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   300 immigration workers to INS Service centers to reduce the
backlog of citizenship applications in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami,
New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas and Houston. The
current process to become a U.S. citizen takes 15 months, but the
increased positions should help reduce the time to six months,
Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 300 new positions dedicated to the citizenship caseload
will help deliver better customer service to our nation's legal
immigrants,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   90 detention and deportation employees to manage 400 new beds at
Port Isabel, Texas, and 11 new workers to support an increase of
126 juvenile beds.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Congress approved $171 million for the INS
naturalization program. The INS also plans to use an additional $5
million to transfer paper records to electronic databases.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith did not rescind his request for Meissner's
dismissal, he welcomed the new jobs Wednesday, saying the proposal
fulfilled a congressional priority: ``I am hopeful that now the
agency will focus on fixing its mismanagement of handling criminal
aliens to make the best use of its budget.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ form and fit?''
</P>
<P>
   At Lawrence Livermore's National Ignition Facility, money is
being spent to use 192 lasers to explore the feasibility of pure
fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Some call the program ``gold-plated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know that the Stockpile Stewardship may well
be over-funded, but they're biting their tongues because they like
the (testing) moratorium,'' said Michael Krepon, president of the
arms-researching Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This test ban treaty is so important that a lot of people, me
included, are willing to get out the wallets,'' Krepon said. Hawks
insist that Stockpile Stewardship is simply the labs' reward for
forsaking testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an out-and-out bribe,'' said Frank Gaffney, the director
of the Center for Security Policy. ``The only hope that the
administration has is if the labs continue to stay bought. If
anybody speaks up, this treaty is toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Doves, on the other hand, oppose the plan because it keeps the
nuclear weapons assembly line in place and gives designers new
tools _ the supercomputers and laser device _ that will tempt them
to make the next generation of thermonuclear monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need weapons designers,'' said Hisham Zerriffi, a
project scientist at the Institute for Energy and Environmental
Research. ``All you need is engineers who can replace the old
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're setting up some sort of virtual arms race....Some
country is going to go back to the old way of building more weapons
out of fear of falling too far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative and liberal critics converge on their criticism
of the science on which the program relies.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, America maintained a mastery over its nuclear
weapons with continued refinements that were always double-checked
with test explosions, turning desert sand to glass, obliterating
Pacific atolls and finally moving underground in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   An intercontinental ballistic missile, for instance, might be
plucked randomly from its silo. The missile might be fired at a
benign ocean target after the warhead was taken out. The warhead
would be dissected to figure out how its steels, aluminums and
ceramics had aged, then reassembled and detonated at the Nevada
Test Site.
</P>
<P>
   All those warhead checks continue under the Stockpile
Stewardship Program, except for the underground explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note that while the weapons are not new, some of their
parts are. The parts are made differently today because, for
instance, the methods used at the defunct Rocky Flats nuclear
trigger factory were environmental disasters. That and age cause
subtle variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is pretty good for the next week, the next year or
the next month,'' said Baker Spring, a national security analyst
for the Heritage Foundation. ``The issue is whether it's going to
be good 10 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doves advocate scrapping weapons when signs of decay
appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that you will make changes that create an
inoperable weapon or a more volatile weapon,'' said Ray Kidder, a
retired physicist who designed nuclear weapons at Lawrence
Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism underestimates the value of the tools at the
disposal of the weapons labs, defenders of the program say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can test them just fine in the computer,'' said Michael
Hynes, a physicist with nuclear testing experience who studies
research and development management for the Rand Corp. think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all I've talked (about) with my designer friends, there's
about 99 percent confidence that the computers will be able to do
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Reis at the Energy Department conceded that no one can
be absolutely certain it will work.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that even live tests in the past didn't
simulate all the factors that a warhead would face in combat.
Instead of launching an armed missile from its silo into suborbital
flight to see whether it would destroy a target thousands of miles
away, for instance, the elements of the weapons were tested
separately.
</P>
<P>
   That did not prompt a wave of concern that America's nukes might
be unreliable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the limits of virtual world testing...'' Reis
conceded. But he added: ``We think the fixes will be something we
can understand.''

   Release of the new version of Lotus Development Corp.'s flagship
Notes and Domino software has been delayed again because of bugs in
the product.
</P>
<P>
   The delay contradicts a pledge at last month's Lotusphere trade
show, where Lotus CEO Jeff Papows promised to have the software
ready this month. Instead, the product, called Version R5, won't
ship until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has resulted from the realization that there were more bugs
to fix,'' said Lotus spokesman Paul Labelle. Trial versions of
Version R5 have been distributed to thousands of corporate computer
administrators, said Labelle, and they found some unexpected
problems which must be repaired before shipping. Labelle said that
Notes and Domino should achieve ``virtual zero bug status'' next
week, meaning it should be free of all serious bugs. It will then
take several more weeks to produce copies for shipment to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Version R5 of Notes and Domino are seen as vital for the future
of Lotus, a Cambridge, Mass. subsidiary of IBM Corp. Notes and
Domino are the leading brands of ``groupware,'' software that runs
on powerful server computers to help large groups of workers
collaborate on projects. Rival software company Microsoft Corp. has
launched an aggressive campaign to win this market with its own
groupware product, called Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said for delaying the release just to
ensure a better-performing product,'' said Mike Comiskey,
collaborative computing analyst at International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass.. ``I don't think that's going to be that
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But some customers aren't pleased. Rushi Shah, system
administrator for a nonprofit agency in McLean, Va., thinks Lotus
knew all along that the product would be late, and should have told
customers sooner. ``All this could have been avoided if they'd just
said it's going to be out at the end of March,'' said Shah. ``I've
got a server that's on order and it's going to be sitting there for
a month doing nothing.''

UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS `VIRTUAL' TESTS OF AGING NUKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A third of a billion dollars pours into
Kansas City's AlliedSignal plant yearly to ponder explosive
riddles:
</P>
<P>
   What does time do to the fuse of a B61-7 warhead? How does the
passing of years in a North Dakota missile silo affect the radar of
a nuclear weapon made in the Johnson administration?
</P>
<P>
   If they were uncorked on a future enemy, would they be duds? Or
worse, could they blow on their own?
</P>
<P>
   Experience suggests no problems. Decades of exploding America's
nukes in tests hints only at reliability, however horrific.
</P>
<P>
   But those real-world tests have stopped. And one of the new
questions is whether the chaos of a nuclear explosion can be
captured in even the world's most dazzling computers.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Stockpile Stewardship Program is a $4.5 billion
annual gamble that it can. The program _ an amalgam of scientists,
engineers, supercomputers and lasers scattered across the country _
hopes to find out what old age does to The Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Few would quibble with the need to constantly check that the
nuclear stockpile is in working order, to replace parts made
brittle by heat, moisture and the passing of time.
</P>
<P>
   But hawks and doves alike are edgy about what they see as the
country's new half-in, half-out approach to the nuclear weapons
business. They argue that in its desire to win Senate ratification
of a key arms treaty, the Clinton administration settled on a plan
that invites dangerously bad science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual'' detonations in a supercomputer cannot replace the
real thing, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger here is that they will make a mistake somewhere
along the line and the computer won't catch it,'' said Jonathan
Katz, a physicist who consults for the Defense Department on
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature is more clever than scientists,'' Katz said. ``Without
experiments, you always get it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration defends Stockpile Stewardship as the least
risky way for America to deal with its nuclear weapons now that the
arms race has been won.
</P>
<P>
   First, its defenders say the program clears the way for _ is, in
fact, vital to _ the nation's ratification of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the administration says that critics underestimate the
power of teaming past underground testing data with savvy
scientists and computing power undreamed of just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, officials stress that if those scientists begin to feel
uneasy about vouching for the weapons, the president would withdraw
from the test ban treaty and that the secretaries of energy and
defense could effectively yank the plug on the computer modeling
system if they lost confidence in it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Nevada Test Site, the proving ground for America's
warheads, is kept in working order so underground testing could
resume on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've made, in a sense, the health of the stockpile a supreme
national interest,'' said Victor Reis, the Energy Department's
assistant secretary for defense programs. ``We believe it's working
now and that it will continue to work.''
The last underground nuclear test _ code-named ``Divider'' and
described by the Department of Defense only as ``less than 20
kilotons'' _ took place Sept. 23, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the new energy secretary, Hazel O'Leary, held a
two-day meeting in Washington to discuss the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. She called together much of America's nuclear brain trust _
from the Pentagon, from the Energy Department, from the Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore and Sandia national laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of the weapons labs had the most at stake, but
perhaps the strongest trump card.
</P>
<P>
   The labs risked losing what had been their mission for the
previous half-century _ the design and manufacture of nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   If the lab directors publicly opposed the test ban, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff would follow. The joint chiefs' opposition, in
turn, would doom the treaty in the U.S. Senate, where ratification
is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Frank von Hippel, who was then assistant director for national
security in the White House Office of Science and Technology, said
the labs were offered Stockpile Stewardship. The plan promised a
continued payroll, and the kind of high-tech goodies needed to
tempt bright young minds to work on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal between the Clinton administration and the weapons
labs was that the weapons labs would only support a test ban if
they were given as much money for not testing the weapons as they
got for testing them,'' said von Hippel, who teaches physics at
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the new approach don't recall such an explicit
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``(O'Leary) asked the laboratory people there, specifically,
could they maintain the stockpile basically without testing,''
recalled Reis, who is in charge of the Energy Department's nuclear
warhead monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reaction was...`we would certainly give it a try,' but
that it might very well cost more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockpile Stewardship outfits the labs with the world's fastest
computers. A computer capable of modeling a nuclear detonation is
due to crank up by 2004, when about half the country's physicists
with nuclear testing experience will have retired.
</P>
<P>
   Already in Kansas City, a smaller but still brawny supercomputer
is solving manufacturing problems that had frustrated engineers for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The AlliedSignal work force in Kansas City is down by about a
fourth, to about 3,000, since 1997, but the supercomputer delivered
in November gives the engineers here an unrivaled tool for solving
manufacturing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might use the computer to study what happens if you move a
part,'' said Gayle Brace, a manager at the plant. ``Does it improve
the weapon system's reliability? What does it do to form and fit?''

KANSAS CITY, LIKE RUST BELT CITIES, ENJOYING A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For a long time, no city wanted to be
associated with the ``Rust Belt,'' identified for decades with some
of the nation's worst economic and demographic trends.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City finds the Rust Belt pretty good company
following a report from the U.S. Census Bureau that says Rust Belt
cities are ``comeback cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is down. Welfare is down. Crime is down.
Construction is up. And population is up or stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Kansas City to me,'' said Frank Lenk, director
of research services for the Mid-America Regional Council, which
tracks the Kansas City area's performance.
</P>
<P>
   While the census report didn't include Kansas City because of a
statistical quirk, one of the bureau's chief analysts said this
region fit into the Rust Belt peripherally and fit with its
recovery generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're similar in what they're going through in the '90s,''
said Glenn King, chief of the census statistical branch that put
out Tuesday's study.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics from the census' recent State and Metropolitan
Area Data Book show Kansas City has:
</P>
<P>
   A population growth rate that is one-third higher than the
1980s, including a projected increase in the city of Kansas City
for the first time since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   A pace of housing construction that by 1997 already surpassed
the 1980s in terms of total building permit units.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-percent plunge in welfare recipients on the Missouri side
since 1993 and a 41-percent plunge on the Kansas side since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A decline by nearly one-quarter in the unemployment rate between
1990 and 1996, and last year the state of Missouri reported the
lowest jobless rate for this area since records were first kept in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   A one-third drop in total violent crime within Kansas City
itself, whose crime rate dwarfs that of the suburbs, since
killings, rapes, assaults and the like peaked in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City resident Yvette Johnson has lived the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the start of this decade, Johnson returned to her
hometown, pregnant with her fourth child. She quit the working
world and went on welfare. She relied on government assistance for
roughly seven years.
</P>
<P>
   When her youngest child reached school age, she decided to sign
up for job training classes and landed a spot at Sprint Corp.'s
long-distance call center in the 18th and Vine historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good not to sit home all day doing nothing,'' Johnson
said Tuesday. ``My children are happy and I'm happy and we can pay
our bills now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rust Belt has no formal boundary. It's typically thought to
stretch from Pennsylvania into Missouri. Cities known for steel and
auto plants such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago and St.
Louis all lost manufacturing jobs during the 1970s, the 1980s and
the first three years of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   So did Kansas City. At the end of the 1980s, with the closing of
General Motors' Leeds assembly plant, Kansas City relinquished its
long-held national perch at No. 3 in automobile assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Rust Belt report, the Census Bureau looked at those
regions that had reversed both population declines and economic
downturns. Kansas City missed making the list because its
metro-area population never stopped growing, unlike its city
population.
</P>
<P>
   The report highlighted Detroit, Cleveland and Louisville among
major metro areas. Detroit has experienced nearly a 5 percent
population increase this decade after falling 2 percent in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   The Rust Belt comeback, the census report observed, has resulted
from today's economic boom and the economic shift from
goods-related jobs to services. The boom has helped the entire
nation. The Rust Belt, for instance, still trails southern Sun Belt
regions in most performance indicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tracking with the national economy now,'' the Census
Bureau's King said of the Rust Belt, ``when they had lagged behind
the national economy in the '80s.''

THE DEFICIT IS DEAD, BUT THE TAXES LIVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) When it comes to budget policy, Uncle Sam plays a
heads-I-win, tails-you-lose game with America's taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of humongous deficits ``as far as the eye could
see'' as the decade dawned justified tax increases as critical to
stanching chronic budgetary hemorrhages.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a great American tradition, and the telephone excise tax
is the granddaddy of all such taxes. It was imposed 101 years ago
to finance the Spanish-American War. The war ended, but the levy
remained as a ``luxury'' tax because only rich people and
businesses had telephones.
</P>
<P>
   It lived on in perpetuity, and the escalation of America's
involvement in Vietnam prompted Washington to boost it from 3
percent to 10 percent to help finance the war effort. The telephone
tax was subsequently scaled back but never repealed, even though it
was a target for elimination occasionally in the '80s. In 1990, it
was made permanent as part of the deficit-reduction arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward eight years to the arrival of the first U.S. budget
surplus in nearly three decades, which has been accompanied by
forecasts of several trillions more in surpluses over the next 15
years. Is anyone proposing repeal of the telephone tax because its
putative purpose as a deficit-cutting tool no longer exists?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the gasoline tax boost legislated in 1993 to help
bring down the deficit? Gas taxes had historically been levied to
raise money to build and maintain roads and bridges for the
motoring public. After the deficit hit a record $290 billion in
fiscal 1992, however, panic hit Washington. The fear of
half-a-trillion-dollar shortfalls by the end of the 1990s led to a
sense of revenue-enhancement urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the federal gasoline tax was boosted a few cents a gallon
to help ameliorate the deficit problem rather than maintain the
highway system. As gasoline prices have fallen to historic lows,
that tax increase has receded from the national consciousness.
Nevertheless, it remains, even though the deficit crisis used to
justify it no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the cheaper gasoline gets, the more it
encourages gas consumption, which increases its revenue-raising
potential. Therefore, it's small wonder nobody in Washington has
stepped forth to advocate repeal of the tax now that the Treasury
expects to be awash in budgetary surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Washington will dole out a lot of cash for highway
work. It will also direct a lot of the gas tax revenue to
pork-barrel transit projects. At the same time, however, a lot of
money will be used to finance budget outlays that have nothing to
do with transportation needs. When this happens, the highway trust
fund will get the same sort of IOU the Social Security trust fund
gets after its surplus revenue is spent on other things.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans don't realize is that the looting of Social
Security surpluses is merely the largest of many such trust-fund
rip-offs. Whereas the trust funds once masked the size of deficits,
they now create surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resulting surplus funds are made possible by revenue
from taxes approved specifically to ease deficits. The deficit is a
thing of the past, they say, but these taxes remain.
</P>
<P>
   Why?

IN A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH, DANISH PHYSICIST SLOWS THE SPEED OF
LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When light travels through empty space, it zips along at a speed
of 186,171 miles a second _ the highest speed anything can attain,
even in principle. A moonbeam takes only a little over one second
to reach Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But a Danish physicist and her team of collaborators have found
a way to slow light down to about 38 miles an hour, a speed
exceeded by a strong bicyclist.
</P>
<P>
   The physics team, headed by Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau, who works
concurrently at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge,
Mass., and at Harvard University, expects soon to slow the pace of
light still further, to a glacial 120 feet an hour _ about the
speed of a tortoise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the speed of light so low we can almost send a
beam into the system, go for a cup of coffee and return in time to
see the light come out,'' Dr. Hau said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement, by Dr. Hau, two Harvard graduate students and
Dr. Steve Harris of Stanford University, is being reported on
Thursday in the journal Nature. Physicists said it had many
potential uses, not only as a tool for studying a very peculiar
state of matter but also in optical computers, high-speed switches,
communications systems, television displays and night-vision
devices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most desirable features of the apparatus that the
researchers built for their work is that it does not transfer heat
energy from the laser light it uses to the ultracold medium on
which the light shines. This could have an important stabilizing
effect on the functioning of optical computers, which operate using
photons of light instead of conventional electrons. A switch using
the system could be made so sensitive that it could be turned on or
off by a single photon of light, Dr. Hau said.
</P>
<P>
   The medium Dr. Hau and her colleagues used in slowing light by a
factor of 20 million was a cluster of atoms called a
``Bose-Einstein condensate'' chilled to a temperature of only
fifty-billionths of a degree above absolute zero. (Absolute zero is
the temperature at which nothing can be colder. It is minus 273.15
degrees on the Celsius scale, minus 459.67 on the Fahrenheit scale
and zero on the Kelvin scale.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hau's group reached an ultralow temperature in stages, using
lasers to slow the atoms in a confined gas and then evaporating
away the warmest remaining atoms. The temperature they attained,
one of the lowest ever reached in a laboratory, was far colder than
anything in nature, including the depths of space.
</P>
<P>
   Bose-Einstein condensates (named for the theorists who predicted
their existence, Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein) were
first prepared in a laboratory four years ago and became the
objects of intense research in the United States and Europe. They
owe their existence to some of the rules of quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which
states that the more accurately a particle's position is known, the
less accurately its momentum can be determined, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a Bose-Einstein condensate, atoms chilled nearly
to absolute zero can barely move at all, and their momentum
therefore approaches zero. But because zero is a very precise
measure of momentum, the uncertainty principle makes the positions
of these atoms very uncertain. In a condensate, as a result, such
atoms are forced to overlap each other and merge into superatoms
sharing the same quantum mechanical ``wave function,'' or
collection of properties.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a superatom, made of a gas of superpositioned sodium
atoms, that provided Dr. Hau and her associates with the optical
molasses they needed to slow light down.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning their project last spring, the group tuned a
``coupling'' laser to the resonance of the atoms in their
condensate, shot the laser into the cold cluster of atoms and
thereby created a quantum mechanical system of which both the laser
light and the condensate of atoms were components. At this stage,
the system was no more transparent than a block of lead, Dr. Hau
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to send a brief pulse of tuned laser light
from a ``probe'' into the condensate, at a right angle to the
coupling laser, in such a way that the laser-condensate system
interacted with the probe laser. Under these conditions about 25
percent of the probe laser light passed through the ``laser-dressed
condensate,'' but at an astonishingly slow speed.
</P>
<P>
   The light that emerged from the apparatus, not visible to the
naked eye, was only 25 percent as strong as the light that entered,
but detectors found that it had roughly the same color.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of light is reduced in any transparent medium,
including water, plastic and diamond. Glass prisms and lenses, for
example, slow light by differing amounts that depend on the
thickness of the glass. The slowing of light causes the bending by
which lenses focus images.
</P>
<P>
   But the reduction of light speed in a laser-coupled
Bose-Einstein condensate works in an entirely different,
quantum-mechanical way. Not only is the speed brought to a crawl,
but the refractive index of the condensate becomes gigantic.
</P>
<P>
   Refractive index is a measure of the degree to which a medium
bends light. The refractive index of the condensate created by Dr.
Hau's group was about 100 trillion times greater than that of a
glass optical fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Hau said it might take 10 years before major
applications were developed, the huge refractive index of the
condensate, which can be precisely controlled, may make it a basis
for ``up shifting'' devices that increase the frequencies of light
beams from the infrared end of the spectrum up through visible
light to ultraviolet. Possible applications include ultrasensitive
night-vision glasses and laser light projectors that could create
very bright projected images.
</P>
<P>
   Laser-condensate combinations may also lead to ultrafast optical
switching systems useful in computers that would operate using one
light beam to control another light beam. Such a system could
function as an optically switched logic gate, replacing the
electronic logic gates computers now use.
</P>
<P>
   Slow light could also be exploited in filtering noise from
optical communications systems, Dr. Hau said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jene Golovchenko, a physics professor at Harvard familiar
with Dr. Hau's work, commented, ``She has worked long and hard on
this, and now she's really hit a home run.''

   JOHANNESBURG _ After two inquests and more than 20 years of
waiting, the family of Stephen Bantu Biko still does not know the
truth of how the antiapartheid activist received the injuries that
killed him.
</P>
<P>
   But for his widow and two sons, the decision late Tuesday night
to deny amnesty to the former Security Branch policemen who
interrogated him in the days before his death in detention came as
a welcome step forward in their search for justice. For the first
time the police version of what happened _ an explanation accepted
by a magistrate in 1977 even though it failed to square with
forensic evidence _ has been officially rejected as false by South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
</P>
<P>
   ``There is emotional satisfaction for the Biko family and the
world at large in having it known that the police lied then and
they lied now,'' said George Bizos, the Bikos' lawyer during during
both the Commission's hearings and 1977 probes.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what happens now. The decision not to grant
amnesty to Biko's police interrogators provides the first
high-profile test for South Africa's experiment in reconciliation.
Because the case is so prominent, analysts say, how the legal
community follows up on it will affect the public's willingness to
lay the past to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are now reviewing the case, but seem skeptical about
the possibility of a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to make a study of the whole issue. It's
quite a complex one, working out whether we have a case to
prosecute or not,'' said Les Roberts, top prosecutor for the
Eastern Cape Province, where the case would be tried. ``Our options
are murder or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last three years, the truth commission enticed
the perpetrators of apartheid violence to come clean about their
actions in exchange for immunity from prosecution. That trade-off,
it was hoped, would yield the most complete record possible of how
the white minority protected its power. The amnesty provision was
internationally unprecedented, and implied specific social costs.
It meant that many victims would see their aggressors go free for
the sake of national unity. It also meant that perpetrators who
failed to participate fully in the national catharsis could be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 people applied for amnesty. The criteria for
approval was straightfoward. Applicants had to make full
disclosures. They also had to prove that their actions were
politically motivated and that circumstances justified the manner
in which they were carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded its work except for the amnesty cases
last year. As it issues judgments on individual applications, it is
uncertain that those who have been denied amnesty will be brought
to court. By law, evidence brought before the commission cannot be
used in subsequent criminal prosecutions. Other factors, including
age, health, and the amount of time that has lapsed since the act
was committed could influence a decision not to take a case
forward. And given the potential post-commission caseload, the
national prosecutor's office has for the most part drawn a line at
murder: lesser crimes won't be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Biko's case runs into most of these obstacles. Arrested a
healthy man in August 1977, the charismatic leader of the Black
Consciousness Movement died of severe head injuries three weeks
later, chained and naked on the floor of a prison cell. At the
inquest that year, the interrogating officers claimed Biko lost his
balance during a scuffle and hit his head against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   They did not change their testimony significantly during the
hearings in 1997 and 1998. The panel denied amnesty for four of the
applicants Tuesday on the basis that they did not make full
disclosures about what happened. Their version of events did not
explain the forensic evidence. The fifth officer was denied amnesty
in December for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The family wants to prosecute the four surviving officers (a
fifth died late last year). That may not be possible since a
20-year statute of limitations has lapsed, thereby limiting the
kind of charges they can pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Bizos doubts a murder charge could be won. He hopes, however,
that prosecutors will follow the only other option _ what South
African law calls ``constructive intent to murder,'' a lesser
charge that carries up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyer says there is more than sufficient evidence
to convict on that count.

SIEMENS UNIT EXPECTED TO BUY SWITCHING DEVELOPER ARGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Siemens AG, the German electronics and telecommunications giant,
is expected to acquire Argon Networks Inc. of Littleton, Mass., a
two-year-old developer of data switches, for $240 million,
according to several sources familiar with the Siemens' plans.
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement is expected the week of March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens is purchasing privately held Argon in order to enter the
next generation of voice and data networking. The German company,
which is a major supplier of voice equipment, wants to become a
major player in providing equipment and services for data and
Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   With a goal of competing against North American heavyweights
such as Lucent Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Northern
Telecomm, Siemens is also looking beyond privately-held Argon to
acquire three or four other small telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Grady, Argon president, declined to confirm or deny the
Siemens acquisition, which has been rumored for more than six
months. However, some of Argon's 70 employees were informed of the
deal on Monday, the Globe has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Grady founded Argon in February 1997 along with Steven Willis,
Argon's chief technology officer. Willis previously was a cofounder
of Wellfleet Communications, which became part of Bay Networks of
California. Their goal was to develop a high-speed data switch,
called a terabit router, that could simultaneously move Internet
traffic and corporate data, along with new video and voice
services, very quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   To fund Argon's product development, the company has received
$34 million in venture capital funds led by Matrix Partners, North
Bridge Venture Partners, Greylock Management and Sigma Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pending Siemens deal, Argon's private investors will
receive $200 million. Most of the $200 million who go to venture
capitalists who will earn nearly six times their investment in two
years. The rest of the $200 million will go to the founders and
employees. An additional $40 million will be paid in stages to
Argon employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price tag is good for Argon's equity holders, but still
reasonable given that Siemens is buying a company at its early
stage,'' said Paul Johnson, a senior telecommunications analyst at
BankBoston/Robertson Stephens ``But Siemens is competing against
very established players like Lucent, which made a string of much
bigger telecom equipment acquisitions recently, and Cisco, the
leader in the data switching and networking space. So I am in the
camp that thinks Siemens might be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Siemens Information and Technology Inc., based
in Boca Raton, Fla., which markets telephone switching and wireless
equipment in the United States and Canada, declined to confirm or
deny the Argon deal. However, he cited a recent speech by Siemens
top executives that the company, which had revenues of $66 billion
last year, is looking to move into the converging voice and data
networking markets through acquistions and joint partnerships.

 &HT;    SCANA makes key N.C. acquisition
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SCANA Corp. said Wednesday its $900 million
acquisition of a natural gas utility in North Carolina will nearly
double its customer base, and as a result will boost its Georgia
natural gas marketing business.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina-based electric and gas utility announced it
will buy Public Service Co. of North Carolina, which supplies
natural gas to the fast-growing Research Triangle area, for $900
million in stock, cash and assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would make SCANA the second-largest natural gas
utility in the Southeast, after Atlanta Gas Light Co., with 760,000
customers in three contiguous states.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Schrum, a spokesman for the company, said the acquisition
will bring ``critical mass'' to SCANA's Georgia gas marketing
business. SCANA is widely acknowledged as the market leader after
three months of deregulation. ``The ability to provide gas more
efficiently for a larger customer base allows us to be more
competitive,'' Schrum said.
</P>
<P>
   SCANA's energy marketing subsidiary claims a 45 percent share of
the Georgia market, with about 175,000 customers. Georgia start-up
costs accounted for most of the company's $11 million in
fourth-quarter 1998 losses.
</P>
<P>
   SCANA's largest subsidiary, South Carolina Electric &AMP; Gas Co.,
has 257,000 customers for gas and 517,000 for electricity in South
Carolina. Public Service Co. would add 340,000 gas customers.
</P>
<P>
   SCANA has opposed opening its South Carolina utility market to
outside competitors, but has aggressively pursued Georgia's
competitive market. The North Carolina acquisition would position
the company to compete in the sale of electricity with
Raleigh-based Carolina Power &AMP; Light if and when North Carolina's
utility markets are deregulated.

CELLUCCI WOULD SPEND SURPLUS ON ROADS, BRIDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cellucci administration Wednesday proposed spending
almost the entire 1999 state budget surplus, which could be $300
million or more, on roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   And not on the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the $10.8 billion Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel
project will continue to get the billions of dollars it needs. But
that huge job, combined with a 40 percent cut in federal highway
funds to Massachusetts over the next several years, has put non-Big
Dig transportation projects and repairs in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   So transportation and state finance officials Wednesday rolled
out a plan to spend a minimum of $80 million, and maybe upward of
$300 million, to get more than 100 backlogged construction projects
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out on the street _ this construction season,'' said
transportation secretary Kevin J. Sullivan. ``By June or July.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that a huge surplus won't materialize, rendering
the construction plan moot. Also, the highway plan will have to be
approved by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, administration officials are still
predicting a big budget surplus when the books are closed four
months from now, and they contend it makes sense to use the money
the neglected projects.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Finance secretary Fred Laskey said devoting
almost the entire surplus to transportation needs would not affect
Governor Paul Cellucci's pledge to cut taxes. About $1 billion in
tax cuts has been built into budgets in each of the two years, 1999
and 2000, Laskey said, even before the surplus is taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday whether there will be anything left of the 1999
surplus for tax cuts, Cellucci said, ``We don't know yet, because
we don't know what that surplus will be. But we do need to address
this shortfall in federal revenue'' for highways.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial predictions say the surplus could go as high as $700
million, which would greatly increase the chances Legislators would
earmark $300 million for roads because it would leave some money
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, the state had a surplus of about $800
million, state finance officials said, though several hundred
million of that has now been spent.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said his ``number one priority'' was still cutting the
income tax back to five percent, which is provided for in the 2000
budget. After that reduction goes into effect, any annual budget
surplus could be reduced or eliminated, so officials are not
counting on surpluses to fund transportaion needs after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One finance official said the state would spend ``the
overwhelming majority'' of any 1999 surplus on transportation, up
to $300 million or more, reactivating more than 100 projects from
Acton to Yarmouth that have been on hold because of cash drawers
emptied by the Big Dig megaproject.
</P>
<P>
   Laskey and Sullivan said the plan would allow the state to spend
a total of $600 million or so a year on non-Big Dig projects
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   That is about the same amount that has been spent over the last
several years, though the officials acknowledged that the share
that goes to cities and towns _ as opposed to highway work on
interstates for example _ would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci administration appears to have accepted the advice
of some legislators, including the cochairmen of the transportation
committee, who both in recent weeks have urged that a goodly
portion of the surplus be devoted to crumbling bridges and potholed
roads throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the state needs to step up to the plate to fund the
gap,'' said secretary Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joseph C. Sullivan (D-Braintree), cochair of the
Legislature's transportation committee, offered praise and caution.
``The governor is listening to the Legislature and recognizing
there's a need to jumpstart a number of projects,'' Sullivan said,
adding that highway spending is a good idea because it generates
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sullivan said that cities and towns may not be getting
enough money under the ratio proposed Wednesday by the Cellucci
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposed annual spending through 2003 would allocate
about $500 million to state projects and $100 million to cities and
towns. Rep. Sullivan noted that in the last two years communities
had received about $150 million, and legislators may want to
maintain that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a reduction in the amount is something we'd be
looking to do,'' he said. Sullivan added that the Cellucci proposal
is not unlike one that the Legislature proposed in the fall _ and
the governor vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called it $200 million in `unnecessary expenditures,' ''
Sullivan said. ``Today it's `the way to go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to kick a gift horse in the mouth, but I'm going
to be like Ronald Reagan. I'm going to trust but verify.''
</P>
<P>
   David C. Soule, executive director of the Metropolitan Area
Planning Council, echoed Sullivan's concerns about a shrinking
program for cities and towns. But he said getting the 100-plus
construction projects that are on hold moving would be very
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local officials have been very frustrated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation secretary Sullivan said the state has made huge
progress since 1990 in improving roads and bridges. The amount of
pavement that is not in good condition has been reduced from 64 to
22 percent of the state's 2,900 miles of roads, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the number of structurally deficient bridges has
been dropped from 864 in 1991 to 598, a 31 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has seen a quantifiable benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration Wednesday filed a $6 billion state
transportation bond bill, which if passed will provide funds for
Big Dig and other work. It would also restructure the finances of
the debt-ridden MBTA.

 &HT;    Internet trading raises question about future of stockbrokers
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With billions of dollars flowing into stock index
funds, thousands of computer owners engaging in day trading and an
Internet full of research, who needs a stockbroker any more?
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Feb. 22) makes a case that technology is causing
seismic waves that will eventually change the way Wall Street does
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to two phenomena born of cheap computing _ indexing and
the Internet _ investors are standing Wall Street on its head by
cutting out the middleman and taking control of their portfolios,''
the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't stop with trading. It reaches into money
management, or the advice part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Business Week notes the Internet also is having a
major impact on the economy, boosting growth but also creating
fresh risks, some of which are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR AN ADVANTAGE
</P>
<P>
   With a bull this old and stock prices this high, cautious
investors are always looking for some new ways to get into the game
and win. The business press is there to help:
</P>
<P>
   _ Money (March) suggests investors go ``against the grain'' in
their stock picking. Sometimes called contrarian investing, the
idea is to look for investments among out-of-favor stocks on the
theory that great investors win by going where others don't.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, steel and aluminum, real estate investment trusts and
utilities are among the industry groups in which these future
winners may be found.
</P>
<P>
   Money cites several stocks that fit this criterion: Halliburton
(ticker symbol HAL), Steel Dynamics (STLD), Alcoa (AA), Teco Energy
(TE) and Peoples Energy (PGL).
</P>
<P>
   _ Smart Money (March), meanwhile, looks at Wall Street's hottest
stocks and suggests that ``it's not too late'' to buy them, despite
their high prices.
</P>
<P>
   You just have to wait until they come down in price for one
reason or another, which they always do sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money identifies some of these stocks and calculates a
share price at which they would be good buys.
</P>
<P>
   America Online (AOL) may be out of reach at the current $153,
but would be a buy at $86, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Some others are: Cisco System (CSCO), now $97.12 1/2, and a buy
at $80; Dell Computer (DELL), $81.63 3/4 and $50; General Electric
(GE), $99.31 1/4 and $85, and IBM (IBM), $170.50 and $120.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (March) says the biggest
mistake investors make in choosing a mutual fund is not to match
the fund with some specific goal, or objective _ saving for
retirement, college for the kids, a new house.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine says there are rules of thumb anybody can follow to
get it right, and makes recommendations as to which funds meet
those goals. The magazine also looks at the top 500 funds.

 &HT;    Black buying power takes healthy jump to $392 billion
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barry Corker is typical of many middle-class blacks.
</P>
<P>
   His income is rising and so is his spending, said Corker, a
financial consultant with Merrill Lynch Inc. in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, black buying power _ money from salaries and wages _
rose to $392 billion in 1997 from $367 billion a year earlier,
according to the fifth annual report on the buying power of blacks,
released Wednesday by Chicago-based Target Market News. In Atlanta,
black buying power reached $4 billion in 1997, up from $3.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nation's strong economy, African-American
consumers are continuing to purchase at a brisk rate,'' said Ken
Smikle, president of Target Market News. The emphasis, however, is
shifting away from big-ticket products for the home and toward
personal items, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending more mainly because of my business and because
the kids are into so many outside activities like baseball,'' said
Corker, a father of five.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks spent the most _ $104.8 billion _ on housing and related
charges, the survey said. But the biggest increases were for
personal care services and online access to the Internet. Internet
spending, for example, was up sixfold to $60 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Such purchases indicate that African-Americans still feel
``confident about the economy and their personal financial
status,'' said Smikle. Among the biggest economic winners were
black women, he said, whose presence in the work force grew by 2
percent, vs. less than 1 percent for black men.
</P>
<P>
   Target Market News based its findings on analysis of data from
the U.S. departments of Commerce and Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Companies use figures on black buying power to gauge market
potential, said Tomikea Flowers, an assistant media planner for the
Atlanta office of Burrell Communications Group, whose clients
include Procter &AMP; Gamble and McDonalds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are learning how to direct advertising
toward African-Americans,'' she said. ``The purchasing power of
African-Americans is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar study on black buying power is done by the University
of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth. In the most recent
UGA study, blacks are expected to spend $30.37 billion in Georgia
this year and $532.67 billion nationally.

 &HT;    Software maker Harbinger pins hopes on business-to-business
e-commerce
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four months after laying off 10 percent of its work
force, Harbinger Corp. executives on Wednesday announced a sweeping
new Internet strategy and predicted solid revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based software company in March will formally launch
an Internet portal, a site that will provide information about
electronic commerce, offer service help to Harbinger customers and,
most importantly, let companies do business with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe these are probably the most important announcements
that our company has ever made,'' said C. Tycho Howle, Harbinger
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known consumer portals like Yahoo!, Lycos and Excite offer
a range of information, as well as ways for users to shop and chat.
With companies increasingly using Internet technology to transmit
information, Harbinger is betting it can build a brand name by
tailoring a portal to electronic commerce for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Harbinger has always specialized in electronic commerce. The
Internet site is designed to handle orders between two companies,
creating records of the transaction at each, Howle said.
</P>
<P>
   To stay ahead of the technology needed, Harbinger Labs has been
established as a unit within the company. It has about 20 people
but will grow to 30 this year, taking about 25 percent of the
company's research and development budget, Howle said. ``Everybody
wants to connect up with their trading partners. It turns out this
is not so easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbinger is toying with several ways to make money from the
site. Unlike consumer portals such as Yahoo!, mass advertising
seems an unlikely source of revenue for Harbinger. Instead,
Harbinger may charge for each transaction or possibly offer
``subscriptions'' to companies that use the service regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Yahoo!, much of the site will be free.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in electronic commerce will grow an average of 30
percent a year for the next three years, Howle said. ``We expect to
grow faster than our industry, not only in the year 2000 and beyond
but in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic effort at a turnaround, Harbinger in October
eliminated 110 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The company finished the year with $135 million in revenues, but
the October changes included elimination of products that account
for about $18 million in annual revenue. Chief Financial Officer
Joel Katz predicted Wednesday that Harbinger will end this year
with more than $130 million in revenue and grow to $185 million in
revenue in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Harbinger grew at a healthy clip from 1989 to 1997, running into
trouble after making a series of acquisitions. Company focus has
returned, Howle said. ``I believe those challenges are now behind
us. We are now one Harbinger _ we weren't one Harbinger in 1998.

MAJOR ISRAELI WRITER LEADS BACKLASH AGAINST ORTHODOX RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Firing another shot in a culture war, the best-known
author in Israel, Amos Oz, has signed up as a member of the Reform
Jewish movement.
</P>
<P>
   Oz made his statement on Tuesday after a huge rally on Sunday by
ultra-Orthodox Jews against Supreme Court rulings that they
consider antireligious, including decisions that have given a
measure of recognition to Conservative and Reform Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a newspaper appeal by Oz and other prominent
intellectuals, hundreds of Israelis have contacted the offices of
the Reform and Conservative movements to register as members,
leaders of the groups said. The two movements are relatively small
here, saying they have 25,000 dues-paying members.
</P>
<P>
   The groundswell of sympathy is a backlash against the rally on
Sunday, which many nonreligious Israelis saw as an assault on the
judicial system and democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Oz, 59, a secular Jew with liberal views, is an influential
voice among the nonreligious majority. ``We wanted to show the
Orthodox that there is another Judaism that is appropriate for us
and to strengthen these movements, which are being persecuted,''
said Oz's wife, Nily, who signed up with her husband and spoke for
him because he was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of legal battles, the Conservative and Reform
movements have chipped away at the Orthodox rabbinate's control of
religious affairs, winning court orders to register non-Orthodox
conversions and to seat Conservative and Reform Jews on religious
councils.
</P>
<P>
   The inroads have brought a torrent of invective against the
Supreme Court and Conservative and Reform Judaism from
ultra-Orthodox rabbis and political leaders. The chief justice of
the Supreme Court, Aharon Barak, has been labeled ``an enemy of the
Jews.'' Reform rabbis have been called clowns and leaders of a
non-Jewish sect.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox campaign, which culminated in the
demonstration on Sunday, led Oz to muster other secular writers,
academics and artists to publish an appeal on the day of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save Judaism from the enemies of democracy,'' the appeal said,
urging Israelis to sign up with the Conservative and Reform
movements as a show of solidarity. ``The Judaism of these movements
is closer to the positions of most of the democratic Jewish
public.''

SHOOTINGS HEIGHTEN TENSIONS OVER KURDISH LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH AND JONATHAN GORVETT S  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Israeli security guards Wednesday shot and
killed three Kurdish demonstrators who stormed the Israel embassy
in Berlin. In all, 14 were injuring in the melee, which heightened
tensions in Europe following the capture of rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claiming his forces
acted in self-defense, voiced regret at the loss of life and
ordered the closure of all Israel's European embassies as a
security precaution. Fearing more reprisals by Kurdish protesters,
Kenya closed all of its embassies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds' decision to target the Israeli embassy reflected the
growing skepticism by Ocalan's supporters over Israeli and American
denials that they played a role in his capture Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first image of the Kurdish separatist since his arrest,
Turkish television released footage of hooded agents
``high-fiving'' each another before removing a blindfold from
Ocalan, who was securely fastened to an airplane seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, to your country,'' the special forces commander
asked, ``How are you feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Ocalan replied. ``I really love Turkey and the
Turkish people.'
</P>
<P>
   Turkish authorities, meanwhile, revealed that five or six
Turkish agents from the Turkish secret service captured Ocalan
after a secret 12-day operation. Turkish media reported that a
commando team in Nairobi drugged Ocalan and loaded him onto a
private plane owned by a Turkish businessman and politician, Cavit
Caglar.
</P>
<P>
   The reports noted that the Turkish government had learned five
days ago of Ocalan's presence in Nairobi. The team then flew to
Kenya in Caglar's unmarked aircraft and, according to the reports,
moved in on Ocalan after learning that the Greeks had turned him
over to the Kenyans for a plane bound for the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ocalan, however, flatly deny that account and
claimed Tuesday that he had been forcibly removed from the Greek
ambassador's compound in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish intelligence said Ocalan was traveling on a Cypriot
passport with the name of a prominent Greek-Cypriot jounralist. He
has since been jailed in the island of Imrali in the Maramara Sea
near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonya Godana continued to insist that
his government played no role in the capture of Ocalan. ``We would
like to assure everybody, Kurds included, that we had no role in
this affair.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, fearing Kurdish protesters will turn
against Americans, went on high alert Wednesday, warning Americans
around the world that the threat of violence spreading across
Europe ``may extend to American interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's supporters have charged American and Israeli
intelligence agencies with aiding Turkey in its capture of Ocalan.
The United States, while denying it played a ``direct role'' in his
arrest, has declined to comment on reports that it provided
intelligence on his whereabouts to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   However, American officials acknowledge that the Clinton
administration decided to help Turkey bring Ocalan to trial after
he was jailed in Rome last November.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the State Department considered expanding the scope
of a war crimes tribunal in the Hague to include Ocalan as well as
trying him in the United States for crimes against American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While Ocalan was in custody in Rome, the United States also
sought to persuade Italy to turn him over to Germany, where he was
under indictment for terrorist activities. ``There was a dual
desire to bring him to justice without facing capital punishment,''
explained a White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which does not have a death penalty, chose not to
accept Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US has added fuel to the fire by providing intelligence to
Turkey,'' said Kani Xulam, a Washington-based Turkish Kurd who
maintains contacts with Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
``I hope the Kurds will not jump to conclusion and declare the US
enemy number one. Our fight is not with the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials have also declined to comment on reports that the
the Clinton administration provided Turkey with intelligence on
Ocalan's whereabouts in Greece. ``I have no information on that and
we never discuss intelligence matters,'' said a US official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting question belongs to the Greeks,'' he
added. ``What on earth were they doing?''
</P>
<P>
   While the arrest has strengthened the government of Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on the eve of Turkey's April
elections, it has undermined the Greek government, which is under
attack from the country's nationalists for letting Ocalan fall into
Turkish hands. Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, the
target of resignation calls, assured parliament that it was Kenya,
not Greece, that betrayed Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocalan affair has also exacerbated already poor relations
between the two NATO members. While publicly stating that it did
not know where Ocalan was, Greece was sheltering him in its
ambassador's residence in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi for 12
days.
</P>
<P>
   As Kurdish protesters ended many of their demonstrations
throughout Europe and released the Greek ambassador to Austria,
whom they had held hostage in Vienna, new protests sprung up from
Switzerland to Turkey, sparking warnings of tough response from
besieged European governments.
</P>
<P>
   In Diyarbakir, the capital of the southeastern region of Turkey,
a Kurdish protester, angered by the arrest, set himself on fire. In
Geneva, some 20 Kurdish protesters occupied, and later evacuated,
the headquarters of the United Nations' refugee agency. In Zurich,
about 60 demonstrators held a policeman at the Greek consulate.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst violence occurred in Germany, where Kurdish
demonstrators were violently repulsed as they sought to seize the
Israeli embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have standing orders to prevent the taking of
hostages and to defend the taking of hostages and to defend
themselves with force,'' Netanyahu said, noting that the
demonstrators had seized an Israeli woman. ``We are involved in a
battle against terrorism and it is our duty to defend our nationals
and our facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned that foreign
protesters would be deported. ``Anyone who breaks the law is not
our friend,'' he said. `` We will tell them politely, but clearly,
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey reacted angrily to European demands that it honor human
rights standards in its upcoming trial of Ocalan on terrorist
charges, and it refused an appeal by the UN Special Rapporteur on
Torture to allow international monitors to observe the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``No European country has the right to lecture us on this
subject,'' Turkey's Prime Minister told ``CNN Wednesday.'' ``Those
who suspend justice for fear of violence in the streets have no
right to warn or criticize us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that Germany declined to call for
Ocalan's transfer for prosecution from Italy last fall out of fear
of violence from the thousands of Kurds living within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on its capture of the rebel leader, Turkey
Wednesday ordered 15,000 troops, backed by air support, to pursue
Ocalan forces based in northern Iraq. The PKK fighters for years
have used northern Iraq as a base for mounting cross-border raids
into souteastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ocalan was first detained in Italy last November, Turkish
security forces have maintained a crackdown on Kurdish political
activities in Turkey. Following his arrest Monday, police in Turkey
have arrested demonstrators, members of human rights groups and
pro-Kurdish political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds were detained last night,'' said Nazmi Gur, a
spokesman for the Ankara based Human Rights Association, Wednesday.
``Six lawyers were among them, so now, we really don't know what
will happen next.''

COMMENTARY: TURKEY'S BIG CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A mob of Syrians may with impunity trash the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Damascus, but when a mob of Kurds storms
Israel's consulate in Berlin and seizes a hostage, demonstrators
get killed. That's because besieged Israelis afford terrorism zero
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish separatists living in Germany lashed out at Israel
because they mistakenly suspected its Mossad helped a Turkish
commando team capture their fugitive leader, Abdullah Ocalan in
Kenya. The ensuing bloodshed was doubly tragic because the Kurdish
and Jewish peoples _ non-Arab and historically oppressed _ long
quietly shared a fellowship of the rejected in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds, 20 million weak, have no homeland. Many live in
northern Iraq, and are protected from Saddam Hussein in a
``no-flight zone'' by U.S. planes based in Turkey, where most other
Kurds live. (In Istanbul this month, I was reminded to call them
``Turks of Kurdish descent.'')
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable Kurdish leaders want autonomy within other nations:
to enjoy their language and ancient culture under a degree of
self-rule. Then there is the Marxist Ocalan. He and his PKK
guerrillas have been fighting a bloody war against the Turks for an
independent Kurdistan, costing over 30,000 lives in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   By threatening war with Syria, Turkey drove him out of his
Damascus sanctuary. His capture triggered furious protest
throughout Europe. He is to be tried in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He will soon be lionized by knee-jerk lefties everywhere who
still miss Che Guevara. They will overlook the way he murders those
not loyal enough to him and probably profits from heroin smuggling
to support his movement.
</P>
<P>
   But Ocalan's dramatic flight and capture has radicalized Kurds
of all factions. Turned away from every door, he desperately
searched for refuge. That symbolized the plight of a people whose
slogan was uttered decades ago by my friend Mullah Mustafa Barzani,
after his betrayal to the Shah of Iran by the Americans: ``The
Kurds have no friends.''
</P>
<P>
   On trial, the fiery Ocalan is likely to come across more as a
righteous John Brown than a coolly murderous Adolf Eichmann. His
prosecutors run the danger of being portrayed as authoritarian
militarists not only denying cultural rights to a repressed
minority, but bouncing a rebellion's rubble by persecuting its
hero.
</P>
<P>
   That media play would further alienate Socialist Europeans from
Turkey, a nation they unfairly blackball from their exclusive club.
Making a martyr out of Ocalan would strain, though not break, the
growing ``phantom alliance'' of Turkey, Israel and the United
States, a strategic tie that so frustrates fundamentalist Muslims
and southward-looking Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not go down that road.
</P>
<P>
   First, here's what the Kurds in Iraq should do: Barzani's son
Mahmoud should stop playing footsie with Saddam Hussein. On Sunday
he met secretly in Duhok with Tariq Aziz. No good can come out of
two-timing the United States, which polices the no-flight zone from
Turkey. With Ocalan in custody, Kurds everywhere should encourage
new leadership to help the Americans overthrow Saddam and help the
Turks make peace with Kurds of Turkish descent. Promote
Kurdishness, not Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Turks should do: Declare victory and end the
war. (1) In the trial, concentrate on the PKK killings of Kurdish
``collaborators'' and knock themselves out to be fair. (2) Pump
money, not ammo, into impoverished Kurdish villages. (3) Release
jailed Kurdish politicians and let Kurds vote for them instead of
the Islamic party. (4) Permit Kurdish-language radio and TV, so
that Kurdish Turks do not rely only on news from pro-PKK satellite
broadcasts from London.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, loosen up, Turkey _ you've won. With confidence
gained from victory, treat ethnic diversity as a sign of strength.
Emulate multicultural Western democracies, not Balkan tribal
conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the United States and Israel should do: Publicly
hail Turkey's victory. (Both President Clinton and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu have been doing the right thing on this.) Make
plain to oil companies that the Caspian pipeline is safest through
Turkey. Convince the Turks that the above four-point plan benefits
the phantom alliance. (If the Turks want, let Azerbaijan in.)
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Ankara, take Churchill's advice: ``In war, resolution
... in victory, magnanimity.''

MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE DENIES KEY ALLEGATION IN ANTITRUST CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft &UR;  &LR; Corp. executive Wednesday denied a key
allegation in the government's antitrust case _ that the company
had both threatened its main rival in the Internet software
business and made it an illegal offer to divide the market.
</P>
<P>
   In his 90-page direct testimony, Daniel Rosen, a Microsoft
general manager, called those portrayals of a June 1995 meeting
between executives of Microsoft and Netscape Communications &UR;  &LR; Corp.
as ``either fabrications or the products of a fundamental
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen offered his own detailed account of the disputed meeting
and the events surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is a pivotal episode in the government's suit. After
Netscape declined Microsoft's offer to divide the Internet browser
market, the government contends, Microsoft embarked on a pattern of
anticompetitive behavior intended to thwart the challenge posed by
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, Rosen, who led the Microsoft team at
the June 1995 meeting, angrily dismisses those allegations as
``misleading,'' ``outrageous'' and ``rubbish'' _ directly
contradicting the testimony of the government's leadoff witness,
James Barksdale, the president of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the outcome of
this nonjury trial, must determine which witness is more credible.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said that in late 1994 Netscape tried to license its
browser to Microsoft and said it would not compete head-on with
Microsoft _ only to change its strategy and its story later. Rosen
cites an e-mail he received on Dec. 29, 1994, in which James Clark,
the chairman of Netscape, stated, ``We have never planned to
compete with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark went on to describe Netscape's browser as ``client''
software, a way to distribute its technology, but that its main
business would be selling Web server software to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale testified that Clark sent this e-mail in a ``moment of
weakness,'' and had not told others at Netscape of his overture.
Indeed, Clark's e-mail ends, ``No one in my organization knows
about this message.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosen notes that Clark's ``moment of weakness'' lasted at
least several days, since he had tried to send it, using an
incorrect e-mail address, to another Microsoft executive earlier in
the month. Besides, Rosen said, the Clark e-mail was consistent
with conversations he had had during that time with other Netscape
executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-hour meeting in 1995 at Netscape's offices, Rosen
insists, it was Netscape executives who brought up the issue of the
``line'' dividing the Internet technology Microsoft planned to put
into Windows and Netscape's Internet software that would run on top
of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replied that its priority was to ``establish Microsoft
ownership of the Internet client platform for Windows 95,'' as
Rosen wrote in an e-mail to Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and
other senior Microsoft executives a day after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the message, Rosen wrote, ``we discussed sucking most
of the functionality of the current Netscape browser'' into
Windows, confining Netscape's future development mainly to add-ons.
Yet, Rosen reported, ``They seemed OK with this concept.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rosen said, the Microsoft team suggested that
licensing Netscape's browser technology for ``the non-Windows
platforms might be a reasonable part of a larger strategic
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and Netscape regard these as the ingredients of
an illegal market-division offer, while Rosen says the discussions
were ``entirely consistent with lawful, and commonplace, business
practices.'' &QL;

INVESTORS WARM TO ARGENTINA'S BONDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sign that investors still are willing to lend to
the right emerging-market country, Argentina easily sold $1 billion
in new 20-year bonds Wednesday to eager American and European
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, also showed that the investors still were
demanding high interest rates and some extra sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   The bond sale, with J.P. Morgan as the lead underwriter, was one
of the biggest emerging-market deals since Brazil devalued its
currency last month. Mexico did a $1 billion deal two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's success _ there were $2 billion of bids _ indicates
that the financial market fallout from the Brazilian devaluation
has not been intense. In fact, some analysts are arguing that
because of Argentina's tight link to the U.S. dollar and other
economic policies, it might be able to ``delink'' from Brazil
despite the two countries' strong economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the deal was expensive, although Argentina can get a
better deal than other emerging-market countries. The 20-year bonds
were priced to yield 12.177 percent, 6.78 percentage points above
the yield on a comparable Treasury bond. The J.P. Morgan index of
all major emerging-market debt was at a spread above Treasuries of
11.66 percentage points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bond includes warrants that give the owner the right to buy
more of the same 20-year bonds in a year at a set price. The future
price is $103.10, compared with the $99.6135 the bonds were sold at
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The last Argentinian bond deal, which was done in November, also
included warrants to buy additional bonds in the future at a fixed
price. These warrants were for an existing 30-year bond. At the
time of the deal, the fixed price to buy the bond in a year was
$93.30, while the bond was trading at $85.50. But while the price
of the bond rose after the deal, it fell later. It was trading at
about $84 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is doing the borrowing now to assure that it has the
cash on hand to meet the principal payments on existing debt that
come due this year. This effort to refinance the existing debt
early is, in fact, one of the reasons that investors are interested
in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The more refinancing Argentina does, the less concerned
investors have to be about the possibility of default, which is
still a worry for investors in other emerging-market countries. &QL;

GOP SPLIT OVER WHETHER TO LET SCANDAL DIE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As many Republicans struggle to move beyond
impeachment, they find their party fractured by a hard reality:
Many other Republicans, particularly conservatives, do not want to
move beyond impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those frustrated by months of polling that showed impeachment
caused the public to see the Republicans as partisan and
mean-spirited hoped that President Clinton's acquittal would give
them an opportunity to change the subject. But a vocal minority are
pressing forward, in as public a manner as possible, with the
argument that Clinton should be held accountable for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans do not think they are committing political
suicide. Sooner or later, they contend, voters will punish
Democrats for the Lewinsky scandal. They say that the president's
poll ratings have been artificially high and could fall once people
put the impeachment saga in perspective, or if another scandal
shakes the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has predicted
that public sentiment could change dramatically as voters _ hungry
for politicians of moral character _ reward Republicans in the 2000
elections for taking on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Shirley, a veteran conservative public relations
operative, summed up the argument: ``It would be horrible to run
away from the Clinton scandals because you are giving up something
that is important to the base of the Republican Party _ and you're
suggesting that we were somehow wrong in going after Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, a
conservative group, said, ``Everyone says, `Oh, this is poison and
people shouldn't talk about it.' I think they have to. It's one of
the most important events of the second half of the 20th century.
The fact that Clinton remains in office, if that's not challenged,
it is sweeping something under the rug which is going to come back
to bite us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' apparent impeachment albatross has delighted
White House advisers, who vow to cast the GOP as controlled by
extremists who are bent on prolonging the impeachment ordeal.
``There's an opportunity for a national message against the
Republican Party,'' said Mark Penn, the president's pollster.
``That it is too extreme and its leadership is too far to the
right. And that national message could have a lot of impact come
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn scoffed at the notion advanced by Lott and others that
Clinton's approval ratings might sag. ``If you were a Martian and
you came down and just read the polls, you would not know that the
Monica Lewinsky scandal existed,'' he said, ``because he was in
good shape before, during and after because the public
fundamentally separated this issue from his performance as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also many Republicans who fear that the ghost of
impeachment could haunt and define the party. Many party leaders,
including several governors, seem terrified that the Democrats
could seize on their party's handling of impeachment to win back
Congress in 2000, and have warned their colleagues to drop the
issue. They argued that the No. 1 priority of Republicans should be
to move on the offensive with an ambitious issue agenda. Yet
Republicans are not united over just what that agenda should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we should be talking about is for us to move on,'' Gov.
George Pataki of New York said in an interview Wednesday, ``and in
moving on to focus on the core beliefs of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Carney, a longtime Republican strategist in New Hampshire,
was almost testy in his advising party members to let go of
impeachment. ``The Republicans who are fixated on this, these
people need to get a life,'' he said. ``I don't know what drug
treatment they need. I don't know what psychotherapy they need. But
the country's moved beyond this. What about free trade? Crime in
the streets? Kosovo? There are other issues out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney predicted that impeachment will be so far from voters'
minds next year that neither party would benefit _ or suffer _ from
the issue. `` `Vote for me in 2000 because I voted to keep Bill
Clinton in office.' That's not going to work on a bumper sticker or
in a commercial. Or, `Vote for me in 2000 because I tried to get
rid of the bum.' That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Edward T. Schafer of North Dakota, a Republican, put it
this way: ``I don't think you use it as a weapon. You don't say,
`Oh, there's a Democratic candidate and they're a member of the
party that lied and cheated and then acquitted the perpetrator.'
There's going to be an underlying issue of what the president did
wrong. But we should point to the positive aspects of our
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a looming trouble spot as Republicans try to hold on to
their control of Congress and regain the White House in 2000 is not
that voters will lash out at the party's candidates _ but that the
issue will make it much easier for Democrats to raise money and
recruit prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, a Republican, said his
party has to be especially aggressive in countering the Democrats'
recruitment drives. ``For the Republican Party at the state level
to succeed, I think we need a national message.'' In 1998, he
added, the party was ``consumed with this impeachment thing; they
weren't even out there advocating tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the potential perils for Republicans is that even
with the party's biggest lightning rod _ Newt Gingrich _ gone as
speaker, there are still Republicans in Congress at center stage
who were among the most vociferous proponents of impeachment, such
as Reps. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, and Henry Hyde of
Illinois, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's constituents, in fact, are encouraging his continued
attacks on Clinton. Next month, he will be honored with the 1999
Political Courage Award at the Harris County Republican Party's
Lincoln Day Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to keep impeachment alive is also being fueled the
most by politicians with the most conservative constituents.
</P>
<P>
   At a town meeting the other day in Douglas County, a Republican
enclave about 25 miles south of Denver, only a handful of people
mentioned impeachment to Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo. Those who did
praised Allard's votes to oust the president. After the meeting,
Allard stopped short of saying Republicans could turn impeachment
to their advantage. But he did say that by focusing on cutting
taxes and fighting crime, the party could prevent a backlash
against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brookover, who stepped down after the November elections as
political director of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, said his party faced a classic dilemma of whether to
appeal to the outspoken conservatives whose support can be crucial
in primaries _ or whether to appeal to the broader, general
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the constant argument inside the party, whether
you play to the base or play to the middle,'' Brookover said. ``A
winning campaign figures out how to do both. But I don't know if
we've yet landed on a winning way.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Around the country, Democrats have begun plotting how to
capitalize on the Republicans' quandary. In Oregon, Sen. Gordon
Smith, a Republican, is not even facing re-election until 2002, but
Democrats already vow to target him for voting to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who has always portrayed himself as a moderate,''
said Jim Edmundson, a lawyer who is chairman of the Oregon
Democratic Party. ``But he is not. This vote really reveals the
depth of his religious conservatism. This will leave a residual
feeling among moderate voters that he is out of touch with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the only statewide elected Republican in Oregon,
acknowledged the high stakes of his vote in a state that tends
toward moderation. ``I'll account for it the rest of my public
life,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Atkinson, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, said
Smith cemented his support with conservatives by voting guilty on
both counts. Had Smith voted not guilty on one of the counts _ as
he had talked about doing _ Atkinson said ``it would have sent
mixed messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, offered this advice to his party: ``The Republican Party
had a president who the entire country believed was a lying
adulterer. And they couldn't convince their own Republicans to do
something about it. What does that say about the efficacy of the
issue?''

COMMENTARY: A SENSELESS ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Padilla was crossing Sheffield Avenue at the
corner of Liberty Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn
when he saw the car approaching. Its headlights were off, and it
was traveling fast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was late on the night of Oct. 7, 1994. Padilla crossed the
street safely but within seconds the car with its headlights off
crashed into another car at the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, 28 at the time, ran back into the street to see if he
could help. It turned out that the car with no headlights was an
unmarked police vehicle carrying three officers. Padilla, an
immigrant from Honduras, recalled that no one was seriously injured
but within minutes several other police cars and an ambulance
arrived at the scene. Padilla still thought he could be of help.
</P>
<P>
   He spotted a police officer with a notebook and went up to him.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed Padilla on Tuesday in the lower Manhattan offices
of his attorneys, Marvin Salenger and Robert Sack. He remembered
telling the officer with the notebook: ``Would you like to hear
what I saw? I could tell you what happened because I saw what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer with the notebook ignored him. But another officer
walked up and said, according to Padilla, ``Shut the (expletive) up
and take a hike.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla naively tried to explain that he wasn't a crank, that he
had information he thought the police should have. He said the
second officer told him if he didn't take a hike he'd be arrested.
So, as even the police acknowledge, Padilla turned around to leave.
For some reason, the second officer, later identified as John
Coughlin, grabbed Padilla from behind, flipped him and slammed him
face first to the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Then several cops jumped him. Padilla said he was hit in the
back of the head with a heavy object and his face was pounded into
the ground. ``I couldn't see how many cops there were,'' he said.
``But I could see so many feet surrounding me and kicking me. It
was horrible. I felt like I was going to be killed. I was totally
scared. I was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla was taken to the 75th Precinct stationhouse where he was
given a summons for disorderly conduct. The specific charge was
making unreasonable noise. To Coughlin it was not a big deal. He
would later describe his encounter with Padilla as a ``minor
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Padilla left the stationhouse he was a mess. His face
was swollen and he was bleeding from his forehead, his chin, his
hands and his knees. He went home, and on Monday morning he went to
work as usual. But instead of gradually feeling better, he felt
worse. He suffered excruciating headaches. And within a few days he
began to lose the sight of his right eye. The optic nerve, which
transmits visual impulses from the eye to the brain, had been
damaged in the beating inflicted by the cops.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla is now legally and permanently blind in that eye. ``All
he can see are shadows,'' said Salenger.
</P>
<P>
   Salenger and Sack filed a lawsuit on Padilla's behalf, charging
that he had been falsely arrested and that the police had used
excessive force. The case recently came to trial. At one point
Coughlin, now a sergeant, was asked to demonstrate for the jurors
how he flipped Padilla. He seemed happy to do so. He stepped behind
an attorney who volunteered for the demonstration, grabbed him,
flipped him, and slammed him to the floor. There was a collective
gasp in the courtroom. Jurors later commented on the grin of
apparent satisfaction that Coughlin displayed after the
demonstration. Coughlin assured the lawyer that he had taken it
easy on him.
</P>
<P>
   There were at least 10 cops on the scene when Padilla was
arrested. But Coughlin testified that he could not recall the name
of even one officer who witnessed the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors did not find the attack on Padilla to be funny or
trivial. Last week they returned an $8.2 million verdict against
the city and the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla is a hard-working body and fender repairman who is
married and has two young children. ``He is just a terrific guy,''
said Salenger. ``All he wanted to do was help.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sack: ``The police, by violating their oath, violated the
rights of an innocent man, causing him to suffer a devastating
injury.''

DESPITE PEACE TALKS, KOSOVO'S GROWING REBEL ARMY TRAINS FOR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also KOSOVO-TALKS) 
(fe)

<P>
   KOSTRCE, Serbia _ If the Kosovo Liberation Army's negotiators
are talking in France about peace, its officers in the forbidding,
frozen hills of southern Kosovo are still preparing for war.
</P>
<P>
   In an officers' training class in a primary school in this
village some five miles north of Suva Reka, there is little sense
that the KLA is about to pack up and turn in its new uniforms for
those of civilian policemen.
</P>
<P>
   In a year, this rebel army has gone from ragtag guerrilla bands
to a force of 10,000, perhaps 15,000, equipped with increasingly
sophisticated weapons and bent on achieving not the autonomy for
Kosovo that is on offer at the peace talks, but independence for
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   The officers here are trained fighters who have been chosen to
lead others. They say they would obey their superiors' commands
after any peace with the Serbs. But they hastened to add that a
core of the KLA must remain intact and armed, to protect the Kosovo
Albanians when Western forces leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peace is possible without a military _ to live without a
military is not a serious idea,'' said Maj. Sadik Halitjaha. ``No
one here trusts the Serbs, with their brutal expansionism and their
megalomania. No one can trust them after they burned our villages,
poisoned our wells, killed women and children and cut out the eyes
of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians' sworn enemy, President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia, is currently blocking a deal providing Kosovo
self-rule for three years under the protection of some 28,000 NATO
troops. But his objections will probably be worn down by heavy
diplomatic pressure, borne out by the troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
   More lasting are serious concerns about how any deal will be
carried out on the ground. Will the KLA, a force on the rise on its
home turf, accept disarmament and effective dissolution, forbidden
to wear uniforms, patrol territory or even conduct military
exercises?
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's blossoming insurgency against Belgrade's rule in this
southern Serbian province has altered old assumptions and prompted
vicious Serbian countermeasures. But the increasing military and
political power of the rebel army has also forced the West to move
now to forestall Kosovo's formal independence, which Washington
fears could disrupt the whole region, including nearby Bosnia,
where thousands of American troops have already spent four years.
</P>
<P>
   Such diplomatic niceties are lost on Halitjaha and his men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no going back, and it is impossible now for Albanians
and Serbs to live together as if nothing has happened,'' said one
fighter, who said he quit the Yugoslav police in 1989 _ the year
Milosevic stripped Kosovo of the autonomy it once had _ and joined
the KLA in its early days, in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Halitjaha, a 43-year-old French-speaking physicist, is a real
Kosovo radical who says he was arrested three times _ in 1979, 1982
and 1986 _ for agitating against the Yugoslav government. He says
he ``took up the gun'' in 1996, after the Dayton settlement for
Bosnia produced nothing for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community spent seven years telling us to
wait and pursue a peaceful path with the Serbs, the people who
destroyed peace in the Balkans,'' he said. ``We had so little space
to move, and it was crushed to the point that we were obligated to
use force to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full disarmament for us is an impossibility,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Halitjaha wears no insignia of rank and is known here simply as
Commander Sadik. He said that a guarantee of independence now would
be much clearer for everyone, including the Serbs. Failing that, a
guarantee of a referendum on Kosovo's independence, after a
three-year interim accord, ``could be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the West promising neither, he said, ``such vagueness
will lead to war again from the Serbs as soon as the West gets
bored and leaves.'' As the ``guardians of peace,'' he said, the KLA
``must always be present, with arms and forces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you in America sleep happily if your peace was
guaranteed by a force of Russians and Chinese?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters and incipient political structure of the rebel army
are not hard to find in this nominally Serbian province, where
barely one in 10 of the 2 million inhabitants are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling south from Pristina, the provincial capital, the last
Serbian police checkpoint is just outside Suva Reka, in a large
house destroyed in last summer's scorched-earth campaign by Serbian
security forces _ an assault that drove tens of thousands from
their homes, ultimately outraged the West and brought the KLA
thousands of new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Just 400 yards away is the first KLA checkpoint. The rebel
soldiers sport new boots and belt-fed machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   In this country within a country, the KLA moves openly and with
confidence. While much about the rebel force remains mysterious _
including its actual size _ it has apparently managed its growth
with skill and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel army was hobbled, but not destroyed, by the Serbs'
summer offensive. It has re-emerged since October, when more than
1,000 unarmed Western ``verifiers'' entered Kosovo under the
auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and in effect helped to restrain the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to control more than a third of Kosovo,
both day and night, and they claim a large, though still
clandestine, presence in Kosovo's cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is taken seriously by both the Serbs and the West,
the KLA is turning away recruits. Its fighters wear new fatigues
from Germany or Switzerland, where ethnic Albanian exiles have long
agitated against Serbian rule and collected money to fight it.
Despite their new guns, typically smuggled in from Albania, rebel
commanders say they have few heavy weapons, except for some armored
personnel carriers captured from the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the KLA, which has five avowed members on the 16-man ethnic
Albanian delegation at the talks in France, is also taking on a
more political presence on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In areas under its sway, there are a growing number of
``military police,'' in black leather jackets, new black boots and
distinctive gray and yellow arm bands fastened to an epaulette.
Villagers appeal to its commanders to settle disputes _ a sign that
the rebels are gaining authority in the ethnic Albanians'
tight-knit, clannish society.
</P>
<P>
   Halitjaha and an officer known as Remi, a 28-year-old who says
he commands the KLA's northern zone, running from Pristina to
Podujevo, deflect essentially political questions. On these, they
say with the collective loyalty that Kosovo's Albanians often
display but almost never explain, they will follow the dictates of
the 50-member council that is said to direct the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kosovo's independence is clearly their goal _ not its vague
status as a largely self-governing entity within unchanged borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put our weapons in warehouses only when we have
liberated Kosovo,'' Remi told reporters in Lapastica after a visit
from William Walker, the American diplomat who directs the Western
monitors. ``Our general staff is fighting for the freedom of
Kosovo, and I don't expect to receive any order to disarm or
disband.''
</P>
<P>
   Halitjaha concedes that it will be difficult to suddenly ``pull
the spark plugs'' out of the rebel army. In Bosnia, the Dayton
settlement was reached after all sides were exhausted by three and
a half years of war.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the KLA is on the rise and believes its victory is
inevitable. Its opponents in the Serbian security forces maintain,
correctly or not, that only Western interference prevents them from
clobbering, if not destroying the rebel army.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the officer candidates here are being taught the
political and military tactics of wars of liberation, from the
Algerian revolt against France and the Chechen struggle against
Moscow to the long Palestinian effort to win its own state.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Western diplomats seem confident that the KLA will play
along with a peace accord now. It ``wants peace now and will do
what it needs to do,'' a Western diplomat said after interviewing a
KLA commander, Gani Koci, on Wednesday in Likovac.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Western diplomat pointed to the strength of
28,000 NATO troops and said, ``If there is a deal, my personal
opinion is that implementation would go OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But the KLA is already trying to look beyond a three-year
interim deal toward the surest path for independence. Its officers
in training here in Kostrce say they have ``clear divergences''
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the West cannot see reality, it's a big problem,'' said one
man, a former physical-education teacher. ``This isn't a war for
autonomy. This is an anti-colonial war, a war for our liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   And to a man, they dismiss the pacifist path of the writer
Ibrahim Rugova, the titular ethnic Albanian leader since 1989, and
suggest that his days are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any parent,'' an officer said, ``he thinks the children
will always stay little. But there is a day for them to take their
places. He must make way for us, the next generation.''

   ABC MOVING TOP MANAGEMENT FROM NEW YORK By BILL CARTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC will move more than 200 of its employees, including most of
its top management, from New York to Los Angeles within the next 18
months, ABC executives said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are intended to consolidate the management of the
network at the headquarters of Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent. Among
the divisions based in New York that will be relocated are daytime,
research, promotion and advertising, and corporate and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision involves 240 positions at ABC, about 5 percent of
its work force, but only 211 employees will be affected because the
other 29 positions are now vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the West Coast, first reported Wednesday in the
entertainment trade publication The Hollywood Reporter, reaches
even the network's top executive, Patricia Fili-Krushel, the
president of the network. Robert A. Iger, the president of ABC Inc,
will be based in both New York and Los Angeles, ABC executives
said, though it has not yet been determined where he will live.
</P>
<P>
   Among other ABC executives who received official notice last
week that their positions would be moving were Alex Wallau, the
president of administration; Angela Shapiro, the president of
daytime programming; Alan Wurtzel, the executive vice president of
research; Alan Cohen, the senior vice president of marketing, and
Patricia Matson, the senior vice president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matson said: ``We've known about this for some time. It's
not as if it was a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But several ABC executives who insisted on anonymity said they
were surprised by the move.
</P>
<P>
   Iger presented a broad outline of ABC's plans in a memorandum to
the company staff, issued last June. At that time he wrote that he
and the chairman of the Disney company, Michael Eisner, had devised
a plan to integrate more of the company's activities in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He announced then that the company would begin construction of a
new building on the Disney studio lot in Burbank, Calif., which
would be used to house ABC. Iger did not specify which employees
would be moved, but estimated they would number between 300 and
400.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo issued on Feb. 12, Iger said that to achieve the
company's ``day-to-day objectives'' it was critical that ``we be
adjacent to Disney senior management.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC will not make the move until September 2000, deciding to
give its employees long advance notice so they could plan their
personal lives around the decision. But employees must inform ABC
of their intention either to make the move or to leave the company
by Aug. 31 of this year.

COMEDY CENTRAL GOES INSIDE FOR CEO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ending a closely watched talent search, the Comedy
Central cable channel has decided to name Larry Divney, an
advertising executive at the channel, as president and chief
executive, people close to the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The choice, which could be announced as early as Thursday, is
noteworthy because Comedy Central is going with an insider as well
as an executive who does not have a background as a developer of
programming. Divney is the channel's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., which own Comedy
Central, confirmed the appointment. The officials said Divney was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The major networks have been struggling with declining audiences
because of competition from cable channels and other forms of
entertainment, including the Internet. As a result, they have been
looking to outsiders, principally from cable, to inject life into
their programming.
</P>
<P>
   Divney's predecessor, Douglas Herzog, was hired at the end of
last year as the president of Fox Entertainment, with Fox
executives making clear that they hoped he would bring the kind of
fresh ideas that have characterized many cable channels. In
addition, NBC hired Scott Sassa, who had spent most of his career
at the Turner cable company, to run its entertainment division last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Herzog, Comedy Central, an all-comedy channel that was
founded eight years ago and has 56 million subscribers, developed
offbeat but popular programs. These included ``South Park,'' an
animated show filled with foul language and violence that has
attracted a small but ardent following and is one of the
most-watched shows on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chairman of Time Warner's HBO unit, which
oversees the company's interest in Comedy Central, said the channel
had searched widely, talking to successful comedy producers, studio
executives, network executives and even a print journalist, Kurt
Andersen, an editor at The New Yorker and the former editor of New
York magazine. They went with Divney, he said, largely because he
had been with Comedy Central from its beginning and had a clear
grasp of its unusual style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew up with the channel and he understood it better than
anyone,'' Bewkes said.

GOP PLAN FOR SHORING UP SOCIAL SECURITY IS DISCLOSED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican chairman of the House subcommittee
that oversees Social Security provided the first details Wednesday
of his approach to shoring up the retirement system, saying that he
planned to introduce legislation that would create private
investment accounts but insulate retirees from the risks of the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee's Social Security Subcommittee, said the plan would use a
large portion of the federal budget surplus to finance the
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of both parties have made specific proposals on
Social Security, the Republican leadership has so far been
reluctant to endorse a particular approach, calling on President
Clinton instead to present a detailed package as the basis for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said his plan, which will be the starting point for the
bill most likely to reach the House floor later this year, would
still have to be reviewed by his party's leaders. But he said his
approach had the general support of most House Republicans, and his
willingness to outline legislation could mark the beginning of a
more intense debate over how the nation should deal with pressures
facing the social welfare system as the population ages.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have agreed with Clinton that 62 percent of
the projected federal budget surpluses, or $2.7 trillion over the
next 15 years, should be set aside to help put Social Security on
firmer financial footing as the baby boom generation approaches
retirement. While there is no assurance that the surpluses will
actually materialize, both parties are counting on them to minimize
or eliminate the need for benefit cuts or tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the two parties are far apart over how to use the money for
Social Security. Clinton, backed by nearly all Democrats in the
House and most in the Senate, wants to use the money to pay down
the national debt and earmark the savings for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties are skeptical that they can reach
agreement on an issue that is so politically sensitive and brings
out the deep ideological differences between them, especially in
the aftermath of the impeachment trial and with the 2000 elections
looming.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's approach, while still in tentative form and lacking many
of the details that could determine its fate, would use the surplus
to help individuals buy stocks and bonds for private accounts that
would be part of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he believed most people would do better under his plan
than under the current system. But he said his plan would set a
guaranteed benefit level that all retirees could count on even if
their investments performed poorly. Shaw did not provide details on
how the guarantee would be financed, and it was not clear whether
the plan would allow a benefit equal to what current retirees
receive, or if the level would have to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plan would also make private investment voluntary,
at least at first, permitting people intimidated by the stock
market to opt for the guaranteed benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw described his approach even as Clinton was holding an event
at the White House to develop support for his approach.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using the bulk of the surplus for debt reduction,
the president's plan calls for the federal government to invest a
portion of Social Security's reserves in the stock market in an
effort to generate higher returns. These reserves are currently
invested in a low-yielding but safe form of Treasury bond.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan rejects the creation of individual investment
accounts within the Social Security system, but calls for the use
of tax breaks to help finance new savings accounts for low- and
middle-income people as a supplement to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has said that generally it supports
setting aside 62 percent of the surplus until we save Social
Security,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``That's good and I appreciate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Clinton added, ``That's where the agreement ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's economic adviser, said the
administration had ``real skepticism'' about individual investment
accounts, but said Shaw's proposal could be constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the degree that he's putting his own specific ideas into
the debate rather than simply launching critiques, that's a
positive step,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and the Republican leadership have pledged
to work together to see if a bipartisan deal on Social Security is
possible this year. House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois will
meet with Clinton next week to discuss the issue. But so far there
have been no efforts by either side to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Without any changes, the system will run short of money to pay
all promised benefits starting in 2032.

 &HT;    Lauren conjures up a rainbow
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YOK _ Buyers and editors toasted designer Ralph Lauren with
a standing ovation Wednesday after his fall/winter collection
preview. The reed-thin Lauren had managed to design a dazzling
array of fine woolen pieces without once resorting to camel, the
most often-seen shade this Fashion Week. ``I didn't see a thing I
could wear,'' joked actor Samuel L. Jackson, who sat front row for
the all-womenswear show. ``But I'm sure there are some things there
my 16-year-old daughter (Zoe) would like.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that a double. Jackson's wife, actress LaTanya Jackson, a
Spelman College trustee, saw plenty to covet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad he's trying to bring color back,'' she said. ``We
African-Americans, especially, look good in bright colors.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Lauren's collection was rooted in the sportswear
aesthetic surprised no one. His attempt to inject his designs with
futuristic touches _ no-fuss fasteners, A-line shapes and minimal
ornamentation _ was equally predictable. And anyone who has paid
attention to New York designers' fabrics of choice for the next
cold season could have told you Lauren would bulk up on two-ply
cashmeres and featherweight felts.
</P>
<P>
   He did all the right things where prevailing trends are
concerned. Better still, he strayed far from the pack that's relied
on camel _ and other shades of brown.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members got a refreshing whiff of pale blue, pink,
purple, red, yellow and green along with the neutrals (black, gray
and cream.)
</P>
<P>
   The basic components of Lauren's collection were lean, clean
pants; awesome sweaters; knee-length skirts; and outerwear (from
vests to capes) to suit any lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   To keep a woman from looking like the clothes are wearing her,
Lauren made sure every jacket, shell, turtleneck and tunic had a
neckline that formed a flattering frame around the face. And to
illustrate the beauty of simplicity, his eveningwear consisted of
such all-American looks as felt shirts and turtlenecks over
same-shade satin skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that look of comfortable luxury,'' actress Lynn
Whitfield said. ``It's new and never pretentious.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Week gives buyers and the media a look at top designers'
clothing for fall/winter 1999-2000.

 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prevailing attitude among editors at Mark Eisen's
fall/winter preview show on Tuesday night was there were too many
styles that looked too coarse, too primitive, too misshapen, too
odd.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely stylish women will look to Eisen in particular
when it's time to spruce up their winter wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   In general terms, however, Eisen's show highlighted nearly all
of the fall/winter trends that have emerged during the runway
previews as well as expose some of the potential hazards along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Eisen said he wanted to prove that, ``The urban nomad of today
and timeless nomad of lore have more in common than meets the
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own meanderings through the prevailing trends, he made a
few wrong turns. But stylish women won't, as long as they watch
their steps more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Choose the right leather pieces. Leather, especially in
shades of brown, looks like it will be a wardrobe essential. Any
sleek, supple, sexy and shiny skirt, shirt, jacket or pants will
do. Eisen's saddle leather skirts were sleek, shiny and sexy _ in
an off-beat sort of way _ but far from supple. And they looked
ungainly in their short, slit interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Mothball any pair of pants that could be described as,
``Capri-length,'' as soon as summer ends. Every designer's showing
trim-fitting pants that flare out from the knee. Eisen did so, too,
but his stopped at the length of gauchos.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: When you select a coat with hidden, magnetic closures,
make sure those closure are actually hidden. Eisen telegraphed his
awareness of the magnetic closure trend by sewing a chunky,
functionless button to the outside of his coats.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Think modern, millenial even, but don't dress as if
you're an extra in the next set of ``Star Wars'' movies. Some of
Eisen's heavy wool dresses looked crude and boxy as if they'd been
sewn by Chewbaca and fitted on Obi Won Knobe.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5: Knitwear is surfacing as a force in coats, suits and
separates. And the shoulder-capping shrug, returns for another
cold-weather season as the hot item to have. But some designers'
sweater-over-sweater alternatives to donning traditional outerwear
are dead-ends, Eisen's included.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6: When you select a pair of knee-high boots make sure
they've got a modicum of sex appeal. Leather and suede boots with
moderate to high heels are getting as much exposure as flats did in
the spring/summer '99 collections. Eisen showed knee-high boots
with thick flat soles that caused his models to plod instead of
prance.
</P>
<P>
   Step 7: Get used to uttering the words ``corduroy'' and ``chic''
in the same sentence. Some designers have found a way of making
corduroy look less bulky and matted. But Eisen tried too hard to
make the most of corduroy _ using it for floor-length gowns _ and
wound up proving that moderation has its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller: Some editors here say things are ``quiet'' in
terms of fall/winter trends worth trumpeting. Be that as it may,
Nicole Miller certainly made some noise with her collection of
inspired suits, separates and gowns. Zip closures of her Lycra
cardigans. Scratch went the eye-catching Velcro closures on her
streamlined leather coats. Clink went the hook-and-eye closures on
the back of her felt dresses. Miller indulged in the color black
more than most designers have so far, but there was also an
abundance of color in the collection (teal, lilac, plum, raspberry,
and pink). She also introduced some eye-catching new fabrics, like
the ''crushed'' taffeta and ''reflective'' wool blends she used for
eveningwear.

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SPARK STOCK MARKET DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Stock prices fell sharply Wednesday, pulled down by
software and computer companies, which fell in the wake of
weaker-than-expected sales from Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, Dell's fourth-quarter numbers, released after
the market's close on Tuesday, were exemplary: a 49 percent jump in
net income but sales growth of ``only'' 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue number was a disappointment because Dell had
reported average quarterly sales growth of 56 percent over the
previous eight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had predicted Dell's sales would fall short of its
performance over the last two years, and the stock fell sharply on
Friday and again on Tuesday. It tumbled another 7 3/16 Wednesday ,
to 81 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Since the close on Feb. 11, Dell, the best-performing stock in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index over the last three years,
has declined 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that a market leader had stumbled spread through the
technology sector and spilled into the overall market, clipping
prices of everything from blue chips to small company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered
those that advanced by nearly 2 to 1. Volume on the Big Board was
moderate, at 735 million shares. On the Nasdaq, just more than 900
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.56 points, or 1.1
percent, to 9,195.47. The S&AMP;P 500 fell 17.84 points, or 1.4
percent, to 1,224.03. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies
was battered, dropping 6.87 points, or 1.7 percent, to 389.53. For
the year, the index is down 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest declines of the session were recorded by stocks
that make up the Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq fell 64.96 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2,248.91. Since
Feb. 11, the Nasdaq has declined 6.5 percent, its biggest
three-session loss since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons for the market to get hit, and
virtually no reasons for it to go up,'' said one stock trader. ``At
best, I think we will tread water between 9,100 and 9,400 on the
Dow. But I would not be at all surprised to see it take a little
hit and go through 9,100.''
</P>
<P>
   John Manley, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said
``strong pressures'' are working on stock prices, some positively,
others much less so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is trying to keep the financial system from imploding,
but economic growth in significant portions of the world, including
Europe and Latin America, is slowing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever,'' he added, ``the United States is affected by
what is happening overseas. The market action over the past five
days has been markedly affected by what is happening in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, the recent rise in Japanese interest rates has
not only pushed up bond yields but also shown that stocks are
vulnerable to an increase in interest rates. Bond prices rose
slightly and yields fell for a second day Wednesday, and the
improvement helped many interest-sensitive bank and financial
company shares.
</P>
<P>
   But that development did nothing to stem the decline in
high-flying technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the worst performing component of the Dow,
shedding 2], to 68[. Like Dell, Hewlett, the world's second-biggest
computer maker, reported a slowdown in its fiscal first-quarter
sales growth and said sales were likely to be lackluster for the
rest of the year. Traders chose to concentrate on the slower sales
and ignored earnings that beat analysts' consensus estimates by 9
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer manufacturers also got punished.
</P>
<P>
   IBM lost 2\, to 170{. And Compaq Computer fell 1 13/16, to 41.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading technology companies, Microsoft slumped 6\,
to 150. Cisco Systems lost 3 5/16, to 95[. And Sun Microsystems
fell 6], to 94 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Bond Prices Rise  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rose Wednesday for a second day as declining
commodity prices and a Federal Reserve report showing no pick-up in
industrial production bolstered expectations for subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in commodities, including gold, ``points to low
inflation,'' said Barry Evans, who helps oversee $10 billion of
bonds at John Hancock Funds in Boston, including some treasuries
purchased Wednesday. ``That's better for bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32, to 99 4/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, fell to 5.31 percent from 5.34 percent on Tuesday.  &QL;

U.S. WRITER SEVERELY HURT IN BEATING IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A prominent American writer on gay themes who
was beaten on Jan. 31 was in critical but stable condition here
Wednesday night, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, Robert Drake, 36, of Philadelphia, received ``severe
head injuries'' in Sligo, police said. No one has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, two men in their early 20s, accompanied by a lawyer,
made a statement in the case to police in Sligo. They have not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Drake's in the United States say the two young men
had told police that they beat him senseless in his apartment,
where he was working on a book, after he had made sexual overtures
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not confirm that Wednesday. National police
headquarters said the case had been referred to the director of
public prosecutions in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Drake won a Lambda award last year for an anthology in 1997,
``His 2: Brilliant New Fiction by Gay Writers,'' for which he was a
co-editor. His most recent book is ``The Gay Canon: Great Books
Every Gay Man Should Read.'' In the mid-'90s, he wrote a novel
about a gay man who is murdered because of his sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's former partner, Dr. E. Scott Pretorius, a radiologist at
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, has written to
friends of Drake, asking them to help provide $10,000 to fly him
back to the United States. Pretorius wrote that when he visited
Drake at William Beaumont Hospital here, Drake was barely conscious
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Pretorius also wrote to friends and officials of gay
organizations: ``Robert's family, friends and I are outraged by
this unimaginable act of violence against this gentle and kind
individual. It is my hope that the parties responsible will be
zealously prosecuted to the furthest extent of Irish law. Crimes
such as these are the natural byproduct of a culture which
continues to relegate gay men and lesbians to second-class
citizenship. We are seen as less than human by the terrorists who
commit crimes such as these.''
</P>
<P>
   Police here do not keep statistics on crimes specifically
against homosexuals. A spokesman said such crimes were rare in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals march without controversy in St. Patrick's Day
parades in Dublin, Cork and other large cities. Parliament has
several openly gay members, some of whom have been Cabinet
ministers. Gay bars and nightclubs operate openly here. And the
plays of one of Ireland's most famous gay men, Oscar Wilde, are
frequently performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an isolated crime,'' the police spokesman added.

U.S. ACCUSES BOSTON HOUSING AGENCY OF WIDE RACIAL BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal housing officials announced Wednesday that they
were filing their first charges ever of ``systemic
discrimination,'' accusing the Boston Housing Authority of failing
to stop the harassment of nine minority families in two
predominantly white housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from 1996 complaints by the nine families,
almost all headed by single mothers, that their young children were
beaten by gangs of white teen-agers, that their homes and cars were
vandalized and that they were otherwise terrorized, but the housing
authority failed to protect or promptly transfer them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just talking about individual acts of racial
violence, but acts of racial violence and harassment that almost
amounted to government-sanctioned lynchings,'' said Ozell Hudson,
executive director of the Boston Lawyers' Committee for Civil
Rights, which represents the families.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the federal charges Wednesday, the administrator
of the housing authority, Sandra B. Henriquez, said the agency's
policies had changed considerably since the families were harassed
from 1992 to 1996. It has brought in a civil rights protection plan
that includes a hot line for such complaints, has trained employees
in racial sensitivity and has moved more actively to evict
aggressors, she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The charges, filed by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, are to be heard before a department judge unless those
involved in the case ask to go to federal court instead. The
families have already brought a separate suit in federal court,
Hudson said, and are seeking at least $1 million along with the
dismissals of accused officials and other changes. HUD is seeking
unspecified damages for the victims and may also ask that the
housing authority be fined for its violations; it is also
considering whether to withdraw some funding from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The case highlights the difficulties of integrating housing
projects in Boston, which had a number of racial disputes over
busing in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The housing projects at issue, in South Boston and Charlestown,
were almost entirely white before a court ordered them to become
more integrated in the late 1980s. Black and Hispanic families thus
moved into a potentially hostile environment and, the families
charge, the housing authority was reluctant to transfer them when
they complained about living in fear.
</P>
<P>
   The families complained that, among other things, a gunshot was
fired into one of their homes and a woman in her third trimester of
pregnancy found that vandals had tied up the doorknob of her
apartment to prevent her from getting out.

MAYOR SAYS BOSTON HAS LOST OUT ON DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mayor Thomas M. Menino conceded Wednesday that Boston's
spirited longshot bid to host the 2000 Democratic National
Convention is dead and that the big party will instead be held in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Democratic National Committee, however,
denied that any formal decision had been made, but Menino said Joe
Andrew, the head of DNC's site selection committee, told him
Wednesday afternoon by telephone that a contract had been offered
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politics. That's the bottom line. We have a city that
wants it badly, that has come together like never before. But
California has 54 electoral votes,'' Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   Menino led Boston's first bid for a political convention and
made it to the final round of cities in the running, with Los
Angeles and Denver. The city proposed holding the convention in the
Fleet Center and assured party officials there were adequate hotel
rooms and other facilities; Menino said Boston was a laboratory for
Democratic policies and would have national appeal as the
``birthplace of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the media exposure from the four-day convention was deemed
to have more of an impact in California, a major battleground in
any modern presidential race, rather than in Massachusetts, which
traditionally votes Democratic anyway, Menino said. Massachusetts
has 12 electoral votes and the six-state New England region totals
35, compared to California's 54.
</P>
<P>
   Menino said Andrew told him Los Angeles was not a done deal, and
pleaded with him not to give up. ``He said there was some
possibility that LA wouldn't agree to stipulations in the contract,
but that's very slim. If they offer a contract, they offer a
contract, and they want it in LA.''
</P>
<P>
   A top City Hall official said Menino was so angered by a Clinton
administration report on racial problems in the city's public
housing developments he decided to preempt plans for a formal
announcement by national Democratic Party officials that the
convention would be held in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The report, made public Wednesday in Washington by US Housing
and Urban Development secretary Andrew Cuomo, angered Menino ``more
than anything else in his career'' and was viewed by the mayor as a
``cheap shot,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is said to be an informal agreement among the mayors of
the cities in the running for the convention to let national
Democrats make the formal announcement of the site. Menino said
Wednesday that ``nobody ever told me about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not spoken to President Clinton or Vice President
Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for
president in 2000, who is in South Africa but is expected in New
Hampshire in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall officials and national Democrats in Massachusetts and
Washington expressed surprise that Menino publicly threw in the
towel and officially denied that Los Angeles was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic National Committee has not made a final
decision on the city to host the 2000 Democratic National
Convention. Although we have intensified discussion with LA
recently, nothing has been finalized,'' said Melissa Bonney
Ratcliff, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Wednesday afternoon, Howard R. Leibowitz, head of
intergovernmental affairs at City Hall and the point man on
Boston's convention bid, said ``nothing was official.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, outgoing chairman of the DNC, said, likewise,
that Menino's concession was premature. ``Boston's convention bid
is by no means dead,'' he said. Grossman added that Menino's
comments will not condemn Boston's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't dispute the characterization of Los Angeles as the
front-runner. In many ways it has been the front-runner from the
beginning,'' Grossman said. ``I understand his disappointment in
what he perceives to be a decision already made. But these
discussions have by no means reached a conclusive stage.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, however, top party officials were
conceding that Menino's comments were accurate: that the Democrats
wanted to hold the convention in Los Angeles. Some officials
familiar with the negotiations even used the terms of a post-mortem
on Boston's bid, indicating the competition was indeed over. ``Few
cities did as well as Boston in the initial site visit. The mayor
was so gracious in welcoming everybody,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Menino acknowledged that Boston may have always been a longshot
for the convention, though he said the city proved it could host
the four-day affair from a logistical standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The bid for the gathering _ which would have brought 35,000
delegates, party officials, and media representatives to Boston,
pumped millions into the regional economy and gained the city
international publicity _ was initially viewed as a lark by some at
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But through the fall, many city officials became convinced that
Boston could actually land the convention, and Menino led a
personal campaign with Clinton, Gore, and others to keep the city
in the realm of serious consideration. Advisers said the mayor
regarded winning the DNC convention as the ultimate coup and a
major part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC's decision to go to Los Angeles comes on the heels of
MacWorld organizers this week announcing that they would not hold
their major convention in Boston. But city boosters say they are
now looking forward to other major events, such as the All-Star
game at Fenway Park this summer.

   Hammered by the loss of nearly a million industrial jobs since
1990, union leaders have settled for negligible wage increases for
the last three years. They have made big concessions on extra pay
for overtime and on weekend work. And they have watched helplessly
as many companies in eastern Germany refused to negotiate with them
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Germany's biggest union edged closer to an all-out strike
against manufacturers, the balance of power may be shifting.
Proclaiming ``an end to modesty'' in its demands, the giant IG
Metall metal workers' union has pressed its most aggressive wage
demands in years and promised to prepare for a strike if it did not
reach an agreement with industry by midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline passed without an agreement, but negotiators
continued to talk early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents 3.5 million workers, is holding out
for raises of more than 4 percent, plus a significant one-time
payment to each worker. The employers, which include
DaimlerChrysler and big manufacturers of machine tools and factory
equipment, have dismissed the demands and are offering a 2.3
percent raise and a maximum one-time payment of five-tenths of a
percent of a worker's salary.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is unusually bitter and comes at a difficult
time. German workers are among the highest paid in the world, but
unemployment in this country remains above 10 percent and the
economy has markedly slowed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   That poses a hard challenge for Germany's new Social Democratic
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who made unemployment the central
issue of his election campaign last fall. A major strike would
almost certainly ruin Schroeder's plans to create jobs through his
``Alliance for Jobs'' _ a series of round-table talks between
industry, unions and the government. Yet Schroeder cannot afford to
alienate unions, which have enormous power in his Social Democratic
Party. Indeed, the new labor minister, Walter Riester, is the
former vice chairman of IG Metall.
</P>
<P>
   German factory workers earn an average of $30.20 an hour,
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in Paris. That makes them the highest paid in the world
and well ahead of their American counterparts, with an average of
$23.60 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the average take-home pay of German workers has been
stagnant for the last three years, after accounting for inflation
and new tax increases. At the same time, productivity for each
worker has soared because of wage restraint and streamlining in
factories. The government estimates that productivity in
manufacturing industries has climbed 7 percent annually over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders argue that their members are overdue for a
significant raise. ``The industry is earning record profits and
their stocks have increased enormously,'' said Juergen Peters, vice
president of IG Metall. ``The workers have to take part in that, as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin America has
slowed the economy. Most experts think that growth will not exceed
2 percent this year, down from 2.8 percent in 1998, and that
unemployment will remain around 10 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strikes are rare in Germany, where companies and unions strive
for consensus whenever possible. As a result, union leaders have
been increasing pressure. In December, they announced their basic
demands. Then they staged a series of ``warning strikes'' of
several hours each at factories across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The union originally set a deadline for talks on Feb. 11. When
both sides refused to budge, the government offered to mediate.
Union leaders agreed to resume talks on Tuesday in Stuttgart,
setting the new deadline of midnight Wednesday. Barring success,
the union said its members would vote next week to strike on March
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very skeptical'' about reaching an agreement, said
Berthold Huber, the lead negotiator for IG Metall, as he took a
break from the talks on Wednesday evening. Huber and other union
leaders insisted that they wanted to avoid a strike and had
signaled their willingness to accept a wage increase of more than 4
percent instead of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The last strike by IG Metall was in 1995, when workers in
Bavaria remained off the job for two weeks. Before that, the last
truly big strike lasted seven weeks in 1984 in the states of
Baden-Wuerttemburg and Hesse, which led to a reduction in the
standard workweek to 35 hours from 37.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, has argued that
workers are overdue for a raise because wages have lagged well
behind increases in productivity. ``The workers have to receive a
fair share of what they have produced,'' he said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists argue that a surge in labor costs would
aggravate unemployment. ``The moderate wage policies in recent
years have brought about an improvement, and they should be
continued,'' said Harmen Lehment, a labor analyst at the Institute
for World Economics at the University of Kiel. ``What we don't want
to see is a repeat of 1995, when we had strikes in Bavaria and big
wage increases followed by rising unemployment. The moderate wage
policies in recent years should be continued.''

IN THE END, IT WAS POLITICS THAT DECIDED CONVENTION SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One has a historic backdrop. The other has an
endless parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But political decisions are rarely based on beauty. And
throughout the process of choosing a site for the 2000 Democratic
National Convention, politics have outweighed practicality, and
economics have overruled emotions, analysts and sources close to
the decision said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is essential to the Democrats' electoral process,''
Democratic consultant Bill Carrick, whose clients includes Boston
Mayor Thomas Menino, said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, a retired state senator who has led the charge to
bring the convention to Los Angeles, said that ``clearly, the 54
electoral votes'' in California makes a difference, overshadowing
Massachusetts' meager 12.
</P>
<P>
   Although, he joked, he and Senator Edward M. Kennedy ``have been
arguing about what's better in the summer, the Cape or Malibu. I
said, we've got sailboats out here, too, Ted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Democrats close to the negotiations, Boston has all
the baseline logistical requirements for hosting the convention: a
sizable convention hall, just enough hotel space for the 20,000 or
so overnight guests, and a political climate overwhelmingly
friendly to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Big Dig, with its unsightly construction sites and
mounds of dirt, is not an automatic strike against Boston. One
Democrat familiar with the negotiations said convention planners at
the Democratic National Committee ``asked a lot of questions about
the Big Dig.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Boston was very good at being very up front about
it, giving information about where they were at with the Big Dig
and where they thought they would be in 2000,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the three front-runners _ Boston, Los Angeles and
Denver _ have pledged roughly equal amounts, in the ballpark of $35
million, so the bottom line would not be a deciding factor in which
city would land the lucrative deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the source of the money would likely play a role: While
Boston and Denver relied heavily on state and city funding in their
proposals, the Los Angeles package mirrored its 1984 Olympics bid,
relying mostly on private donors and not buradening taxpayers,
several Democratic sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, however, is politics.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Brockelman, director of the Massachusetts
Republican Party, the difficulties Boston's Democrats have had in
attempting to lure the convention is proof of their powerlessness
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has put together a great package,'' Brockelman said.
But, he added, ``We know our delegation has zero clout in Congress.
Now it is starting to look like they have zero clout in their own
party.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a source close to the negotiations defended the effort
by Boston officials, saying ``they had a very solid proposal,'' and
their proposal is still ``right up there, and it's very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about bringing the Democrats to California _
home of Monica S. Lewinsky and one of Vice President Al Gore's more
high-profile fund-raising debacles _ political experts said the
benefits of such a decision would far outweigh any risks,
particularly because California is a greater question mark in
Gore's presidential race than Boston or Massachusetts.
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the
apparent choice of Los Angeles was ``a decision obviously made by
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if we lost it to Salt Lake City we could get
suspicious,'' Frank said, referring to the recent Olympics scandal
in Utah. ``But losing it to Los Angeles? It was a political
calculation made by Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee refused Wednesday to confirm
reports that Los Angeles had already won the contract. Melissa
Bonney Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the DNC, issued a statement:
``Although we have intensified discussions with Los Angeles
recently, nothing has been finalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the DNC are expected to make a formal announcement
in early March, some 17 months before the August 2000 convention
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wednesday's concessional remarks made by Menino, even
Torres, the California State Democratic Party chairman, refused to
celebrate Los Angeles's apparent victory, saying he had not been
informed by Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew,'' he said, ``I'd be jumping up and down.''

30-YEAR MURDER CHARGE AGAINST FORMER BLACK PANTHER IS DROPPED
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For 30 years, Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt and the
State of California have been at war with each other.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the state raised the white flag.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse, four-paragraph statement, the Los Angeles County
district attorney, Gil Garcetti, said his office will no longer try
to send Pratt, a former leader of the Black Panther Party, back to
prison for the 1968 robbery and murder of a woman on a Santa Monica
tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt spent 27 years in jail and prison for the slaying, but
steadfastly maintained his innocence, filing numerous appeals. In
1997 an Orange County Superior Court judge, Everett W. Dickey,
threw out the conviction, ruling that prosecutors had withheld
crucial evidence about a witness that may have cleared the
decorated Vietnam War veteran at his trial in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 51, a defiant symbol of the black empowerment movement of
the 1960s, was released to a hero's welcome. But Garcetti appealed
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a state appellate court unanimously upheld Dickey's
decision, and on Wednesday Garcetti said the criminal case against
Pratt was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accept the decision of the court of appeals,'' Garcetti
said in a statement. ``The murder at issue in this case occurred
over 30 years ago. Most of the witnesses to the case are deceased.
It would be virtually impossible to retry this case. In our
professional judgment, there would be no reasonable likelihood of
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and associate dean
of the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said Garcetti's decision
was ``probably the only decision he could make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because the DA's still believe Pratt was
responsible for the murder,'' Ms. Levenson said. ``They don't have
their eyewitnesses anymore, their government informant is worth
zero and all the police officers who worked with the informant are
tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   At their home in Louisiana, Ashaki Pratt, who married Pratt
during his first decade of imprisonment, said she was overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finally over,'' she said. ``I'm just so happy. At last.
At last. It's finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hanlon, one of Pratt's lawyers, said he felt a mixture of
joy, anger and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very fulfilling to reach this point after all these
years,'' Hanlon said. ``But my overwhelming feeling is anger.
Garcetti fought us every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the criminal case is over, Hanlon said Pratt's lawyers,
including Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., will be able to devote much more
time and energy to Pratt's civil lawsuit against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Hanlon said, ``we're going to see what a jury thinks of
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The case stretches back to a December night in 1968. A young
couple, Kenneth and Caroline Olsen, were playing tennis under the
lights when two men approached them and demanded money. The men got
$18 and then started shooting. Mrs. Olsen was killed and her
husband was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a rising star in the Black Panther Party, was arrested
two years later and convicted in 1972, largely on the testimony of
a former Black Panther and one-time Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputy, Julius Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt said he was innocent and had been at a party meeting in
Oakland at the time of the killing. But the case began to slowly
unravel several years later when it was revealed that Butler had
been a police informant, a fact that had been kept from Pratt's
lawyers. It was also disclosed that Butler had been given money by
the authorities to buy a gun and other favors around the time he
was testifying against Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most human beings cannot do what Geronimo Pratt did,'' said
Gigi Gordon, a prominent Los Angeles lawyer and legal commentator.
``They don't have the strength, the endurance, and they don't
believe enough in the system to believe they can be saved. You have
to believe in the system to fight the system. Or you give up.''

A FATAL MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more man's nature
runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Bacon, 1625 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Commonwealth of Massachusetts took its
ultimate revenge was shortly after midnight on the 9th of May,
1947, when two petty hoodlums named Edward ``Dutchy'' Gersten and
Philip Bellino received the usual 2,200 volts of electricity in the
old Charlestown State Prison, long since torn down. The two had
killed a man during a stickup gone wrong at a floating crap game.
Nobody in Massachusetts has since been executed.
</P>
<P>
   Governor &UR;  &LR; Paul Cellucci, fulfilling a campaign promise, would
revive that practice, which the state put behind it more than 50
years ago. ``I am more determined than ever to wage this fight for
justice,'' Cellucci said, describing murderers as ``monsters who do
not deserve hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Many murderers are indeed monsters who do not deserve hope, the
murder of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley being a case in point.
However, there is life without parole to deny murderers hope.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci says the death penalty would act as a deterrent. Yet
the statistical evidence does not support him. States that execute
their criminals do not generally produce fewer murderers than
states that do not, such as Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The governor proposes an elaborate set of safeguards to prevent
innocent persons from going to their deaths. Yet here again, the
evidence shows case after case of death row inmates who are found
not to have done it after all. In Illinois there have been 10 such
cases in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, when all is said and done it is a matter of revenge.
Undeniably, retribution is a legitimate part of punishment, and we
can understand the governor's desire for it. But instead of turning
``the heat up,'' as Cellucci asked voters to do, it is time to turn
the heat down on this emotional issue. The needs of retribution can
be met without the too-wild justice of death. Massachusetts is one
of only 12 states to eschew the death penalty, and it should remain
proud of it.

DUE PROCESS FOR A TERRORIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turkey's capture of the Kurdish terrorist Abdullah Ocalan has
all the elements of a garish potboiler about terrorism,
international intrigue, and the duplicity of nation-states, those
entities that Lord Acton called ``cold monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not clear exactly how Ocalan ended up in the
clutches of a Turkish special operations unit in Nairobi, Kenya, it
is clear that the Greek Embassy sheltered him. There is no good
reason for the Greek government to meddle in the bitter conflict
between Turkish authorities and the Kurdish separatists lest it be
to follow blindly the old Balkan principle that the enemy of my
enemy is my friend. There are more than enough causes of hostility
between Athens and Ankara without adding to the docket a Greek
intervention in a civil war that has snuffed out 30,000 lives. It
would be fitting if the Greek officials who approved the sheltering
of Ocalan were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   As for those Kurds who assaulted Greek and Kenyan embassies
around the world, taking women and children hostage, they have done
considerable harm to their cause. Rather than eliciting sympathy
for the 10 million Turkish Kurds, the protesters drew comparisons
with IRA bombers and the Palestinian terrorists of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ocalan has fallen into Turkish hands, the government of
Turkey's Social Democratic prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, would be
wise to demonstrate that it is capable of honoring Ocalan's human
rights by giving him a trial that the world can watch and adjudge
to be fair. Lawyers of his choice should be able to defend their
client without arbitrary restrictions. Although the Turks are not
always wise in these matters, Ocalan must not be tortured by his
jailers. In any case, Turkey's brutal repression of its Kurdish
minority cannot excuse the tactics of Ocalan and his terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately both Turks and Kurds will have to seek and find a
negotiated political solution to their conflict.

ISRAEL ON HEIGHTENED ALERT FOR ATTACKS BY KURDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: KURD-EUROPE, KURD-TURKEY, KURD-U.S.) 
(rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel is bracing for reprisals after Wednesday's
killings of three Kurdish protesters at its consulate in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   It was already a target of Kurdish rage because of its strong
military and intelligence links with Turkey. Followers of the
arrested Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan have accused Mossad,
Israel's overseas intelligence service, of helping to track him
down. They contend that Turkey and Israel are joining in a ``dirty
war'' against his Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts in Jerusalem said they have concluded that Israel
would not have helped to carry out the capture, while conceding
that Israeli has offered antiterrorist assistance to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Israel and Turkey have forged a high-profile
strategic alliance that has served as a counterweight to mutual
perceived threats from Syria and Iran. Israeli pilots have trained
in Turkish air space, the two countries have carried out a joint
naval rescue exercise, and Israel has upgraded Turkish fighter
planes.
</P>
<P>
   There have been mutual visits by defense and military chiefs
from both countries, meetings between intelligence officials and a
military cooperation agreement signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Along with intelligence-sharing, Israel has advised Turkey on
antiterrorism methods, which the Turks have used in their long war
with Ocalan's separatist Kurdish movement. The methods have
reportedly included fencing-off and mining border areas, curfews
and interrogation techniques, cross-border incursions against
guerrilla bases in Iraq and establishment of a Turkish controlled
``security zone'' there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Israeli governments have avoided taking a direct and active
role in Turkey's war with the Kurds. ``Israel doesn't want to open
a new front with terrorism, because we have enough problems
already,'' said Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist who has written
a book on Israel's intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, Melman added, it is unlikely that Israel
would have participated in the capture of Ocalan, despite Turkish
requests for help in tracking him down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew a distinction between
antiterrorism assistance to Turkey and the capture of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's activity does not include any role in the struggle
against Ocalan, and we did not cooperate with any element in
apprehending Ocalan,'' Netanyahu told a news conference. ``We
always fight terrorism, and we will always fight terrorism, but we
certainly had no part in the capture of Ocalan.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether or not Israel was involved in seizing
Ocalan, it has been drawn into the maelstrom set off by his arrest.
Israeli embassies, consulates and airlines have been put on
heightened security alert amid growing concerns that this country,
long a target of Arab terrorist attacks, could now become a target
of Kurdish terrorism.

FLYING THROUGH TURBULENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annals of labor have many loftier causes than those at issue
between American Airlines and its fractious pilot corps. Most labor
disagreements involve primarily the parties themselves, with
limited collateral damage to customers and the general public. But
American and its pilots have demonstrated a willingness to visit
inconvenience, congestion, and delay on hundreds of thousands of
passengers throughout the industry. It is less than a tribute in a
field where common sense should prevail. No kamikaze spirit here,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pilots' concerns are legitimate. There are issues
that rumble through an industry in flux and driven by intense
competition, with periodic price wars, constant pressure to cut
costs, and frequent attempts to start new regional lines. Pilots,
cabin personnel, and other employees have turned to strikes in
clashes over hours and conditions of work.
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines dispute is only peripherally related to
these issues. The airline is acquiring a regional carrier, Reno
Air, with a rival union, lower pay scales, and different work
rules. American's pilots object to the way the integration will
occur. They argue that their contract requires that all of
American's pilots belong to their union and receive their pay and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute at this point does not involve their own
security or compensation. It is, as one pilot said, a matter of a
slippery slope in which future rights might be eroded. The
breakdown of talks on the issue argues that there were hardened
positions on both sides that led to the sickout, crippling
operations until a federal judge intervened and fined the pilots
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among organized employees, pilots are well paid and generally
enjoy public confidence and admiration. The spectacle of
knock-down, drag-out battles between privileged parties enhances no
one's reputation and runs the risk of alienating a flying public
that already sees itself more in the role of cattle than paying
customer. Some accommodation, please, on both sides.

SUIT FOCUSES ON WEEKEND RETAIL PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Does a ``weekend warrior'' retailer _ a chain that
opens its stores only on weekends _ use inventory practices and
pricing policies that are so peculiar and rare that they constitute
trade secrets that merit special protection?
</P>
<P>
   That's an issue that may have to be decided by Suffolk Superior
Court judge Barbara J. Rouse.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday an attorney for the Westwood company that operates
Frugal Fannie's Fashion Warehouse told Rouse's court that its trade
secrets may have been compromised when Filene's Basement Corp.
hired Frugal Fannie's former president last year to help launch
Aisle 3, a chain of stores that, like Frugal Fannie's, will open
only on weekends and holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Frugal Fannie's is seeking a preliminary injunction that would
prevent its former president, James A. McGowan, from working for
Aisle 3's weekend-only operations; McGowan could still work for the
Basement's seven-day-a-week operations.
</P>
<P>
   But what Frugal Fannie's regards as trade secrets are common
industry practices, and it is harldy the only weekend warrior in
retail, claims Wellesley-based Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case about trade secrets; this is a case about
competition,'' said Basement attorney Robert Popeo of the Boston
law firm of Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse heard arguments from both sides Wednesday but did not
issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   One odd twist in the case: Court documents hint that the
Basement was in negotiations to acquire Frugal Fannie's in the
fall. Negotiations broke off before a deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the case may be what constitutes a weekend
warrior's retail trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   With estimated annual revenues of about $60 million, Frugal
Fannie's operates about seven stores.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to augment annual revenues of about $560 million,
Filene's Basement plans to open the Aisle 3 weekend chain that will
be separate from its traditional off-price stores. The new chain
will open its first stores in Maryland, New York, and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   According to Frugal Fannie's, operating a weekend store is
radically different from running a seven-day-a-week retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory practices, pricing policies, and advertising
strategies that a weekend store uses are so singular that they
constitute trade secrets, said Frugal Fannie attorney Kenneth R.
Berman of the Boston law firm of Sherin and Lodgen.
</P>
<P>
   And when Filene's Basement hired McGowan, a top Frugal Fannie's
executive from 1996 to 1998, to help launch its Aisle 3 format, the
Basement may have improperly benefitted from Frugal Fannie's trade
secrets, Berman claimed.
</P>
<P>
   In dispute is how McGowan left Frugal Fannie's. One scenario had
him resigning after Frugal Fannie's rejected his plan to rapidly
expand the chain. Another had him taking this blueprint for weekend
growth to Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   According to Frugal Fannie's, McGowan signed on as a
$30,000-per-month consultant to Filene's Basement in June while he
was still an executive at Frugal Fannie's, a characterization
disputed by McGowan's attorney, Mary E. O'Neal of the Boston law
firm of Masterman Culbert &AMP; Tully.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing on behalf of Filene's Basement, Popeo said that Aisle
3's stores will be much larger than Frugal Fannies stores and have
a very different merchandise mix.
</P>
<P>
   Frugal Fannie's sells mostly private-label clothing to women,
Popeo claimed, but Aisle 3 will sell brand-name men's and women's
clothing as well as home furnishings and gourmet food.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for nine Aisle 3 stores to open this year; none of
these stores will be ``within 50 miles'' of an existing Frugal
Fannie's store, Popeo asserted, though Berman wondered whether
future Aisle 3 stores would encroach on Frugal Fannie turf.
</P>
<P>
   Popeo also noted that Filene's Basement has paid various
consultants about $10 million in its efforts to launch Aisle 3.
</P>
<P>
   If McGowan had shared any trade secrets with his new employer
and if these secrets had any value to a retailer whose annual sales
are nearly 10 times greater than Frugal Fannie's, the Basement
wouldn't have needed the services of so many consultants, Popeo
suggested.

NEWS ANALYSIS: NOT ALL DEBT IS BAD, ADMINISTRATION TELLS GOP
CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are finding all kinds of suspicious
elements in President Clinton's budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   First, they accused the administration of double counting the
surplus in the Social Security program _ the amount by which
payroll taxes in a given year exceed payments to retirees _ by
adding it twice to the Social Security trust fund. Though the
charge is technically accurate, it lacks, according to many
economists, the nefarious purpose or impact implied by its critics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif., a member of the House budget
committee, pointing to page 389 of the president's budget, accuses
the president of proposing to increase the federal debt by more
than $1 trillion by 2004. So a budget that the administration
boasts would use trillions of dollars over the next 15 years to buy
back government bonds held by the public in reality, according to
this argument, digs a deeper financial hole.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, says the plan will put a ``large burden on our children
and grandchildren who will have to repay this debt.'' Sen. William
V. Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has
made similar criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, according to administration officials and many
outside analysts, the Republican accusations are factually correct
but substantively confused.
</P>
<P>
   Herger asks, ``If, as the administration claims, the budget is
balanced and saves Social Security, why is federal debt still
rising?''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's answer also lies on page 389 of the budget,
two lines below the figures Herger focuses on. The table shows that
under the Clinton plan, federal debt held by the public _ let's
call it external debt _ falls from about $3.7 trillion today to
about $3.3 trillion in 2004. But, as the Republican critics note,
total federal debt rises from about $5.6 trillion to about $6.8
trillion during the same period. Total debt equals debt held by the
public (external debt) plus debt held by various government
agencies or trust funds (let's call that internal debt).
</P>
<P>
   The answer to Herger's question is that the two debt figures
move in opposite directions because the president proposes to use
surplus revenue from the Social Security payroll tax to buy back
government bonds held by the public. External debt would fall. The
president would then, in effect, deposit the purchased bonds into
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Internal debt would
rise, because the bonds represent loans from the trust funds to the
Treasury. Some day the funds will return those bonds for cash.
</P>
<P>
   So which side has the better economic case: the Democrats, who
point to falling external debt as a virtue, or the Republicans, who
point to rising internal debt as a vice?
</P>
<P>
   External debt _ borrowing money from the public _ has real
economic consequences. It siphons dollars away from savers and,
therefore, private capital markets. Private investment drops,
leaving the economy with less plant, equipment and technological
change. Depending on how the government uses the borrowed money,
economic growth could suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Internal debt siphons no money out of the economy. It draws down
no private saving or investment. For one agency to lend money to
another agency is akin to taking $20 out of one's right pocket,
depositing it into the left pocket and reimbursing the right pocket
with a $20 IOU. The internal loan does not change the person's
financial status one iota. One can still spend $20, nothing more
and nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   By running down external debt and running up internal debt, the
president leaves more money in private capital markets. Indeed, his
plan nearly wipes out external debt, drawing it down from almost 45
percent of gross domestic product today to about 7 percent in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Internal debt soars under the plan: The right pocket of
government owes the left pocket a whole lot more money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Archer takes a look at these trends and cries foul on behalf
of his grandchildren. The administration's defense comes in two
parts.
</P>
<P>
   First, its budget would not raise Social Security spending by a
nickel now or in the future. Retirement benefits are determined by
statute, not by the size of the trust fund. If Clinton never added
a bond to the trust fund, government would still owe retirees money
_ money that, if otherwise unavailable, would have to be raised by
borrowing or taxing. The bonds add no burden on future taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the administration's budget projections show large
overall surpluses even during the years when the Social Security
trust fund will be returning bonds to the Treasury for cash. The
surpluses, if they materialize, guarantee that the Treasury would
have enough cash to redeem the Social Security bonds and still pay
for other federal programs. Archer's grandchildren will not have to
pay extra taxes. Nor will government have to invade private capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate reasons to question the president's plan.
Should Congress pledge money to Social Security based on guesses
that federal surpluses will materialize in the future? Should
Congress, by piling up bonds in the Social Security and Medicare
trust funds, give those programs first call on general tax
revenues? After all, the political consensus behind Social Security
rests in part on the fact that the program has depended from its
inception on its own source of money, the payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   But recent Republican criticisms take on different colors.
``Debt is debt, and no matter how classified, our children and
grandchildren must repay,'' Herger says.
</P>
<P>
   This, says the administration, reflects a fundamental confusion.
All debt is far from the same. External debt can be cancerous.
Internal debt is benign. There is as much need to drive down
internal debt as there is for my right pocket to repay my left
pocket.

HUD CHARGES BOSTON WITH HOUSING DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal housing officials charged Boston Wednesday
with ``systematic discrimination'' against nine minority families
when they lived in South Boston and Charlestown housing
developments, calling it the most serious discrimination case ever
brought against a local housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Housing discrimination is an ugly part of our nation's past
that has no place in America today,'' said Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo
</P>
<P>
   Claims of racially motivated vandalism, assaults, and harassment
were downplayed or ignored by Boston housing officials from 1990
through 1996, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development
found in a three-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for protection and emergency transfers ran into brick
walls of bureaucracy, with Boston Housing Authority police and
staff members refusing to uphold civil rights complaints or
demanding extensive data to back up the simplest assault claim,
according to HUD.
</P>
<P>
   At times, even though Boston police substantiated claims of
harassment or hate crimes, the information never made it into BHA
files or was not pursued by the housing agency, HUD found.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, BHA never invoked lease restrictions that permitted
officials to evict tenants for harassing minority neighbors by
setting fires, tying doors closed, smashing windows, and slashing
tires, HUD found.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo also announced a 30-day investigation into the BHA's
actions since 1996. A HUD special counsel will determine whether
Boston followed through on a 1996 agreement with the federal
government to enforce a policy of ``zero tolerance'' of racial and
ethnic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the findings of that review, HUD could tighten
supervision on BHA or further restrict how it spends the $141
million a year it receives in federal money, Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, lawyers for the nine families welcomed HUD's
findings, although they said the three-year wait was hard on their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients have waited a long time for their complaints to be
vindicated,'' said Nadine Cohen, an attorney volunteering for the
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, an arm of the Boston Bar
Association. ``There was a culture at BHA that didn't want to see
the harassment going on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the HUD findings, the nine families can choose to
seek damages from one of three forums: an administrative law judge,
suits filed through the Department of Justice in US District Court,
or pursuing the civil suit already pending against BHA and city
officials in federal Court.
</P>
<P>
   The families would have to ask for damages based on the
emotional distress and lost materials they suffered. But the BHA's
exposure varies widely depending on which avenue the families
follow: An administrative law judge could order BHA to pay up to
$10,000 for each of the nine victims plus another $10,000 for the
systemic discrimination that HUD found. If the federal government
sued, BHA could face fines of up to $50,000 per offense. But if the
families pursue the suit they filed in February 1996, BHA could
face unlimited damages, according to HUD officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas Menino was visibly upset Wednesday over the damning
report, about which he said he expected a warning from HUD and
Cuomo specifically, rather than being ``blindsided'' by press
reports. Menino defended BHA Administrator Sandra Henriquez and
recent efforts by the agency to evict wrongdoers and stamp out
intolerance. Menino and Henriquez, who was hired in 1996, stressed
that none of the incidents cited by HUD occurred on her watch.
</P>
<P>
   But City Council President James Kelly, of South Boston,
questioned HUD's findings and said he has reviewed complaints of
minority residents of South Boston housing complexes in the past
and found them to be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect there's a lot of fabrication and a lot of
exaggeration in the least,'' Kelly said. ``It's all about making a
financial settlement for people who are willing to take the time
and claim that they've been victimized by white people in general
and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ozell Hudson, executive director of the Lawyers
Committee for Civil Rights, representing the tenants for free, said
that while his clients will accept at least $1 million in
compensation for the incidents, the case is not motivated simply by
money awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about remedying the longstanding practice of
discrimination,'' Hudson said. ``BHA acquiesed and condoned this
systematic, egregious discrimination and became co-conspirators in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD's findings of a failure system-wide at the BHA to shield
tenants or to even devise a clear procedure for seeking remedies
for discrimination differs from its past cases. HUD has always been
able to reach settlements between city housing agencies and the
complaining tenants, said one HUD official in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston did not move to integrate the Old Colony housing
development in South Boston and the Bunker Hill development in
Charlestown until the federal government forced the move in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, with a consent decree in place, HUD said, the agency
did not protect tenants from racial and ethnic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``BHA is one of the bureaucracies where who you know gets you
your job and allows you to keep your job,'' said Hudson, adding
that BHA employees should be disciplined or fired in the wake of
the HUD report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads might have to roll,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   The BHA, said HUD, has argued that it had policies in place to
protect its tenants between 1992 and 1996, and that significant
improvements had been made since 1996. But HUD rejected these
arguments.

WALTERS SEEKS NOD FROM STARR TO INTERVIEW LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barbara Walters of ABC News continues to be
frustrated by the Office of the Independent Counsel in her effort
to interview Monica Lewinsky, but the newswoman hopes to gain the
necessary clearance by the end of this week, said ABC News
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said there was cautious hope that Walters would
get the interview in time for it to be broadcast on ``20/20'' on
March 3, the final night of the February ``sweeps'' rating period,
whose Nielsen rating figures are used to set advertising rates for
the next quarterly period.
</P>
<P>
   Although the impeachment proceedings have ended, Ms. Lewinsky
has not yet been given dispensation from Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, to proceed with her agreed-upon exclusive
interview with Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, did not respond to
telephone messages seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to
discuss the conditions under which Ms. Lewinsky might be permitted
to speak to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement specifies that ``pending a
final resolution of this matter,'' she may not talk to
representatives of news organizations ``without first obtaining the
OIC's approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky's book, co-authored with Andrew Morton,
is nearly finished. But the publisher, St. Martin's Press, is still
deciding how to proceed. Within St. Martin's, a division of
Macmillan Publishers Ltd., there has been debate about whether the
silencing order could be skirted by insisting that Morton, as an
author, is not a member of a news organization.
</P>
<P>
   A publishing executive who insisted on anonymity said Ms.
Lewinsky would not proceed with the interview with Walters unless
the book was completed because of concerns that the book's sales
would be hurt if it was published too far after the interview. St.
Martin's is hoping the book will be completed by the end of this
month.

   HOLLANDE BOURU, Guinea _ Amadou Diallo, wrapped in a white cloth
and covered with hand-hewn logs and fragrant leaves, was buried
Wednesday under a fig tree in the village that his
great-grandfather founded more than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral, deep in the parched countryside of Guinea, ended a
remarkable journey that began with the death of Diallo death two
weeks ago, when he was shot by four New York City police officers
who were searching for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 relatives and friends, including two government
ministers and every local official, crowded into the village of
round thatched huts and simple concrete-block houses. Most walked
to Hollande Bouru across miles of rock-studded fields and past
fences of dried twigs lashed together. Many had been waiting since
Sunday in the village, which has no electricity or running water,
to recite prayers over Diallo's body and to accompany it with
melodic chanting to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The number of mourners was a sign of the size and prestige of
his vast extended family in Guinea, a country of 7 million where
Diallo's ethnic group, the Fulani, makes up 40 percent of the
population. It was also further evidence of how Diallo, an unarmed
black immigrant shot at 41 times by white officers at his home in
the Bronx, has become a symbol for many Guineans of everything that
can go wrong for a young black man who tries to follow a dream of a
better life far from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my father saying before he died, `God bless
America,''' said Amadou Balde, who is married to one of Diallo's
aunts and drives a taxi in the capital, Conakry, 300 miles south of
Hollande Bouru. ``But when I got big, I realized that in America
somebody can just take a gun and prey on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The plain pine coffin containing Diallo's body arrived in the
village before dawn, having made a journey from a Harlem funeral
home to the Islamic Cultural Center of New York for a tumultuous
prayer service, and to Newark (N.J.) International Airport at the
head of a motorcade organized by the National Action Network, a
black political organization.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the coffin in Conakry on Monday night was greeted
by the country's government ministers, who led a procession that
sped the body from the airport to a morgue. But when the
much-traveled coffin arrived by Guinean military truck in Hollande
Bouru, it was met with a ritual of simple dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers placed it on a carpet in a small concrete-block
building, called the Grandfathers' House, where all the significant
events, from marriage to communal meetings to funeral services,
take place. Women and men filed in to weep or pray silently.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's 71-year-old maternal grandfather, Ahmadou Bailo Diallo,
edged in and nodded to the men around him to open the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   When the zinc-lined top was lifted off, he gently turned back
the shroud covering his grandson's face for the mourners to see.
The grandfather's expression did not change.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo, who spent most of his life outside Guinea,
visited Hollande Bouru, a village of 10,000 people, on school
holidays, but never lived there. Still, his father, Saikou Amad
Diallo, is one of its wealthiest and most prominent men. A trader
since his teens, when he bought a truck and drove it loaded with
cotton, coffee and other products from Guinea to neighboring
countries, Saikou Diallo set up import-export companies in Liberia,
Singapore, Thailand and Togo.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of the death of Amadou, the third of his four sons,
he flew to New York from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which is now
his home. His trip with his son's body is his first visit here in
14 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saikou Diallo received condolences and greetings from the porch
of a concrete house, one of the largest in the village, that he
built in 1973. Hollande Bouru, he said, was founded by his
grandfather, who brought his relatives there from a nearby city to
raise cattle. The villagers still have cattle and grow corn and
root vegetables. Orange trees rise from the packed dirt between the
huts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a poor village,'' said the elder Diallo. Then he
corrected himself. ``It's poor, of course,'' he added. ``But
everyone survives on their own labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The only funeral ever held in the village that rivaled Diallo's
in size was that of his paternal grandfather, Ibrahim, who taught
boys from all the surrounding villages the Islamic holy book, the
Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo was buried next to his revered grandfather. Saikou
Diallo said he planned to build a Koranic school near the cemetery
to honor both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, shortly after Diallo's parents
arrived at the village from Conakry after a nine-hour trip on roads
that ranged from rutted asphalt to red dirt, the coffin was carried
to a spot near the cemetery and placed in front of a twisted bare
tree called the teke, facing east toward Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   There, speakers raised the subject of how Diallo died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to say to the men of the village where Amadou's
father and grandfather come from, that we in America pledge to
fight for justice for Amadou,'' the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has made
the Diallo killing a political cause for his National Action
Network and helped finance the parents' trips to New York and to
Guinea, said in remarks translated into the Fulani language. ``We
will not rest until those who are guilty face justice.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of men rose to carry the coffin to the cemetery, where
it was opened and the shrouded body gently lowered into the grave.
Atop the body, the men placed lengths of different kinds of wood,
cut from trees near the village, followed by boughs from the fig
tree above and, finally, dirt. In keeping with Islamic custom, the
coffin was discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Calmly, the crowd turned from the grave and wandered back
through the village for conversation and food and to comfort the
family.

AN EPIC DRAMA OF THE `FLOWER THAT HAS MADE MEN MAD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tulips still entice with their vibrant colors, their sensuous
shape, their delicate grace, their promise of summer to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips, though, have now become so commonplace that they are
sold in grocery stores, which is why it is difficult to imagine
that this one flower could create fortunes, prompt bankruptcies,
undermine heads of state, spur intrigues, engender passions, foster
art in various mediums and enflame unquenchable obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is indeed the amazing history of the tulip, as British
gardening writer Anna Pavord makes clear in her fascinating and
sumptuous new account, ``The Tulip: The Story of a Flower That Has
Made Men Mad'' (Bloomsbury, 439 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   This is not a gardening book, with planting tips and how-to
hints. This is instead an epic drama, a true tale that spans
continents and centuries, shows humankind at its worst and its
best, with heroes and villains galore., And it's already a No. 1
best seller in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more astonished by its success than the author
herself, one of Britain's leading gardening journalists, who
thought for a long time that all the research on tulips that she
had collected over the years was probably just a reflection of her
own obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Pavord, 58, has been so consumed by tulips that she had no
hesitancy about driving through dangerous, isolated sections of the
Turkish countryside, near the border with Iran, in hopes of
actually glimpsing tulips growing in the wild. And She was not even
deterred even when frequent army roadroundblocks resulted in
machine guns being stuck poked inside the car.
</P>
<P>
   Pavord and her companions, including her husband of 33 years,
were deathly afraid, but the mission was definitely worth the
perils. She was searching, after all, for tulips.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had died then,'' Pavord said in an interview, ``I would
have died happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavord is a Wales-born force of nature, a farmer's daughter of
guileless charms and irresistible enthusiasms. She laughs hardest
when she laughs at her own predilections and predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   Pavord is abuzz when describing her brief visit this week to the
still-dormant tulip fields of the Skagit Valley north of Seattle
and meeting growers there: ``They wanted my autograph _ crumbs! For
me, meeting them was like meeting a Rothschild!''
</P>
<P>
   She is quieter, but still unabashed, when describing her battle
against cancer last year that resulted in major surgery, but did
not convince her to undergo radiation or chemotheraphy: ``My future
is in the lap of the gods, but my will is as strong as any machine
_ and I did not want to muck up my body.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing seems to inspire Pavord's zeal quite like the tulip.
She can readily recall the first tulip she ever planted four
decades ago. Its charactertistics are as fresh to her as today's
bouquet. It was love at first bloom. It was also a case, she later
understood, of how opposites do attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm, by nature, solitary and introverted, a woman of such
height that I was ungainly until I learned to carry myself,''
Pavord related. ``I just wish I was like a tulip _ with its
flamboyance, its sexiness _ but I don't share any of the tulip's
traits.''
</P>
<P>
   Those traits enslaved the fancies of men and women from the time
the tulip was discovered in the wilds of central Asia and the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The enflamed passion for the flower swept across the Ottoman
Empire and then successive countries in Europe, starting in the
1500s, and finally engulfed America as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips were worn in turbans in Turkey (the source of a
misunderstanding that led to the tulip's name: When a Flemish
ambassador asked an interpreter the name of an unfamiliar flower
tucked in a turban, he mistakenly picked up and later used the word
for turban instead of the word for tulip).
</P>
<P>
   Tulips were worn in the decolletage of dresses in France just
like diamond jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips became a symbol of love. ``When a young man presents a
tulip to his mistress,'' reported a 17th-century traveler in Iran,
``he gives her to understand by the general colour of the flower,
that he is on fire with her beauty, and by the black base, that his
heart has burned to coal.''
</P>
<P>
   There were even periods of unbridled tulipomania, first in
France and later in Holland, times in which the tulip was in such
demand and subject to such speculation that it was the Amazon.com
stock of its day. The price of a single bulb of a prized tulip
variety escalated so steeply at Holland auctions, between 1634 and
1637, that it rivaled the cost of the best townhome in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The mania was fueled by the great mystery of how the most prized
tulips would ``break'' into different colors and patterns. This
phenomenon was not explained until the 1920s when the electron
microscope revealed that such breaks were caused by a most mundane
source _ a plant virus transported by an aphid.
</P>
<P>
   Pavord revels in such ironies in tulip history, but none more
than the fact that the most beautiful tulips ever bred came from
the work of dedicated amateurs in England. These were tradesmen and
artisans in the early 1800s with tough daily lives who were
slavishly devoted to perfecting the beauty of a flower, despite the
seven years it takes for a tulip seed to become a tulip bulb.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most touching thing I discovered in my
research,'' Pavord stresses. ``Here were shoemakers and people who
had started working in factories at age 8, people with horrible
lives, and they gave us some of the most beautiful tulips ever.
They had a commitment to the ideal of beauty, despite their grim
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulips have gone on to become a worldwide industry, dominated by
the Netherlands. That small country devotes almost half of its land
to growing tulip bulbs and annually exports 2 billion bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties of tulips once carried names that spoke poetry about
the flower's allure _ Sparkling Fire, Spring Song, Black Swan,
Eros. Now tulips have become such a part of popular culture that
varieties sport names that include President Kennedy, Scarlett
O'Hara, Bing Crosby and Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tulipomania may have faded, but the magic of the tulip still
remains.
</P>
<P>
   As Pavord writes, ``On a grey, sunless day, when a northeasterly
wind is whipping the skin off the backs of your knuckles, nothing
cheers the heart more than a bunch of tulips, weaving and bending
in their vase like a flock of inquisitive birds.''

HEINZ PLANS DRAMATIC CHANGES AND LAYOFFS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla., Italy )  By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to revitalize its sagging food business, H.J. Heinz Co.
said Wednesday that over the next four or five years it would
revamp its global operations, lay off up to 10 percent of its work
force and sell its Weight Watchers International division.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had sales of more than $9 billion last year,
said the moves would amount to the ``greatest transformation in the
history of Heinz,'' eventually generating savings of more than $200
million a year and earnings-per-share growth of 10 percent to 12
percent, not including the sale of Weight Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, the maker of Heinz ketchup, Star-Kist tuna
and other well-known processed foods said it would raise spending
on marketing to stimulate the sales of food products that have been
losing market share in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who were not surprised by the
announcement, cheered the news, saying it showed that after two
years of flat sales growth, Heinz was disciplining its management
team and sharpening its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows Heinz to focus on grocery,'' said John McMillin, a
food industry analyst at Prudential Securities. ``They're a food
company, they're not in the preaching business. I think they're on
a better path than they were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Heinz, which had climbed about 8 percent in the week
leading up to the announcement, rose 25 cents Wednesday, to
$55.875.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the make-over, Heinz will take a charge of more than
$1 billion over the next four years. But the company expects to
reap tremendous cost savings and invest an additional $100 million
in marketing and pricing initiatives to lift sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the Weight Watchers classroom operation, which counsels
customers on weight loss, increasingly had become profitable the
last year, officials at Heinz said that it was not a vital fit in
the food business. The company did not say how much the unit would
bring, but nearly 30 million people have attended sessions the last
year and operating profits have been projected at $85 million.
Heinz will, however, retain its Weight Watchers food line.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment on whether it would also divest
itself of the Cardio-Fitness Corp., a smaller health and fitness
division based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Heinz officials did say a drastic make-over was under way in
everything from marketing and packaging to the introduction of new
products. Heinz officials hope these moves will help revitalize a
company that has been best-known for ketchup; Charlie the Tuna, the
cartoon pitchman for Star-Kist; Ore-Ida frozen potatoes, and Morris
the Cat's favorite food, 9 Lives.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which came during the Consumer Analysts Group
of New York meeting in Naples, Fla., the company said it would
close up to 20 factories around the world, downsize at least 10
more and reduce its 43,000-strong work force by about 4,000. Other
factories would be expanded and dedicated to particular products.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Pittsburgh, did not say how many jobs
would be cut in the United States. But about a third of the plant
closings are expected to take place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz also will reorganize its global operations by doing away
with affiliate units, such as Heinz Italy, in favor of organizing
the company along six primary categories and six regions. That
shift, the company said, will streamline operations, improve how
factories are used and save hundreds of millions of dollars that
could later be used to increase sales of its core food products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $64,000 question is. `Will this restructuring help
transform top-line growth?' '' said McMillin. ``It definitely
supplies the ammunition, but will they be able to move the needle
on ketchup or frozen potatoes? It's not easy to change consumer
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The man trying to transform Heinz is William R. Johnson, who
took over as the chief executive at Heinz in 1998 after the company
was criticized for lavish spending, high executive salaries and a
lagging stock price under his predecessor, Anthony J.F. O'Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the company has lost market share in some of its key
products. Now, Johnson and Heinz say they will bolster marketing
and advertising costs, introduce new pricing initiatives _
including a 99-cent commemorative bottle of Heinz ketchup _ and
introduce new packaging as a way to win back market share.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts say Heinz has not been aggressively
marketing and advertising its products and that it raised its
prices on several items, allowing smaller private-label companies
to gain market share. Now it is trying to reverse that course, and
the company says recent marketing pushes have led to stronger sales
of ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ore-Ida, they've been losing market share to private labels
because of the gap in price,'' said Nomi Ghez, an analyst at
Goldman, Sachs. ``But everything we heard today is good news. The
company is definitely doing what's right for the long term.'' &QL;

 By BRENDAN M. CASE and DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ In the golden age of Mexican cinema, the ballads
of mariachis and the antics of Cantinflas ruled theater screens
from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego.
 &HT;    But the success of the 1940s and 1950s led to excess. The
government controlled ticket prices, distribution, and even theater
ownership. The labor union was so tough that it allowed only one
employee per cinema to serve popcorn and one to serve soft drinks.
Those patrons who wanted both had to stand in line twice. Once
inside, the entertainment value fell further: The popcorn was
usually stale, the screens rundown and the seats so decrepit that
some patrons reported sustaining flea bites.
 &HT;    Over the years, theater attendance plummeted from a high of 400
million tickets sold in 1980 to 60 million in 1995. ``It was
tragic,'' says Roberto Jenkins, the general director of Cinemark in
Mexico. ``People stopped going to the movies and rented movies to
watch at home instead.''
 &HT;    Now, Mexican movie theatres are entering a new golden era.
Cinemark is one of several companies building multiplexes with
sparkling sound systems and fresh popcorn that have moviegoers
giving up the VCR in favor of a flick. This year, operators will
sell more than 100 million tickets, according to the National
Cinema Chamber.
 &HT;    The deluxe cinema chains, on par with the comforts of any movie
house in the world, have coaxed Mexicans back to the movies. But
they offer little else other than Hollywood blockbusters at a time
when the Mexican film industry is slogging through a slump.
 &HT;    During the industry's heyday, nearly 100 films came out each
year. But over each of the last two years, Mexican cinematographers
have turned out less than a dozen films. Funding is the perennial
problem. ``There's no way to produce movies in Mexico,'' says
independent film maker V ictor Ugalde. ``The only funding comes
from the [government's Cinema Fund and it rejects many interesting
projects.''
 &HT;    Plagued by poor distribution and lackluster promotion, the few
locally produced films face predictably little public interest. The
often money-losing ventures command even less attention from
private financiers.
 &HT;    Critics contend what the industry needs is more control. In
response to the nationalistic cry, Maria Rojo, a former actress
turned politician, pushed through Congress a law that requires
theaters to reserve 10 percent of screen time for domestic films.
``We're talking about part of our cultural heritage,'' says
congresswoman Rojo.
 &HT;    Owners of movie theaters, however, say the new law goes against
the emerging free-market culture that has allowed them to flourish.
They fear that the legislation will simply lock them into showing
money-losing flicks.
 &HT;    Both government and unions were removed from the movie business
in recent years as a part of the country's economic reforms. In
their place, several entrepreneurs have invested nearly US$400
million to open an estimated 1,000 state-of-the-art theaters across
the country. To ensure a speedy return on their investment, the new
movie-theater moguls are showing the films that they believe people
want to see: the best action films, romances and comedies coming
out of the Mecca of filmed entertainment, Hollywood. ``Hey, I want
Mexican movies to work as much as the next guy, but when they suck
I have to pull them because no one will pay to see them,'' says one
theater executive. ``I need to maximize profits.''
 &HT;    Such market rationale prevails at the three companies that have
pioneered the new generation of theaters: Grupo Cinemex,
Organizacion Ramirez and Cinemark. And their logic seems to be
paying off.
 &HT;    Despite eroding purchasing power, moviegoers now spend as much
as US$3 per megaplex ticket. ``People go to the movies to have a
good time,'' says Matthew Heyman, one of Cinemex's three directors,
who together dreamed up the company while studying at Harvard
Business School. ``If you build the sound systems and the screens,
and you make the theaters a fun place to be, people will spend the
money.''
 &HT;    More theaters are on the way. Cinemex recently opened a $15
million complex of 19 theaters in northwestern Mexico City, as well
as several complexes in the provinces. Organizacion Ramirez, which
runs the Cinepolis line of theaters among others, plans to open a
20-theater complex in a huge new mall in Guadalajara in the first
half of 1999.
 &HT;    And despite Congress's nationalist sensibilities, audiences do
not seem to mind foreign films playing on their screens, just as
long as the view is good and the popcorn fresh. ``This is like
going to the movies in the glory days of Mexican cinema, when the
screens were big and everybody went to the movies,'' says Daniel
Rodriguez, a city employee in Mexico City who brought his two young
sons to see Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' at a local Cinemex. ``I'd
like to see more good Mexican movies, but I also like the ones from
Hollywood.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    AN ACT OF CONGRESS: A TALK WITH MARIA ROJO
 &HT;    In her latest film, Maria Rojo plays a woman overflowing with
love, so much so that she assembles five husbands on whom to lavish
her passions. When her multiple marriages come to light, the main
character is thrust into the media spotlight and she becomes a
champion for women oppressed by overwhelming, macho men.
 &HT;    These days, Rojo's own storyline reads much like that of her
character in the film, ``De noche vienes, Esmeralda'' (``Esmeralda
Comes by Night.'') The actress turned member of Congress is
attempting to save what she loves best. Her passion has pushed her
onto center stage to champion Mexican film against the overwhelming
power of the big-budget Hollywood movie machine.
 &HT;    Rojo sponsored a new law that requires movie theaters to show
Mexican films during a tenth of the theaters' total running time.
Chair of the congressional committee on culture, she spent nearly
two years pushing the bill to change Mexico's cinema law. Her
original proposal was even stronger, asking for nearly a third of
screen time and a tax on movie tickets to fund local filmmaking
efforts.
 &HT;    The 50-year-old film star entered the limelight long ago,
playing her first screen role at age 17. She steadily gained fame
in Mexico from work in the movies and TV soap operas, and starred
in the 1995 El Callejon de los Milagros (known in English as
``Midaq Alley'') which won 49 international awards. Rojo is
considered a major Latin American film star, though she's hardly a
household name in Hollywood. In 1997, she staged a second career,
winning election to Mexico's lower house of Congress.
 &HT;    In her current battle, Rojo has picked up fellow Mexican ally,
blockbuster actress Salma Hayek, who also played supporting role to
Rojo in El Callejon. ``It's important that we promote and support
Mexican talent _ because we have a financial crisis, but we do not
have a talent crisis,'' Hayek said in a recent interview. ``Most of
us [Mexicans in Hollywood have dreams of going back and doing some
quality stuff down there.''
 &HT;    That's exactly why Rojo has been so committed to her cause.
``The cinema in Mexico is a poor industry,'' Rojo has said, ``but
it's there and we want to keep it in existence.''

AFL-CIO APPROVES $40 MILLION POLITICAL ACTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ill., Mich., N.J., Pa., Wis.) (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Hoping to build on its electoral successes last
November, the AFL-CIO approved its most ambitious political effort
ever on Wednesday _ a $40 million-plus, two-year program of
grass-roots lobbying and campaigning involving thousands of union
members.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders gathered here for the AFL-CIO's winter meeting
said the plan was bigger, and they hoped more effective, than any
previous labor political effort because they were gearing up far
earlier than for any previous campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which would not involve direct support for any
candidate, is in many ways an expanded version of the labor
federation's 1998 strategy, in which unions mobilized tens of
thousands of members and helped the Democrats pick up five seats in
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting much earlier to re-engage people over our
legislative issues,'' said Gerald McEntee, chairman of the
AFL-CIO's political committee and president of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ``Then
hopefully we'll be able to move that kind of enthusiasm and action
into the year 2000 campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new effort, labor leaders said, will focus on six
swing states with heavy union membership _ Ohio, Illinois,
Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin _ which they say
the Democratic presidential candidate next year will need to win.
All told, the campaign calls for large-scale political operations
in about 35 congressional district and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the labor federation, repeatedly
emphasized at a news conference on Wednesday that none of the
money, as much as $46 million, would go to political candidates or
to party campaign committees. Instead, the money will be used to
print literature, work phone banks, broadcast issue advertisements
and register voters and get them out to vote. Those efforts would
focus on union members and groups that often share labor's agenda,
including black groups, women's organizations and retirees'
associations.
</P>
<P>
   While labor leaders said they hoped their effort would help to
bring about a Democratic-controlled Congress, they said they would
support candidates based, not on party, but on whether they support
labor's issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a continuous effort to support candidates who
have been supportive of working families, and that's regardless of
party,'' Sweeney said. ``There will be endorsements of Republicans
as well as Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were quick to condemn labor's political
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that the union bosses are meeting in sunny Miami
and staying at fine resorts plotting to buy influence among
Gore-Gephardt Democrats rather than using union dues to improve the
quality of lives of their hard-working members,'' said Scott Hatch,
executive of director of the National Republican Congressional
Committee. ``This should be a wake-up call to every working
American and every business owner that if they don't participate in
the 2000 cycle, the liberal elite and unions will attempt to buy
the next Congress to install their agenda of backroom politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating labor's political clout, important Democrats are
pouring into this seaside resort. Among them are Vice President Al
Gore, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
Bill Bradley, the presidential candidate and former senator from
New Jersey, and Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic
Whip.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior paid homage to labor's political prowess, saying he owed
his victory last November to unions. ``Their ground effort was
amazing,'' he said. ``On Election Day, when I got up at 5 a.m. and
went into my headquarters, I had 300 auto workers at 6 a.m. ready
to work the neighborhoods to get the vote out.''
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy aims to improve on the old by engaging more
union members sooner, recognizing that the labor movement has had
greater success than any other group in America in getting masses
of people to do campaign work.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new strategy, the labor movement plans to immediately
mobilize union members to speak out and distribute literature on
issues like Social Security and a higher minimum wage. Then, next
year as the labor movement's focus shifts to electoral politics,
unions will use those members for the November campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders noted, for instance, that more than 25,000 union
members in California campaigned last June against a ballot
proposition, ultimately defeated, that would have limited unions'
ability to use members' dues money for politics. By keeping those
members mobilized through November, labor leaders said, unions
played a key role in bringing about the election of Gray Grey
Davis, a Democrat, as California's governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing it sooner than ever before,'' McEntee said. ``What
we found out in the past was we'd have good campaigns, we'd have a
good mobilization and after the campaign it would go flat on us and
we'd have to go out and re-engage people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Union officials repeatedly asserted on Wednesday that the more
than $40 million in political spending _ because it is spread over
two years _ is actually a decrease from the $35 million the AFL-CIO
spent last year on political education and getting out the vote.
Republican and business groups pilloried the $35 million amount,
insisting that organized labor used its financial muscle to buy
election victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, called
that criticism absurd. ``In 1996, labor was outspent by
corporations 11 to 1. In 1998, it went up to 15 to one.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, union leaders said, would be financed by having
individual unions contribute $1 this year and $1 next year for each
of the labor federation's 13 million members. Then, labor leaders,
said, another $15 to $20 million would come out of the federation's
regular budget.

 Por BRENDAN M. CASE y DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ En la epoca dorada del cine mexicano, las
baladas de los mariachis y las payasadas de Cantinflas dominaban
las pantallas desde el rio Grande hasta la Tierra del Fuego.
 &HT;    Pero el exito de los anos 40 y 50 llevo al exceso. El gobierno
controlaba los precios de las entradas, la distribucion y hasta la
propiedad de las salas. El sindicato era tan estricto que en cada
cine solo un empleado podia servir palomitas de maiz y otro
refrescos. Las personas que querian las dos cosas tenian que hacer
la cola dos veces. En la sala misma se tropezaba con nuevos
contratiempos: las palomitas solian estar rancias, las pantallas
estaban gastadas y muchas personas sufrian picadas de pulgas
emboscadas en los asientos decrepitos.
 &HT;    Con el paso de los anos, la asistencia a los cines bajo de un
record de 400 millones de entradas vendidas en 1980 a 60 millones
en 1995. ``Fue tragico,'' dice Roberto Jenkins, director general de
Cinemark en Mexico. ``En vez de ir al cine, la gente alquilaba
peliculas para verlas en la casa.''
 &HT;    Los cines mexicanos entran hoy en una nueva edad de oro.
Cinemark es una de varias empresas que construyen complejos de
salas de cine con avanzados sistemas de sonido y palomitas frescas
para hacerle competencia a la videocasetera. Este ano, segun la
Camara Nacional de la Industria Cinematografica y del Video, se
venderan mas de 100 millones de entradas.
 &HT;    Las cadenas de cines de lujo, con un nivel de comodidad
comparable con el de los mejores cines del mundo, han logrado
atraer de nuevo al publico. Pero no ofrecen mucho mas que
superproducciones de Hollywood mientras la industria nacional esta
en decadencia.
 &HT;    Durante el apogeo del cine mexicano se producian casi 100 filmes
al ano. Pero en los dos ultimos anos se han producido alrededor de
10 cintas. La falta de fondos es otro problema constante. ``No hay
forma de producir peliculas en Mexico,'' dice Victor Ugalde, un
realizador independiente. ``La unica ayuda financiera proviene del
Fondo de Fomento a la Calidad Cinematografica [del gobierno y esa
entidad rechaza muchos proyectos interesantes.''
 &HT;    Perjudicados por una distribucion y una promocion deficientes,
los pocos filmes que se producen en el pais despiertan muy poco
interes entre el publico. Esas peliculas, que suelen perder dinero,
despiertan menos atencion todavia de financiadores privados.
 &HT;    Los criticos sostienen que el sector necesita mas control. En
respuesta al clamor nacionalista, Maria Rojo, ex actriz que ahora
se dedica a la politica, presento al Congreso una ley que requiere
que las salas de cine reserven el 10 por ciento del tiempo de
proyeccion a filmes nacionales. ``Estamos hablando de una parte de
nuestro legado cultural,'' comenta la congresista Rojo.
 &HT;    Pero los duenos de las salas de cine alegan que la nueva ley
contradice la incipiente cultura del libre mercado que les ha
permitido prosperar. Temen que la ley los obligue a presentar
peliculas que les hagan perder dinero.
 &HT;    Las reformas economicas de los ultimos anos sacaron del negocio
del cine tanto al gobierno como a los sindicatos. Llenando el
vacio, varios empresarios privados han invertido cerca de US$400
millones para abrir unas mil modernas salas de cine en distintos
puntos del pais. Para recuperar su inversion rapidamente, los
nuevos magnates del cine exhiben las peliculas que consideran que
el publico quiere ver: las mejores cintas de accion, romance y
comedias que produce la meca del cine, Hollywood. ``Por supuesto
que me gusta que las peliculas mexicanas despierten el mismo
interes, pero cuando son malas tengo que rechazarlas porque nadie
va a pagar un centavo para verlas,'' comenta un ejecutivo del
sector. ``Tengo que maximizar las ganancias.''
 &HT;    Esa logica de mercado prevalece en las tres empresas pioneras de
la nueva generacion de salas de cine: Grupo Cinemex, Organizacion
Ramirez y Cinemark. Y su logica parece dar frutos.
 &HT;    A pesar de que el poder adquisitivo se ha erosionado, el publico
paga hasta US$3 por ir al cine. ``La gente va al cine a pasar un
buen rato,'' comenta Matthew Heyman, uno de los tres directores de
Cinemex que concibieron la compania cuando estudiaban en la Escuela
de Comercio de la Universidad de Harvard. ``Si uno ofrece buenas
pantallas, buenos sistemas de sonido, si hace del cine un lugar
divertido, la gente se gasta el dinero.''
 &HT;    Hay mas teatros en proyecto. Cinemex abrio recientemente un
complejo de 19 salas por US$15 millones en el noroeste de la Ciudad
de Mexico, asi como varios complejos en otros estados. Organizacion
Ramirez, que opera la linea Cinepolis, entre otras cadenas, planea
inaugurar un complejo de 20 salas en un enorme y nuevo centro
comercial en Guadalajara en el primer semestre de este ano.
 &HT;    Y a pesar de la sensibilidad nacionalista del Congreso, al
publico no parece importarle que las peliculas que se proyectan
sean extranjeras, mientras se vean bien y las palomitas esten
frescas. ``Esto es como en los dias de gloria del cine mexicano,
cuando las pantallas eran grandes y todo el mundo iba al cine,''
dice Daniel Rodriguez, empleado municipal en la Ciudad de Mexico
que llevo a sus dos hijos a ver Bichos, la produccion de Disney, en
una sala de Cinemex. ``Me gustaria ver mas peliculas mexicanas,
pero tambien me gustan las de Hollywood.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    UN GUION PARA EL CONGRESO: UNA CHARLA CON MARIA ROJO
 &HT;    En su ultima pelicula, Maria Rojo interpreta a una mujer
apasionada, tanto que se casa cinco veces. Cuando se descubren sus
numerosos matrimonios, la protagonista cae en la mira de la prensa
y se convierte en campeona de las mujeres oprimidas por los
machistas.
 &HT;    Hoy, la historia de Maria Rojo se parece mucho a la de su
personaje en la cinta De noche vienes, Esmeralda. La actriz y ahora
congresista trata de salvar lo que mas ama. Su pasion la ha hecho
saltar a la palestra en defensa del cine mexicano frente al poder
abrumador y los cuantiosos recursos de la maquinaria filmica de
Hollywood.
 &HT;    Rojo propuso una ley que exige que los cines exhiban peliculas
mexicanas la decima parte del tiempo total de proyeccion. Rojo, que
es presidenta de la comision parlamentaria de cultura, invirtio
casi dos anos en promocionar la medida. Su plan original era mas
ambicioso: casi la tercera parte del tiempo de proyeccion y un
impuesto a las entradas para financiar la realizacion de peliculas.
 &HT;    La estrella de 50 anos entro en el mundo de las candilejas hace
mucho tiempo, a los 17 anos. Su actuacion en filmes y telenovelas
le dio fama en Mexico, y en 1995 protagonizo El callejon de los
milagros, que recibio 49 premios internacionales. Rojo es una de
las principales estrellas de America Latina, aunque en Hollywood
apenas se le conoce. En 1997, inicio una segunda carrera al ganar
un escano en la camara baja del Congreso.
 &HT;    En su contienda del momento, Rojo cuenta con una aliada y
colega, tambien mexicana, la celebre actriz Salma Hayek, que
tambien actuo en El callejon. ``Es importante promover y apoyar el
talento mexicano, porque tenemos una crisis financiera, pero no
tenemos una crisis de talento,'' comento Hayek en reciente
entrevista. ``La mayoria de nosotros [los mexicanos en Hollywood
sonamos con regresar y hacer peliculas de calidad en Mexico.''
 &HT;    Es por eso que Rojo esta tan comprometida con su causa. ``El
cine mexicano es una industria pobre,'' senala, ``pero ahi esta y
queremos conservarlo.''

ADVERTISING:   TV SPOTS FOR LEGOLAND BORROW FROM SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the opening approaches for Legoland, the Lego
Group's $130 million theme park in California, the company will
begin a regional television campaign on Sunday that departs from
traditional amusement park advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of camera cuts from the latest white-knuckle thrill ride
or sentimental spots using life-sized characters, the Lego ads use
contemporary children and special effects to summon up a modern-day
fairy tale filled with mysterious expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who see the spot may notice that it seems to borrow its
emotional texture _ a sense of innocent wonderment _ from the
Steven Spielberg film ``E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the mood alone that seems cribbed from E.T., the
heavy-headed alien whose index finger glowed. In the initial teaser
spots, each child is a recipient of a comet-delivered,
glow-in-the-dark Lego brick. In the ads' second half, the children
are drawn to a moonlit field, a secret society where each reveals a
glowing treasure to the other. The spot ends with a chant,
``Legoland is coming,'' that is reminiscent of the Walt Disney
movie ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go wrong by doing Spielberg,'' said Bruce R.
Dundore, a partner and chief creative officer for Asher &AMP; Partners
in Los Angeles, the agency that created the $15 million campaign.
``It wasn't intentional,'' added Barry H. Schoenfeld, an Asher
partner and director of business development.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which also produced the campaign for the New York,
New York casino in Las Vegas, Nev., had a tall order to fill:
standing out in what is considered one of the nation's most
fiercely competitive theme-park markets.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland will open next month on a 128-acre seaside bluff in
Carlsbad, north of San Diego, the third park opened by the Danish
toy company and its first in the United States. Yet an hour or two
away are many better-known rivals, including Universal Studios and
the granddaddy of the industry, Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland's promise is to be true to its legacy, a build-your-own
toy that encourages creative thinking among children 12 and
younger. On visits to Legoland parks in Denmark and Britain,
Schoenfeld observed parents and children engaged in a way that
differed markedly from the typical theme-park experience. The
campaign set out to distill that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   At most theme parks, ``the creativity of the builders is set out
for you,'' Schoenfeld said. ``At Legoland, it's almost as if they
took it so far, but the rest is up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a driving school attraction has no
guardrails, allowing riders to drive when and where they choose. At
another attraction, the ``power tower,'' youngsters propel
themselves up and free fall to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't about thrills and chills,'' Schoenfeld said. ``What
you get out of the park is what you put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   A second spot, scheduled for broadcast on children's shows
beginning in mid-March through Labor Day, builds on the initial
ads' fairy-tale theme, but with a jack-in-the-beanstalk twist.
</P>
<P>
   The children from the original spot are seen planting their
luminous bricks and are surprised at the result; the ground sprouts
a towering giraffe and slightly threatening dinosaur, built of
cunningly assembled Lego bricks.
</P>
<P>
   The images are among the Lego-brick replicas that populate the
park, including Mount Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty and the White
House. Of the eight model builders, all but one is a veteran of the
Danish park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They captured the essence of it,'' said Marianne M. Flowers,
Legoland's marketing director, referring to the agency. Asher was
selected from among 58 that competed for the account. One element
that set Asher apart, she said, was a resonant jingle, ``Now's a
country just for kids,'' that is incorporated in the second spot.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland seeks to draw 1.8 million visitors in its first year.
The park is promoting weekday use by encouraging student field
trips, offering teachers resource guides in math, physics and
science that are adapted to the state's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   For example, children will be able to test their skills at
building model cars and racing them on a timed indoor track, and
then make their own comparisons riding the park roller coaster,
said Jonna Rae Bartges, a park spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Education is not really the point, even if Legoland ads lack
commercial directness. The park itself is an oversize commercial.
It conveniently includes a shop that is stocked with a broader
inventory of Lego products than any toy store.

`ER'S' GEORGE CLOONEY HANGS UP HIS SCRUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Clooney leaves ``ER'' Thursday night on the path to
Hollywood immortality, or possibly en route to accidental
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   It could go either way. Many of the big screen's biggest names _
Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks, John Travolta, Robin Williams and Eddie
Murphy jump to mind _ made the transition from TV stardom.
</P>
<P>
   But for every Tom Hanks, there's a David Caruso, and for every
Clint Eastwood, a Pernell Roberts _ actors who bailed too soon from
hit shows.
</P>
<P>
   As he departs television's only remaining 30-share series,
Clooney has one thing going for him that Caruso and several other
past evacuees, including McLean Stevenson of ``MASH,'' didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   That's the gratitude and good wishes of the colleagues he leaves
behind. He gave ``ER'' the contractually prescribed five seasons.
He didn't cheat the network, the producers or his friends on the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' executive producer John Wells has said that Clooney
``lost literally millions of dollars by staying on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that although Clooney has been able to double his
workload and moonlight on the big screen, he presumably could have
been free for more feature film work without his ``ER'' commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has done the thing that few people do,'' Wells said of
Clooney's fidelity to the TV series. ``That ethic is something that
has been less and less present over the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney is leaving ``ER'' in just about the way you'd expect his
character, Dr. Douglas Ross, to act. He's taking a risk, but at the
same time flashing his deep-seated loyalty to his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   NBC didn't send Thursday night's episode for preview, but the
consensus seems to be that Ross will be ash-canned by County
Hospital for breaking rules in administering painkillers to a dying
boy. At least that exit relieves Clooney of one anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept coming to me and saying, `I just don't want testicular
cancer,''' Wells said. Wish granted, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Ross alive also raises the prospect of future
appearances on the show. On ``MASH,'' by contrast, Stevenson was
terminated with extreme prejudice; Henry Blake was killed in a
helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle Thursday night is another TV network. ABC
is carrying the final hour of the miniseries ``Storm of the
Century'' against ``ER.'' It's a contest NBC and ``ER'' are
expected to win.

   It's tough to gauge Clooney's Hollywood future from his past.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney has star attributes _ the manly jaw, the bedroom eyes,
the killer grin and adequate acting talent. His blend of
sex-infused humor and macho presence is rooted in the Clark Gable
school of film stardom.
</P>
<P>
   But then, there are the movies to date: ``One Fine Day,'' ``From
Dusk Till Dawn,'' ``The Peacemaker,'' ``Batman and Robin.'' Not a
blockbuster in the bunch. In each of these cases, though, the blame
could be assessed to the material and not to Clooney's prospective
star power.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``Out of Sight'' is harder to explain. Based on an
Elmore Leonard best-seller, the movie appeared to be a home run.
Clooney was perfect for the role of a charming bank robber. He had
a roiling chemistry with co-star Jennifer Lopez. The supporting
cast was perfect. The movie was a sharply directed mixture of
bankable elements _ sex and violence _ and the critics rightly
adored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' should have gone through the roof but never
really got out of the parlor. It grossed $74.4 million last year,
with the domestic box office accounting for only $37.6 million of
that total. Not a commercial dud, but no fireball either.
</P>
<P>
   So you have to wonder. How is Clooney going to improve on an
inherently appealing and critically praised movie that managed to
finish only 52nd on the year's box-office roster?
</P>
<P>
   Clooney might reply with a string of TV titles _ ``E/R'' the CBS
sitcom (1984), ``Sunset Beat'' (1990), ``Baby Talk'' (1991) and
``Bodies of Evidence'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Together with scarcely notable roles on ``Facts of Life,''
``Roseanne'' and ``Sisters,'' these shows constituted Clooney's
less-than-stellar television credits before ``ER'' premiered in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   It's true in TV, and it's true in the movies. One monster hit
and all the earlier disappointments are nothing more than trivia
questions.
</P>
<P>
   In Clooney's case, a whole lot of people are cheering for a good
guy to knock one out of the park.

SWISS TRUTH-TELLER OR LYING TRAITOR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In this button-down nation, mentioning the name of
Holocaust-era chronicler Jean Ziegler evokes passion. To many, he
sheds indispensable light on Switzerland's wartime past. To others,
his efforts are such outrageous calumnies that they amount to
treason.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler's 1997 book, ``The Swiss, the Gold and the Dead,''
accused his wartime countrymen of helping to finance the Third
Reich and prolonging World War II by purchasing Nazi gold,
withholding funds in Jewish bank accounts and turning away tens of
thousands of Jewish refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized as inaccurate and exaggerated, the book has roused a
group of fellow citizens to file charges of treason against the
University of Geneva professor.
</P>
<P>
   Largely from the northern city of Basel, the group, consisting
of 20 men old enough to remember the war, is trying to strip
Ziegler of the legal immunity he enjoys because he also is a member
of Parliament. If successful, the effort would open the way for a
trial and the possibility of a five-year prison term and stiff
financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   His detractors maintain that Ziegler, who teaches sociology, not
only wrote a book based on shoddy research and invented anecdotes,
but has promoted his views worldwide. Particularly galling to them
was his testimony at a U.S. Senate banking committee hearing last
July about Hitler-era gold purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``His book is full of lies and insults,'' insisted Matthias
Eckenstein, a Basel architect who organized the group.
</P>
<P>
   Eckenstein, who knows Ziegler from their days as students in the
1950s, singled out a highly contested scene in the book that
strikes at Switzerland's neutrality. Ziegler described, as a boy,
seeing German war materiel in a local rail yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late one afternoon in December 1943,'' Ziegler wrote, a
violent snowstorm hit with such force that ``dozens of freight cars
bearing the black eagle and the initials DRB, for Deutsche
Reichsbahn, toppled over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strewn across the tracks like corpses on a battlefield'' were
machine guns, ammunition boxes, artillery shells, antiaircraft guns
and tank turrets, Ziegler wrote. This was his ``first encounter
with the Swiss neutrality lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckenstein dismisses the anecdote. ``Nobody has ever heard
anything about this accident, or the train,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Francois Bergier, a Zurich historian who heads the
government commission reviewing Swiss wartime actions, agreed. ``As
far as I know, this is unknown in the documents of the time. There
is no trace of the accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ziegler brushes aside the criticism. ``They accuse me of
lying and say it's an incredible story because it attacks the idea
that Switzerland is the haven of God's chosen ... that it was
protected during the war because of its neutrality,'' he said in an
interview. ``But I stand by it. It happened.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The book, sold widely in the United States, appeared just as
lawsuits in American courts cast doubt on Switzerland's neutrality
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Nonbelievers, like Ziegler, see Switzerland as infinitely more
practical. ``The Reichsmark was not convertible. Twice a week
lorries came through Basel and brought gold to Bern, and it was
laundered through the national bank,'' Ziegler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler depended on the world market for strategic war
equipment. The Swiss paid for those war goods. The Swiss were
fences and money launderers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Eckenstein and others, those statements confirm that Ziegler
is a traitor ``who has damaged the image of Switzerland abroad.''
They also charge Ziegler with ``reinforcing the position'' of
``blackmailers'' _ apparently referring to class-action lawsuits by
American Jewish groups that sought the return of Holocaust-era
monies from Swiss banks. Those suits were settled with a $1.25
billion settlement that was signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler testified last summer that ``Switzerland received much
more German assets, especially stolen gold, than it admitted,'' and
urged the Swiss national bank and private banks to restore the
sums.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Schmid, a retired chemical industry executive who also
signed the complaint against Ziegler, argued that Ziegler was
muddled over the gold issue, and that landlocked Switzerland had to
deal with the Nazis ``to get food and fuel to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Swiss law, citizens may ask the federal prosecutor for a
criminal indictment for acts against the country. Whether Ziegler
can be tried for treason will be tested when either a federal
parliamentary committee or the federal Cabinet hears the
historian's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler, long an iconoclast in his country, has felt the law's
sting before this. His previous books about Swiss banks, accusing
them of ignoring money laundering and accepting monies from
dictators, have drawn legal action. One book left Ziegler with more
than 50 percent of his salary garnisheed. He wrote that book while
in Parliament, but the government decided it wasn't protected by
legislative immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler could well lose his immunity without the government
doing anything. Under Socialist Party rules, Ziegler cannot stand
re-election because he has held his seat for 12 consecutive years.
So he is considering running for a different seat to retain his
immunity. Swiss parliamentarians do not have to live in the
districts they represent, if their political party agrees.
Ziegler's Socialist allies have indicated he would likely receive a
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Eckenstein says his group would settle for a conviction that
would forgo fines against Ziegler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could go to jail for one to two weeks. And if he continues,
he could go to jail for longer,'' he said. ``We want him to stop
saying things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know that you should be slightly proud to be
Swiss,'' Eckenstein insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler accuses his detractors of needing a scapegoat. ``They
would like to silence me once and for all,'' he said. ``If they can
prove in Switzerland that it's all my fault, then no one can say,
`You lied for 50 years.'''

   Pigs to the left, pigs to the right, pigs all around him,
Charles Burrus stood in the cacophonous center of his barn,
gesturing at the indignant squealers. He felt like squealing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we're going to do in the next three
months,'' said Burrus, oblivious to the stench of the 7,000 animals
around him. ``We're losing $10,000 to $15,000 a semi load.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrus, a 65-year-old whose gray hair peeks through his farm
cap, has seen some tough times in a life of hog farming, including
a fire that ripped through his barns in 1978 and roasted 1,200 pigs
alive. But nothing, he said, has ever been nearly so devastating as
today's prices. These days he is bleeding money so badly that he
worries about losing his 600-acre farm here among the cornfields
near Cantrall, Ill., 130 miles southwest of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've never seen in the livestock
business,'' Burrus said dolefully. ``We've never seen this heavy a
loss in the pork industry, not even in the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems on the Burrus farm, a sprawling collection of 14
hog buildings with temperature controls and automatic curtains on
the windows, underscore how the economic crisis that began 19
months ago in Thailand is knocking on the gates of the American
heartland. The only real chance of a rescue for Burrus would come
through an economic revival on the other side of the globe, in
Asia, where his hogs usually end up between chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the United States as a whole has been remarkably
impervious to the crisis, and much of American industry has
benefited from the cheaper oil and imports resulting from the
downturn elsewhere. Still, it is not clear whether the United
States can remain unaffected, and the crisis presents the country _
and the rest of the world _ with far-reaching political and
economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cuban missile standoff was a quintessential Cold War
crisis, then today's global economic upheaval may be a landmark
crisis of the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest challenge is for the United States to sustain its
strong growth rates. But the broader task will be to prevent
nationalistic cataclysms in the worst-off countries, like Russia
and Indonesia, and to contain the political and security risks of
explosive frustration if the crisis bites further into places like
China and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy has demonstrated tremendous flexibility and
resilience, but uncertainties arise because the American stock
market is 64 percent higher than it was on Dec. 5, 1996, when Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned about ``irrational
exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Brazilian crisis _ marking the failure of the
November bailout _ underscores that the storm has not necessarily
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent Brazil's problem is a reflection of slowing
economic activity,'' said Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist
who now runs his own consulting company. ``We have to consider
whether there is more to come. Developing countries are still
coming to grips with a slowdown in the global economy. If the
economic revival in Europe is subdued and the American economy
slows down, that is bound to put some pressure on other parts of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from Washington during these upheavals strikes some
foreigners as hypocritical. When Thailand and Brazil were hit, the
Clinton administration's message was firm: Raise interest rates,
cut government spending, put up with a recession if necessary,
allow banks to fail, be stoical.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in September when the crisis seemed as if it might strike
the United States, the administration had a change of heart.
President Clinton went into overdrive in September, welcoming three
interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, pressing Europe and
others to cut rates as well, and finally getting money out of
Congress for the International Monetary Fund. The Federal Reserve
even coordinated the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, a
hedge fund backed by wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cuts were precisely the opposite of the prescription
that the United States had handed out to everyone else. And these
days, there is a lurking fear in Washington that these
countermeasures may have worked too well _creating a false sense of
security.
</P>
<P>
   At Treasury and the Federal Reserve, officials were concerned to
see that their actions seemed to have moved millions of investors
from an excess of fear to a new spasm of exuberance, sending the
market to a new high. Officials say they worry that the eventual
fall, if there is one, may be that much farther.
</P>
<P>
   For all the condemnation of cronyism and mismanagement abroad,
there are signs in America and Europe of some of the
vulnerabilities that brought down Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis abroad was partly a consequence of success: Soaring
growth rates led to excess confidence, excess borrowing, excess
investment and excess capacity. Not everyone agrees, but some
economists see similar patterns in corporate giants like U.S. Steel
and even on farms like the one Burrus runs.
</P>
<P>
   When pig prices were 80 cents a pound of live weight, Burrus
borrowed from the banks to build new barns. In fact, he just
completed his latest barn a few months ago. But the high prices
were also driving every other hog farmer in the world to increase
production as well, and in hindsight it was a pig bubble that
popped.
</P>
<P>
   So now Burrus is getting 17 cents a pound for his pigs, even
though his costs are running 38 cents a pound. Bankers in Cantrall
are nervously eyeing hog farms the way bankers in Rio de Janeiro
are anxiously examining coffee plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of hours' drive from Burrus' farm is steel
country, the huge chimneys and fiery vats of molten steel that
represent the traditional sinews of American industry. These days
steel companies are crying foul and laying off workers, saying they
are facing a deluge of imports from Japan, Russia, Indonesia and
other countries. These nations worry about a new round of
protectionism, and on Friday the United States announced penalties
against Japan and Brazil for selling goods in the United States
below cost.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, however, the steel companies' problem
reflects the pattern of excess capacity that one sees in hogs, cars
or Indonesian rickshaws. During the boom years, steel companies all
over the world invested huge sums in production, in anticipation of
the Asian market _ which then shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   So far U.S. Steel and Burrus are both exceptions, and the
American economy is still growing strongly. Yet apprehensions arise
because the global economy is a three-engine jet, with one engine
dead (Japan's) and another losing speed (Europe's). It all comes
down to how much fuel is left for the final, American engine. The
gauges are broken, the pilots are arguing and the journey has
already set a distance record _ the United States' longest
peacetime expansion, now almost eight years.

<P>
   SLENDER GAINS FOR SALAMET
</P>
<P>
   In the remote Indonesian town of Mojokerto, Salamet is in
mourning. Salamet, a rickshaw driver, was outside trying to get
rides one afternoon recently when his mother finally died in her
sleep on the floor of his little house.
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief, for she had groaned piteously from the pain of
breast cancer, and he had been unable to afford painkillers. Yet
Salamet now found himself faced with another bill he could not pay:
the $28 for the coffin and burial.
</P>
<P>
   In the end neighbors stepped in to lend him the money. But
custom dictates that a bereaved son not leave the neighborhood for
40 days. This made it more difficult than ever to find the rickshaw
rides that would buy food for his three hungry children and pay the
fees to keep his eldest son, Dwi, in the second grade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to keep it all in perspective, Salamet is in the worst-off
group _ the urban poor _ in the worst-off country of all,
Indonesia, and even he is managing to get by.
</P>
<P>
   In Salamet's neighborhood, no one thinks that the quality of
life has retreated even to the level of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how much the depression had pushed his life
backward, Salamet (who like many Indonesians uses only one name)
described the positive changes over the last decade, and emphasized
that these have been enduring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change was electricity, which came about six years
ago,'' he reflected. ``It cheers us all up, and at night there's
light. And then there's also television now as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second-biggest change is that the roads here got paved. It
used to be that in the rainy season, everything got so muddy you
couldn't go anywhere. But now we can get around in all seasons, and
I can drive the rickshaw and earn a living even after it's
rained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The third change is the toilets,'' he concluded. ``They were
built four years ago. Until then everybody just used the river, but
that was a problem at night. It was far away, and there were snakes
that used to bite people.''
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of gains are still fragile, particularly in places
like Indonesia, China and Russia, where there are serious risks of
political instability. But for now at least, they have not come
close to being undone.
</P>
<P>
   COULD ASIA'S WORST BE OVER?
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the striking thing about the economic news from
Asia these days is that so much of it is good. A year and a half
after the Asian crisis began, countries like Thailand and South
Korea are showing signs of bottoming out. Asia's currencies have
recovered sharply, with the Indonesian rupiah now standing at about
9,000 to the dollar, compared with 16,650 in June (or 2,500 before
the crisis).
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have fallen as well, and this has bolstered the
stock markets. They remain far, far below their pre-crisis levels,
but Asian stock markets were some of the best performing in the
world last year. South Korea's rose 121 percent in dollar terms in
1998, and Thailand's was up 34 percent _ both from abysmal lows.
</P>
<P>
   If countries like South Korea and Thailand really restructure
their economies in fundamental ways _ which so far has not
happened, despite a lot of promising talk _ then it is possible
that they will emerge that much stronger from the crisis, with
better banking systems, more open economies, stronger legal systems
and more democratic political structures. President Kim Dae-jung of
South Korea argues that the crisis will be remembered as a
blessing, because it is forcing essential economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that having to restructure our economy under the
agreement of the IMF is ultimately a big help for our economy,''
Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the recovery is slow or rapid, the emerging markets
eventually are expected to regain their pulse. Although they make
up just 7 percent of the global value of stocks around the world,
emerging markets account for 70 percent of the world's land, 85
percent of the world's population, and 99 percent of the
anticipated growth in the world's labor force.
</P>
<P>
   THE SANDWICH MAN
</P>
<P>
   Sirivat Voravetvuthikun offers a hopeful image of Asia's future,
one in which Asians manage to rebuild their lives in new ways and
thus achieve greater prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Sirivat, 50, a Chinese Thai businessman who went to high school
and college in Texas, was a successful investment manager and
property developer in Bangkok. With his brother, he built 28 lavish
homes in the middle of a vast golf resort, with no luxury spared,
from the swimming pools to the landscaping beneath mango trees and
coconut palms.
</P>
<P>
   The development cost $12 million, $10 million of it borrowed
from banks and much of the rest from Sirivat's savings. It is in a
lovely spot, nestled among the hills 115 miles northeast of
Bangkok, but just as it was being completed the property market
collapsed. Now the homes are empty and the main pool is green with
algae.
</P>
<P>
   The homes did not sell, and interest costs soared. Banks pressed
him for payment, and Sirivat could not meet the payroll for his
staff. He and his brother began quarreling.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Sirivat, like thousands of other businessmen
around Asia, decided to start again. Drawing on his years in the
United States, he decided to become a sandwich peddler. Sandwiches
are not a customary food in Thailand, so Sirivat decided it would
be a good market niche in a country whose young people are
increasingly experimental about foreign foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife started by making 20 sandwiches,'' Sirivat remembered.
``I told my staff we had to sell them on the street. I remembered
people in the states selling popcorn, carrying bags of it, and I
thought, we'll try this. It's illegal to have pushcarts or to set
up a table on the sidewalk, but I thought it would be OK if we just
carried the sandwiches in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirivat's business _ now known as Sirivat Sandwiches _ is
thriving, and he is turning a nice profit on it. The first 20
sandwiches took six hours to sell, but now daily sales have reached
550 sandwiches. Sirivat has rented another building in Bangkok to
make sandwiches and to experiment with new varieties. He aims to
emerge as the sandwich king of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be big,'' he boasted, adding that he was
trying to build a strong brand name and ultimately hoped to list
Sirivat Sandwiches on the Thai stock exchange.

<P>
   Rocky Roads, Resentments
</P>
<P>
   In assaying what comes next, some of the most fundamental
concerns are not economic but social and political.
</P>
<P>
   A growing backlash is evident against Western capitalism, and
especially against the Americans who exemplify it. This is most
apparent in countries like Russia, which has already defaulted on
its debts, but it is found even in Japan, where politicians heap
abuse on what they call Anglo-Saxon capitalism, deriding its
ferocity and lack of civility.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebellion against the American-led drive for free markets,
the finance ministers of the second- and third-largest industrial
countries, Japan and Germany, have both spoken about the need for
tighter controls on currency movements. And late last year, a
three-year-old international effort to achieve a Multilateral
Agreement on Investments _ which would have promoted globalization
and cross-border investments _ collapsed after France, applauded by
Australia and Canada, backed out of the talks. They all worried
about surrendering power to foreign companies and open markets.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, once a darling of international investors, went the
furthest in thumbing its nose at the markets. Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has denounced Jews and the West for conspiring
against him, and has warned that people in the developing world
will stage ``a kind of guerrilla war'' against Western corporations
that buy overseas companies at depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the West, Malaysia adopted capital
controls on Sept. 1. The controls, which are now being relaxed to
lure foreign investors back, seemed to help: The currency was
stable, the stock market more than doubled and foreign exchange
reserves rose sharply. Moreover, with interest rates of just 7
percent (compared with 38 percent in Indonesia), Malaysia is
expected to eke out a bit of economic growth this year _ even as a
continued dip is anticipated in Indonesia. Western officials worry
that other countries may adopt Malaysia's methods.
</P>
<P>
   Less dramatic capital controls, like Chile's system to encourage
long-term inflows rather than short-term ones, now are also widely
praised. Chile dismantled them late last year _ because at the
moment there is no problem with excess capital inflows _ but those
controls may become a model for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest worries in the West is about the future of
Russia. The stock market there plunged 84 percent last year in
dollar terms. President Boris Yeltsin, once seen as Clinton's ally
and the man who would tug Russia toward the West, has now faded
into the backdrop along with reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Sysuyev, a top aide to Yeltsin, sat in his immense office
in the old Central Committee Headquarters one day recently and said
that reforms very likely were dead for the next five years in
Russia. He added that unless the monetary fund gave in and offered
Russia major support, there were only two scenarios for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Sysuyev said as he chain-smoked Marlboro Lights, is
ruthless budget-cutting, which might lead voters to choose
old-style, totalitarian candidates in the parliamentary elections
in 1999 and the presidential elections in 2000. The second, he went
on, is hyperinflation. ``This scenario _ not as fast _ may lead to
the same consequences,'' he said.

<P>
   CHINA AVOIDS THE CRUNCH
</P>
<P>
   As for China, it has evaded the crisis, and what saved it from
catastrophe may in part have been its unwillingness to listen to
Western economists. Urged to make its currency freely tradable with
the dollar, it resisted. If the Chinese yuan had been convertible,
then Chinese would have sent their money fleeing as Thais and
Indonesians did, and China might also be mired in a major financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   China claims economic growth last year of almost 8 percent _ a
tribute to the government's $1.2 trillion stimulus plan and
probably to the audacity of the statisticians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one troublesome parallel with the hardest-hit countries of
Asia is found in a vast hole in the ground in the Pudong district
of Shanghai. The hole, swarming with construction workers, is
scheduled to become the Shanghai World Financial Center, the
tallest building in the world. At 1,509 feet tall, it will be 27
feet taller than the Petronas Towers of Malaysia, which in 1997
surpassed the Sears Tower to become the tallest.
</P>
<P>
   Someday it may pay off. But for now it is scheduled to cost $625
million and provide 3.6 million square feet of floor space (twice
as much as the Empire State Building) just as the Pudong business
district finds itself with dozens of new buildings and an overall
occupancy rate of only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This real estate bubble is linked to Japan, for the World
Financial Center is backed in part by Japanese banks and is the
brainchild of Minoru Mori, chief executive of Mori Building Co.
Mori is a visionary in Japanese business circles, a man who reveres
the French architect and planner Le Corbusier and who also aspires
not just to put up roofs but to shape society.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is unabashed. He argues that while Shanghai property may
look like it is heading for a bust, in the long run there will be
another boom as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the abacus will show a profit for us,'' he said, but
he acknowledged that completion of the World Financial Center might
now be delayed a couple of years after the original target date of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of his boardroom, on the 37th floor of his Ark-Mori
building in Tokyo, is a painting from Mori's outstanding collection
of Le Corbusiers, bearing a large inscription by the artist: ``Je
revais,'' or ``I was dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The real estate glut in China is at the heart of a banking mess
perhaps more serious than anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese banks have lent heavily to construct buildings that are
now largely vacant and worth little. Three of the four major banks
are effectively insolvent by a huge margin, even though these are
boom times.
</P>
<P>
   So long as depositors keep their money in the accounts, the
banks can keep functioning indefinitely. But the moment depositors
start asking for their money back, the banking system in China will
face the possibility of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   China's bad bank debts are staggeringly large, totaling about 40
percent of gross national product, compared with 3 percent in the
United States during the savings and loan crisis. Nonperforming
loans (those that are not being paid back) are about 25 percent of
the total at the big banks, significantly higher than in other
countries when they were hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, there seems little prospect that China will face
an international currency crisis of the kind that hit Thailand and
Indonesia. Beijing has $145 billion in foreign exchange reserves,
exceeding the country's entire $131 billion foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the risks of political upheaval in China coming from
two directions, both economic.
</P>
<P>
   One danger for the government is a banking crisis, driving
furious depositors to the streets to demand their money back.
</P>
<P>
   The second risk comes from workers who lose their jobs at
state-owned companies. The Communist Party has reiterated its plans
to close down money-losing companies, but those workers may
represent the sternest challenge to the Communist Party since the
democracy movement in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, 11.5 million people are unemployed in China, but
that figure is not very meaningful because it excludes people who
have been laid off as well as rural workers and peasant migrants to
the cities. Estimates of total unemployment range up to 260
million, which is also not very meaningful, because many of these
people manage to get odd jobs or make money on their land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one doubts that there are tens of millions of Chinese
workers and peasants who are unemployed or underemployed and who
are a potentially dangerous element in the social mix. Outside the
southern city of Changsha, near where Mao grew up, thousands of
people clashed with police early in January, and one man was killed
when he was hit with an exploding tear-gas canister and bled to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, some 500 laid-off workers from a defunct wire-cable
factory marched through Changsha and were joined by several
thousand sympathetic onlookers who brought traffic in the downtown
area to a standstill for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Weilin, 45, one of the onlookers, acknowledged that these
protests might not lead anywhere, for workers are very careful not
to push too far or to come across as protest leaders, for that
might mean arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the frustrations were evident in the placards that
workers carried, declaring, ``We have no food,'' and ``We don't
want fish or meat, just a bowl of rice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' Wang said, ``have nothing to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   PANIC SPAWNS THE NINJA
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia offers frightening images of how economic distress can
tear a society apart. Optimists sometimes used to say there was a
possibility that China could turn out as well as Indonesia, but now
Indonesia seems less a model than a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian Muslims have been burning down churches, and
Christians have been attacking mosques. In the capital, Muslim mobs
have chased down and hacked Christian men to death as police
officers and soldiers stood by. And when there is no other target
around, rioters attack ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Java region of Indonesia's main island, mysterious
groups of men dressed in black have been killing Muslim religious
leaders, chopping up the bodies and throwing the pieces into
mosques. This has created a panic, leading to a witch hunt _
literally _ for the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Called ninja by local people, these killers are believed to be
sorcerers, and panicked mobs sometimes beat to death those whom
they think might be ninja. More than 200 people have been killed so
far, either by real ninja or by mobs looking for ninja, and crowds
have sometimes paraded the heads of their victims on pikes.
</P>
<P>
   Such brutality seems particularly incongruous because Java was
civilized before England and has an ancient culture emphasizing
harmony and restraint. The killings and mutilations have been a
gruesome reminder of how rapidly economic crises can cause
societies to mutate in horrific ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Mojokerto, even Salamet, the rickshaw driver, has joined a
posse to guard against ninja. He goes out each evening with a group
of men, armed with clubs and sickles. Salamet is the most
reasonable of the group, but some of the men spend their days
sharpening their sickles and talking proudly of hacking to death
any intruders they find.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from Salamet, a Muslim activist named Ahmed Banu
claims to have beaten two ninja to death, and he shows off a pair
of boots that he says belonged to one of the dead men. In fact, the
entire episode seems to have been fictional, but Banu is a
charismatic man with a growing following.
</P>
<P>
   After prayers on a recent evening, he held an open meeting of
local Muslims to deal with the supposed ninja menace. Salamet
stayed away, but 24 men attended, listening intently as Banu warned
passionately that the ninja were ready to destroy the neighborhood
and vanquish all Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we Muslims are being treated like animals,'' he said, his
voice rising, ``will we stand for it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' his followers yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catch the ninja, what should we do? Give them to the
police or kill them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kill them!''

MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE PUSHED IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With support strong on Beacon Hill to help
Massachusetts' lowest-paid workers, Senate President Thomas
Birmingham and Governor Paul Cellucci are pushing competing plans
to boost the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham is calling for the more aggressive hike to the
state's minimum wage, which is currently $5.25 a hour. His plan
would increase the rate by $1.50 over the next three years. The
Chelsea Democrat also would tie future increases to the state's
minimum wage to the consumer price index, a main gauge of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if you work for a living in Massachusetts, you
should be able to make a living here, which is just not the case
with the present minimum wage,'' Birmingham said in an interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an economic issue, it's a paramount issue of
social justice that in this era of great prosperity we should
recognize that the riches aren't being evenly shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's plan, which he plans to file Thursday, calls for a
90-cent hike over two years. It does not include any automatic
hikes after the second increase goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get to the point where the federal minimum wage
and the state's minimum wage are the same,'' Cellucci, a
Republican, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law currently sets the minimum wage at $5.15 an hour,
though President Clinton and US Senator Edward Kennedy are pressing
to boost it by $1 over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The push to raise Massachusetts' minimum wage is putting the
spotlight on House Speaker Thomas Finneran, who single-handedly
killed a proposed hike last year. Finneran not only blocked a House
vote on Birmingham's bill, but by refusing to assign the bill to a
committee, he prohibited his members from even debating it.
</P>
<P>
   But House members, including some of Finneran's own leadership
team, said Wednesday that was strong support for minimum wage hike
in the House. The question is whether Finneran will allow it to
come to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this comes up for a House vote it will pass, and Finneran
knows that,'' said one House member. ``And with Birmingham moving
to get the bill over here so early in the legislative session, it
will impossible for him to argue there isn't enough time to
consider it, like he did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Senate passed Birmingham's bill, which would raise
the minimum wage by 50 cents an hour each year for three years, by
a vote of 35-4 as an amendment to the budget. But after Finneran
refused to assign the bill to a committee, it couldn't move forward
in the legislative process. When the session ended in July, the
wage hike proposal died.
</P>
<P>
   This year Birmingham has taken the unusual step of bypassing the
House in the early legislative stages and assigning his wage bill
to the Senate's Ways and Means Committee. Usually, such a bill
would go to a committee controlled jointly by the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the matter
Thursday. Birmingham expects the Senate to adopt the measure within
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate has spoken on this issue and will again soon,''
Birmingham said. ``If the Speaker's position is that of the members
of the House, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some House members worry that Birmingham's aggressive
tactics will anger Finneran and provoke him to block the measure
from coming up for consideration in the House.
</P>
<P>
   While labor unions support a minimum wage hike, business groups
oppose it, arguing that Massachusetts is already a high-cost state.
Raising the minimum wage, opponents say, will make Massachusetts
less competitive with other states.

 UNDATED: ``Kill them!''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE HOUSE BRAINSTORMS
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day last year, as financial markets worldwide were
tumbling in the aftermath of Russia's financial turmoil, an
impatient and annoyed Bill Clinton summoned his top advisers to the
Yellow Oval Room on the third floor of the White House. Clinton, in
cowboy boots, settled in his favorite chair by the fireplace, and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sat directly opposite, as he likes
to do, so that he could look the president in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted to attack the crisis more directly and
more openly. He also wanted his administration to lead the way in
remaking the global financial system, so as to reduce the risk of
another crisis down the road. He had been speaking on the telephone
with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and they had agreed that
world leaders should step out and convey a sense of urgency about
altering the international economic order _ and so he was
frustrated with Rubin's caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was leaning on Treasury for some action,'' recalled
one participant. ``He was leaning hard. And of course the Treasury
wanted to be cautious. It was telling the political types in the
White House that this is sensitive stuff _ you say one wrong thing
and you can mess things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem is that today's Bretton Woods economic
structure _ based on fixed exchange rates and the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund _ is widely regarded as outdated and
insufficient to steady today's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to establish a new system for the 21st century,'' said
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister of finance. ``You could
call it a new Bretton Woods. It's difficult, but it's got to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   But what precisely is to be done?
</P>
<P>
   While almost everyone agrees that the present system is
inadequate, there is no consensus on what would be better. Ideas
range from radical proposals for a global central bank and
semifixed exchange rates among major currencies to more modest
suggestions for tougher bank standards and curbs on hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland,
recently, some European officials urged the creation of an ``early
warning system,'' roughly equivalent to a weather satellite
alerting the world to approaching economic tornadoes. But the
technology simply does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue for an ``exit tax,'' which would require investors
to pay a fee for removing their money from a country quickly _ an
experiment that Malaysia is now trying. But Rubin fears the tax
could scare off investors.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton's enthusiasm for doing something seems to have
ebbed as the sense of crisis faded, there seems little chance that
the present debate will lead to any major changes soon in the
international economic system.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that for all the tragedies now unfolding in places
like Indonesia, supporters of the current economic system say that
overall, it has done an excellent job of promoting economic growth.
By some economic measures, Indonesians are better off materially
today, in the bust stage of their boom-bust cycle, than if they had
bought stability at the price of sacrificing growth in the boom
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All countries have benefited from the free market system,''
said Jurgen Stark, vice president of the Bundesbank, Germany's
central bank. ``I am a little worried about all the talk about a
`new financial architecture.' What's new? What would it
accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that although the metaphor is always ``new
financial architecture,'' the proposals for the financial system
are usually fairly small-bore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think architecture is a bad word,'' said John Heimann, who
recently stepped down as chairman of Merrill Lynch Global Capital
Markets to head a new bank-supervisor training institute. ``What
you need is more attention to the plumbing and electricity. That's
not as dramatic, but it's the plumbing and electricity that make
the house work.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of these kinds of changes are under discussion. At the
global level, the 22 leading industrialized countries proposed 44
initiatives, ranging from an international accounting code to
better supervision of banks, insurance firms and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are trying to take dull but important steps to
reduce the risks of crises: improving their legal systems; creating
a modern bankruptcy structure; fighting corruption, and hiring bank
supervisors. But these steps often run into entrenched local
interests, and the progress is slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the lessons been tough enough so that people in
individual countries are moving to actually fix their financial
market infrastructure?'' asked William McDonough, president of the
New York Federal Reserve Bank and chairman of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision. ``Probably not. Should the effort be made?
Yes. Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a simple or common solution to these types of
problems? I don't think so.''

<P>
   THE DANGER OF HUBRIS
</P>
<P>
   So what are the lessons of Asia and Russia as they apply to the
American economy?
</P>
<P>
   There is not much agreement on that. The lessons on which a
consensus has emerged seem surprisingly obvious and modest for an
economic catastrophe that has destroyed so much wealth and
transformed the prospects of nations from Indonesia to Russia to
Brazil. Historians may eventually elicit more subtle conclusions,
but for now the lessons are almost embarrassingly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   One is the danger of hubris. The crisis arose in part because
emerging-market countries built up too confidently, because Western
investors and bankers were too optimistic in their assessments of
risk and because Western governments were too convinced that they
had the right solutions. Throughout the crisis, expert predictions
have invariably been wrong and even miracle economies have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A second lesson is the importance of prudence in the banking
system, the pillar of any modern economy. Financial institutions
have generally been better supervised in America than in many other
countries, but the near-failure of Long-Term Capital Management
underscored the risks even in the most sophisticated and
best-supervised market in the West.
</P>
<P>
   And a third lesson is the danger of stock and property manias.
Many Asians say glumly that they have learned the hard way the
importance of scrutinizing the foundations of any economy, however
dazzling it seems. And as they say that, they look _ jealously,
resentfully and nervously _ at the American economy and especially
at the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a dispute about whether that lesson applies to
the United States. America has far less corruption and cronyism
than Russia or Indonesia, and no one thinks that America has built
a bubble on the scale of Japan's in 1990, so some analysts argue
that any parallel with Asia is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not accept the comparison between Asia and the United
States,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment
policy committee at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. and so far one of the most
bullish and accurate of Wall Street strategists. Ms. Cohen
emphasized that while Asia's boom was fueled by cheap credit _
artificially low interest rates _ this has not been true of the
United States. In addition, she noted that American accounting and
banking standards are more rigorous than those abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian economy has been having difficulty recovering
because banks have large portfolios of underperforming loans,'' she
said. ``But here the level of bank regulation has been much higher.
Regulators are really paying attention, and shareholders are paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists and policy-makers in Asia, with a biting skepticism
that comes from seeing their own economies swell and pop, are often
contemptuous of the American explanations. They point to the
banking crisis in Texas in the late 1980s as an example of the
foolishness that even highly regulated banks can engage in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it objectively,'' said Sakakibara, ``the United
States now has a bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics like him say that the United States has followed the
Asian pattern of an upward spiral whereby higher stock prices lead
to rising investment and consumer spending, which leads to higher
stock prices and pushes the spiral even higher. Moreover, the
United States is financing its growth the Thai and Indonesian way _
by borrowing from abroad, although it has the advantage of being
able to borrow in its own currency.
</P>
<P>
   The American stock market has also soared to its highest ratio
of market capitalization to gross national product (140 percent)
ever recorded in history, a ratio that compares with a previous
peak of 81 percent in 1929. The American ratio is more than twice
as high as Indonesia's or Brazil's at the time their crises hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, one of the central problems in Asia and
Russia was that investors were so used to success that they did not
contemplate catastrophe. In the same way, the long bull market in
the West since 1982 means that most stock market investors cannot
conceive of how devastating a bear market can be, even if the
market turbulence in the fall did shake them up.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kindleberger, an economic historian and author of the
book ``Manias, Panics and Crashes,'' said he was ``troubled by the
volatility'' of the American stock market today. ``I've been
thinking for two or three years that the market was too high,'' he
added. ``When it collapsed in August, I thought it might be
becoming sensible again. But it turned out that the Fed reduced
interest rates three times, and the market returned to its previous
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindleberger also expressed concern over the parallel with Japan
in the late 1980s. In the face of a global slowdown, Japan cut
interest rates to stimulate its economy, and the result was even
more frenzied speculation, which eventually collapsed and proved
catastrophic to Japan and the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   So, looking at the financial crisis, John Kenneth Galbraith, the
nonagenarian Harvard economist, concludes that ``the overwhelming
lesson is to be aware of the history'' of speculative mania, and to
be ``further aware that the United States is also part of the
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculative mood,'' he added, ``can pervade Wall Street as
much as Tokyo or Malaysia.''

<P>
   EXPLAINING A CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   Economists and government officials have offered an abundance of
neat explanations for the crisis. Some attribute it to crony
capitalism and fundamental weaknesses in overseas countries. Others
point to the fickleness of international capital flows and the
entire global economic system. Still others say that the culprit
was the United States and the monetary fund, or alternatively the
venality and incompetence of governments in Russia, or Indonesia,
or other countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economists will dispute for years which factors leading to the
crisis were necessary, and which sufficient, and which tangential.
But the causes seem so many and so intertwined that it is difficult
to fit them together in any neat equation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for all the talk in recent months about grand
solutions to crises, there is a growing sense that no good answer
may be out there, and that one price of economic development has
perhaps been a loss of control over the markets that nurtured the
development.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prosperity in general has led to what seems an
unstoppable trend toward steadily greater oceans of capital
sloshing around the globe, and all that cash in turn creates new
instability. For all the post-Cold War sense of triumphalism, for
all of the high-speed computer networks that in an instant can
graph the trend in the yen-dollar rate, fundamentally the world's
economies come across as corks bobbing in the sea. And, unless the
U.S. economy was badly hit, it would be difficult to imagine world
leaders galvanized to devise a new approach to international
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key causes of this crisis may lie not in economic
ratios but human nature. In explaining the way that international
economic crises have rippled around the globe, historians have
often concluded that the most important factor was psychology. The
same may be true today.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and ``rocket scientists'' and first-rate research have
yet to overcome the instinctive tendency of markets to overshoot up
and down. The herds went from mania to panic in an instant, and
this process trampled Asia and Russia. It is also what some
economists worry about when they look at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old human emotions of fear and euphoria still prevail,''
said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former head of Clinton's Council of
Economic Advisers. Ms. Tyson said that Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, had once made the same point to her, noting that
if one looked at a graph of jumps and dips in stock prices, it
would be impossible to tell whether one was looking at the 1890s or
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis suggests that the old high-tech tools are still in
frail human hands.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, musing on the crisis, said: ``I wouldn't be as severe
on the regulators as on those being regulated. When you are dealing
with insanity, one looks first at the insane and then at those
supervising them.''
</P>
<P>
   BACK ON THE HOME FRONT
</P>
<P>
   In Cantrall, not far from Burrus' hog farm, Mary Jo Paoni is
planning to retire in April from her job as a secretary. Whatever
the uncertainties, and despite her pension fund's loss of $2.7
million on Indonesian stocks, it has still ridden the boom in
American stocks and is in strong shape. Mrs. Paoni and her
generation of Americans will be able to retire without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is also embedded in her community, and these days it is
showing signs of vulnerability. The corn that surrounds her home
sold for $5 a bushel two years ago; now the global economic
difficulties have sent corn plunging to $2.12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried,'' she said, exclaiming: ``Good God, look what's
on TV now! How about the layoffs!''
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring and downsizing strike a particular nerve in
the Paoni household because the supermarket chain where Mrs.
Paoni's husband, George, worked for 32 years was bought out by a
distant company just nine months before his retirement. He did not
lose his job as a meat cutter, but he lost his holiday pay and five
weeks' vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paoni is apprehensive about stock market levels and also
about local signs of disquiet: With farmers in trouble, tractor
sales have slumped, and the nearby John Deere plant has announced
layoffs. Banks are nervously checking their exposure to the
agricultural sector. And Mrs. Paoni, after some reflection and
several hours of interviews, has decided that she is linked to the
global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit here in this kitchen and say I don't have anything to do
with Asia, but I do,'' she said. ``There's always some tentacles
out there. Asia will definitely have an effect on Iowa and
Illinois.''

CLINTON TO RETURN TO GRANITE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exactly seven years after New Hampshire voters
resurrected his faltering political career in the wake of the
Gennifer Flowers and Vietnam War draft controversies, President
Clinton, on the mend from a tortuous 13-month sex scandal, makes a
somewhat nostalgic visit there Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Granite State is where Clinton dubbed himself the ``Comeback
Kid'' after a strong second-place primary finish in the 1992
presidential campaign despite allegations of marital infidelity and
questions about how he avoided the draft, and where he is coming
back to make his first political appearance since his Senate
impeachment trial ended in acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to deliver a speech on health care in
Dover, and attend a private lunch with friends and supporters in
Merrimack and a state Democratic Party dinner in Manchester during
the one-day trip that organizers said was confirmed a few days
after the Dec. 19 House vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something special about New Hampshire for the
president,'' said White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart,
specifically mentioning the '92 primary. He dismissed the idea of
any symbolism in the president's visit, calling the timing
``coincidental,'' and delivering a crisp ``no'' when asked whether
Clinton was going there to gloat about his Senate acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, to cheering supporters on primary night in Merrimack,
Clinton said, ``New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the
comeback kid.'' He added: ``At least I proved one thing, I can take
a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   That ability to take a punch, and New Hampshire's willingness to
help him get back on his feet, may be part of the mutual appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters here are proud of the fact that he can take a punch,
dust himself off and keep on going, no matter what his adversaries
say about him,'' said Joseph Keefe, former New Hampshire Democratic
Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters were the first Americans to make the
distinction between the president's private life and his public
duties. That distinction has since been embraced by a great
majority of Americans,'' said Keefe, who also is a member of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Clinton plans to promote his budget proposal
for targeted tax relief, including a $1,000 tax credit for
long-term care. He will address the 40th anniversary dinner of the
New Hampshire State Democratic Party's ``100 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, current chairman of the state Democratic Party,
said Clinton was booked in August for the dinner, but those plans
had to be canceled because of independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's investigation of the president's affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Woodburn said Clinton was invited because of his ability to draw
a crowd, which is difficult in New Hamsphire ``when you have the
presidential candidates around as frequently as they are.''
Woodburn said he expects up to 1,000 people to attend the
fund-raising dinner and reception, which he hopes will raise more
than $100,000 for Democratic candidates. Ticket prices range
between $100 and $750.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the dinner _ the seventh anniversary of Clinton's
strong showing in the state primary _ was no mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a lot of friends in the state, and I think New
Hampshire feels a lot of ownership in this presidency,'' Woodburn
said. ``We saw beyond Gennifer Flowers, the draft issue, and we saw
the quality of the human being standing before us and embraced that
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, when those scandals surfaced, Clinton went to the
Dover Elks Lodge and asked the state's voters to give him a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I'm on the ropes now, not because of anything I did
in my public life, not because of anything I've done to you,'' he
said. ``I'm on the ropes because people questioned my life, after
years of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   And in what would become some of the most memorable lines of his
campaign, he said, ``I won't forget who gave me a second chance.
I'll be there with you until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not expected to make a repeat trip to the Elks Lodge,
but Clark Hubbard, a political scientist at the University of New
Hampshire, said the president's visit will be ``very symbolic both
for Clinton personally and in terms of his renewed efforts to
rehabilitate his image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He recovered from the Gennifer Flowers fiasco here in New
Hampshire. That was sort of his first big test, not of his
presidency, but his pre-presidency, and now he's facing the next
big test of his presidency,'' Hubbard said. ``And I think he's
going to get it off the ground here. New Hampshire voters seem to
have a sympathetic ear for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``He's rehabilitated his image here once before, so it
seems like a logical place to do it once again.''

LONDON-NEW YORK: A ONE-WAY STREET?  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British tide that periodically washes over the American
theater is surging again. Already ensconced on New York stages are
David Hare's ``Blue Room,'' David Leveaux's production of
``Electra'' and Harold Pinter's ``Ashes to Ashes.'' And what about
Diana Rigg's recent visit in ``Phedre'' and ``Britannicus'' at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, where ``Blue Heart,'' the double bill by
Caryl Churchill, winds up its run today? Then there was Matthew
Bourne's ``Swan Lake,'' the ballet that played Broadway as
comfortably as a musical. Speaking of Broadway, half a dozen more
theaters are about to open their doors to productions that have
already won attention in London: Kevin Spacey in ``The Iceman
Cometh'' and Dame Judi Dench in ``Amy's View'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? And what about traffic the other way?
This special section on theater tries to answer those questions,
starting off with a conversation among the three theater critics of
The New York Times: Ben Brantley, Vincent Canby and Peter Marks.
Their talk _ over tea and biscuits, appropriately _ was recorded by
the theater editor of Arts and Leisure, Andrea Stevens, who began
by asking if the crowd of arriving British productions would risk
canceling one another out. Here are excerpts from the discussion.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VINCENT CANBY. I don't think people think of them as English
shows or not English shows, if they're good shows.
</P>
<P>
   BEN BRANTLEY. And they are such different species. ``Not About
Nightingales'' is coming by way of Trevor Nunn and Vanessa
Redgrave. Nonetheless, when I saw it in Houston, I would not have
said, ``Wow, what a great British production.'' It's a resurrection
of a purely Tennessee Williams play and purely American.
</P>
<P>
   PETER MARKS. But who would have thought a year ago that you
would have so many plays to choose from?
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Don't you think it's a product of having had ``The Beauty
Queen of Leenane,'' which started it, and then we suddenly got a
whole rash?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Janet McTeer's revival of ``A Doll's House,'' I think,
was key in opening the door. What is interesting is what we seem to
be getting from it. Yes, it has the English pedigree, so everyone
salivates. But it's not ``Masterpiece Theater.'' There's a vitality
in these productions that we don't get very often from American
straight plays. At least those that are seen on Broadway. If you're
comparing ``Getting and Spending'' with ``Closer,'' I mean__
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. ``Shopping and ... '' or ``The Weir''?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. I went to see Mark Ravenhill's other play,
``Handbag,'' in London, and it made me think maybe I should
reconsider ``Shopping and ... ''; that it suffered from being done
here with an American cast. I don't think I'd ever like it. But I
can see now what the buzz was about it, because there's an energy,
there's a sense of connection of the theater in England with its
audiences that we've lost. There are exceptions. Last night I went
to see the Richard Foreman play ``Paradise Hotel.'' That was an
exciting audience. But for the most part on Broadway they go
anesthetized, they leave anesthetized and they don't want anything
that's going to interrupt their anesthesia. There's no buzz. At
intermission, you don't hear people talking excitedly, as they did
at ``A Doll's House.''
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Have you gone back to see ``Art'' with the new cast?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. No.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. I did.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. You liked it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. I'm astonished by its longevity and the way it holds an
audience. And the fact that almost anybody can play it. You could
put baboons in it and it would still be funny.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Are you saying the three of us?
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Oh, boy. Don't let that idea get out.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. They'll sell six tickets.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. No, they'll sell out the house and give them tomatoes and
fruit to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREA STEVENS. Do you think there's a difference between the
audiences here and in London?
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. In London there's still a habit of going to the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   STEVENS. But that habit is supposedly dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. I know. And Ian McKellen has gone up to the north
country, to Leeds, because he's dissatisfied with what he sees of
London audiences. But comparatively, there's still an ``Oh, let's
go to the theater.'' Here, there are such expectations that there
is this self-consciousness on either side of the proscenium: the
audience saying, ``Oh, my God, can I get the sitter, blah, blah,
blah,'' and those in the production thinking, ``Well, we've got to
give them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. We have a skewed sense of English theater here because
the best things usually come in. Still, when I go to a play from
London, very often I think, ``Which country is the older country?''
Because I always feel like theirs is so much fresher.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. It's true.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. What's coming over here feels reinvented. It's coming out
of the mind anew. And what originates here is so much more
conservative. Look at the plays that won Tony Awards in the last
few years. We're so reflective and nostalgic _ ``Last Night at
Ballyhoo.'' The one original new American play that comes to
Broadway this season is ``Side Man,'' which is a memory play with
echoes of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Don't you think it has to do with the general climate
of caution, though? If it's proven in England, it arrives with the
English imprimatur. There's a sense that people will be willing to
gamble on it. But I know exactly what you're saying. Which
(italics)is(end italics) the younger country, in fact? That has to
do not only with the habit of going to the theater but of making
theater. It's just something you do. It seems like an organic
thing. Where you don't have 20 levels of marketing between the
production and the idea. America is pathetic right now, as far as
that stuff goes.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Do we have as much marketing going on with straight
plays? It seems to me what's happened recently has been that as a
result of the success of English straight plays here, we are
getting many more attempts to do straight American plays. They're
coming up out of Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Or the regional theater.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Or staying Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. As annoying as a lot of English theater is, you still
want to go every night.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. They write in response to something visceral. Politics
and ideas are still big themes in British plays. And you've still
got David Hare and Tom Stoppard _ two immense bookends of the
theater _ writing these plays on topics that fill a big space, even
if they're small plays. Here _ talk about compartmentalizing _
playwrights have got the message that they're writing in a smaller
artistic pursuit. They're told it's a small medium, it's not
movies, so they write small plays. Even the most major playwrights
_ with the exception of Tony Kushner, who wrote the one play of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Which came to us by way of England.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. But it's so interesting that these plays are all about
families, or about ethnic identity and gender identity. They're
picking up on that somewhat in London; it's starting to be more
obsessive there. But these are relatively tiny concerns. And you
sometimes feel in a big space: ``Why am I seeing this play here? I
need to be with these people in a small room.'' Maybe that's why
``Wit'' works where it is. Maybe it was the right decision not to
move that play, even though it's a lovely play, to a big, big
space.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. There's a big difference between Stoppard and Hare.
Stoppard's plays are alive and working on all sorts of levels.
Hare's plays, for me, too often seem to be operating from an idea
down.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Stoppard is much more of a linguist than Hare. He
starts with the love of language.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. Yet Hare has tremendous currency here. Three of his plays
are being done this season.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. We have to think of ``The Blue Room'' as an exception.
And also as an example of what's shameful in the British
theatergoing character.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed almost any Hare play,
I'm afraid.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. I didn't like it at all.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Well, it's painless.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Yes, that's true. But I'd rather be__
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. In pain?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Yes, I would. If it stimulates some kind of response.
Even if it makes me angry. With ``The Blue Room,'' I wanted to yawn
all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Well, I haven't been made angry. I have yawned at a lot
of Hare's work.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Even if it is starting with an idea, I think he has so
much personally invested in those ideas and putting them across. At
his best, it's not a one-sided polemic. He does present the debate
at least, and he doesn't come to easy conclusions. But it's true:
Who else can make Oscar Wilde boring? But he keeps producing. He
keeps the dialogue alive.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. That's true of all writers. They have to keep writing to
write well.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. And he's responsive, as Peter was saying, to what's
going on in the world around him. There is a sense of a dialogue
with the audience that you don't get with American theater now.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. It's the same with our movies. Hollywood films, most of
them, could have been made on the moon. Much of our entertainment _
television sitcoms and whatnot _ has nothing to do with the lives
of the people who see them. Whereas in London and Paris, you do get
pop entertainment that is very much concerned with that world.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. When was the last time an American play got into the
conversation?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY and MARKS. ``Angels in America.''
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. The difference is in this country when kids are in fourth
grade they do ``Peter Pan'' or ``Once Upon a Mattress.'' That's
what our theater education involves, the show business aspect. In
England, they feel it's theirs. Shakespeare is in their blood.
There's no fear, there's no insecurity. Part of our embrace of the
English is that in some ways we haven't gotten over England.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. It's still a colonialist attitude to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. It's not just that. They bring the best over, too. We
aren't willing to see something about which we know nothing.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Let's not forget that London also gave us ``The Herbal
Bed.''
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. That was certainly a cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Fusty, self-conscious, quote, cultured English theater
at its worst, end quote. And I think it is a testimony to the
discriminating taste, for once, of American audiences that it
didn't take off.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. But the question of why we fall in love over and over
with what they bring in _ that hasn't changed in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. In the beginning of the 20th century you had Sarah
Bernhardt and Eleanora Duse coming over. And no one cared that they
couldn't speak the language. They just wanted to see them. There's
nothing comparable right now.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. They also have a whole raft of actors who do nothing but
work in the theater. And that gives them an ability to do things
that we could never match. I think of Peter Hall's ``Ideal
Husband'' _ it still remains in my memory. And they can do French
farce, which I've seen done in London, which always fails here. We
don't know how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. On the other hand, you look at something like Lincoln
Center Theater, which, at its best, does provide the equivalent of
what ``An Ideal Husband'' was, which I think of as the
well-upholstered play. I was thinking of ``A Delicate Balance,''
for example.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. Which we sent over there and they did.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. That's right, but in another production.
</P>
<P>
   STEVENS. What do you think about that _ the exchanges negotiated
by the actors' unions here and in England? Apparently, British
Equity has suggested to American Equity that the two sides try a
year with no restrictions and see what happens. Do you think
American actors would suffer because it would be all in one
direction?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. I like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. You might get a lot of English so-called stars coming
over. I think it would be a terrific idea.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. It's crazy to have these restrictions. I don't understand
why for this profession the Hague Convention has to be invoked. If
you go down the line, how many people are we talking about? Maybe
50 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   STEVENS. What about the theory that when we send our plays over
that show us off to bad advantage, the English love them?
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. What's more common is portrayals by British playwrights
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Like ``Taking Sides.''
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. Exactly. They're stereotypes, but it's mostly lesser
playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Arthur Miller is celebrated there.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. It's ``Death of a Salesman,'' for crying out loud. He's
so cynical about American culture and American politics. The
English love that.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Though ``Death of a Salesman'' was not a smash when it
first opened in London.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. It's also his earnestness. The other thing is, the
English have an archival interest in the theater that doesn't
necessarily have to produce just dust and footnotes: the fact that
Vanessa Redgrave's own personal passion and interest in Tennessee
Williams would lead her to bring out ``Not About Nightingales''
from some academic vault. And then to give it the kind of
passionate production that it has. Again, I think a London audience
is, shamefully, going to be more interested in Tennessee Williams.
Even if this isn't a perfect play, they will say, ``Let's go and
see what he was thinking at that time.'' Whereas here, it's going
to be: ``Is it perfect? Is it thumbs up or thumbs down? Is it a
blockbuster evening?'' We demand too much and too little at once.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Because London has a theater culture that doesn't exist
in New York. So there isn't that great pool.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. London was never a moviegoing city. Television was on
three channels, not 72 channels. Just the mix of the media was
different. They always felt theater was theirs. And in a funny way
we never have.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. I'll be very interested to see what the response is
here to ``Not About Nightingales.'' People think if they're going
to go out, they want to have a good time. The number of people,
smart people, too, real theatergoers, who have said, ``Oh, `Wit.'
Well I don't know, a play about death. I don't really think I'm up
to that tonight.'' I've used the metaphor before, but people want
the theater to be a geisha. It's like: ``If I'm spending this much
money, you make me feel good. You give me a massage like I've never
had before.''
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. What do you think we do as well, if not better than the
English in theater?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. It is a cyclical thing. Mid-century, I don't think
there was anything in contemporary English theater that matched
what was coming out here. I don't think anything John Osborne wrote
is half as good as anything Tennessee Williams wrote. It does go
through cycles, and you have to figure that the balance is in their
favor right now for a lot of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting about Kushner and the reason we keep going
back to him _ although I was not a fan of his second adaptation of
``The Dybbuk''; I liked the first better _ is this: When I went to
``Love's Fire,'' the evening of plays inspired by Shakespeare's
sonnets, suddenly, when his one-act comes on, after listening to
everyone else and their rote formulas, there is a passion about
language that is so rare in American theater now that he does have.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Also, as you said earlier, he is aware of the world
around him. I think ``Slavs!'' is a marvelous play. It's better
than any other American play that year.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. But it's not just topical. With him there is an
awareness and a commitment. And it all seems to be part of the same
package: the passion transfuses his approach to the world. But also
the possibility of language to shape, to change, to mutate, is what
I think is so great about him. It's what the theater can do that
film can't.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. We spend a lot of time trying to emulate the movies on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Which I think is always disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Movies have made the staging of plays much more fluid.
Their influence has been all to the good, I think. I'm talking
about plays that move simply and easily from one scene to another.
And we all accept it. You don't ned three-sided sets and all that
baloney. Some plays do need them. But many are freed by
acknowledging that the audience has an imagination and it will go
anywhere if the play is good.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Movies are much more literal-minded.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Let me ask you: What do you think is the difference
between London critics and New York critics?
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. Oh, boy. I'm not touching that. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. I'm baffled, because some of them are among the brightest
people I know. And the difference in taste is just extraordinary at
times.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. Remember, they're writing that night for the most
part. And we have the luxury of a day or even several to reflect
and distill. I think it's healthy that there are so many of them
coming from so many different directions, because it's not this
monolithic voice saying go or not.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Also, I think they are all encouraged to be
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. That's true. But the reviews of ``The Blue Room''
mystify me. I do think that was a provincial reaction.
</P>
<P>
   STEVENS. Would you say that American audiences are waiting to be
told what to go to, whereas in England, critics are writing for
someone who may throw down the review and say, ``I don't care, I'm
going''?
</P>
<P>
   BRANTLEY. It goes back to the idea of an open dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. The perfect example is that when a bunch of critics
directed plays in London, they were savaged by the directors, who
wrote reviews that were published.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. If you try to write for an audience, you're going to be
in hot water. You just try to be as articulate as you can. One
problem with all reviewing is that 99 percent of what you see is
neither very good nor very bad. And as writers, there is a problem
with trying to make that interesting to read.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. If you just say, ``No, no, no,'' people may not admit it
_ they always say they want you to go thumbs up or down _ but if
you do that they turn off. They think you're a crank or you're a
cheerleader. So, it's a trap.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. I think all readers who read any paper conscientiously or
regularly, find out where they stand in relation to a particular
critic. They come to recognize a critic's tics and how to interpret
them. They know whether if somebody likes something, then maybe I
will like it, but not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS. There is that response, that immediacy that people feel
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY. Then you come upon something that you like so much that
you can't bear the idea that it won't be seen and you can't wait to
write the first word. You're excited and on fire for something.
It's great fun to write those reviews.

LINTON TO RETURN TO GRANITE STATE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exactly seven years after New Hampshire voters
resurrected his faltering political career in the wake of the
Gennifer Flowers and Vietnam War draft controversies, President
Clinton, on the mend from a tortuous 13-month sex scandal, makes a
somewhat nostalgic visit there Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Granite State is where Clinton dubbed himself the ``Comeback
Kid'' after a strong second-place primary finish in the 1992
presidential campaign despite allegations of marital infidelity and
questions about how he avoided the draft, and where he is coming
back to make his first political appearance since his Senate
impeachment trial ended in acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to deliver a speech on health care in
Dover, and attend a private lunch with friends and supporters in
Merrimack and a state Democratic Party dinner in Manchester during
the one-day trip that organizers said was confirmed a few days
after the Dec. 19 House vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something special about New Hampshire for the
president,'' said White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart,
specifically mentioning the '92 primary. He dismissed the idea of
any symbolism in the president's visit, calling the timing
``coincidental,'' and delivering a crisp ``no'' when asked whether
Clinton was going there to gloat about his Senate acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, to cheering supporters on primary night in Merrimack,
Clinton said, ``New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the
comeback kid.'' He added: ``At least I proved one thing, I can take
a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   That ability to take a punch, and New Hampshire's willingness to
help him get back on his feet, may be part of the mutual appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters here are proud of the fact that he can take a punch,
dust himself off and keep on going, no matter what his adversaries
say about him,'' said Joseph Keefe, former New Hampshire Democratic
Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters were the first Americans to make the
distinction between the president's private life and his public
duties. That distinction has since been embraced by a great
majority of Americans,'' said Keefe, who also is a member of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Clinton plans to promote his budget proposal
for targeted tax relief, including a $1,000 tax credit for
long-term care. He will address the 40th anniversary dinner of the
New Hampshire State Democratic Party's ``100 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, current chairman of the state Democratic Party,
said Clinton was booked in August for the dinner, but those plans
had to be canceled because of independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's investigation of the president's affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Woodburn said Clinton was invited because of his ability to draw
a crowd, which is difficult in New Hamsphire ``when you have the
presidential candidates around as frequently as they are.''
Woodburn said he expects up to 1,000 people to attend the
fund-raising dinner and reception, which he hopes will raise more
than $100,000 for Democratic candidates. Ticket prices range
between $100 and $750.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the dinner _ the seventh anniversary of Clinton's
strong showing in the state primary _ was no mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a lot of friends in the state, and I think New
Hampshire feels a lot of ownership in this presidency,'' Woodburn
said. ``We saw beyond Gennifer Flowers, the draft issue, and we saw
the quality of the human being standing before us and embraced that
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, when those scandals surfaced, Clinton went to the
Dover Elks Lodge and asked the state's voters to give him a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I'm on the ropes now, not because of anything I did
in my public life, not because of anything I've done to you,'' he
said. ``I'm on the ropes because people questioned my life, after
years of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   And in what would become some of the most memorable lines of his
campaign, he said, ``I won't forget who gave me a second chance.
I'll be there with you until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not expected to make a repeat trip to the Elks Lodge,
but Clark Hubbard, a political scientist at the University of New
Hampshire, said the president's visit will be ``very symbolic both
for Clinton personally and in terms of his renewed efforts to
rehabilitate his image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He recovered from the Gennifer Flowers fiasco here in New
Hampshire. That was sort of his first big test, not of his
presidency, but his pre-presidency, and now he's facing the next
big test of his presidency,'' Hubbard said. ``And I think he's
going to get it off the ground here. New Hampshire voters seem to
have a sympathetic ear for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``He's rehabilitated his image here once before, so it
seems like a logical place to do it once again.''

WILL RODMAN HOP ON JERRY'S BUSS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There was Jerry Buss in his pregame element
at his dining table at the Forum Club, surrounded by his fawning
subjects that included, of course, his Designated Date For The
Evening who happened to be a very tall blonde in very tight pants
and looked as though she had celebrated very few birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why haven't you been able to sign Dennis Rodman?'' I asked the
Lakers owner, so cool, so poised, so in control of his domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money,'' Buss said. ``Dennis has to get used to the idea that
we can pay him only a few hundred thousand dollars. You must
understand Dennis made $10 million last year playing for the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way we can pay that because of salary cap restrictions.
Dennis right now is in a state of denial, like a guy who's just
been told he has cancer. He wants us to pay more, but we can't do
it. I talked to Dennis on the phone today. He wants to play for us.
I want him to play for us. But we can only give him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does Buss want Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's a good player who can help us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   Is Dennis Rodman worth all the commotion he's already created on
the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers coach, Del Harris, whose job status becomes a source
of passionate debate each time his team fails to beat a quality
opponent, is so uptight about the Rodman situation that, according
to Shaquille O'Neal, he's threatened to fine his players if they
consent to talk about it any longer with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a military family, and you do what the general
tells you to do,'' O'Neal said Tuesday night after the Lakers
breezed past the Charlotte Hornets. ``The coach told us not to talk
about Rodman, so I'm not talking about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't that violate your First Amendment rights of free
speech?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess it does, but that's the way it is,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did Harris say the fine would be if you talked about
Rodman?'' I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five thousand dollars,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm serious. Honestly. Five thousand dollars. It's just
not worth blowing that money over Dennis Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal wasn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Jerry West these days.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, once again, my two favorite Jerrys, Buss and West, are
having their differences.
</P>
<P>
   While Buss thinks Rodman would give the Lakers the rebounding
toughness and intense competitiveness they lack, West sees a young
team he's built being blown asunder by the outlandish antics that
are a daily part of Rodman's persona.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, West attempted to trade Eddie Jones, the Lakers'
notoriously erratic guard known for his strange playoff
disappearances, for the perennial All-Star guard, Mitch Richmond,
then with the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But Buss, with prodding from his accountants, nixed the
transaction, thereby depriving the Lakers of one of the NBA's most
accomplished shooters that would have given them the link they so
desperately miss late in tight games.
</P>
<P>
   Buss and West also had a well-publicized monetary disagreement,
which nearly led to West's departure from an organization he's been
with since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The two men effected an agreement that was reached over the
summer when Buss gave West a four-year contract extension, worth an
estimated $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed cordial bliss was restored, but the two strong willed
fellows are at loggerheads again because of Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Buss sees rebounds grabbed and tickets peddled because
of Rodman's presence, West envisions a media horror show that would
unravel his young team.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Buss sees another world championship banner for the
Lakers because of Rodman's presence, West envisions an insurrection
among his troops when it becomes apparent that Rodman will be given
preferential treatment by the the team's coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Buss sees the Lakers instantly turning into the NBA's
reigning glamour team featured most often on ESPN's Sports Center
because of Rodman's presence, West envisions a Rodman-distracted
team performing below expectations and becoming nothing more than a
cult favorite among diamond cutters, cross-dressers, hairstylists,
tattoo artists, bartenders, blackjack dealers, and massage parlor
bouncers.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   He was quite conspicuous by his absence at Tuesday's Laker game,
and I strongly think there is a direct corollary between his
absence and Buss' wooing of Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Karen West, Jerry's wife, said her husband wasn't feeling well,
and I'm sure he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers do wind up with Rodman, Jerry West will feel even
sicker and might miss a lot more Laker games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings about us getting Dennis Rodman,''
veteran guard Derek Harper said. ``I think he's a player who can
help the team. He's smart, knows how to win, and is a great
rebounder. But he also can bring distractions, and that can cause
problems for a young team that is fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, is this Dennis Rodman stuff fun!
</P>
<P>
   Except to Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   And Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps now even to the tongue-tied Shaquille O'Neal.

NEWS ANALYIS: RAMBOUILLET IS NO DAYTON
</HEADLINE>
   (With BC-KOSOVO-NYT) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When the idea of a peace conference for the tormented
province of Kosovo was first broached, there were instant
flashbacks to the Dayton talks that ended the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Warring factions from the Balkans quarantined in close quarters,
negotiators shuttling between the sides, suspense about the
outcome, high stakes for big countries _ all this conjured up a
reprise of what happened at an out-of-the-way military base in Ohio
more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 days into the negotiations in the gilded castle at
Rambouillet, 30 miles south of Paris, the differences are more
striking than the similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton talks were an American show from start to finish. Not
only did Richard Holbrooke, then an assistant secretary of state,
dominate the negotiations with his forceful personality, but he was
backed by more than 20,000 American troops that President Clinton
said would be deployed to enforce the peace the moment a deal was
signed.
</P>
<P>
   At Rambouillet, the Americans are smaller players. The chief of
a trio of negotiators is an American, Ambassador Christopher Hill,
but he lacks the relentless rhythms of Holbrooke. More
significantly, he lacks the commitment of a large number of
American troops to back him up.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a senior American military officer noted, the Clinton
administration is getting involved with the ``greatest
reluctance.''
</P>
<P>
   The process at Rambouillet is a European show, shepherded by the
French and to a lesser extent the British, and represents an effort
by the Europeans to prove that they can shoulder responsibilities
in their own backyard. Kosovo is a forlorn piece of land in
southern Europe, but its fighting threatens to spill into a wider
war and send waves of refugees onto the rest of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference is that at Rambouillet there is very
little discussion, negotiating or even arguing with the warring
sides.
</P>
<P>
   At Dayton, the leaders of Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia were all
present, and feared by the negotiators for what tantrums they might
throw, what demands they might make.
</P>
<P>
   In the French countryside, the 16-member ethnic Albanian
delegation and the 13 Serbs are actually bit characters.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have been diligent in studying the few
documents that have been passed around, making written comments and
waiting for answers, according to diplomats. The Serbs, by
contrast, have no authority from their master in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and, according to
participants in the conference, have been spending the evenings
playing the piano and singing.
</P>
<P>
   The real negotiating, and bickering, according to diplomats, is
among the six host countries, known as the Contact Group. This
group _ the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Italy and
Russia _ was established to resolve the problems of the former
Yugoslavia and is now trying to demonstrate that on the Kosovo
question, its past reputation for glacial diplomacy is unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But the squabbling among the sponsors has ranged from whether
NATO should be allowed to have officers present at the conference
to whether a monitoring mission established in Kosovo four months
ago by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
should be allowed to continue with an American leading the project.
</P>
<P>
   The French, who are the official hosts of the conference, argued
against allowing NATO officers at the conference, European and
American diplomats said. With the exception of a cameo appearance
before the ethnic Albanians by two American colonels, the absence
of high-ranking military officers at Rambouillet has been another
contrast to the Dayton talks.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, according to diplomats, was against a NATO presence at
the conference, and, unlike at Dayton, Russia is a pivotal player
at Rambouillet. On Sunday at a Contact Group meeting, Russia said
that, under certain conditions, it would join a NATO-led force in
Kosovo, thus isolating its traditional ally, Milosevic, at a
critical moment.
</P>
<P>
   The more intense quarreling among the sponsors of the talks has
been over which country should do what in Kosovo in the event of a
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and to a lesser extent Britain, according to
diplomats, are arguing that since the Europeans are planning to put
more troops into peacekeeping and more money into the civil
reconstruction of Kosovo than the United States, then European
nations should have the largest say _ and presumably the largest
glory _ in what will become the quasi protectorate of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on phone lines and in meeting rooms at Rambouillet and
elsewhere, the European sponsors have argued that the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which now has 1,300
monitors in Kosovo, should be supplanted by a newly created
organization, similar to the Office of the Higher Representative in
Bosnia. Most importantly, the Europeans argue, a European should
head the new organization. The OSCE mission in Kosovo is led by
William G. Walker, a former American ambassador to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual alliance within the OSCE, a 54-nation
trans-Atlantic organization, the United States and Russia are
trying to fight off the European demands, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   All this diplomatic squabbling has made one point clear: Even
though the settlement of a Balkans war is the centerpiece,
Rambouillet is no Dayton. The most striking reason is that even
though Washington may feel uncomfortable being the junior partner,
the United States has decided to let the Europeans carry their
share of the burden.

EDITORIAL: PURSUING PEACE IN KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 18:
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the deadline for a peace deal on Kosovo,
American, European and Russian diplomats still are pursuing a
commendable plan. It would use NATO forces, including some American
peacekeepers, for the worthy cause of preserving peace. The ethnic
Albanian guerrillas and their political allies largely have
endorsed the plan, which was presented to both sides in the
conflict as essentially non-negotiable. But there are worrisome
signs that the West might make unnecessary concessions to get the
cooperation of the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The peace deal would end the year-old conflict and gradually
pull Serbian security forces out of Kosovo, where they have been
responsible for massacres and widespread atrocities against the
largely ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo would return to the self-government it enjoyed before
Milosevic came to power in 1989. Up to 30,000 NATO troops would
help maintain the peace for three years, after which the
international community could take up the possibility of
independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   What the ethnic Albanians want most is American peacekeepers.
Over the weekend, President Clinton announced that Washington was
willing to send 4,000 troops, a small part of a NATO force that,
unlike the one in Bosnia, would be largely European and under
command of a British general. This is an encouraging development
for a continent that has long depended on Americans to defend its
security interests. It is also an appropriate use of American
troops, as their presence is desired by the inhabitants of Kosovo,
and they will not be there to separate warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan's vagueness could be a problem on some issues.
including the role of the ethnic Albanian guerrilla army and the
extent of self-government. Some Europeans are trying to set up a
new body to direct the civilian side of the mission, wresting it
from the control of William Walker, a skilled and frank American
whom Serbia has sought to expel. Walker should keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   The principal danger, however, is that Western nations will
allow Milosevic to dictate terms. They should not offer to drop
sanctions on Serbia or rein in the Bosnia war crimes tribunal. Such
appeasement will strengthen Milosevic and allow him to crack down
on Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, and tighten his control of
democratic activists within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The West initially said that if Milosevic did not sign the
agreement, NATO would bomb selected Serbian military targets until
he did. That threat must be carried out if needed. Peace in Kosovo
can only work if it is clear that NATO, and not Milosevic, is in
charge.

COLUMNIST BACKS OFF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SOROS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the legendary speculator George Soros speaks, financial
markets move.
</P>
<P>
   When financial markets tumble, politicians and central bankers
look to Soros for advice.
</P>
<P>
   And when the noted economist and columnist Paul Krugman
suggested last week that Soros had taken advantage of his
privileged position and engaged in a bit of insider trading, the
global gossip mill began churning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Krugman now admits, is that his charges are not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I allowed myself to serve as a conduit to the media for this
story, and I shouldn't have done that,'' Krugman said in an
interview Wednesday. ``I'm a believer that these things happen, but
I don't know what actually happened and I shouldn't have conveyed
that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   As Krugman beats a hasty retreat from the allegations he made
last week against Soros in the online magazine Slate, the episode
shows the perils of leveling insider-trading charges against any
financier, especially when it involves one of the most well-known
members of the very clubby, and very cloistered, world of
international finance.
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading is, of course, extremely hard to prove. Soros,
who declined to comment Wednesday, has never been charged with
insider trading during more than three decades plying the world's
financial markets, most notably as a currency trader.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Soros' hedge fund firm, Soros Fund Management,
also declined to comment, other than to point out several
retractions Krugman has posted on his personal Web site and to
share a letter the firm sent to Slate _ which is owned by Microsoft
Corp. _ requesting that those retractions be noted.
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha, which has also erupted in the Brazilian media,
began with Krugman's Feb. 11 Slate column in which the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist wrote that Soros
used information gleaned from a former employee, Arminio Fraga Neto
_ who is also the newly appointed Brazilian central bank president
_ to successfully speculate in Brazilian bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the days preceding the appointment of Arminio Fraga Neto,
a former fund manager for billionaire speculator George Soros, as
president of Brazil's central bank, wild rumors spread through the
markets: Brazil was going to default on its debt, close the banks,
whatever,'' Krugman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that time, it turns out, Fraga was negotiating with the
government, meaning he knew that no such plan was being devised. At
the same time, Soros was buying up large quantities of Brazilian
debt at deep discounts. When the weekend passed the real recovered
sharply, partly because Soros was now able to `squeeze' those who
had sold Brazilian debt short.''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman said in Wednesday's interview that his sources for the
information about Soros' Brazilian trades were ``e-mails from
people in the investment community.'' But Krugman, who also writes
for Fortune magazine, said he made no attempt to independently
verify his sources' contentions, nor did he attempt to seek comment
from Soros or anyone else at Soros' firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, I wish I hadn't done it,'' Krugman said. ``I didn't
think I was breaking a story. It's all been an object lesson in
something or other.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, the editor of Slate, said his magazine planned
to run a letter from Fraga as well as Krugman's retractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied with the result in this case, but we're
satisfied with the processes we have in place here to prevent these
things from happening,'' Kinsley said. ``We're not foolproof but we
have a pretty good record of accuracy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite Krugman's self-described reporting errors, there is
little legal recourse for Soros given his notoriety and protections
the press receives under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soros is a public figure and as a result, if somebody writes
something about him that turns out to be false the writer is
protected so long as he believed in what he said at the time he
wrote the article,'' said Floyd Abrams, a lawyer specializing in
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not entirely clear what Soros' financial position
was in Brazil prior to Fraga's appointment. On Wednesday, the firm
declined to discuss its trading despite repeated requests to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, a former managing director with Soros Funds
Management who co-taught an international finance course with Fraga
at Columbia University, said he was recently assured by several
Soros employees that the firm received no inside information from
Fraga. Johnson said that these employees said that ``they missed
opportunities in Brazil'' to make money.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraga said he did not disclose to anyone at Soros'
firm that he was negotiating with the Brazilian government for the
central bank position until the day he resigned from the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil devalued its currency, the real, on Jan. 13, sending it
into a free fall from which it has yet to recover and raising
concerns about the capabilities of the Brazilian government's
economic team. A week later, on Jan. 20, the New York Federal
Reserve convened a breakfast meeting at its offices at the request
of the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians wanted to speak with a select group of financiers
about the prospects for the Brazilian economy, according to a
Federal Reserve spokesman. Among those invited to the breakfast
were Chase Manhattan's chairman, Walter Shipley; J.P. Morgan's
chairman, Douglas Warner; Citigroup's vice chairman, William
Rhodes; Merrill Lynch's chairman, David Komansky, and nine other
powerful financiers _ as well as Soros.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, on Jan. 27, Fraga, a former Brazilian central
bank official who was managing an emerging markets fund for the
Soros firm, met with Brazilian central bank officials but did not
discuss a job, Fraga said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga, who said he returned to New York the night of Jan. 28,
added that a Brazilian finance ministry official first explored the
possibility of the central bank presidency with him on Saturday,
Jan. 30. He was formally offered the job the next day and accepted.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at Soros' offices on Monday, Feb. 1, Fraga said
he resigned. He said no one at Soros Fund Management knew of the
negotiations before then, including Soros, who was at a financial
conference in Davos, Switzerland. Word of Fraga's appointment was
made public the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should be judged by rumors,'' Fraga said.
``Krugman wrote something based on rumors and his own
imagination.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 18:
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey voters may have felt a bit jealous this week
listening to speculation about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Rudolph Giuliani would give New York the Senate race of the
millennium. But now it appears that New Jersey will have its own
exciting Senate contest in 2000. Sen. Frank Lautenberg has
announced that he will be quitting at the end of the present term,
and each party has several qualified candidates who might want to
succeed him. Mrs. Clinton's name has not surfaced so far, but Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman becomes an instant prospect. Former Gov.
James Florio also has been mentioned, as has Rep. Robert Menendez
of Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg's retirement came as a bit of a surprise. Although he
will be 76 in the year 2000, he had given every indication he
intended to run for a fourth term. Many senators have served the
nation brilliantly at Lautenberg's age. But the real trick for any
senator is maintaining the same level of enthusiasm after a number
of six-year terms in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Like Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Lautenberg has opted
to leave with grace while he is still wanted. He will be remembered
as a strong voice in the Senate for stiffer gun-control laws, a
supporter of environmental legislation and a fighter for the
interests of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman, in comments Wednesday, seemed to be opening the
door to a possible run for Lautenberg's seat. Her hopes of moving
up to the national level have been blocked so far by the Republican
Party's right wing. But New Jersey voters almost elected Mrs.
Whitman to the Senate when she was a relative unknown, chosen to
run as a sacrificial lamb against the popular Sen. Bill Bradley.
She could be a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey has an ample supply of other attractive moderate
Republicans who could also make good nominees. On the Democratic
side, the early money is on Menendez, a Cuban-American who recently
was elected to a top job in the Democratic House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey had some experience with the downside of competitive
politics in the rancorous Senate contest that was won by Robert
Torricelli in 1996. Still, in an era when so many elections seem to
be over before they begin, the prospect of a hard-fought battle
featuring good candidates is welcome, even if none of them are
married to the president of the United States.

KINGS WON''T SELL THE FARM FOR FLEURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Expressing serious concerns with National Hockey
League economics, Kings president Tim Leiweke said this week that
the team will not drain its pool of young talent to acquire a
marquee player, specifically Theo Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean we're out of the star market,'' said Leiweke,
who didn't rule out trying to acquire the Calgary Flames'
30-year-old right wing if an acceptable deal can be struck. ``We're
into the long-term survival of the sport. Everybody better stay
focused on that. If people in the league don't stay focused, the
league as we know it will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   More on this last part later. First though, comes the issue of
the perceived need for a star player, a need seemingly heightened
by the dire state of the Kings' playoff hopes as they enter
tonight's key game at the Forum against the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke would not reveal the names of specific Kings prospects
the Flames are asking for in exchange for Fleury, who is believed
likely to switch uniforms by the March 23 trading deadline as
Calgary seeks compensation for a player who will be the top
unrestricted free agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NHL source, the Flames have asked for junior
defenseman Mathieu Biron and junior right wing Scott Barney, along
with one or more draft choices. Biron was the Kings' first-round
draft choice last year and plays for Shawinigan in the Quebec
league, and Barney was a second-round choice in 1997 who is having
a big year with Peterborough in the Ontario Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke acknowledged that the Flames want prospects, but said
the Kings are concerned with the long-range effects of dealing
talented young players for established stars approaching the latter
stages of their careers. He said it has not been shown that a team
can buy a Stanley Cup, and that when a team chooses to spend money
on established stars rather than developing prospects, it leads to
ticket-price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Leiweke said, ``you have to show,
philosophically, the ability to pick and choose well, develop
players and, in particular, you can't give up your young kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, we've had active conversations with (Calgary).
... What I'm saying is, if the price of a Fleury is ultimately that
you've got to give up two, three, four kids and increase ticket
prices 20 to 25 percent, I don't know if this gives you a team that
can be competitive and I'm not sure there will be anybody in the
stands if you keep increasing ticket prices like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was mentioned to Leiweke that some Kings fans, yearning
for a marquee player, would be unhappy reading comments indicating
the organization might be backing off its star search, he said,
``This is good news for the fans. We will not price fans out of the
building to go try to buy a Stanley Cup. ... There's a feeling in
the organization that we are nervous about the league, the
economics, the salaries. The majority of teams lose money, and
we're losing a lot. We can't keep jumping into the free-agent
market, passing those costs on to the fans. Then, at some point,
you have an average price of $50 or $60.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' average ticket price this season is more than $37,
and the Kings are believed to be on course to lose as much as $20
million this season. A majority of the NHL's 27 teams are believed
to be operating at deficits. The Kings will have a sizable increase
in income when they move into the Staples Center next season, but
NHL television income is minute compared with that of the NBA, NFL
and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' average announced attendance at the 16,005-seat Forum
is a little more than 12,000. When the Flames visited the Forum
last month, an announced crowd of 10,334 turned out to watch
Fleury, leaving one wondering exactly how much marquee power the
gritty 5-foot-6 winger actually would have in Los Angeles. Fleury
may command an annual salary of $8 million when he tests the market
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is fans want to see a bunch of guys go out and give
it 100 percent every night,'' Leiweke said. ``This isn't an
admission that we're going backward. We've picked up some good
talent this year. But each club in the league has to take a look at
where the league is headed. Right now, this business doesn't make
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the Kings' apparent hesitancy to acquire a
marquee player indicated that the team's owners lack commitment to
winning or to remaining involved in the NHL, Leiweke said, ``I
think we're committed. This is a good ownership group. Philip
(Anschutz) is as good an owner as I've seen in 20 years in sports.
He's very committed.''

SENATOR LAUTENBERG CHANGES HIS MIND, WILL NOT RUN FOR 4th TERM IN (fe) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey
Democrat who declared last fall that he would seek a fourth term in
2000, announced on Wednesday that he would not run for re-election
after all.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference here, Lautenberg, 75, said he was stepping
down only because he did not want to spend the next two years
raising money for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg's surprise announcement prompted immediate
speculation in both parties about who might run for the seat, which
he has held since 1982. Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican who
lost a close Senate race to Bill Bradley in 1990, has been
frequently mentioned in recent weeks as a potential Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who are said to be interested in the seat
include Rep. Marge Roukema; James Treffinger, the Essex County
executive; and Richard Zimmer, the former congressman who lost a
Senate campaign to Robert Torricelli in 1996. Among Democrats, Rep.
Robert Menendez and former Gov. James Florio are strong
possibilities, party leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the governor sounded more interested in the
possibility of another run for the Senate than she had in the past.
``I rule nothing out,'' Whitman said at a news conference in
Hamilton Township, where she was helping to dedicate a new train
station. ``It is going to be a personal determination and what I
think will be best for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's current term, her second, expires in 2001 and she is
barred by state law from seeking another consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg said in November that he would seek re-election
because he believed that the Democrats would regain control of the
Senate. If that happened, Lautenberg said, he would have a good
chance of becoming chairman of the powerful Budget Committee, where
he is now the ranking minority member. Lautenberg also said last
fall that he was interested in becoming chairman of the Environment
and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over
transportation programs, an area of interest to him.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his change of heart on Wednesday, he said he had
decided that fund raising would consume to much of his time. ``I
did not want to sit there all those hours of each day asking for
money when in fact there is good solid work to be done,'' he said.
``It would distract me from the job I was sent to Washington to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lautenberg is a multimillionaire who has spent heavily
in past campaigns, he said he did not relish a race that he
estimated would cost at least $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats have privately expressed doubts that Lautenberg
would run again, noting that he had raised barely any money for a
fast-approaching campaign. Lautenberg raised only about $70,000 in
1998 and had just over $500,000 in his campaign war chest,
according to federal records released this month. He said on
Wednesday that he had not worked hard at raising money out of
deference to other New Jersey Democrats whose campaigns were more
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders also say that after 16 years in Washington,
Lautenberg was out of touch with the state party and would have had
a hard time building organizational support. His prickly
personality and a public battle last year with Torricelli, New
Jersey's junior senator, might also have impeded his fund-raising
efforts, they said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who is considered an intelligent and hard-working
legislator, is best known for his work on tobacco control, drunken
driving, the environment and the budget. He pushed through a bill
that banned smoking on domestic airline flights and another that
prohibited ocean dumping of sewage and plastics. He has pressed for
the cleanup of Superfund sites, secured millions of dollars in
federal transportation funds for New Jersey and fought for tougher
laws against drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   But to Lautenberg's constant frustration, he has been
overshadowed by more prominent _ and more telegenic _ senators from
New Jersey: first Bradley, who worked beside Lautenberg for 14
years, and now Torricelli, who has quickly become a vocal
Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of 1998, Lautenberg and Torricelli barely
exchanged a word and publicly complained about each other. They
finally declared a detente last May, at Lautenberg's urging. But
while Lautenberg devoted much of his news conference on Wednesday
to praising fellow Democrats, he did not mention Torricelli. Asked
to characterize their relationship, Lautenberg flatly said, ``It's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lautenberg only briefly mentioned his failure to capture the
spotlight, saying: ``I would like to get more attention for the
things I've done, sure. But people know.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who was in California on Wednesday raising money for
Senate Democrats, said in a telephone interview that Lautenberg had
been especially effective in pushing through legislation and
securing funds that had a direct impact on New Jersey residents.
``I don't think there is a county in New Jersey without a road, a
railroad, a bridge or a mass-transit project where Frank Lautenberg
did not deliver the federal funds,'' Torricelli said. ``He should
be very proud of his public career.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also complimentary, saying in a statement that
Lautenberg ``was an effective advocate for those things that
directly touched people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg was raised in the industrial city of Paterson, where
his father, a Polish immigrant, worked in the silk mills. He
enlisted in the Army after high school and served in the Signal
Corps in Europe during World War II. After the war, he used the GI
Bill to attend Columbia University, graduating in 1949 with a
degree in economics.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Lautenberg helped found a storefront company
in Paterson that provided payroll services to businesses. The
company, Automatic Data Processing, evolved into one of the largest
computing services companies in the world. It built a fortune for
Lautenberg, who used some of his assets and his fierce competitive
streak to fight his way into elected office in 1982, when he
defeated Rep. Millicent Fenwick.
</P>
<P>
   During that House race, Lautenberg questioned the 72-year-old
congresswoman's ``fitness'' and ``her ability to do the job.'' But
in recent years, Lautenberg has dismissed questions about his own
age, bragging that he could ski faster than his four children.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed on Wednesday that age had nothing to do with his
decision to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I don't tire easily,'' he said. ``If I were any
younger, I'd be dangerous.''

PACIFIC THEATERS OFFERS TO BUY MANN CHAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Pacific Theaters disclosed Wednesday it has
offered to buy the Mann Theatres chain, three weeks after Mann went
on the sales block.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would double the number of screens operated by Los
Angeles-based Pacific, which has been one of the most aggressive
builders of state-of-the-art ``megaplexes'' in Southern California.
Pacific would obtain the legendary Chinese Theater in Hollywood and
the landmark Village Theater in Westwood but would also inherit the
problem of invigorating many outdated properties in the 60-theater
Mann chain in California and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific, owned by the Forman family, had no comment beyond
confirming the offer. Industry trackers said the declining value of
older theaters will force Wall Street investment firm Warburg
Pincus, Mann's principal owner, to take a major loss on the $165
million buyout it led in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a buyers' market right now,'' said Kevin Skislock, a
consultant with Laguna Research Partners. ``Warburg should take
whatever's offered because they'll get less tomorrow. Every new
megaplex that goes up knocks down the value of older theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Encino-based Mann and Warburg, which hired investment banker
Bear Stearns to unload Mann, had no comment on the offer. Robert
Laemmle, owner of the Los Angeles-based art-house chain of the same
name, said the deal would represent a strategic departure for
Pacific, which has opened a dozen megaplexes in recent years and
has plans for 11 more in Southern California and Hawaii over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that Pacific is doing this as a defensive
strategy to keep someone else out of the market,'' Laemmle added.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock asserted Pacific will be best served by tearing down
many Mann facilities and building megaplexes. ``The best name on an
older theater cannot go toe to toe with a top-line new theater,''
he added. ``Keeping older theaters is a market-share siren song
because consumers can so easily tell the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Megaplexes, which cost about $1 million per screen to build,
accounted for more than half of the 3,086 new screens built last
year in the United States. Chains such as AMC, Regal, General
Cinema and Carmike led the impressive expansion pace, driven by the
improved financial performance that the new theaters deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say there's no turning back from megaplexing is an
understatement,'' Skislock said. ``This battle is only going to get
more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific opened one of the region's largest theaters, the
6,000-seat Winnetka 20, a year ago and launched the Northridge
Fashion Center All Stadium 10 in December. It recently closed its
five-plex at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, to be replaced by an
18-screen megaplex next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has launched new theaters in Glendale, Thousand Oaks and
Westlake Village in recent years but its first megaplex, the Plant
16 at the former General Motors factory in Van Nuys, has only nine
auditoriums operating more than a month after the first screen
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of publicly held chains have been hammered in recent
months and several other midsize chains have joined Mann on the
sales block. Profits have been squeezed due to poor performance
from older theaters, the expense of megaplexes and tough
comparisons from the year-ago period when ``Titanic'' dominated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, General Cinema parent GC Cos. reported Wednesday a
55 percent decline in profits to $1.4 million, or 18 cents a share,
for its first quarter ended Jan. 31. The conglomerate blamed a huge
decline in domestic theatrical operating profits, which slid to
$400,000 from $7.9 million, and its stock fell 62.50 cents to
$34.375, down 36 percent from its 52-week high.

 &HT;    Court refuses to stop Berry execution
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A federal appeals court Wednesday refused to halt
the execution of Wilford Berry Jr., who is scheduled on Friday to
become the first convict to be put to death in Ohio since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled it
does not have jurisdiction to decide whether head injuries Berry
reportedly sustained in a September 1997 prison riot impaired his
competence to waive his right to legal appeals of his death
sentence in the 1989 murder of a Cleveland baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the issues raised by the new evidence are
appropriate only in the Ohio state courts,'' a three-judge panel
ruled. But the court noted that ``the issue of competency was
decided a substantial time before Berry received his injuries in
the riot at the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Public defenders Wednesday night asked the full, 15-judge
appeals court to reconsider the three-judge panel's decision, state
Public Defender David Bodiker said. He hoped for a decision on that
request today. A majority of the 15 appellate judges must agree
before the court can rehear the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft, who has the power to commute Berry's sentence to
life imprisonment, was briefed on the federal court ruling by his
chief legal counsel, Bill Klatt. Taft made no decision on
commutation Wednesday, but ``the governor is coming to closure on
this,'' said spokesman Scott Milburn.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, however, told Klatt in a 15-minute meeting Wednesday
evening that he is mentally competent and asked that Taft not
commute his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 36, has been dubbed ``The Volunteer'' because he has
waived appeals and says he'd rather die than spend the rest of his
life in prison for the robbery-murder of Charles Mitroff Jr.
Although Berry has a long history of mental illness, he has
repeatedly been found legally competent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the federal appeals court made the correct
decision,'' said deputy Ohio attorney general Mark R. Weaver. ``The
law is very clear on this point: Competent people are allowed to
waive their appeals. Wilford Berry has done that and his execution
should go forward on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who has been held at the Correctional Medical Center
prison hospital outside Columbus since his beating on death row at
Mansfield Correctional Institution, is scheduled to die by lethal
injection at 9 p.m. Friday at the Southern Ohio Correctional
Facility at Lucasville.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio public defender's office filed the federal appeal on
behalf of Berry's mother and sister. If all else fails, public
defender's officials have said they plan to file a last-ditch
request for a stay of execution in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Court, where Berry was sentenced to die. The basis of the request,
they said, would be a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that it is
unconstitutional to execute a person who doesn't understand the
death penalty or why he's being put to death.
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver said ``there's just no evidence that Wilford Berry
doesn't understand these two points.''
</P>
<P>
   He said public defenders would have to show probable cause why a
hearing on such a motion should be held in order to postpone
Friday's execution. ``Under the state statute, a judge could
dismiss their petition just by looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Public defenders can also appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court,
Weaver said, but ``precedent is pretty strong on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rhine McLin, D-Dayton, one of 11 lawmakers who
visited Taft on Tuesday to urge commutation, on Wednesday called
the chances of gubernatorial intervention ``nil.''
</P>
<P>
   McLin, who opposes capital punishment, said Berry's execution is
especially objectionable because of his history of mental problems.
``Do you want your first execution since 1963 to be clouded with
mental health issues?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Berry on Wednesday refused to meet with state Sen.
Robert Hagan of Youngstown, who had asked to visit him, said Linda
Jenks of the prison hospital staff. Hagan, one of the lawmakers who
had met with Taft, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry spent most of the day Tuesday visiting with his mother
and sister. Jenks called the visit uneventful, calm and positive.
Berry was handcuffed and a supervisor was present, but the family
members met in the same room with Berry, she said. Except for a
break for lunch, the visit ran from 9 a.m. to 4:20 p.m. They are
not expected to visit again.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-death penalty activists from the Dayton area plan to travel
to Lucasville on Friday to protest the execution.

 &HT;    Morehouse's McAfee 499 wins strong
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ritual resumes at 7:30 tonight, just before the
opening tipoff, as Arthur McAfee takes his accustomed seat at the
head of the Morehouse bench. Seeing that, Craig Boyd, the Maroon
Tigers' head trainer, will reach over McAfee's shoulder and hand
the old coach a roll of white athletic tape, which doubles as
talisman and stress reducer. Then the man Morehouse men have called
Coach Mac for 34 winters will attempt what he's accomplished 499
times before: to win a college basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Tarkanian has his teething towel, Bob Knight his terrible
temper, Arthur McAfee his tape. When Morehouse hosts LeMoyne-Owen
tonight and McAfee seeks his 500th victory, he'll do so with a
twirl of the tape. Constantly twirling the tape on his left thumb
with the fingers of his right hand, a sight as enduring as the man
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just always had it,'' said McAfee, 70, who began coaching
high school basketball nearly a half-century ago. ``I guess I
started it when I first started coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   That was long ago in Florida, at Jones High in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee is still rolling his tape more than four decades later,
34 years since arriving at Morehouse in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   There were several lean years, hardly surprising at a school
with such stiff entrance requirements, heavy academic regimen and
limited athletic scholarships. But 95 percent of his athletes have
graduated despite the requirements that McAfee hopes never change.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the glory years, 1989-92, when Morehouse went
90-30 and reached the 1990 NCAA Division II Final Four. There have
been many seasons like this one; the 'House is 12-11, 7-8 in SIAC
play.
</P>
<P>
   Yet tonight, McAfee, whose 38-year career record of 499-494
includes a 441-425 mark at Morehouse, will try to become the 23rd
Division II coach in college basketball history to win No. 500.
``It means I've been around a long time,'' McAfee said, laughing.
``I've been lucky enough to be around a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   His son knows better. ``It means quite a bit to him,'' said
Arthur McAfee III, his father's point guard from 1980-83, now a
lawyer and a legal counsel for the NFL Players Association. ``It
puts him in a category with a lot of his friends.'' Friends and
former adversaries like ``Big House'' Gaines, who won 828 games at
Winston-Salem, and John McClendon, the legendary ex-Tennessee State
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty excited about it,'' said Arthur III. ``He's always
tried to downplay these milestones. And I'm really excited for him,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun,'' McAfee said about his life in basketball.
``I've gotten gray and got my brains beaten out. But it's been fun.
I guess that's why I'm still in it. I've been lucky, no health
problems. I've told my wife (Sylvia), `If I ever get up and say I
don't want to go to work, you tell me and I'll get out.' And I
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Wichita, Kan., McAfee graduated from what is
now Emporia State, played AAU basketball, served in the Air Force
and nearly became a dentist before choosing coaching. From Jones
High, McAfee went home to Emporia as an assistant. He got his first
collegiate head-coaching job at Lane College, then he went to
Mississippi Vocational (now Mississippi Valley), Lincoln, Mo., and
Bishop College in Dallas. His 1963 Mississippi Vocational team
qualified for the NAIA national tournament but was barred from
playing because Mississippi state law banned interracial play by
state-supported schools.
</P>
<P>
   When McAfee succeeded Frank Forbes as head coach at Morehouse
for the 1965-66 season, the job was a bit different. McAfee also
scouted for the football team, helped coach baseball, even drove
the tennis team to road trips when Forbes had a conflict. ``They
knew more about tennis than I did,'' McAfee said.
</P>
<P>
   The closest McAfee came to leaving Morehouse was in 1971. There
were other overtures _ North Carolina-Charlotte, Southern Illinois,
Emporia State, other SIAC schools _ but in '71 McAfee agreed to
become the head coach at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing in the upper division (there),'' McAfee said,
referring to Division I. ``The scholarships. Full staff. You can
recruit anywhere.'' Not even an opener against John Wooden's UCLA
defending champions daunted McAfee. But his wife loved Atlanta; so
did their daughters, Gwendolyn and Sylvia. So they stayed at
Morehouse, once McAfee also was named athletics director.
</P>
<P>
   He still employs the Morehouse man-to-man defense. The Maroon
Tigers run what McAfee calls ``A pressure break, not a fast break.
We can break only as fast as you can control the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a terrific run of talent 1989-92, most notably Harold
Ellis, a three-time Division II All-American and the school's
career scoring leader who went on to play for the Los Angeles
Clippers. ``Hopefully, that'll happen again. I probably won't be
here. But hopefully, it'll happen for the next group of coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Grady Brewer, the top assistant, and Roderick
Stubbs, both of whom played for McAfee. McAfee will keep coaching
``as long as I'm feeling good,'' he said. ``But I will not allow
myself to get into a spin I can't get out of and mess up Morehouse
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more years is the maximum, he said. ``I have two people
working for me who deserve a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the third vice president of the National Association of
Basketball Coaches, McAfee will become the NABC president for the
2001-02 season, the first Division II coach in years to hold that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Until retirement, however, McAfee will play man-to-man D, break
when possible and preach his gospel to recruits and players: ``No.
1, I want you to go to school. No. 2, I want you to graduate. In
between, there's me and basketball. I'm going to give you
everything I have. I'm not going to cuss you out. I was never
cussed out. I'm not going to embarrass you; don't you embarass
me.''
</P>
<P>
   So for now, especially for No. 500 tonight, play ball. The right
way. ``I guess I'm an old dinosaur, old-fashioned,'' McAfee said.
``The end result is who puts the ball in the basket more, isn't it?
And we've tried to do that.

OREGON REPORTS 15 LEGAL SUICIDES IN LAW'S FIRST YEAR

report is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers can make

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Oregon officials reported Wednesday that in the first
year of the only legally sanctioned assisted-suicide program in the
world, 15 terminally ill people in the state ended their lives with
lethal medication.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the eight men and seven women who took their
lives was 69, the state said; 13 had cancer and the other two had
heart or lung disease. Fourteen had lived in the state for at least
six months and one came to the state to be with a family member.
Eight other people also received prescriptions for drugs to end
their lives in 1998, but six died from their illnesses before
taking the drugs and two were still alive as of Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Division's official report on the state's Death
with Dignity Act was quickly hailed by advocates of doctor-aided
dying as evidence that the law had not led to abuses, botched
suicides or a widespread rush among the sick or suffering to move
to Oregon for the right to be put to death, as many critics of the
law had contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law has been seldom and carefully used with no failures,
no complications, no misdeeds, no mistakes,'' said George Eighmey,
executive director of Compassion in Dying of Oregon, a nonprofit
group that worked to get the law passed.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that for some physicians the suicide process had
``exacted a large emotional toll,'' but some of the doctors also
spoke up Wednesday in praise of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very positive thing to have people gather around and
say their final goodbyes and reminisce,'' said Dr. Peter Rasmussen,
a cancer specialist in Salem, Ore., who said he has been present
for at least two such occasions, in which terminally ill patients
died after taking chocolate pudding laced with barbiturates. ``One
of the potential advantages is, you can plan it _ people who have
relatives far away can gather everybody together. I've seen it
happen and it was a very positive, joyful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from easing the debate over assisted suicide,
Wednesday's release of the state report seemed only to inflame it.
Archbishop John Vlazny of Portland, the state's leading Catholic
spokesman, said in a statement that the findings were a cause for
``sadness and shame'' across the state. ``In allowing assisted
suicide to continue, the state of Oregon dismisses the value of
human life,'' the archbishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide was briefly legalized in the Northern Territory of
Australia, from July 1996 to March 1997, but today Oregon is the
only place in the world where doctor-assisted suicide is legally
sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, though, it has been practiced for many
years; while it is technically illegal there, it is rarely
prosecuted. And a report in the Journal of Medical Ethics,
coincidentally to be released Thursday, found evidence of a
``slippery slope'' in the Netherlands, with many cases of both
voluntary and involuntary euthanasia by doctors going ``unreported
and unchecked.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, an adult of sound mind who has, in the opinion of two
doctors, less than six months to live may request authorization for
lethal drugs. Doctors may prescribe but not administer the lethal
dose. Those wishing to die fill out and sign a single-page form,
titled ``Request for medication to end my life in a humane and
dignified manner.'' There were 29,000 deaths in Oregon last year,
according to the report, and for the 15 who used the law, the cause
of death was simply listed as ``Drug overdose, legally
prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   The state report, a version of which was also released in the
New England Journal of Medicine, was in part a compendium of
statistics that provided a broad snapshot of the practice of
assisted suicide. The average time to unconsciousness was 5
minutes, with the overall range from 3 to 20 minutes; and the
average time to death was 26 minutes, with the range from 15
minutes to 11 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also suggested there were common elements in the
profiles of those who chose assisted suicide, and one principal
finding was that the primary factor cited by those who opted for
the process was ``the importance of autonomy and personal
control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Physician-assisted suicide was not disproportionately chosen
by terminally ill patients who were poor, uneducated, uninsured,
fearful of the financial consequences of their illnesses, or who
lacked end of life care,'' the report summary said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katrina Hedberg, a medical epidemiologist at the Health
Division and an author of the report, said the state was attempting
to be ``totally neutral'' in its presentation of the report. ``We
were given a mandate to collect this information,'' she said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But, inevitably, release of the findings spurred the question
Wednesday of how or even whether they would change the debate over
assisted suicide in other states and elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the process clearly hoped that their cause would be
aided by the relatively limited numbers of deaths in Oregon and the
reasons cited by those who chose it, such as ``dignity'' and ``some
feeling of control over my body,'' as opposed to the chaos and
forced euthanasia predicted by some critics.
</P>
<P>
   And in the state capitol in Salem, under the auspices of
Compassion in Dying, a Portland area woman who has a terminal brain
tumor spoke out Wednesday in support of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how fantastic a feeling of relief it is to know
that I have this available to me,'' said Barbara Oskamp, who is in
her late 60s and who said she may opt for lethal medication if she
feels she has become an undue burden to her family.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon law was first approved, 51 percent to 49 percent, in
a 1994 vote by state residents, but was promptly put on hold amid
great legal wrangling. Then, in 1997, the state's voters backed the
law again, this time by a decisive margin of 60 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, though, the law was held up: Federal drug-enforcement
officials threatened to impose severe sanctions on any doctor who
aided in suicides. Attorney General Janet Reno effectively removed
that obstacle last year, however, by declaring that doctors would
not be prosecuted if they were obeying state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon report covered all of 1998, the first full year of
the assisted-suicide law. Although it took effect in late October
1997, no deaths were reported in that year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the researchers, no person who chose assisted
suicide expressed a concern about their financial situation to
their doctor, nor was the pain of a prolonged illness cited as a
major fear. Rather, they said, ``Many physicians reported that
their patients had been decisive and independent throughout their
lives or that the decision to request a lethal prescription was
consistent with a longstanding belief about the importance of
controlling the manner in which they died.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Oregon law has yet to create any kind of discernible
groundswell elsewhere. Measures legalizing doctor-assisted suicide
have been blocked or rejected in at least 20 state legislatures.
Ballot initiatives in California and Washington state both failed
in the early 1990s and just this past fall, Michigan voters solidly
turned back an assisted-suicide measure.
</P>
<P>
   That measure may have foundered in part because the nation's
best-known advocate of physician-aided death, Dr. Jack Kevorkian,
who lives in Michigan, opposed the initiative, claiming it imposed
too many restrictions and too much bureaucracy on the process.
</P>
<P>
   One other possible movement toward assisted suicide is occurring
now in Alaska, where two terminally ill patients have mounted a
legal challenge to the state ban on the practice. Advocates are
hoping to expand that challenge into a sort of class-action
lawsuit, in which they would argue that the state constitution's
privacy guarantees include the right to die.

EDITORIAL: A DEAL ON LOCKERBIE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 18:
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after 270 people died in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, reasonable arrangements for
trying the two Libyan intelligence agents accused in the case at
last seem to be falling into place.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan put together by the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, Libya's leader, Col. Muammar Gadhafi, would send the two
suspects to the Netherlands for a trial under Scottish law. If
convicted, the Libyans would serve their sentences in Scotland.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, U.N. economic sanctions against
Libya would be suspended and, in all likelihood, permanently
shelved.
</P>
<P>
   That formula would leave many American grievances against
Gadhafi unresolved. But it would allow justice to be belatedly done
in the Lockerbie case.
</P>
<P>
   First proposed by Libya several years ago, the idea of a trial
in a neutral country under Scottish law was accepted by the United
States and Britain last summer. Gadhafi then raised new questions,
but now appears ready to proceed, persuaded by the personal
diplomacy of Annan, with crucial help from President Nelson Mandela
of South Africa and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. They
persuaded the Libyan leader to accept the idea that the two
suspects, if convicted, would have to serve their sentences in
Scotland, although they could receive regular visits there by
Libyan diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi has not yet severed his ties with terrorism, remains an
outspoken opponent of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors
and is trying to develop biological and chemical weapons. But
agreement to turn over the Lockerbie suspects could be a sign that
he is tiring of his role as an international pariah. If so, he
might be induced to take further steps toward diplomatic
respectability. &QL;

 &HT;    Joneses file for divorce after `going public' fails
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper
Jones already has admitted to fathering an illegitimate child _
putting a major strain on his standing as one of the most popular
Braves players.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jones said the strain was too much for his
marriage. Jones and his wife, Karin, were separated weeks after his
public confession in October and have filed for divorce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so glad for a baseball season to start,''
Jones said at the Braves spring-training facility. ``It's been a
long, hard, lonely offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Karin and Chipper said Wednesday that they did not realize
what was ahead for them when in October he admitted having affairs,
fathering the child out of wedlock and vowing to change his
lifestyle. They separated several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had this thing to do over again, I'd do it a lot
differently,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Going public was a decision
Karin and I made together. It was as much my decision as it was
hers. Obviously, if I had known what was going to happen a month
later, I'd have kept it all private.''
</P>
<P>
   Karin Jones said Wednesday that she thought at the time that
talking about their troubles publicly was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that would bring some honor to a dishonorable
situation,'' she said. ``I didn't know then things would turn out
the way they did. Things didn't turn out the way I had hoped they
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Karin has been living in the couple's home in
Alpharetta. Chipper has moved into an apartment in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply saddened and hurt,'' Karin Jones said. ``I'm just
starting to deal with the disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   That disappointment extended to both families. Chipper's parents
said Wednesday they have known about their son's infidelity for a
year and a half. But they continue to try to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to reconcile it in my mind,'' Larry Jones Sr. said
Wednesday from his home in Pearson, Fla. ``My wife (Lynne) was
saying if I ever did that to her she'd never be able to forget it.
And I said the same thing to her. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(As a family) we went through the yelling and the screaming
and the `You weren't brought up this way,' and the `How can you do
this to our family?' You reach a point where no matter what he
does, he's still my son, and I love him to death. I don't condone
what he did. He's made some changes in his lifestyle. That's
important in this stage of the game. He doesn't make excuses for
what he did. I appreciate that. He knows what he did was wrong, and
he owns up to that fact. He's doing right by his son; I appreciate
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it is in real life. You face the music, take your
beating and move on ... Sometimes (professional athletes) think
they're bulletproof. They aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Jones said that seeing Karin and Chipper separate
``breaks his heart,'' but he added that it might be the best for
both, if they couldn't put their problems behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing for Chipper and Karin both was
making the step to cut the ties or mend them, but being in limbo
was difficult,'' Larry Jones said. ``Four or five months ago, I
remember asking him if everything's going to be all right, and he
said, `I hope so.' Now when I ask him, he says, `I'm doing good.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the start of the baseball season less than six weeks away,
Chipper Jones said he knows he will undergo public scrutiny. But he
said he is confident that his off-field problems won't affect his
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't affect me over the last two years, it's not going
to affect me now,'' Jones said. ``That's another reason I'm
excited. Hopefully, I can get this stuff behind me and go through
the season without any distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   One way Jones has kept his mind off his personal problems during
the offseason is by working out. He has added more than 20 pounds
of muscle. The 6-foot-4 Jones, who weighed 198 at the end of last
season, weighs 220. He expects the added strength to help his power
and stamina late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thrown myself into my workouts to try to take my mind off
things,'' Jones said. ``It's still there, still part of my every
day life, but not having it thrown in my face is sort of a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball might be easier than facing his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's done is done,'' Jones said. ``I've heard a lot of
support from people in the few public appearances I've had since
then. People have come up and expressed how sorry they are and hope
things work out for the both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Chipper and Karin Jones talked publicly about trying
to deal with the several affairs he had after the 1996 World
Series, which the Braves lost to the Yankees in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who apologized to fans, said that in one of the affairs
he fathered a child with a woman who had worked as a waitress at a
Hooters restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla. The child, a son, was
born in March 1998, and Jones said he acknowledged paternity and
was providing support.
</P>
<P>
   After the admission and apology in the fall, Jones, who had more
commercial endorsements than any other Braves, lost some of that
income. Fan reaction was mixed, although most seemed willing to
forgive and forget.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jones said his son is prepared to deal with any kind of
fan reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says `I'm going to have to accept it however it comes,'''
Larry Jones said. ``I said, `You have a tremendous opportunity here
to talk to people about some of the pitfalls that go with fame and
fortune and celebrity and how to deal with it.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: EARLY MORNING FOG 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fog is fin-de-siecle weather, or so it seemed on an
early morning walk across town Wednesday. Perhaps it was the sight
of a working gaslight on 35th Street the night before or the fact
that the Met Life Building had been blotted out by the fog and a
shroud of steam was rising from Grand Central at 7 a.m. Something
had put the end of Whistler's century in my mind, and the thought
was slow to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Davidson's sculpture of Gertrude Stein _ that most un-fin of
authors _ stared out over Bryant Park, past the white tents of this
year's Fashion Week, past the pale London plane trees rising like
models' wrists into the fog. For a moment, even Ms. Stein seemed as
much an esthete, as much a part of a century's last days, as Aubrey
Beardsley himself.
</P>
<P>
   A city is a set for its players, the crowds that throng it every
weekday. When the set is empty, as it tends to be at 7 in the
morning, it is still hard to put the players out of mind. Walking
up a quiet Park Avenue, past a custodian raising the American flag
outside a fog-stunted skyscraper, I found myself imagining the
rails and roadways that fan out from New York like crooked rays
from the sun, each of them at that moment full of inbound commuters
about to repossess the city.
</P>
<P>
   T.S. Eliot's evocation of urban life _ the undone dead peopling
London's wasteland in ``the brown fog of a winter noon'' _ has hung
over this century since 1922. But this fog wasn't brown, and it
wasn't death that had released the people rattling in even now,
only sleep.
</P>
<P>
   I thought there was a 24-hour newsstand on 42nd Street near
Times Square, but when I got there its metal shutter was still
half-drawn. The woman behind the counter remembered that in her
grandfather's day the stand had been open year round, day and
night, but that, she said, was when New York had 11 newspapers. I
lingered for a few minutes, watching the floor being mopped and
papers from all across the country being stacked on the counter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I stepped beneath the shutter again, the fragile
morning quiet had faded. Five minutes, and one city had become
another.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of construction rang off buildings, no longer muffled
by the fog. Near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, people spilled
across intersections, unconstrained by lights or crosswalks. The
end of one century had lifted, and a morning at the end of another
century had begun in earnest.  &QL;

 &HT;    Wohlers upbeat on return
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ As promised, Braves closer Mark Wohlers
spoke about pitching when he arrived in Florida on Wednesday for
the start of spring training. But the comments came in a mix of
seriousness and sarcasm from a pitcher who is trying to find the
strike zone and salvage his career.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he planned to do differently this spring
training, Wohlers said laughing: ``Maybe this year, I'll try to
throw a strike.'' Then he added: ``What I want to do is just get in
the program and go along with everybody else. No special treatment,
no early workouts. People know what I've gone through in the past.
I've been working hard; there's been some upside; there's been some
positive things that have happened (at Camp Leo workouts) in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he had some more humor for the group of reporters around
his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say that (when) you guys are sitting in the
press box I might not launch a ball up there,'' Wohlers said. ``It
might be intentional, it might not, but at least I have an out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pressure, Wohlers said he's approaching this spring
training with the same goals he normally does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I went through a lot of stuff last year, I'm not
going to change my goals,'' said Wohlers, who spent most of the
season in Class AAA Richmond. ``I'd like to peak at the end of
camp, be healthy, have a strong camp, go north with the club and
contribute to try and win a world championship for Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Wohlers is trying to concentrate on the
positive, and he found some of that on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here, that's positive,'' Wohlers said. ``I went through
some (bad things) last year, and I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHART'S ROAD TO RECOVERY
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart is in camp early _ position players aren't
required to report until Monday _ continuing to work his way back
from reconstructive shoulder surgery on his non-throwing arm.
</P>
<P>
   As he approaches the four-month mark since his surgery, Lockhart
said he is ahead of schedule. He was released by doctors Tuesday to
start hitting off a tee and soft toss and expects to see some
machine-pitch work as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other day, I've been swinging off the tee, and it hasn't
been sore,'' Lockhart said. ``It feels great. ... I don't know if
I'll be playing in the first game (of spring training), but as far
as being ready for the season, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS AND THAT
</P>
<P>
   The Braves agreed to terms with second baseman Tony Graffanino,
right-hander Luis Rivera and catcher Fernando Lunar, bringing the
total number of players signed to 31 out of 40 players on the
Braves' major-league roster.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino's chances of making the squad are slim considering
last season's struggle, the addition of Bret Boone and the
anticipated recovery of Lockhart. Graffanino hit .211 with five
home runs and 22 RBIs in 105 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, 20, was 5-5 with a 3.98 ERA in 20 games for Class A
Macon last year to go along with 118 strikeouts in 92 2/3 innings.
Lunar, 21, hit .220 with three home runs and 28 RBIs in 91 games
for the Class A Danville team. ... Pitcher Odaliz Perez of the
Dominican Republic was not at Camp Leo in Atlanta because of visa
problems but is scheduled to arrive on time and be ready when
workouts for pitchers and catchers begin today. ... Catcher Adrian
Manzano, a non-roster invitee, is the only player who has reported
visa delays. He will not arrive from Mexico until Wednesday, the
second day of full-squad workouts.

 &HT;    Falcons release veteran Bennett
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons terminated the contracts of
weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett and center/guard Dave Widell
on Wednesday in a cost-cutting measure that paves the way for
former Georgia Tech standout Keith Brooking to become a starter in
his second season.
</P>
<P>
   The final season of Bennett's four-year, $13.6 million contract
called for a salary of $2.4 million. Widell, who dressed for just
two games last season, was due $500,000, and running back Harold
Green, who was released last Friday, was due $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Counting bonuses the Falcons would have likely owed Bennett and
Green, the combined $3.775 million the team saves leaves Atlanta
roughly $7 million under next season's NFL salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   That's room enough for Atlanta to set its sights higher in a
fast-dwindling free agency market. The team lacks a cornerback and
a strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who played the first nine seasons of his 12-year career
for Buffalo, led Atlanta with 121 total tackles, breaking middle
linebacker Jessie Tuggle's nine-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuggle ($3.85 million) and Bennett ($3.7 million) would have
carried the second- and third-highest salary-cap charges on the
team next season behind quarterback Chris Chandler's $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two linebackers, who will be 34, would have made up 13
percent of the team payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, coach Dan Reeves said Brooking (cap charge: $1.32 million)
needs to play. Brooking had 22 of his 30 total tackles, his
interception, and his sack in the final eight regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a position we can get somebody (else) in there and give
us some cap room,'' Reeves said. ``We've got a No. 1 draft choice
(Brooking) we think can play, and we've got to get him on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornelius proved he can still play well, and this also gives
him a chance to see what his market value is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will carry cap charges next season of $1.25 million
for Bennett, $200,000 for Green and $50,000 for Widell.

MICROSOFT TRIAL EXPLORES AN ODD ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-TRIAL)  
 (rk) 
 By   JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior executive of Microsoft Corp &UR; . &LR;  reported in
federal court Wednesday that America Online had, at least for now,
renewed its contract to equip its users with Microsoft's browser _
even though it is buying Netscape Communications, Microsoft's main
competitor in the browser field.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Brad Chase, quickly added that he believed
America Online would abandon Microsoft soon enough, dealing a
serious blow to Microsoft's effort to make its browser, Internet
Explorer, the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing three days of testimony in the federal antitrust trial
against his company, Chase said he believed that America Online had
chosen to stick with Microsoft for the time being in part for
political reasons _ because the company wanted to influence the
outcome of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they switched to Netscape, our market share would drop to
30 percent,'' Chase said. That would make Internet Explorer,
Microsoft's browser, the underdog and ``would be inconsistent with
AOL's desire to support the government in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online signed an agreement with Microsoft in 1996 to use
Internet Explorer as the default browser for its subscribers. Since
they now number more than 16 million, about 40 percent of those
equipped with Internet Explorer are using it in conjunction with
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for the agreement is a subject of hot dispute at
the trial. The government and a senior America Online executive who
testified as a government witness say the company chose Microsoft,
and agreed to limit its members' use of Netscape, because Microsoft
dangled irresistible bait: promotion of America Online's service on
every personal computer running the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued again Wednesday that America Online actually
chose Internet Explorer over Netscape because it was a better
product.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft-America Online contract expired Jan. 1. But even
with the renewal, Chase testified, he believed an eventual switch
of browsers was ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   In Security and Exchange Commission documents that Microsoft
submitted as evidence, America Online declared it would create a
new browser, in cooperation with Sun Microsystems, to compete with
Microsoft _ and to use with the America Online service.
</P>
<P>
   Chase ended his testimony at midday, and John T. Rose, a senior
vice president for Compaq Computer, &UR;  &LR; took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the lead government attorney, first used Rose to
bolster the government's assertion that Microsoft is a legal
monopoly under antitrust law _ a finding that must be made if most
of the government's other charges are to stick.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning from Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson helped Boies. The
judge asked Rose, ``Is it fair to say there is no commercially
viable alternative to the Windows operating system?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is correct, your honor,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Boies asked him whether it was true that Compaq had not even
considered looking for another operating system to replace Windows
after Microsoft imposed a steep price increase for Windows last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is correct,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to raise prices with impunity is a hallmark of a
monopolist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then Boies began a challenge of the central tenet of Rose's
testimony, which will continue on Thursday. In his written, direct
testimony, Rose took issue with the government's accusation that
Microsoft threatened in 1996 to cancel Compaq's license to sell
Windows with its computers when Compaq began loading Netscape on
its machines.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the real problem was that Compaq had separately signed
a contract with America Online at about the same time, requiring
Compaq to replace the Internet Explorer and Microsoft Network icons
in Windows with an America Online icon.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose said the people who signed that contract did not
realize that Compaq had agreed in a telephone call with Microsoft
executives a few days earlier not to tamper with those icons.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said that ``there was simply a communication breakdown'' at
Compaq, and some of the documents Microsoft submitted with his
testimony support his story indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies showed that some people involved in the first
agreement, with Microsoft, were also involved in the second one,
with America Online, and he said that it was odd that they did not
know of this conflict.  &QL;

IBM TO OFFER LINUX WITH NETFINITY COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mass.)  (nk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In perhaps the most significant endorsement yet of
the little operating system that could, IBM Corp. will announce
Wednesday that beginning next month it will ship its Netfinity line
of network server computers with the free operating system Linux
pre-installed alongside Microsoft's Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is a highly regarded flavor of Unix, a kind of operating
system widely used in powerful business machines that serve as the
hub of local computer networks and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its power and stability, Linux has not gained wide
acceptance because corporations have had nowhere to turn for
support; it was designed and built by a loose international
coalition of programmers who freely share its source code and
collaborate on its development. Thus, there is no company that can
be held responsible for the product.
</P>
<P>
   IBM will address that drawback by offering customers technical
support for the software through an agreement with a Linux
distributor, Red Hat Software.
</P>
<P>
   The move by IBM comes on the heels of decisions by several other
computer manufacturers _ most notably Hewlett-Packard and Dell
Computer _ to sell machines that run Linux, making it a viable
competitor to other flavors of Unix and, most notably, to Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
   Although some system administrators and programmers within
companies have embraced Linux because of its flexibility and
propensity not to crash, the operating system has rarely been
officially sanctioned by management because of its orphan status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This increases the credibility of Linux in organizations,''
said Stacey Quandt, an analyst with Giga Information Group in
Cambridge, Mass. ``A lot of companies are running Linux on some
server in a closet somewhere, but when IBM comes out and says
they're supporting it, it creates a lot more credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM said customer demand had been growing for Linux,
particularly among Internet service providers and companies that
want to take advantage of its open source code to modify their
systems for their own needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to early PC days, what you typically saw was
technically literate folks using PC's at home and moving them into
businesses where it wasn't a top-down decision,'' said Phil Hester,
chief technology officer of IBM's personal systems group. ``This
has a lot of that same feel to it. We think we need to understand
this marketplace and grow with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hester's division, which is based in Raleigh, N.C., just five
miles from Red Hat's headquarters, has set up a laboratory to test
Linux on the Netfinity servers, as well as on work stations and its
Thinkpad line of laptops. In addition to Linux and Windows NT, the
Netfinity servers will continue to be shipped with IBM's OS/2
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The deal positions Red Hat, which also supplies Linux to
Hewlett-Packard, as the leading commercial distributor of the
operating system, although IBM left open the possibility that it
would also contract with one of Red Hat's competitors, like Caldera
Inc. or SuSe.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which can be had free on the Internet, has spawned a
cottage industry of distributors that combine its various pieces on
a CD-ROM with basic technical information.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat, a five-year-old start-up that last year received an
equity investment from the Intel Corp., aims to make money by
selling technical assistance to Linux's growing customer base.
Under the agreement with IBM, customers will have the option of
buying Red Hat support directly or through IBM. The company's
existing support contracts range from $1,000 a year for a single
user to $60,000 a year for enterprises, depending on the number of
computers linked to the server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft uses a different approach, pricing its support for the
Windows NT Server by ``incident,'' meaning that when a customer has
a problem, he gets Microsoft's help for a specified amount of
money. Typically, this is about $195, with a volume discount for
companies that prepay for 10 incidents. Windows NT itself range in
price from about $250 for a single computer to about $55 per
computer when licensed for 25 or more computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's endorsement of Red Hat meant Linux was OK to use,''
said Robert C. Young, Red Hat's chief executive. But anyone who
bought it still took on the liability for buying hardware not
supported for Linux. Now IBM is stepping up and taking
responsibility for the hardware component.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts caution that the bigger hurdle for Linux is a
lack of software that runs on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applications drive operating system sales,'' said Bill
Petersen, research director for IDC Research. ``The fact that Linux
is available on hardware gives chief information officers the
ability to say, `Great, I can get Linux,' but their next question
is, `What can I run on it?' The story only begins to get
interesting when more organizations begin to make their
applications available for it.''

   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. _ The Pentagon announced Wednesday
night that it was sending 51 additional aircraft, including 12
F-117 stealth fighter jets, to bases in Europe, as part of an
effort to pressure President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace
agreement that would include a NATO-led ground force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment brings to 260 the total U.S. aircraft overseas
available for use in NATO strikes on Serbian military targets
should Milosevic not accede to demands for a settlement with the
ethnic Albanians who are the majority in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has authorized the strikes in Kosovo and in other parts of
Serbia in the event that Milosevic does not agree to a settlement
that includes a NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced on Saturday that he would commit
nearly 4,000 American troops to the ground force should the two
sides reach a deal. The deadline for an agreement is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 430 NATO aircraft that would take part in any NATO
strike have been placed on 48-hour attack alert. In an interview
Wednesday, Samuel Berger, the national security adviser, reiterated
a warning that the United States and its NATO allies were prepared
to strike if the Serbs did not accept the agreement being
negotiated over the last 10 days in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't comply and if he doesn't sign a political
settlement, then he will be facing a military confrontation with
NATO,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the F-117s, 10EA-6B radar jamming jets and 29
aerial refuelers, the United States has also pledged to use B-52
bombers in a military strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been made with respect to the use of force,''
the Pentagon's statement said. ``This deployment is a precautionary
measure to assure that NATO has the capability to conduct
operations should that prove necessary.''

 Home Smart Home  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
If you think it's tough sharing the remote control, imagine trying
to share a computer, modem, scanner and printer with others in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cummins and his wife each have a PC at home. His has a
color printer and more memory, so they both store files on it. Hers
has a scanner and black-and-white laser printer attached.
</P>
<P>
   The couple found it a hassle when Cummins had to stop working on
his PC so his wife could access it for files or print something
from the color printer. And Cummins often had to interrupt his
wife's work to use the scanner or laser printer.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cincinnati couple decided to create a home network _
hardware and software that lets computers talk to each other _ so
they could share files and peripherals like printers, CD-ROM drives
and scanners.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the first users of Symphony Cordless Networking
Suite, a product developed by Proxim Inc., a Mountain View company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made things so much easier. We no longer have to
interrupt each other or unhook and reconnect things to various
computers,'' Cummins said.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley companies like 3Com Corp., Cisco Systems Inc.,
ShareWave and others are anticipating that as more homes add a
second or third PC, consumers will want a way to link them.
</P>
<P>
   Their quest is buoyed by the growth in the number of homes with
multiple PCs. Between 15 million and 20 million homes already have
more than one computer, according &LR;   &LR; to Dataquest, and that number
is expected to rise as the cost of PCs continues to fall.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, 1.9 million U.S. homes will have a home
network, according to International Data Corp. During the next few
years, IDC says, that number is expected to soar to 12 million or
almost 12 percent of all U.S. homes. Industry watchers anticipate
sales of home networking equipment will reach about $200 million
this year and $1 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a home network varies, but consumers should expect
to spend between $100 to $300 per computer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Companies Show Interest
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers have gotten the attention of almost every
networking firm. Just last month, 3Com announced that it formed a
division devoted to home networking. And several startup companies
have staked their fortune on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing of resources is the key word,'' said Greg Naderi,
information technology market analyst for Frost and Sullivan in
Mountain View. ``The ability to share a printer, a fax, a scanner
or any other type of peripheral device is cost-saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Home networking can also do more  &LR; sexier things _ like letting
computer users play games against one another on different
computers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the near future, home networks will be able to control
security systems, lights, entertainment systems and even microwave
ovens.
</P>
<P>
   But the main driver for home networking, industry watchers say,
is Internet access. As high-speed Internet services, such as cable
modems and digital subscriber lines, catch on, consumers will look
to home networking as a way to share those costly devices and
services among various PCs. Linking computers gives users the
ability to surf the Web at high speeds from any PC in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As cable modems and DSL become more widespread, that's going
to drive demand,'' said Roy Johnson, who heads 3Com's home
networking division. ``What makes sense is sharing that pipe. Not
many people are going to buy multiple cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of home networking is not new. Multibillionaire Bill
Gates and athlete Barry Bonds each networked his home, and several
developers have been building houses wired for home networks. But
the costs have been prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for
average folks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; New Affordable Systems
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, consumers who wanted to link their PCs needed to
drill holes and lay cable to make a connection. Today, companies
are either selling or getting ready to roll out home networking
kits that the average person can install and afford.
</P>
<P>
   The products work in three ways _ through existing phone lines,
over power lines or wirelessly via radio waves from an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless products work by attaching tiny antennas to every
computer a customer wants to include in the network. Using special
software installed on a PC, families can share a modem to surf the
Web from any PC in the house. With the use of set-top boxes, they
can also download video or music clips from the Internet to the TV
or the stereo. The speeds vary depending on the product and the
modem being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless is easy to use and install and it eliminates the
problem of not having a phone jack in the room where you want to
surf the Web,'' said Bob Bennett, a co-founder of ShareWave, an El
Dorado Hills (El Dorado County) company that's developing wireless
home networking products.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's company is selling its technology to manufacturers
like Phillips Electronics, and products should be available in the
second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Sunnyvale's Epigram and Tut Systems of
Pleasant Hill, use existing phone lines to create home networks.
</P>
<P>
   With Epigram, customers buy a networking card at a retail store,
snap it into a slot on the computer and connect a traditional phone
wire between the computer and existing wall jack. The product is
about 200 times faster than a 56K modem. Tut's ``HomeRun`'
technology allows data to travel across phone wires at speeds up to
1 megabit per second, roughly 40 times faster than a standard
modem.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which are expected to retail for $100 to $200 per
computer, don't affect ordinary phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the home networking products being developed will hit
the shelves within the next year. Some companies, such as Proxim
and Sunnyvale's ActionTec, are already selling wireless networking
kits in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Are Networks Mainstream?
</P>
<P>
   While company officials predict the home networking market will
soon explode, some industry watchers are skeptical. The benefits of
home networking are clear for people like Cummins, whose wife runs
two businesses out of their home. But whether home networking has
broad market appeal remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mainstream product,'' said Paul Johnson, an
industry analyst with BancAmerica Robertson Stephens in New York.
``A lot of money is being thrown here, but not that many homes are
ready for a home network.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who installed his own home network, said while the
products are easier to set up than in the past, they still require
a good deal of time. And once up and running, they are often clunky
and unreliable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to put one of these things in place,'' Johnson
said. ``Early adopters may put this in, but until these things get
easier to set up at home and people see a need for it, the market
won't take off.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the industry argue that the popularity of the
Internet will drive home networking into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the Internet out there I would be much more
pessimistic about what this market could be,'' said Jeffrey
Thermond, president of Epigram and a founder of the Home Phone
Networking Alliance, a trade group. ``But there's a lot of
bandwidth in the home for people to share. It's hard for me to
imagine that a home that has the discretionary income to pay $50 a
month for cable (Internet access) has less than two PCs. They are
going to want to share that pipe through a home network.''

 Large S.F. Ad Agency Sells Majority Stake  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bowing to changes in the advertising industry, San Francisco's
largest independent ad agency, Citron Haligman Bedecarre, has sold
a majority stake to the New York ad conglomerate Euro RSCG
Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bedecarre, chairman of the agency now known as Citron
Haligman Bedecarre Euro RSCG, said yesterday a combination was
``inevitable'' given increasing demand by clients for agencies that
can handle Internet advertising, direct marketing and global
business, in addition to the consumer ads Citron Haligman is known
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five or six years we were in business, this was not
a question that ever came up,'' said Bedecarre. ``The last 12
months, it has been a relentless drum beat'' from both prospective
and existing clients.
</P>
<P>
   As CHBER, the agency can tap into Euro RSCG's network of 140
advertising and marketing companies in 65 countries. It expects to
work closely with the San Francisco offices of Cohn &AMP; Wells Group,
a direct marketer, and the interactive agency Euro RSCG DSW
Partners, both owned by Euro RSCG.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing explosive growth in the mid-1990s, Citron
Haligman's billings plateaued at about $100 million in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a huge opportunity for us to grow,'' said
Kirk Citron, the agency's president. ``We're involved in five new
account pitches now and there isn't one of them that this isn't
relevant to.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Bob Schmetterer, Euro RSCG
Worldwide's chairman and chief executive, said CHBER's three
principals would retain equity stakes in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Citron Haligman has been in discussions with several other
agencies in the last year or so, including the Martin Agency, based
in Richmond, Va. and Ammirati Puris Lintas of New York, according
to a source who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was founded in 1990 by Bedecarre, Citron, Matt
Haligman and Jeff Atlas, four executives who had worked together at
Hal Riney &AMP; Partners. Atlas left in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Riney was the largest independent agency in San Francisco
until May, when it was acquired by Publicis S.A. of Paris. It is
now called Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney.
</P>
<P>
   Like Citron Haligman, Riney officials said they had been losing
business by not being able to offer a broader array of services.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CITRON18 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``There was no way not to do this (be acquired by a larger
company) and still succeed and grow in this market,'' said
Bedecarre. Euro RSCG was an attractive partner because it affords
its agencies a large degree of independence, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Euro RSCG, the seventh-largest ad network in the world, is owned
by Havas Advertising, a public company based in Paris. It's clients
include Intel and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Clients of CHBER, the ninth-largest agency in San Francisco,
include Good Guys, HomeShark, Ore-Ida and Sony Computers. Its 1998
revenues tallied about $13.5 million and it employs 65 people.

 AOL to Offer Cheap Long-Distance Calls  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz and Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The giant of the Internet may be getting bigger. In a pair of moves
to extend its services, America Online will soon offer
long-distance phone calls over the Internet and also may get into
the Web auction business.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest online service said yesterday it will
incorporate sound into its popular ICQ instant-messaging system
next week. This will allow it to offer telephonelike service over
the Internet for a fraction of regular long-distance rates. At the
same time, AOL reportedly is in discussions with eBay about buying
a minority stake in the popular San Jose online auction company.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves could significantly increase the company's revenue
streams and customer base. It now reaches 16 million computer
users. AOL is in the midst of a fierce battle with other Internet
and media companies to gain the widest membership possible.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials are particularly interested in jointly developing
online content and services with eBay, according to a report in
yesterday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   AOL refused to comment on the report. ``We've been rumored to be
buying companies I've never even heard of,'' AOL CEO Steve Case
said in an interview yesterday, following a speech at San
Francisco's Commonwealth Club. ``This climate (of acquisitions in
the Internet market) is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, eBay agreed to pay AOL at least $12 million over
three years to advertise on AOL. Case has repeatedly called eBay
one of the Web businesses he most admires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at eBay called the rumored alliance ``pure
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although AOL is the better-known company and commands more than
half of the domestic Web audience, there's plenty to attract the
Virginia giant to eBay, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's most popular online auction site has 2.1 million users
buying everything from autographed baseballs to Beanie Babies. It's
one of the ``stickiest'' sites on the Internet, capturing an
average user's attention for 27 minutes per visit _ an important
selling point to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One thing eBay isn't, however, is cheap. Its stock price has
soared nearly tenfold since it went public in September. Yesterday,
after initially jumping on news of the possible AOL alliance, eBay
fell $4.50 to close at $233 per share. That gives eBay a market
capitalization of nearly $9.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors evidently think an AOL investment in eBay would be too
costly. Its shares slid $6.50, to $153.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said eBay could provide a tremendous new source of
revenue for AOL. EBay ``is basically turning Beanie Babies into
bucks. People are buying and selling, and they (AOL) are going to
get a piece of that action,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst with Paul
Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   While AOL officials were mum on eBay rumors, they acknowledged
that they have melded voice technology into their ICQ
instant-messaging service, creating a cyber equivalent to the phone
system.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephony _ voice conversations relayed between two PCs
over the Internet _ is still in its infancy. It can suffer from
quality and reliability problems, and can be cumbersome to set up.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the Paul Kagan analyst, said the addition of voice to ICQ
could be a boon for Internet telephony, which currently has an
estimated 10 million active users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make the whole notion of Internet telephony more
legitimate,'' he said. ``For the most part, nothing on the Internet
becomes consumer-friendly until AOL does it.''
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (Internetese for ``I Seek You'') boasts 28 million
registered users and is adding an average of 90,000 customers a
day. The wildly popular real-time chat technology allows users to
exchange private pop-up messages that are instantly relayed over
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   AOL acquired Mirabilis, the Israeli company that created ICQ,
for $287 million last June.

FBI MAKES INQUIRIES ABOUT LAWYERS' CONTRACTS IN TOBACCO LAWSUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The FBI is asking questions about former
Attorney General Dan Morales' contacts with two Houston attorneys
in connection with the state's successful lawsuit against tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One is Joe Jamail, a famous litigator who claimed Morales
improperly solicited millions of dollars from him and other lawyers
in seeking help in the lawsuit. The other is Marc Murr, a friend of
Morales' and little-known plaintiffs' attorney whose critics claim
he did little to earn the huge fees he is seeking in the tobacco
case.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has claimed he was actively involved in an advisory role to
Morales even before the state's lawsuit was filed and that he
contributed up to 2,000 hours to the anti-tobacco effort.
</P>
<P>
   But phone records and sign-in sheets indicate Murr infrequently
visited the attorney general's office during the lawsuit and was
only occasionally called &UR;  &LR; by Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn also began investigating Murr after
succeeding Morales in January.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn spokeswoman Heather Brown confirmed Wednesday that
Cornyn's office has been contacted by the FBI about Murr.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment further on federal inquiries, but one
informed source said that the FBI also was looking into the
allegations Jamail initially raised last year.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman in San Antonio refused to comment. Morales and
Murr didn't return phone calls, but Morales has consistently denied
Jamail's claims.
</P>
<P>
   In a document filed in federal court by several state
legislators last spring, Jamail said Morales solicited $1 million
from each of several lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The money was ``purportedly for the purpose of defending General
Morales against possible attacks from the tobacco companies,'' the
document said. It didn't specify what types of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jamail, best-known for winning a $10.5 billion verdict for
Pennzoil in 1987, wasn't hired for the lawsuit, which was filed in
March 1996. The tobacco case was settled for $17.3 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators who made Jamail's allegations public were
fighting legal fees sought by five outside lawyers hired by
Morales. A national arbitration panel eventually awarded those
lawyers $3.3 billion, which cigarette makers have agreed to pay
over as many as 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jamail, who also was unavailable for comment Wednesday, has
refused to elaborate on his allegations in interviews. But he has
said he would be willing to provide more details under oath in a
courtroom or other legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   When Jamail's charges first surfaced, a spokesman for Morales
said the only money that the attorney general asked the private
lawyers to provide was for lawsuit expenses. Each of the five
lawyers agreed to risk $2 million of his own money in return for a
share of a 15 percent contingency agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the lawyers _ Walter Umphrey and Wayne Reaud of
Beaumont, John O'Quinn and John Eddie Williams of Houston and
Harold Nix of Daingerfield _ also denied Jamail's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Murr's involvement in the tobacco case was not widely known
until after the settlement was announced in January 1998, and he
began fighting for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   He was not part of the Umphrey team, and the other private
lawyers have refused to share their fees with him.
</P>
<P>
   Murr met Morales in the early 1980s when both men were young
attorneys at Houston's Bracewell &AMP; Patterson law firm. Murr
eventually left the firm to launch his solo practice, and he was
one of the attorneys who negotiated a settlement in the 1989
Phillips Petroleum explosion in Pasadena, Texas. He also
represented Morales in a 1990 libel lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Murr attended some of the negotiating sessions that produced the
tobacco settlement. However, according to other lawyers, he didn't
make any courtroom appearances during months of pretrial
preparations in 1996 and 1997. His name didn't appear on any of the
hundreds of court documents filed during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has called Murr's assistance ``critical'' to Texas'
success in the case and said he did his work behind the scenes as a
key adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo prepared for the national arbitration panel on legal
fees, Murr's lawyer, Roy Minton of Austin, said Murr was Morales'
``co-pilot'' in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the three national arbitrators, handpicked by the Umphrey
team and the tobacco industry, rejected Murr's claim for a 3
percent contingency fee _ or more than half a billion dollars _ and
awarded him $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   A separate state arbitration panel of three retired judges
picked by Morales and Murr has awarded Murr $260 million. That
figure would amount to a fee of $130,000 an hour, if Murr worked
the 2,000 hours that he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   But cigarette makers are obligated to pay only the $1 million
set by the national panel.
</P>
<P>
   Murr could ask a federal judge to order the state to pay the
difference _ an action that would be fought by Cornyn, Gov. George
W. Bush and several state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   According to sign-in logs at the attorney general's building,
Murr visited Morales' office only nine times from late March 1996,
the month the tobacco lawsuit was filed, through the end of 1997,
when settlement negotiations had begun.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the month the settlement was announced, he
signed into the building on seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to the logs, Murr visited the attorney general's
office on 16 days from February through November 1998, while the
lawyers' legal fees and a share of settlement proceeds for county
hospital districts were being debated. Sometimes, Murr was
accompanied by Minton, who represented his interests in the fight
for fees.
</P>
<P>
   Minton has said Murr played a key role in resolving the hospital
district dispute, which was settled in July, but other lawyers
dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone records obtained from the Cornyn administration show
that a single one-minute call was placed to Murr from the attorney
general's administrative offices in January 1996, as, presumably,
the finishing touches were being put on the tobacco lawsuit two
months before filing.
</P>
<P>
   No calls were recorded in February 1996, and four calls totaling
fewer than five minutes were placed to Murr in March 1996, the
month the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The office records cover only outgoing long-distance calls
within Texas; they don't reflect how many times Murr may have
called Morales or someone else at the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has a phone at an office in Austin, which he periodically
visits. That phone, if it were used, also isn't covered in the
phone records.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 long distance calls were placed to Murr from the
attorney general's office during the remainder of 1996, the records
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Murr from January through November of 1997 averaged
about three a month, most of short duration. During that time,
lawyers for the state and the tobacco industry were facing off in
numerous pretrial hearings in Beaumont and Texarkana and flooding
the federal court with documents.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Morales or an aide placed three calls to Murr
totaling about three minutes. That same month, the attorney
general's office placed 15 calls, totaling 101 minutes, to Houston
attorney Grant Kaiser, a liaison for the Umphrey team of outside
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Murr got one, two-minute call from the attorney
general. Kaiser got 19 calls, totaling 108 minutes. Murr got one
call, of less than a minute's duration, in April 1997, while Kaiser
got 16, totaling 83 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Murr started getting more calls from Morales' office in December
1997, when settlement negotiations were under way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nine calls that month totaled 53 minutes. The records on nine
other calls were unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   Morales or someone in his office called Murr 36 times, totaling
107 minutes, in January 1998, the month the settlement was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Murr got 13 calls, totaling 199 minutes, from the attorney
general's office in October 1998, the month the state arbitrators
picked by Murr and Morales awarded the Houston lawyer $260 million.

 Intel Puts Pentium III On Display  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Intel Corp. yesterday offered a dose of high-tech hype as an
antidote to privacy advocates' threatened boycott of its new
Pentium III chip.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III, which will start appearing in new PCs at the
end of this month, was the star of a ``preview day'' at the San
Jose Convention Center yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 companies ranging from geeky software and hardware
developers to real-world retailers such as the Sharper Image showed
off different ways they plan to use the new chip's 3-D
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   These companies also shrugged off the privacy furor that has
dogged Intel since its disclosure last month that the chips would
carry an identifying number. The purpose of the number is to
increase security so that a Web site knows what computer it's
dealing with, but privacy advocates fear companies could use it to
track Web users' activities online.
</P>
<P>
   Intel will spend more than $300 million to promote the chip,
from television ads to flying banners over Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Pentium III represents a great leap forward in using 3-D
technology. Intel demonstrated some examples, including a search on
the Excite Internet directory that served up results looking like
satellites orbiting small planets.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's largest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale,
has already been shipping chips with its 3DNow technology, which
offers similar 3-D performance. But while AMD said its chips would
run the same programs as the new Intel chips, Intel said many
software developers will create programs specifically for the
Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III will be fast, too. Intel surprised analysts by
saying a 550-MHz chip will ship by July _ a faster chip coming out
sooner than expected. The chip will be 50 percent faster than the
speediest 400-MHz Pentium II chip now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Nathan Brookwood, who runs the consulting firm Insight
64 in Saratoga, pronounced the new features ``marvelous,'' but said
AMD may be able to undercut Intel's prices with similar chips.
</P>
<P>
   Intel wouldn't reveal prices, except to say that desktop PCs
with Pentium IIIs would sell for below $2,000 _ a price targeted at
high-end users. AMD made tremendous inroads against Intel in the
past year in equipping PCs that sell for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the Intel hoopla, analyst Jonathan Joseph of
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities sees the Pentium III as just an
incremental improvement. ``It's not a huge event,'' he said. ``For
the average guy, it means a slight leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the identification number is one the chip's main
advances. Although no one picketed yesterday's event, there were a
few flyers outside, mocking Intel's branding for the Pentium III.
Instead of Intel's Pentium III logo _ a door marked ``This Way In''
_ the flyers showed a door marked ``No Way Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives defended the serial number as boosting security
for electronic commerce and said users can turn off the number to
protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates see that option as hollow, since Web sites and
software programs could require users to release the number in
exchange for access.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel said the serial number will ultimately prove popular.
People ``will have to decide what's more important,'' said Intel
Vice President Mike Aymar. ``It's similar to ordering something
over the phone with a credit card,'' he said, noting those
transactions are not necessarily secure, but that people have grown
comfortable with them.

 Transamerica Trading Fuels Takeover Talk  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Heavy activity yesterday in the stock and options of Transamerica
Corp. revived rumors that the San Francisco financial-services
company could be on the verge of a merger or takeover.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the stock market in general declined steeply,
Transamerica shot up $1.81 to $57.63 on the New York Stock
Exchange, reaching its highest level in more than a month. At one
point yesterday, the stock sold as high as $59.88
</P>
<P>
   Transamerica officials did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been saying for more than a year that Transamerica
eventually might merge with another company.
</P>
<P>
   There have been massive consolidations lately in the
financial-services industry _ most notably between Travelers and
Citicorp, forming Citigroup _ and Transamerica, with about $6
billion in annual revenues, generally is considered too small to
stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a time of consolidation,'' Colin Devine, an analyst
with Salomon Smith Barney, told Reuters. ``It's fair to say that
when you look at potential consolidation candidates, Transamerica
is among the top on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a million Transamerica shares changed hands yesterday,
the first time that has happened in more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   On the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, where Transamerica options
are traded, activity was extraordinarily heavy in the company's
call options, each of which gives buyers the right to buy 100
shares of the company's stock at a fixed price before a fixed date.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,374 February call options _ allowing purchasers the
right to buy the stock through Friday's session _ changed hands
yesterday. In addition, investors bought 444 March call options _
allowing investors to buy the stock through March 19.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the total volume for Transamerica's February put
options _ giving investors the right to sell the stock _ amounted
to just 20 contracts yesterday. Sales of March put options totaled
16 contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Options traders said the prices of Transamerica call options
sold yesterday were substantially higher than normal, based on
standard valuation measures.
</P>
<P>
   The March options were trading at levels suggesting that the
buyers think there's a strong chance that the stock will move up as
much as 60 percent in the coming year.

GERALD DICKLER, LAWYER WHO AIDED ARTISTS, DIES AT 86  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., N.C., Mass. )  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gerald Dickler, a New York lawyer who represented
artists, writers and broadcasters, including some of those
blacklisted in the McCarthy era, died last Saturday at Mount Sinai
Medical Center. He was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Dickler was chairman of the Pollock-Krasner
Foundation, which he helped to establish in 1985 under the will of
Lee Krasner, the Abstract Expressionist painter and widow of
Jackson Pollock. Dickler was the lawyer for Lee Krasner's estate.
The foundation gives individual grants to ``talented visual artists
in need of funds'' in the United States and abroad. Its most recent
report said it had assets of almost $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his volunteer work, Dickler was a successful lawyer with
lucrative links to the broadcast industry. He was a founder and
corporate secretary of Capital Cities Broadcasting in the
mid-1950s. In 1959, he joined what is now the firm of Hall,
Dickler, Kent, Friedman &AMP; Wood, from which he retired as a senior,
founding partner in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan to immigrants from Russia and Romania
and graduated from George Washington High School in 1928. After
completing Columbia College in 1931, he got his law degree from
Columbia Law School at 20 in 1933 and went to work for the law firm
of Sam Rosenman, a member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal brain
trust, his policy-making advisers. Two years later, he went into
practice on his own.
</P>
<P>
   One day he received a call from Rolf Kaltenborn, son of the news
broadcaster and commentator H.V. Kaltenborn, requesting his legal
help _ without pay _ to organize the first radio workers' union, a
forerunner of Aftra, the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Dickler's work for the union shaped his career. H.V. Kaltenborn,
impressed by the work of the 23-year-old lawyer, recommended him to
others in the business, and Dickler went to work with the writer
and broadcaster Lowell Thomas and Mike Todd, the movie director, in
promoting Cinerama, the wide-screen movie format.
</P>
<P>
   After Cinerama was sold in the mid-1950s, Dickler and others
joined to buy a small radio station in Albany and a television
outlet in Durham, N.C. They formed the cornerstones of Capital
Cities Communications, which grew into a major media force with
stakes in radio, television and publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the company took over ABC and became Capital Cities/ABC
Inc., of which Dickler was a board member emeritus; it, in turn,
was swallowed up in 1996 by the Walt Disney Company.
</P>
<P>
   Dickler was the author of ``Man on Trial: History-Making Trials
from Socrates to Oppenheimer'' (Doubleday, 1962). It summed up 13
trials and excerpted court records from cases that he selected for
having reflected their times and leaving an impact on Western
history.
</P>
<P>
   Dickler represented John Henry Faulk, whose career in radio and
television was cut short when CBS fired him 1955. The dismissal
followed allegations of Communist sympathies on Faulk's part.
Dickler, his former business manager, worked for him without pay in
the ensuing litigation.
</P>
<P>
   He also had his brush with the bitter and labyrinthine feud over
the valuable estate of Mark Rothko that went on for years among the
painter's heirs, executors and other parties. Rothko committed
suicide, and Dickler represented the guardian and aunt of Rothko's
young son, Christopher, in the court battles.
</P>
<P>
   Dickler is survived by his wife of 65 years, Ruth Crohn Dickler;
three daughters, Abby Pratt of West Stockbridge, Mass., Jane Lebow
of Manhattan and Susan Dickler of Lexington, Mass.; a brother,
Irving, of Sunrise, Fla., and four grandchildren.

MLICKI DEALS WITH TRADE TALK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The numbers weren't gaudy, but in 20 starts
with the Dodgers last season Dave Mlicki did more than go 7-3. The
consensus among baseball people was he showed he belonged in the
rotation rather than the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here he is again, fighting for a starting role as spring
training commences. This time, though, the battle figures to
involve his future with the Dodgers. Mlicki, 30, concedes starters
Chan Ho Park, Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort aren't going
anywhere. With Carlos Perez looming as the lone left-handed
starter, it leaves Mlicki and Ismael Valdes, 25, for the fifth
starting spot. By process of elimination, Mlicki is the leading
contender to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about it,'' Mlicki said Wednesday,
a day before pitchers and catchers voluntarily report to
Dodgertown. ``I've been dealing with this for a while now. It used
to bother me, but now I kind of look at it as a positive. When
there's that many teams out there who want me, you have to look at
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   What could ultimately determine Mlicki's address when spring
training breaks won't necessarily be who's interested, but what
they're willing to part with in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he won't make a deal
for the sake of making a deal. He also said he's wary of dealing a
starter before spring training even begins.
</P>
<P>
   Given his druthers, there's no question where Mlicki wants to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to stay here,'' Mlicki said. ``I think when you look
at this team, a lot of good things are going to happen, and I
definitely want to be a part of it. L.A. is a great place, and you
can't get much better than the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki's role became more defined, and his value may have
increased, after he came to the team in the Hideo Nomo deal last
season. He went 7-3 with a 4.05 ERA in 20 starts as a starter with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Before that there were questions of whether Mlicki, who is 31-35
lifetime, would be better used out of the bullpen. In 1996, he went
6-7 with a 3.30 ERA as a middle reliever and spot starter with the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Starting) is what I prefer to do, it's what I've always
done,'' said Mlicki, who is 24-30 as a starter. ``The one year I
relieved with the Mets, I felt like I did a good job, and I think
they liked the job I did, but I'm just not that type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Come see Dodgers . . . and beaches: With the Dodgers examining a
move to a new spring training site in Arizona, Indian River County
(Fla.) wants to show tourists there is more to Vero Beach, and the
surrounding area, than six weeks of baseball in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   The county will advertise on cable stations within Florida,
enticing tourists to attend spring training games and then check
out the area. The 30-second television ads, to be paid for with
tourist development tax money, will feature the area's beaches,
shops and hotels.

   LOS ANGELES _ ``October Sky'' tells the more or less true story
of Homer Hickam, a West Virginia coal miner's son whose youthful
fascination with rocket science eventually led to a career with
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood rocket scientists _ director Joe Johnston
(``Jumanji''), producer Charles Gordon (``Waterworld,'' ``Field of
Dreams'') and screenwriter Lewis Colick (``Ghosts of Mississippi'')
_ have apparently worked over Hickam's memoir ``Rocket Boys'' to a
commercial fare-thee-well. The thing plays like a ``Rocky'' movie
for physics nerds, with a male weepie subplot of father-son
friction thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Cliched as the film may be, though, there are far worse things
than promoting learning in a beat-the-odds, rah-rah manner _ and it
must be noted that ``October Sky'' handles the material in a much
more subdued, naturalistic way than the slicker, superficial ``Dead
Poets Society'' did. We're also fortunate that the skeptical,
hard-bitten dad is played by Chris Cooper, whose convincing,
sympathetic presence has grounded hokum of all stripes (``Lone
Star,'' ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``A Time to Kill'') in honest
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Young Homer, played earnestly by Jake Gyllenhaal, is, like many
Americans, alarmed and inspired when the Soviet Union launches the
first Sputnik satellite in 1957. Too puny to earn the football
scholarship his older brother (Scott Miles) is headed for, Jake is
expected to go straight to the mines once he graduates high school.
</P>
<P>
   But now his head's in the heavens, not down in the hole. Risking
social ostracism by befriending the school geek Quentin (Chris Owen
of ``She's All That'' and TV's ``7th Heaven''), Homer and his pals
Roy Lee (William Lee Scott) and O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), set to
studying jet propulsion and experimenting with increasingly
powerful _ and unpredictable _ homemade rocket launches.
</P>
<P>
   Such activity is encouraged by Miss Riley (Laura Dern), one of
those super-supportive movie teachers who can't be long for this
world. It's pretty much dismissed as pie-in-the-sky nonsense by
everybody else, most particularly Homer's mine foreman father John
(Cooper). Tensions mount when a predictable cave-in, then a strike,
threatens John's livelihood. But gosh darn it, that national
science fair is coming up, and somebody's got to win it and get
their hand shook by Werner Von Braun.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the filmmakers treat the town's doubters with
respect; in the late '50s, outer space was indeed a fantasy realm,
and why should a culture built on the ultimate down-to-earth
business think otherwise? If Homer or one of his buddies gets
uppity about their self-advancement agenda, a working man soon
comes along to remind them that hard labor is noble, too.
</P>
<P>
   This, like a dozen other crowd-massaging touches (Homer's
spunky, encouraging mom, the girl who likes him for his brain more
than his rising local celebrity, etc.), comes off as manufactured
as the movie's overall, triumphal inevitability. But ``October
Sky's'' love of brainwork is genuine enough, and that's really all
the movie needs to rise above its mundane fundamentals.

SPORTS COLUMN: NOW YOUNG PLAYERS CAN ESCAPE COMPARISONS TO JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jason Williams, the rookie point guard from the
University of Florida currently distributing flair in Sacramento,
is lucky. He does not have to be like Mike. Instead of needing the
Dean Smith stamp of approval and a clean collegiate image, he can
merely prove himself as a player and not worry about his sketchy
past.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to measure up to Michael Jordan, whose
presence in the NBA grew larger than legend, he can find a kindred
spirit in someone like, well, Jayson Williams _ the Nets center who
went from being a young knucklehead to a hard-working veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Jordan's retirement is not that another
team will take home a title. Crucial to the game's success, the
next generation of players now has a chance to be viewed more
realistically.
</P>
<P>
   Role models more human than holy will help them much more than a
basketball deity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to set high standards, but you don't want them
to be unreachable,'' said Scottie Pippen, Jordan's sidekick on the
Bulls. ``There are boundaries you need to put up to let yourself
know that. With Michael gone, maybe that will be easier. Being
alongside Michael and playing with him, I didn't see him as a
mega-superstar. I was on the inside and looked at the young players
as they just had to wait their turn. But I could see, the
opportunity for anyone to overshadow Michael and the Bulls just
wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen spoke a few hours before his new team, Houston, met
Minnesota and Kevin Garnett. It was also the day before he and the
Rockets would match up against another gifted young player, Keith
Van Horn of the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett's three-year career is often used as a blueprint for
everything that is wrong with the NBA: teen-age star skips college,
signs ridiculously rich contract based on potential rather than
experience and has to carry, unfairly, a franchise at the ripe old
age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   But Garnett and, to a lesser extent, Kobe Bryant have become
exceptions to the rule. Bryant also skipped college, but these two
play and work hard and win, oblivious to the pressure of propelling
a league trying to recapture its mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one very simple reason no one can be Jordan,'' said
Jerry Reynolds, Sacramento's director of player personnel.
``They're not nearly as good as he was. If someone is trying to be
Michael, they're going to be nothing but a big disappointment.
Whoever is trying to promote their players like Michael is also
going to fail miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds and the Kings' staff interviewed Williams before they
drafted him seventh last June. His dismissal from his college team
20 games into his senior season for violating team and athletic
department policy and his history of transferring in and out of
schools _ he signed with Providence, spurned the Friars and went to
Marshall, then transferred to Florida _ frightened many teams away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty honest,'' Reynolds said of the meeting. ``He
said he did something _ marijuana was involved _ but he added that
most of the problems stemmed from the fact he didn't like college.
I just told him: `We'll never make you go to class. Just take Jump
Shots 101, and you'll be fine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids mess up when they're 20 and keep doing it. Others
straighten out and mature. For a lot of these guys, though, the
margin of error is much slimmer than it is with society.''
</P>
<P>
   As the incomparable big brother who got straight A's, Jordan
fostered that belief. He was good. Any cocksure youngster who spoke
back to him was bad. While he, Pippen and the Bulls rose in
stature, it was almost as if a part of the NBA family was off
trying to get attention in dubious ways.
</P>
<P>
   The players who come into the league today do not have to work
that hard for attention. They may not be players whom you remember
from March Madness; they may even be players who opted out of
college. The first time you may get to know them is as young
millionaires with either peach fuzz or troubled pasts or both.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough sell, but at least they can play their game and
plan their futures without such an unfair and unrealistic
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have to step up and fill those big shoes that have
been missing,'' Detroit's Grant Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   At least they don't have to be judged alongside Jordan anymore.
As even a squeaky-clean all-star from Duke knows: it is one thing
to take your team to the playoffs, it is completely another to try
to make yourself into a myth. &QL;

 &HT;    Small businesses worry about costs
 &HT;    By Andy Miller and Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tib's Electrical Service Co. pays all costs of health
insurance for covering its 45 employees. The suburban Atlanta firm
offers a rich benefits plan because ``it's hard to keep quality
electricians,'' said general manager Todd Tibbetts.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's health costs, at about $200,000 annually, go
up by 10 percent a year for its PPO managed care plan, Tibbetts
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Tibbetts is concerned that managed care legislation
pushed by Gov. Roy Barnes will mean even higher premium increases _
by much more than the 1.6 percent maximum the governor asserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One percent is very unrealistic,'' Tibbetts said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting support of such small firms as Tib's, and their larger
corporate counterparts, will be crucial for the managed care
industry to defeat pieces of Barnes' health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Business and insurance officials scrambled Wednesday to get
details of the Barnes package. And they expressed frustration that
the actual bills would not be introduced until Monday. That
effectively gives the governor nine working days to force them
through one chamber of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely important,'' said Bert Fridlin of the
National Federation of Independent Business. ``You can't take on
something this sweeping and do it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature should allow enough time to study the issues,
said Earl Rogers of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say lack of time may be the most effective
argument opponents can raise to a package of reforms by a popular
governor directed at an unpopular industry. Attempting to delay the
bills for more in-depth analysis, which would defer them to next
year, might be more successful than trying to kill them outright,
political scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The business-insurance collaboration, successful in the past at
opposing smaller insurance bills, will likely focus its efforts on
two Barnes proposals: liability for managed care companies on
coverage decisions, and wider patient choice of doctor and
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument will hinge on one central factor: cost.
</P>
<P>
   If legislation raises premiums for employers, the cost will be
borne by workers as well, Fridlin said. Another danger is that more
companies will drop insurance _ leading to more uninsured
Georgians, said Betsey Weltner, spokeswoman for the Georgia
Association of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barnes' choice-of-doctor issue, patients would be able to
select a health plan allowing them to visit non-network providers.
The consumers would generally pay a premium differential of no more
than 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't cover the true market cost of choice, Fridlin
added. Under Barnes' proposal, ``employers will have to eat a lot
of the costs and shift costs to the employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' plan for opening up networks to other doctors would
reduce the quality of care, argued physicians for Kaiser
Permanente, a leading HMO. ``We couldn't monitor quality,'' said
Dr. Bruce Perry of the Permanente group.

 &HT;    Georgia Gov. Barnes' plans to expand doctor choice, right to sue
HMOs likely to draw stiff opposition
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt and Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes prescribed a package of far-reaching
health care reform Wednesday, touching off what may be his most
ambitious and contentious effort of the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   In the forefront are his plans to open HMO networks to more
doctor choice and more lawsuits if patients are denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for a fight with the insurance industry money on one
side and what the people of Georgia want on the other,'' Barnes
said. ``But I'm used to fights with a lot of money on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The last major piece of Barnes' first-year legislative agenda _
three bills to be introduced Monday _ will initiate the reforms
that were the most visible and most promised of Barnes' campaign
for governor. The proposed changes will let managed care patients
go to any doctor and pay minimal additional costs as long as the
doctor agrees to terms of the HMO plan.
</P>
<P>
   And managed care networks will be opened to lawsuits over denial
of treatment as the last step of an external appeals process.
Barnes also intends to create an insurance consumer advocate to
fight for lower rates and represent consumers in insurance
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of insurance companies, small-business and
big-business lobbying groups and HMOs who had been anticipating
this action for months responded immediately. Their warning:
Barnes' plan could mean skyrocketing insurance rates for patients
and employers.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Weltner, speaking for the Georgia Association of HMOs,
called the effort ``the largest proposed changes to health care
laws in 20 years.'' She cautioned the combined steps advocated by
the governor could jack up rates by double-digit percentage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes rejected those claims, citing a Congressional Budget
Office study indicating such reforms would inject, at most, a 1.6
percent rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' press for change in the face of insurers' resistance
sets the stage for what may be the fiercest battle of a legislative
session in which opposition to his other legislative initiatives
has evaporated almost before it had a chance to form. On Wednesday,
the governor found potential allies among Republicans who had
earlier decried his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty good middle ground he's found,'' said House
Minority Leader Bob Irvin (R-Atlanta). Irvin was reassured by
provisions to protect employers from liability and by the two-step
appeals process that makes lawsuits a final resort. ``He's moved a
long way in the direction we've been pushing,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers who for years have fought unsuccessfully for
major insurance and health care reform applauded the initiatives as
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past it's been blocked by the power of the industry,''
said Rep. Nan Orrock (D-Atlanta). ``But I'd say they've met their
match with Roy Barnes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his proposal to create a transportation superagency to
deal with metro Atlanta's traffic gridlock and pollution, the new
governor has now tackled an issue that touches every corner of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have to get out and fight traffic every
day, where they do have to worry about health care,'' said Charles
Bullock, a University of Georgia political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barnes' proposal, HMOs must offer clients an opportunity
to enroll in a ``consumer choice option'' that permits them to go
to any doctor they choose. But the patient must pick up the
additional costs, capped at 7.5 percent of the premium.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also proposes an appeals process to deal with
denial of treatment. Patients first would bring a grievance to a
panel of outside doctors to review the case. That's a process
several of Georgia's eight managed care providers voluntarily
agreed to this year.
</P>
<P>
   But HMOs balk at the next step: allowing patients to sue managed
care providers for injury resulting from denied or delayed
treatment. Currently, Georgia law restricts such lawsuits to breach
of contract or physician malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes modeled his enhanced liability proposal after a Texas
law. But he said he won't follow Texas' example and open HMOs to
punitive damages that insurers warn would drive settlements into
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawsuits have been filed since the Texas law was enacted in
September 1997, according to a spokesman for the Texas insurance
commissioner's office. But the law has resulted in more than 400
independent reviews, according to Texas health care attorney George
Parker Young. And about half of those reviews resulted in HMOs
reversing their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any downside to it,'' said Charles Inlander,
president of the People's Medical Society, a nonprofit grass-roots
medical advocacy group for patients. ``This is sound consumer
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also disputes claims that his reforms will hit small
businesses who buy outside insurance harder than it will big
companies, whose self-insured plans typically are not regulated by
the state. The liability reform will apply to all companies, Barnes
said, including those that self-insure, if they employ an outside
plan administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' plan for an insurance advocacy office isn't expected to
run into as much opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A competent, independent advocate could play an important role
on rate increases and services,'' said consumer health advocate
Linda Lowe. ``That person could identify problems and patterns of
anti-consumer actions, and propose remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to create a health department consolidating several
state agencies _ another Barnes proposal _ also will be introduced
next week.
</P>
<P>
   With the 40-day General Assembly session almost two-thirds done,
the governor's health care overhaul will have nine working days to
move through one legislative chamber or be put on hold for the
year. Though he says he's not concerned about the time constraints,
Barnes is splitting up the package. He's starting one bill in the
House and two in the Senate in what some political observers say is
a compartmentalization strategy to ensure that some portion of it
stays afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think time is on our side,'' Barnes said. ``No longer are
we going to cower to those in the halls that say that the world is
going to come to an end ... just because we want to reform what is
a harsh system.''

 &HT;    Texas health care law produces few suits
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Texas law that allows some patients to sue their
HMOs has not opened a floodgate of lawsuits and has provided fairly
solid protection for patients, advocates and Texas officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawsuits have been filed since the law was enacted in
September 1997, according to Lee Jones, spokesman for the Texas
insurance commissioner's office. But the law has resulted in more
than 400 independent reviews, according to Texas health care
attorney George Parker Young. And about half of those reviews
resulted in HMOs reversing their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any downside to it,'' said Charles Inlander,
president of the People's Medical Society, a nonprofit grass-roots
medical advocacy group for patients. ``This is sound consumer
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes wants to enact a similar law for Georgia
consumers. In Texas:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs have liability for the care they oversee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients have the right to an independent review of rejected
claims for proposed treatments.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs cannot retaliate against doctors for mentioning treatment
options not covered by a patient's plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors cannot be forced to sign contracts that hold them
solely liable for care.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not protect in many ways employees who get their
health coverage through self-insured plans. Those plans, usually
offered by large employers, are protected by federal statute from
state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   However, that might change. After Aetna U.S. Healthcare
challenged the law in court last fall, a federal judge ruled that
such plans may be held liable for care.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas and the insurer are appealing the split ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes proposal has caused shudders throughout the insurance
industry, which fears it will promote frivolous and expensive
lawsuits that could drive up premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is whenever we open the door for liability,
costs go up,'' said Betsy Weltner, spokeswoman for the Georgia
Association of HMOs. In Georgia, an average of three patients per
plan per year are dissatisfied with insurers' review policies, she
said. ``We don't have a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente of Georgia, for example, already can be sued
because of its unique structure where the doctors are an integral
part of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the HMO would support such a proposal,
said Laura Marshall, a Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just encourage people to take action too quickly,''
said Marshall. ``And that would lead to costs that are too high,
even if you won.''

YANKEE CONFIDENCE COMES NATURALLY

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Joe Torre believes he managed the best team in
baseball history last season. The Yankees, Torre is sure, scaled
baseball's mountaintop, breathed the most pristine air of
accomplishment and planted their legacy.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the Yankees prepared Wednesday to open spring training,
with pitchers and catchers set to work out Thursday, Torre made no
flippant claims about winning 125 games and matching or surpassing
the feats of the 1998 Yankees. Torre does not believe that will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   What he did say is that the Yankees need to participate in the
World Series. It's in their nature. Dogs need to chase cats, lions
need to stalk zebras and the Yankees need championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get to the World Series,'' said Torre, leaning back
in his office chair, his black hair shining after a post-workout
shower. ``Because of who we are and what we spend on players. It's
a pressure, but it's a confident type of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have great reason to be sure of themselves. George
Steinbrenner, the principal owner, will spend about $83 million to
$84 million to keep almost the entire team intact; part-time
outfielder Tim Raines is the only departed player. Bernie Williams
returns, with a new $87.5 million contract, and David Cone is back,
with a one-year, $8 million deal. The players whose intensity set
the tone for this team last year _ among them Derek Jeter, Paul
O'Neill and Scott Brosius _ are back.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of the American League East is in transition. The
Boston Red Sox, a wild-card team last year, lost slugger Mo Vaughn
to the Anaheim Angels. The Baltimore Orioles must incorporate
Albert Belle, Will Clark and Delino DeShields. The Toronto Blue
Jays might trade ace pitcher Roger Clemens. So the Yankees are
heavily favored to win the division and return to the World Series.
They need the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of their spring training pre-eminence, the Yankees do
have a list of issues that will be addressed before they open the
season at Oakland on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Torre must decide how he will dole out playing time
in left field to a long list of candidates. Ricky Ledee played
terrifically in the World Series, Shane Spencer was arguably the
American League's best player for a three-week period, and Darryl
Strawberry, who bashed 24 home runs last season, is attempting to
come back from colon cancer. ``And don't forget Chad Curtis,'' said
Torre, mentioning the veteran outfielder who is in the first year
of a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis carries additional value because he is the only other
outfielder who has played center field on a regular basis, and will
fill in if Williams get hurt. As spring training begins and
Strawberry's status is uncertain, it figures that a platoon of the
left-handed-hitting Ledee and the right-handed-hitting Curtis may
emerge. If Spencer doesn't have a great spring, the Yankees could
deal him to Oakland for the right-handed pitcher Blake Stein.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation is all but set with Cone, David Wells, Orlando
Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and Hideki Irabu, with Ramiro Mendoza in
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees are to approach 114 regular-season victories
again, it will be because the rotation is as good as it was last
year. But, Torre noted, Cone and Wells are each a year older, and
Irabu was inconsistent last season. ``Irabu needs to step it up, no
question,'' said Torre, remembering that when Irabu pitched well
early last year, ``maybe he thought it was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada started at catcher in 85 of the Yankees' 162 games
last season, nine more than Joe Girardi. The Yankees decided to
keep Girardi, at the behest of Torre and at an expense of $3.4
million, but Torre indicated that he intends to use Posada more and
more, to the point where he will be prepared to catch every single
day in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Torre intends to mix up his catching rotation.
Posada always caught Hernandez, Irabu and Wells last season, while
Girardi was behind the plate for Pettitte and Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm going to do in the spring is make sure Jorge catches
guys he didn't catch last year,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson and Darren Holmes both had back trouble last year,
and both say they are feeling fine now. But they will be watched
carefully _ Nelson in particular, because of his importance to the
club's middle relief.
</P>
<P>
   Torre will meet with the full squad next week, and he is
uncertain exactly what he will say. He knows he's not going to ask
his players to reach for 125 victories. ``They have to be careful
of what's haunted us all winter,'' Torre said. ``What are you going
to do next year?''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will ask the Yankees to prepare well and play hard, as
they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   And he might ask them to once again quench their need for the
World Series.

ANALYSTS CHEER COUNTRYWIDE DEAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. -- A joint venture announced Wednesday between
mortgage lender Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. and a United
Kingdom-based company was hailed as a milestone for Countrywide and
a step toward globalization of the mortgage industry.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage industry has always been a highly localized
business, with lenders typically servicing clients in and around
their own regions.
</P>
<P>
   But Countrywide, which already has a national reach and is
considered an innovator in the industry, is jumping across the sea
into a foreign market -- a rare if not unheard of occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare for mortgage lending to cross borders,'' said
Thomas O'Donnell, a mortgage finance analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney in New York City. ``We may be taking incipient steps toward
a more global mortgage market, but it's in the early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was unimpressed with the announcement. Shares of
Countrywide increased a meager 56.25 cents to $39.75 on 345,800
shares traded, or roughly 40 percent less than the 30-day average
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide and Woolwich PLC on Wednesday announced their intent
to form a European mortgage banking joint venture. Under the
venture, Countrywide will provide its sophisticated technology and
expertise to service the portfolio held by Woolwich, which has
operations throughout the United Kingdom and in France and Italy.
The joint venture will market its services to other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Woolwich's mortgage servicing portfolio is worth $40 billion,
with annual funding of about $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The venture will more than double Countrywide's geographic
``footprint'' and contribute significant earnings growth for both
companies, according to Stanford Kurland, senior managing director
and chief operating officer for Countrywide Credit Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It marks a major step in the evolution of Countrywide,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each company will own half the venture.
</P>
<P>
   He could not estimate how much the venture will add to either
company's earnings. But the initial capitalization per partner for
the venture should stay below $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture is expected to begin operation in the last
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The move is further evidence of Countrywide's willingness to
innovate and diversify, O'Donnell said. Last year, for example, the
company began offering a full range of insurance coverage to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture's prospects are ``enormously bright,''
O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They essentially invented the mortgage banking industry as we
know it today,'' he said. ``They've always been an innovator -- a
well-managed innovator -- and this is another example.''

TALIBAN SAYS BIN LADEN IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top official of the Taliban, the armed religious
group that controls most of Afghanistan, said Wednesday that Osama
bin Laden, the world's most-wanted terrorist suspect, is no longer
in Taliban territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know where he is,'' said the official, Abdul Hakeem
Mujahid, a Taliban diplomat assigned to the United Nations who met
Wednesday with senior U.S. officials. ``He decided himself to
leave. He is not in the area of control of the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan said on Tuesday that its
troops had sighted bin Laden in Afghanistan in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said they had no evidence to support
the Taliban claim about bin Laden, who has been indicted in the
United States in the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa last
August.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials said they were heartened by the willingness
of the Taliban, which had long harbored bin Laden, to distance
itself publicly from the Saudi multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid spoke with reporters here Wednesday after meeting with
Karl Inderfurth, the assistant secretary of state for South Asian
affairs. Inderfurth met in Pakistan this month with other Taliban
officials to demand that bin Laden be expelled from Afghanistan and
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States does not recognize the Taliban as the
government of Afghanistan, it maintains contact with it.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban leaders are eager to gain diplomatic recognition from
the United States, and to avoid a repetition of last summer's
American missile attack on an Afghan base camp used in the past by
bin Laden. That eagerness has given the Clinton administration
leverage in pushing for his expulsion from Afghanistan.

Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic of The Times of
London. 
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since she took over the role of the spymaster M in the James
Bond movies, and came close to winning an Oscar for her portrayal
of Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown,'' Judi Dench's mailbag has
vastly increased. She has become accustomed to getting letters,
mostly from America, asking her where she has been hiding and what
acting she has done.
</P>
<P>
   If she were a pedantic person, she might reply that, well, she
has been playing leading roles in the theater for four decades and
that her work onstage won her the title of Dame of the British
Empire in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   If she were feeling immodest, Dame Judi might add that she is
widely regarded in British theater circles as the greatest living
English actress. But she knows that only a minuscule proportion of
the world's population has seen her Cleopatra or Lady Macbeth, her
brassy Mother Courage or her oddly young and sexually susceptible
Lady Bracknell. She is well aware that there are at least two good
reasons why she has achieved international renown only in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   First, she has long been a stranger to Broadway and the American
stage. When she opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in David
Hare's ``Amy's View'' on April 15, it will be her first appearance
in New York in 40 years. Back in 1959, she had what she remembers
as ``a magical time'' discovering the city and playing smallish
parts for the visiting Old Vic Company.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is taking the star role of Esme, the feisty West End
actress who spends Hare's tragicomedy arguing with her daughter,
quarreling with her son-in-law and enduring setbacks professional,
economic and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she shied from the movies after a producer saw her first
screen test and told her, ``You have every single thing wrong with
your face.'' That was many years ago; but, perhaps also because she
prefers to give performances that are alive and changing rather
than finished and fixed, her accomplishments onscreen have only
recently begun to match those onstage.
</P>
<P>
   However, her Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' for which
she has just received an Oscar nomination for best supporting
actress, and the new ``Tea With Mussolini,'' in which she plays a
1930s Fascist groupie, may give her second career the extra push it
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that trip to America in 1959 began with
disappointment. Judi Dench was only 22 and fresh from drama school
when she was cast as Ophelia opposite John Neville's Hamlet at the
Vic in 1957, and some critics thought her unready, the influential
Kenneth Tynan dismissing her as ``a pleasing but terribly sane
little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the company eventually took several plays across the
Atlantic, she was replaced in that role while retaining Maria in
``Twelfth Night'' and the Princess of France in ``Henry V.'' Her
belated return to Broadway in a production that triumphed first at
the National Theater, then in the West End, marks a pretty
gratifying reversal of fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Dame Judi so treasured in her native England? Like many
major performers, from the tiny, hoarse Edmund Kean through the
big, awkward Henry Irving, she has what at first seem physical
disadvantages. At 5 feet 1{ inches, she is undeniably short; an
ungallant observer might call her stocky; and when she was a girl
in York, an actor who met her after consulting her father, a local
doctor, decided she had no hope of a stage career because she
sounded as if she had laryngitis.
</P>
<P>
   When she played Sally Bowles in ``Cabaret'' in 1968, she got so
irked by audiences expressing concern about her that she implored
the management to put a notice in the foyer: ``Miss Dench does not
have a cold. This is her normal speaking voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crack in her voice has become an appealing smokiness,
and her height has seemed noticeable only when she has wanted it to
be noticed, as when her dough-faced, chopped-haired Mother Courage
was scuttling across Brecht's warscape like a tough little
cockroach evading the light.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what distinguishes Dame Judi from Britain's other major
actresses _ the droll Maggie Smith, the cool Diana Rigg, the always
fresh Vanessa Redgrave _ is the extent of her versatility. In the
early days, she was an innocently excited Juliet for Franco
Zeffirelli, as well as a raunchy, street-wise Sally Bowles for
Harold Prince.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, she has played the disillusioned actress in
Stephen Sondheim's ``Little Night Music,'' delivering ``Send in the
Clowns'' not as a sentimental dirge or pretty crowd-pleaser but as
a deeply felt confession of emotional failure; yet she was equally
successful as a rattled, monstrous nightclub owner in the most
recent revival of Rodney Ackland's 1952 play, ``Absolute Hell.''
The two performances won her a unique double in the 1995 Olivier
Awards: best actress in a straight play, ditto in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Macbeth she played, opposite Ian McKellen in 1976, an
ambitious yet vulnerable woman forcing herself to commit acts that
terrified her, is widely reckoned the best of our era. When Peter
Hall asked her to tackle Cleopatra in 1987, she asked him if he
really wanted ``a menopausal dwarf'' in the role, and then answered
her own doubts with a performance that combined volatility,
sexiness, melancholy, absurdity and menace. For once, the Egyptian
queen was not a million miles from justifying Enobarbus' salute to
her ``infinite variety.''
</P>
<P>
   But variety is just one quality that Dame Judi's admirers
mention when they define her special strengths. Sir Richard Eyre,
who directs her in ``Amy's View,'' says that ``part of her genius,
and I mean genius, is that she has technique to burn, yet never
displays it, always makes her performance seem effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hare talks of her ``slightly mystical, sixth-sense
responsiveness to the mood of the audience,'' her spontaneity on
stage. ``Most actors find a performance in which they're secure and
vary it a certain amount,'' he says. ``She can say the same line in
eight different ways and make you believe it each time. At one
performance of `Amy's View,' a man started sobbing so loudly in the
last act that it was upsetting the audience, and Judi told me she
was thinking, `God, he'll have a breakdown if I'm not careful.' So
when she got to an upsetting line, she delivered it lightly. How
many other actors have the presence of mind to bring that off?''
</P>
<P>
   Add emotional empathy and power, warmth yet steeliness, too much
understanding of human complexity to judge the character she is
playing, a mischievous sense of humor, a love of economy, a refusal
to hog limelights or upstage other actors, and, no, you still
haven't quite exhausted the qualities acknowledged by those
interviewed in a recent biography, John Miller's ``Judi Dench.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A blazing sincerity and honesty,'' says Ian McKellen, summing
up characters from Juliet in 1960 through a wonderfully cranky,
mistrustful Beatrice in a 1976 ``Much Ado'' to Arkadina in
Chekhov's ``Seagull'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But surely no major actress behaves quite like Dame Judi when a
role is offered her. Though she may do background reading _
biographies of Victoria before tackling ``Mrs. Brown'' _ she tends
not to look at a script before the first read-through.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Davies, who directed her Mother Courage, was astounded
when she growled, ``Why didn't you tell me she's never off the
stage?'' just before rehearsals began; and she similarly flummoxed
the director Trevor Nunn by saying she hadn't realized the title
character of Sean O'Casey's ``Juno and the Paycock'' was older than
herself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she agreed to appear in Eduardo de Filippo's
``Filumena'' without knowing she was to play a hard, canny
Neapolitan prostitute who plots to marry her neglectful protector.
For her, it was enough that she had a director, Peter Hall, she
trusted to deal with the terrors she always feels in the early
creative stages.
</P>
<P>
   Those terrors certainly afflicted her during ``Amy's View.''
Dame Judi, who had long been asking Hare to write her a play,
recalls meeting him walking his dog near her Hampstead home and him
saying, ``I'm finishing something with a wonderful part for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare remembers her nervously replying, ``Oh, God, do I really
have to do it?'' He somehow persuaded her to read the script, or
most it, and she seemed delighted. But three weeks into rehearsal,
the lines, not to mention the character of Esme, were eluding her,
and she begged Eyre to release her.
</P>
<P>
   He gently refused, as Hall had when she was insisting she had
been wrong to tackle Lady Bracknell in Wilde's ``Importance of
Being Earnest.'' So Dame Judi started a regimen of taking baths
and, however cold the water got, refusing to allow herself to get
out until she had learned three or four pages. It was eccentric but
it worked. The result was a performance whose mix of humor and pain
won her some of the best reviews of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Dame Judi is a thoroughly paradoxical person. She
exudes confidence onstage yet is so insecure she may sometimes be
heard telling directors, ``I don't know what I'm doing.'' She is
always afraid before making an entrance, yet relies on the
adrenaline this gives her, so much so that she dryly says, ``I'd be
frightened if I didn't feel fear.'' And she eagerly embraces the
very risks that drive her near to despair:
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept telling me I couldn't play Lady Bracknell, but
that was the appeal. I get bored very easily, so I want to play
parts unlike those I've played before. I want to learn, I want to
be pushed. I want someone to say, `Go on, try that, go on, fall
3,000 feet and see how you feel when you get up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The paradoxes proliferate. Perhaps because of the tension she
feels, Dame Judi is notoriously prone to getting the giggles
onstage, and sometimes plays pranks during performances.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she slipped a spoof love note to Howard Davies,
who was watching her in a theater-in-the-round production at the
National, only to realize that the note had landed in the lap of
the stranger sitting next to him. And yet her commitment to her art
has never been in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   One reason she admires ``Amy's View,'' and wants to take it to
America, is that David Hare uses the play to mount a defense of
live theater over the electronic media as represented by Esme's
go-getting son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Dame Judi neglects conventional preparation yet works
famously hard not only in rehearsals but also after she has opened.
For her, plays exist only when she can explore, change, react to
other performers while they react to her. Richard Eyre calls her
approach to roles ``unscientific and utterly pragmatic,'' recalling
how she had found Ranevskaya in ``The Cherry Orchard'' elusive
until she suddenly said in a wry, forgiving way, ``She's a terrible
old tart, isn't she?'' The suspicion that the great landowner had
slept with many men added an earthy truth and a forlorn yearning to
her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Dame Judi herself finds it hard to talk about
acting, though she admits to relying primarily on instinct. She is
not, however, a friend of the Method, which she thinks encourages
self-absorption and discourages the slight detachment an actor must
always retain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to feel things absolutely at the minute they're
happening,'' she says. ``But you also have to ask yourself a
hundred questions about every line: about the essence of the
character and what the author is saying through you. I think of
myself at an enormous console with hundreds and hundreds of
buttons, each of which I must press at exactly the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi is not easily satisfied with her own work. Despite
plenty of critical praise, she feels her Gertrude in 1989 was ``a
deep, deep failure,'' mainly because she never convinced herself
that Daniel Day-Lewis, who played Hamlet, could be her son, for
reasons she cannot articulate, even to herself.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for her failure to commit herself more often to
movies, and for her refusal to watch those she appears in, is that
they leave her wishing she had done scenes differently. She would,
she says, love to have another go at Victoria's rejection of the
devoted but troublesome gamekeeper, John Brown, which embarrassed
her when she brought herself to see ``Mrs. Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, acting is a work in progress _ ``With `Amy's View' I
still feel I've more to explore, more to discover in the baize bag
I like to imagine I'm carrying with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for her preference for the stage is that it is a
less literal medium than the screen. With films, you are cast
because of what you look like, and you cannot wholly disguise your
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never be allowed to play a Neapolitan onscreen,'' she
says. ``But I can fool you in the theater, not least by making you
believe I'm taller than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And here is a final paradox. Dame Judi is infinitely serious
about her work, yet never earnest. Acting is her life and, since
she and her husband, the actor Michael Williams, insist on making
time for their daughter and grandson, not wholly her life.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to tell worried fellow performers, ``It's only a play,
you know,'' and never forgets an incident when she was playing
Shaw's St. Joan years ago. She looked out the window and saw a
pale, anxious woman pushing a pram, looked back into the rehearsal
room and saw her colleagues strutting in knitted chain mail, and
thought ``What on earth are we doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a part of you that can laugh, or you'd go
mad,'' she says. ``That's not to say I don't care passionately
about the business and the people in it, because I do. But I think
a sense of the ridiculousness of it all is healthy.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The soul of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman''
looms behind the small, unthreatening revival of the play, now at
the Eugene O'Neill Theater, like the promise of a fierce,
revivifying midsummer storm. You await its imminent arrival, the
signs being right.
</P>
<P>
   As you watch the play being performed, you could swear there are
shifty winds around you, intermittently turning the leaves of the
oak trees pale-side-up. In the distance, you can almost see dark
roiling cumulus clouds and flashes of lightning, but the play's
sharp claps of thunder and their ominous reverberations remain
muted.
</P>
<P>
   Even the short, intense downpours _ sudden theatrical explosions
that briefly engage the emotions _ are the kind that Midwestern
farmers dismiss as ``spoilers.'' The water evaporates before
soaking into the earth. Finally, the play's angry, disembodied soul
moves along the far horizon and vanishes entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Thus is lost the full primal power of ``Death of a Salesman,''
the poetic, rock-hard evocation of the last desperate days in the
life of Willy Loman. Though you may never have seen this modern
classic, you probably know Willy Loman, one of the most haunting
characters in modern American literature, the Brooklyn drummer
whose name has become a generic term for any old-time, worn-out
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   The revival, which originated last year at the Goodman Theater
in Chicago, was staged by Robert Falls, the Goodman's artistic
director, and stars Brian Dennehy as Willy Loman. The production
doesn't do damage to this seminal work, but the play isn't fully
there.
</P>
<P>
   What is most extraordinary about the Miller text is that it is
as pertinent today as it was when it first arrived in New York
exactly a half-century ago on Feb. 10. That was less than four
years after the end of World War II. America was euphoric with its
victory, with its new status as a superpower and with the idea that
material success is, if not a sign of God's favor, then a very good
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Willy may not be a victim of the system as much as he is a
victim of his own acceptance of the distorted values the system
promotes, the least pernicious of which are his faith in brand
names and dependency on installment buying.
</P>
<P>
   Told that there is still one more payment due on the
refrigerator, which is now not working right, Willy roars in fury:
``Once in my life I'd like to own something outright before it's
broken! I'm always in a race with the junkyard!'' Yet he sees no
connection between his race with the junkyard and the world in
which he lives, and which now sees him as redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Just around Willy's corner there is always an idea that will pay
off big. He remembers his fabled brother Ben in Africa. Ben walked
into the jungle at the age of 17 and came out four years later with
his pockets full of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Success, Willy says, that's the goal, but you need contacts.
``It's who you know and the smile on your face!'' To be successful,
you have to be more than just liked: you have to be well liked. You
accommodate your clients. You aim to please and, if you have to lie
a little or shape your personality to make the sale, that's all
part of the game. He is not only out of touch with himself, but he
has also _ with love and care _ raised a couple of misfits.
</P>
<P>
   We never learn what Willy has been selling all these years but,
whatever it is, it's beside the point. Willy trafficks in
transactions and possibilities, in ephemera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' is a stern play but also a profoundly
humane and moving one. Though a fraud, Willy is an essentially
decent man trying blindly to cope with his own failure and with the
grown sons he no longer understands.
</P>
<P>
   Happy, the younger, is a good-natured slob, the kind of
compulsive who in the 1940s was called a skirt-chaser; the beloved
Biff, the high school football hero who once had the promise of a
University of Virginia athletic scholarship, is a drifter and
part-time kleptomaniac. Even Linda, Willy's patient, worried wife,
can infuriate him. Her devotion only feeds his sense of guilt and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' is not easily staged, though not
necessarily because Willy's breakdown takes the form of a seamless
cinematic hallucination. As his memories overtake him, past and
present overlap within single scenes. The actor playing Willy must
somehow have a fixed focus on what are really two different
characters inhabiting a single mind at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   There is the burned-out ruin of the hardy American optimist and,
staggering around within, a man in shock, trying to salvage some
dignity and hope from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy, whom I remember most happily as the fast-talking Walter
Burns in a revival of ``The Front Page'' many years ago, is a
physically impressive figure on the stage. He is big. Though he has
weight as a man, he is weightless as Willy, in part because he
appears to be in such robust health and is extremely well-tailored
for someone who has to borrow $50 a month for the household bills
and a little more to pay his insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy can play the superficial Willy, the hail-fellow-well-met
drummer, but the anguished soul within never emerges with
conviction. There is no repose in the performance. His Willy ceases
to exist when the actor isn't doing something, which results in a
reliance on gestures that have the effect of seeming busy, actorly.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Anderson effectively plays the soft, troubled inside of
Biff, the man who harbors a terrible, life-changing grudge against
the father he once worshiped. It's a performance of dour, collected
intelligence, though there is little to suggest that he was ever an
athlete of even high school celebrity. Ted Koch does well as the
cheerfully amoral, self-satisfied Happy.
</P>
<P>
   The production's most skillful, controlled and fully realized
performance is that of Elizabeth Franz, a timeless Linda, a woman
held together by her mission to save Willy from himself. She is
quite wonderful, though not because she seems to sound a lot like
Mildred Dunnock, who originated the role opposite the great Lee J.
Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Very good, too, are several members of the supporting cast:
Howard Witt as Willy's steadfast, if sarcastic, best friend; Steve
Pickering as the bored young executive who casually fires Willy,
and Richard Thompson as the ``anemic'' next door, the bookish,
nerdy kid who grows up to argue cases before the United States
Supreme Court.

 UNDATED: Supreme Court.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone who stages ``Death of a Salesman'' must be haunted by
the dreamlike setting that was designed by Jo Mielziner for Elia
Kazan's memorable initial production: a skeletal representation of
the Lomans' two-story Brooklyn house, as spare of line as an Al
Hirschfeld drawing, hemmed in by apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   With magical lighting (also designed by Mielziner), attention
was effortlessly shifted among the playing areas to facilitate and
enhance Willy's split-second swerves from present to past and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for Falls' production, designed by Mark Wendland,
might possibly be described as post-modern in that it makes no
attempt to seduce the imagination. It is a large dark space spread
out over much of the stage. Its most prominent feature: a large,
old-fashioned revolving platform that holds a small, three-sided,
doll-house-like representation of the Loman kitchen, as well as
some of the other minimally defined playing areas. The setting is
functional and bleak, though not in a way that has much to do with
what happens inside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Gone now _ and, I hope, forever _ are the debates that raged
after the play had its New York premiere, about whether or not
Willy Loman is a truly tragic figure. The subject was raised
largely in reaction to those ecstatic initial reviews that
identified Willy as a character to rank with Oedipus and Lear.
</P>
<P>
   Gone also are the suspicions that Miller's purpose in writing
``Death of a Salesman'' was to undermine the United States
Constitution, the American way of life, fatherhood, motherhood,
hardworking salesmen and the fine, upstanding firms that employ
them, if only on a commission basis.
</P>
<P>
   Today we recognize Willy as a quintessential American character,
a well-meaning but fatally self-deceiving fellow who bought, lock,
stock and barrel, the cliches and pieties that continue to give
order to so much of American life. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nimble Roger Rees is the deliberately fibrillative heart of
Martin Crimp's very free, otherwise exhausting update of Moliere's
1666 Paris hit, ``The Misanthrope.'' The play, directed by Barry
Edelstein, is now playing Off Broadway at the Classic Stage
Company.
</P>
<P>
   The production's other principal attraction: Uma Thurman, the
tall, pencil-thin, often steamy Hollywood actress (``Pulp
Fiction''), making her thoroughly gallant, if modest, professional
New York stage debut, playing Celimene opposite Rees' Alceste. To
call the performance modest is no put-down.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that not many other actresses, no matter what their
stage experience, would have the courage to try to speak Crimp's
overstuffed English dialogue. That is, rhyming couplets in which
there always seems to be an excess of words. They may be needed to
meet the demands of the meter, but they have the effect of blunting
not only the wit but also all meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The only other ``Misanthrope'' I have seen was the Royal
National Theater's 1973 production, which later visited New York. I
remember that production, in an English verse translation by Tony
Harrison, as a joy. But perhaps I'm remembering the young Diana
Rigg's delicious Celimene.
</P>
<P>
   Crimp's version places Moliere's vicious sendup of 17th-century
court manners in contemporary London, where Moliere's aristocratic
hypocrites have been transformed into a bunch of back-stabbing
movie folk.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful Celimene (now renamed Jennifer) is an American
star famous for her sexpot roles. The jaundiced Alceste, who
insists on speaking the truth and loves Jennifer, is a celebrated
writer. With several additional exceptions, the other roles are
less easily recognizable equivalents to those in the original.
</P>
<P>
   Rees commands the stage, but for good reason: no one else can
master the lumpy name-dropping verse with anything like ease. The
physical production looks very rich by Off Broadway standards, but
Ms. Thurman, in person, live on stage, playing opposite an actor of
Rees' stature, is a certifiable event. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A far less shaky certifiable event is ``James Naughton: Street
of Dreams,'' the easygoing, smooth-as-butter one-man cabaret turn
by Naughton, who most recently starred in the revival of
``Chicago'' and, before that, in ``City of Angels.'' Mike Nichols
is presenting the show for a limited run at the Promenade Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you delighted in Naughton's performance as the nervy
Windy City mouthpiece in ``Chicago,'' you have had only a glimpse
of the engaging personality who holds the stage at the Promenade
for 90 minutes, without a break, backed by a first-rate five-man
combo led by the pianist John Oddo.
</P>
<P>
   The format is familiar: songs, backstage stories, some personal
reminiscences and more songs. Included are standards from the
repertories of the Mills Brothers (``Glow Worm''), Bing Crosby
(``Pennies From Heaven'') and Elvis Presley (``Are You Lonesome
Tonight?''), more arcane material by Randy Newman and Billy
Strayhorn, among others, a still-funny Cole Porter parody (``You're
the Pits''), as well as the odd, not easily identified (by me)
novelty number.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton's baritone is as sure as it is flexible. If at times he
appears to be acting as if he were more relaxed than he actually
is, that is also all right: he is a good actor. Just as he doesn't
push, he clearly isn't bored by having done all this for too many
years.
</P>
<P>
   The manner is that of a (comparatively) ordinary guy who has
always wanted to get up and do his own cabaret show, who finally
gets the nerve to try it, and who finds, by golly, that he can.
</P>
<P>
   No one could be more surprised and delighted than he is. The
pleasure is mutual. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Feb. 21,
1999. &QL;

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH/AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ A conversation between
three New York Times theater critics on British and American
theater, which was recorded by the theater editor of Arts and
Leisure, Andrea Stevens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARLOS-SAURA-FILMS (Undated) _ This year's Academy Award
nominations offer many reasons for deep satisfaction, but one such
reason hasn't attracted much attention. Tucked at the end of the
list of nominees for best foreign film, just below Roberto
Benigni's ubiquitous ``Life Is Beautiful,'' is ``Tango,'' an entry
from Argentina that is the work of the hugely gifted, hugely
perplexing Spanish director Carlos Saura. It would be wonderful in
any case for the 67-year-old Saura to be noted again for Oscar
consideration (his ``Carmen'' was nominated in 1983). By Will
Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RISA-GARCIA-FILMS (Undated) _ In 1973, Risa Bramon Garcia turned
her first nobody into a star. His name was Martin, and she didn't
care that he had no acting experience. ``It's not just that he had
(italics)presence,''(end italics) said Ms. Garcia, who was then 16
and directing a high school production of ``South Pacific.'' ``He
had a beautiful singing voice. I knew that because he used to sit
behind me in history class and hum.'' Now 42, Ms. Garcia still has
ears and eyes for talent. Over the past 15 years she has become a
top casting director in Hollywood. With ``200 Cigarettes,'' which
opens on Friday, Ms. Garcia's 94-minute romantic comedy marks her
debut as a feature film director. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Apple,'' an astonishing directorial
debut by Samira Makhmalbaf, written and edited by her father,
Mohsen Makhmalbaf, won praise when it screened at the Cannes
International Film Festival last spring, but it also provoked a
certain confusion. ``One critic asked: `What kind of country is
Iran?' '' Ms. Makhmalbaf recalled, speaking animatedly in a mixture
of English and Farsi. `` `Is it a place where 12-year-old girls are
incarcerated, or where 18-year-old girls make movies?' '' The film,
which opened in New York on Friday after screening in the New York
Film Festival last fall, is both a realistic recreation of surreal
events and a subtle allegory about the need for liberty. By Leslie
Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``Death of a
Salesman''; ``The Misanthrope'' and ``James Naughton: Street of
Dreams.'' (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-ENGLISH-THEATER (Undated) _ While it may seem to Americans
that British theater people stream across the Atlantic in a
constant one-way flow, the current runs both ways. Americans can _
and do _ flourish in English theater. Six expatriates offer their
observations. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JUDI-DENCH-THEATER (London) _ Since she took over the role of
the spymaster M in the James Bond movies, and came close to winning
an Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown,''
Judi Dench's mailbag has vastly increased. She has become
accustomed to getting letters, mostly from America, asking her
where she has been hiding and what acting she has done. &UR;  &LR; If she
were a pedantic person, she might reply that, well, she has been
playing leading roles in the theater for four decades and that her
work onstage won her the title of Dame of the British Empire in
1988. &UR;  &LR; But she has long been a stranger to Broadway and the
American stage. When she opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in
David Hare's ``Amy's View'' on April 15, it will be her first
appearance in New York in 40 years. By Benedict Nightingale.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-AMERICANS-ACTORS (Undated) _ The trade agreement
governing the number of British and American actors working on
opposite sides of the Atlantic is under attack by Britain's main
international cultural agency, prompting hopes that the unions
involved will reconsider the arrangement. Under the current rules,
a producer who wants to bring a British actor to New York must seek
the approval of Actors Equity, the American union, just as British
Equity's approval is needed to allow an American actor to go to
Britain. In theory, the two unions try to balance the exchange. By
Felicia R. Lee. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CORIN-REDGRAVE-THEATER (subslug) (London) _ There will be two
unfamiliar entities onstage when ``Not About Nightingales'' opens
on Thursday at Circle in the Square on Broadway. First, of course,
will be Tennessee Williams's fierce, lyrical prison play, having
its belated New York premiere 61 years after it was written. And
second, playing the central role of the warden, will be Corin
Redgrave, who has not been on Broadway since 1963 and who is the
least known of the famous acting Redgraves. In addition to what Ben
Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called an ``outsize,
Satanic'' performance as Boss Whalen in ``Not About Nightingales,''
Redgrave has been acclaimed in productions of plays by Martin
Sherman (``Some Sunny Day''), Richard Nelson (``The General From
America'') and Noel Coward (``A Song at Twilight''), as well as
onscreen as Sir Walter Elliot in ``Persuasion.'' By Matt Wolf.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANGLO-IRISH-PLAYS (Undated) _ In the 10 weeks between now and
the cutoff date at the end of April for Tony Award nominations, a
crowd of visitors from the British Isles will be taking their
places on New York stages. Last season around this time,
theatergoers were anticipating a similar Anglo-Irish delivery of
plays, performers and directors. And next season is already shaping
up as a busy one for London imports. By Andrea Stevens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAPERO-CLASSICAL-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ The history of music is
filled with accounts of major new works that received prominent
premieres only to languish thereafter and sometimes virtually
disappear. Take the Symphony for Classical Orchestra by the
respected American Neo-Classical composer Harold Shapero. Shapero
was 27 when he completed this 45-minute work, which was given its
promising first performance in January 1948 by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra and Leonard Bernstein, who was then 29. Two months later,
George Szell conducted it with the Cleveland Orchestra. And in
1953, Bernstein and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra recorded the
piece in New York, producing a remarkable performance that
circulated for years and won the symphony admirers among musicians
and composers sympathetic to Neo-Classicism. That recording, long
unavailable, has now been reissued by Sony Classical in its
Bernstein Century series (SMK 60725; CD). By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BLONDIE-MUSIC (New York) _ ``Do you really want to know the
whole odd story?'' asked the guitarist Chris Stein, peering
skeptically across the coffee table in a midtown hotel suite. He
was explaining why Blondie, the punk era's best-selling group and,
later, one of its many train wrecks, has regrouped after 16 years
to record ``No Exit,'' an album of new studio material. By Ann
Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MORELL-PHOTOGS (Boston) _ The exhibition ``Abelardo Morell and
the Camera Eye,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts through April 11,
documents Morell's pictures from the point of view of a child with
70 images. It was organized by Diana Gaston, curator at the Museum
of Photographic Arts in San Diego, Calif. By Deborah Weisgall.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   HAPPENINGS-ART (Undated) _ With ``Off Limits: Rutgers University
and the Avant-Garde, 1957-1963,'' the Newark Museum has organized
an illuminating exhibition about one of modern art's lesser-known
but pivotal creative scenes. It unfolded at a moment when the art
world was transfixed by the apotheosis of Abstract Expressionism,
and still-nascent Pop Art had yet to emerge. The time was the late
50s and early 60s, when a mutually influential group of artists,
teachers and students came together at the Rutgers College and
Douglass College campuses in New Brunswick. There, they came up
with radical notions and rule-breaking experiments that helped sow
the seeds of performance art, installation art, conceptual art, Pop
Art and the international current in art known as Fluxus. ``Off
Limits,'' which traces this art-historical path, focuses on the
ideas and early work of Allan Kaprow, Robert Watts, George Segal,
Geoffrey Hendricks, Robert Whitman, Lucas Samaras, George Brecht
and Roy Lichtenstein, examining some of the better known of these
artists' work in unexpected contexts. The show opened Thursday and
will remain on view through May 16. By Edward M. GOMEZ. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-LANSKY (Los Angeles) _ For his first television movie, David
Mamet has chosen as his subject the gangster Meyer Lansky and
attracted a strong cast that includes Richard Dreyfuss (as a
largely quiet and introspective Lansky), Eric Roberts, Anthony
LaPaglia, Illeana Douglas and Max Perlich. Most of the typical
elements are there _ rubouts, skimming and double-crosses _ as the
movie, directed by John McNaughton, follows Lansky from his native
Poland to the streets of New York in the early part of the century
and finally to Miami Beach in the 1970s. But ``Lansky,'' which will
have its premiere on HBO Saturday night at 8, is a deeply unusual
picture. It defies many of the conventions of its two genres,
gangster films and made-for-television movies. By James Sterngold.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-BASKETS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Lloyd E. Cotsen, a
mega-collector of ordinary and offbeat objects that most people
ignore, goes to great lengths to share them with the public.
Cotsen, who is 69 and lives in Los Angeles, is letting the public
view his most treasured artifacts _ Japanese bamboo baskets. The
900 baskets in his collection, which is considered the largest and
most distinguished in private hands, are a type of artifact that is
virtually unknown to all but a small group of experts, even in
Japan, where such objects are seldom exhibited. So Cotsen lent 100
rarities to the Asia Society in Manhattan for ``Bamboo Masterworks:
Japanese Baskets from the Lloyd Cotsen Collection,'' a show on view
through May 30. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

THE HERO AS GANGSTER AND WANDERING JEW  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Mamet has always chosen his heroes with
care, and so it is noteworthy that this playwright and
screenwriter, whose dramas tend to read like projections of his own
smoldering inner battles, has made his latest, distinctly American
hero an alienated street fighter trying to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   He is an immigrant, a criminal angry at being treated like a
criminal, and, perhaps most important for Mamet, he is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   For his first television movie, Mamet has chosen as his subject
the gangster Meyer Lansky and attracted a strong cast that includes
Richard Dreyfuss (as a largely quiet and introspective Lansky),
Eric Roberts, Anthony LaPaglia, Illeana Douglas and Max Perlich.
Most of the typical elements are there _ rubouts, skimming and
double-crosses _ as the movie, directed by John McNaughton, follows
Lansky from his native Poland to the streets of New York in the
early part of the century and finally to Miami Beach in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lansky,'' which will have its premiere on HBO Saturday
night at 8, is a deeply unusual picture. It defies many of the
conventions of its two genres, gangster films and
made-for-television movies. And it is a much more visible search
for identity than Mamet, the author of plays like ``American
Buffalo'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' is used to portraying, even
if that search is concealed within a supposed historical profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a loving movie about a kind of people,'' Mamet said in
a telephone interview from his home near Boston, adding that in
recent years he had become closer to his Jewishness and what, for
him, is its accompanying sense of being a perpetual outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole life,'' he said of Lansky, ``he's trying to build a
life in a world he sees as very, very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mamet's view, Lansky felt wronged, by his government, by
Congress and by society, largely because he was a Jew in an
anti-Semitic country. Although ``Lansky'' shows its title character
involved in murder and as a leader of the Mafia, the portrait is
affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   Lansky's choice of a career, as an operator of illegal casinos,
is shown as about the only rational choice under the rough
conditions in which he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt anti-Semitism is touched on far too little in
American movies,'' said Fred Zollo, executive producer of
``Lansky'' and the producer of numerous Mamet plays and films.
</P>
<P>
   Lansky was troubled by the violence he had experienced, the
movie suggests, but was unapologetic about it, and bitterly
resented the fact that he was singled out for condemnation by
Congress and the police (though he was never convicted of a major
crime) when others who he felt had done worse _ he had Joseph P.
Kennedy and the Bronfman family in mind _ achieved legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   This is, in fact, how Lansky felt, says Brett Ratner, the young
director of ``Rush Hour,'' who grew up in Miami Beach and knew
Lansky well as a boy. Lansky, he added, often complained about his
vilification, which he never seemed to understand or accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he would say is: `What's wrong with me? Why are they
treating me this way?' '' said Ratner, who is currently working on
a book about the gangster, based on his diaries. ``He'd say, `I'm
as much of an American as they are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ratner added: ``He was a very Jewish guy. He loved Yiddish. I
remember I learned one Yiddish song, and he'd always ask me to sing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mamet, all of this _ but particularly Lansky's unwillingness
to accept his government's judgment, his railing against the
identity assigned to him _ made him a fitting emblem of Jewish
identity in America.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time, of course, that Mamet has taken
organized crime and gangsters as his subject. He wrote the
screenplays for ``Hoffa'' and ``The Untouchables.'' But to
Dreyfuss, who acknowledged that all actors loved to play gangsters,
this movie felt different in other ways. ``It's not about a
gangster,'' he said. ``I don't know exactly how to explain it. It
smells of family to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be good reason for that. Mamet made it clear that in
addition to the powerful identification he felt with Lansky's
Jewishness, there was another subtle but personal connection. He
said he had actually seen Lansky on several occasions when, as a
young man, he had been taken on business trips to Miami by his
demanding father, a labor lawyer whose image has dominated many of
his earlier works.
</P>
<P>
   The two frequently ate at a popular Jewish deli, Wolfie's, which
was a favorite of Lansky's in his later years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dead now and rest in peace, but my father would point out
Meyer Lansky,'' said Mamet. ``I was intrigued.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet hinted that because of that connection, ``Lansky'' touched
on his feelings for his own father. In fact, several people
involved in the movie made similar observations, particularly
because of the way Lansky is shown dealing with his own sons,
embracing them and trying to prepare them for life but not being
willing to fully disclose to them who he is.
</P>
<P>
   In one speech, Lansky lies to his son and insists he is a mere
businessman but also emphasizes that his son must learn to ignore
the taunts of his rivals, take strength from their enmity and focus
on what he feels he needs to do to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize too much how familiar this character was to
me,'' said Dreyfuss. ``The speech he gives to his son, I could have
heard that from my father or from my grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   To make his points about family and about Jewishness, Mamet
concedes, he may not have shown absolute fidelity to the historical
personae. ``In the end, I made it up,'' he said. ``I don't know if
it's the way he thought. It's not the Discovery Channel. It's a
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansky's life story is not, on the face of it, great movie
material, although his beginnings were dramatic. He immigrated from
Poland, where he witnessed pogroms and the murder of his
grandfather at the hands of a mob.
</P>
<P>
   His family made it to New York, where he learned to stand up for
himself in the tough training ground of the streets. He committed
his first murder, of a gambling rival, when he was little more than
a boy. His protector was another Jew, Ben Siegel, later called
Bugsy, who was a lifelong friend, until Lansky acquiesced in his
killing at the hands of the mob for failing to make a success of
his Mafia-financed Las Vegas casino.
</P>
<P>
   But Lansky's forte was the business of organized crime rather
than the warfare of a street soldier, and so the movie is largely
the tale of someone who saw himself as a businessman, even if the
business, gambling, was an illegal one.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that point of view, it seems, that almost blocked
``Lansky'' from being made, though. The script, with its unhurried
pace, fractured dialogue and unconventional narrative style,
jumping back and forth in time, was almost dropped by HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet, originally hired in May 1995 to write the script,
delivered it in January 1996. HBO suggested some changes to create
a clearer narrative and had it rewritten, but lost interest in the
project. The script sat on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later the new chairman, Jeff Bewkes, and the new
president of HBO Productions, John Matoian, took another look and
finally gave it the green light last June.
</P>
<P>
   Further changes were proposed, but Mamet essentially ignored
them. Bewkes explained: ``The truth is, he said, `I hear you, but
I'm going to do it this way.' We decided that was O.K.''
</P>
<P>
   And so many distinctive Mamet touches are in the script,
particularly dialogue with battered syntax and messages that are at
best elusive. At one point, Lansky sums up the immigrant experience
this way: ``Time passes. The dust settles. Then it's over and done
with.''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, Lansky defends himself for running illegal
gambling operations by insisting that the government eventually
will get into the gambling, prostitution and drug businesses. ``Do
you believe that?'' Lansky asks. ``Sore throat, chicken soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, near the end, when he is talking to a journalist in
Wolfie's about his life, he concludes: ``Who you are is who you
are, and that's everyone. You want some more coffee?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the answers Mamet supplies are implicit, felt rather
than enunciated. After Lansky has a heart attack and is lying in a
hospital bed, he motions for the nurse to come close. ``I'll tell
you a secret,'' he says. ``I'll tell you a secret.'' Then he drifts
off, the answer withheld.

WORDS TO PROMPT DISDAIN IN LONDON: NEW YORK HIT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe. 
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The special relationship is beginning to look awfully one-sided.
For years, the assumption has been that New York and London enjoyed
a uniquely symbiotic rapport, so that a major success in one city
could be counted on to open _ and be appreciated _ in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ask an English theatergoer of a certain age, and one hears of
the defining impact made in London by the original Broadway
productions (occasionally with their New York leads) of
``Company,'' ``West Side Story'' or even ``Oklahoma!'' Both ``Annie
Get Your Gun'' and ``The Sound of Music'' had longer initial runs
on the West End than they did on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And while British drama of, say, the 1950s could seem stuffy and
class-bound, the American work of the same period was seismically
invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in love with the American theater before I fell in love
with theater as a whole,'' Richard Eyre, the former artistic
director of the Royal National Theater, has said. ``The British
stuff seemed incredibly etiolated, extremely bloodless,'' he
recalled of the playwriting he knew growing up. Whereas with
O'Neill and Tennessee Williams, suddenly, he said, ``drama had
fangs.''
</P>
<P>
   How ironic, then, that the English nowadays regard so much
American drama as toothless and readily bare their own fangs to
dismember many a New York hit. To be sure, Williams, O'Neill and
Arthur Miller are still revered, with Miller joining Sam Shepard,
David Mamet and, occasionally, Stephen Sondheim among a handful of
American writers to enjoy Honorary Englishman status.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the subsequent generations must go it alone, as
must any Shepard-Mamet contemporary _ Terrence McNally, for example
_ who has had the misfortune of arriving in London with a play that
has already had commercial success in New York. More than one West
End producer has remarked that the phrase ``Broadway hit'' seems to
be anathema to London critics.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently prefer to nurture homegrown stars like David
Hare or Tom Stoppard _ or even discover American playwrights like
Tony Kushner or Phyllis Nagy for themselves _ rather than follow a
parade that originated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the American appetite for English work appears only to
intensify over time, as this New York theater season bears out. So
it can be dismaying when the traffic is reversed to find that the
enthusiasm is not.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's enough merely to cite a show's origins, with a
single place name, to speak pejorative volumes. ``You can take a
show out of New York but you cannot take New York out of the
show,'' John Peter in The Sunday Times of London wrote of the West
End opening last May of the American musical ``Rent,'' before
deriding the late Jonathan Larson's ``well-meaning but oppressive
political correctness that sometimes makes you recoil in despair.''
</P>
<P>
   (Peter's review was gentle; three of his colleagues went so far
as to imply, however facetiously, that Larson's death before the
New York production had even opened was a canny career move.)
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the musical ``Chicago,'' currently on Broadway and
in the West End, received glowing notices in London, but that is a
show that portrays Americans as hard-edged and cynical _ everything
the singularly open-hearted ``Rent,'' for all its real flaws, does
not.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of ``The Vagina Monologues,'' the solo piece by Eve
Ensler that the American writer and actress is performing at the
King's Head Theater through March 7, Nick Curtis wrote in The
Evening Standard: ``The tone is an uneasy mixture of the wry and
the wrenching, of sit-down comedy and theater as therapy.'' Then
the dig: ``Oh, and it comes from New York, in case you hadn't
guessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a writer of Edward Albee's eminence isn't necessarily
spared. In London last September, for the world premiere of his
very fine ``Play About the Baby,'' he must have looked on with some
surprise as the British reviews appeared almost uniformly hostile,
while those from American critics were almost uniformly positive.
Given the opprobrium heaped upon him over time back home, Albee
could be forgiven for perhaps anticipating the opposite response.
</P>
<P>
   The more prizes a show has won in the United States _ three
seasons ago, for example, ``Rent'' won both the Pulitzer Prize for
drama and the Tony Award for best musical _ the more that seems to
irk the British.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like huge hoopla and success,'' said Jonathan Kent,
co-artistic director of the Almeida Theater in North London, a
company that has tended to present American plays (``The Play About
the Baby'' and Ellen McLaughlin's ``Tongue of a Bird,'' among them)
before they reach New York. ``When a show comes trailing every
award known to man, we get nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, by contrast, Kent said, ``All success becomes their
success; it becomes universal _ that's what is enlivening about
working there.'' But, he cautioned, referring to the city's
hit-flop mentality, ``that's also what's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the London response to New York hits, whether large
scale or small, can be grudging at best, fierce at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second time I have seen McNally's play,'' Alastair
Macaulay wrote in The Financial Times about the 1997 West End
opening of ``Master Class,'' starring Patti LuPone as Maria Callas,
``and it is the second time its distortion of Callas has made me
shake with rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas de Jongh, in The Evening Standard, dismissed the same
play, which in New York had won a Tony, as ``breathtakingly vacuous
melodrama.'' In the end, ``Master Class'' lasted barely two months
in a city that had always celebrated Callas at least as
ecsatically as New York.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that was the problem. McNally, hardly a local favorite
to begin with, could never hope to recreate a Callas to rival
British memories of the real thing. One has to wonder, though, how
the same text would have been received had it starred a local icon
like Diana Rigg or Maggie Smith and been billed as the work of,
say, Pam Gems, who wrote ``Stanley,'' ``Piaf'' and ``Marlene.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize-winning ``How I Learned to Drive''
fared little better in its London debut last summer at the Donmar
Warehouse, despite the fact that Ms. Vogel has cited Caryl
Churchill and Harold Pinter among her stylistic influences. Calling
the writing ``unintentionally creepy,'' Charles Spencer in The
Daily Telegraph faulted ``that peculiarly American
soft-centeredness, that craven desire not to cause offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is possible to imagine a `feel-good' show about child
abuse, then this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is simply that ``How I Learned to Drive'' had the
misfortune to open not long before the Almeida Theater revival of
Racine's ``Phedre,'' directed by Kent and starring Ms. Rigg. (That
same production traveled last month to the Brooklyn Academy of
Music.)
</P>
<P>
   In England, it seems, incest is stageworthy if it is
neoclassical and rhetorically high-flown; transpose the same
subject to the American South, as enacted by characters with names
like Li'l Bit, and the London critics turn away. By Racinian
standards, Ms. Vogel is unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Jackie'' and ``Sylvia,'' far better not to go there.
Whereas Gip Hoppe's semi-satire about the phenomenon of Jacqueline
Onassis limped along in New York for much of last season, its
London incarnation last fall barely lasted a month, in a city where
shows can stagger on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brinberg, a New York female impersonator, made a far
greater impact as Barbra Streisand in the sellout London run at the
(admittedly tiny) Jermyn Street Theater of his ``Simply Barbra: The
Wedding Tour'' than a hapless Lysette Anthony ever did as Jackie O.
</P>
<P>
   A.R. Gurney's off-broadway hit ``Sylvia,'' meanwhile, might have
been thought to benefit three years ago from the London casting of
Zoe Wanamaker, Broadway's current Electra, as the eponymous dog,
not to mention opening in a nation besotted with pets. But Britons
apparently prefer their pooches to be authentic, not
anthropomorphized into cutesy stage heroines, and the comedy closed
after two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmortem, its London director, Michael Blakemore (``City
of Angels,'' ``Copenhagen''), maintained that Britain is so
consistently fed a journalistic and television news diet of
American sensationalism and violence that it has no frame of
reference for unsensational plays about _ gasp _ well-heeled
people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American white-trash plays, however silly or over the
top, routinely get English raves. The Chicago writer Rebecca
Gilman's recent Royal Court hit, ``The Glory of Living,'' is only
the latest in a line-up that has included Tracy Letts' ``Killer
Joe,'' currently playing in New York, and David Beaird's ``900
Oneonta''; each caters to the image of a grotesque, loutish America
that the English already possess.
</P>
<P>
   None of those three plays arrived in London with any New York
cachet; nor did David Greer's wildly overrated ``Burning Blue,''
about gay Americans in the military, a London critical hit in 1994.
In retrospect, anonymity at home may represent an American writer's
best chances for success here unless he or she can go one better,
as Arthur Miller has for much of his career, and play the
misunderstood martyr card.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought, for instance, that Neil Simon's Broadway
flop, ``Proposals,'' would find serious champions in the English
press in its European premiere last season in the Yorkshire city of
Leeds? The play, wrote Michael Coveney in The Daily Mail at the
time, ``was far too good for Broadway,'' and will be opening in
London in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one recalls Sondheim, during the 1990 National
Theater engagement of ``Sunday in the Park With George,'' being
told at a public discussion that it was a shame he had not been
born English so that he could pursue his career in the protected
environment of London's state-supported theater. Sondheim's deadpan
reply: ``I've enjoyed working on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on why American plays often do not do well in
Britain, the young English director of ``Art,'' Matthew Warchus ,
said, ``I don't think it has totally to do with nationality.''
Warchus, who estimates that a good third of his career has been
devoted to American shows, said: ``It's to do with the level of
enthusiasm generated in the theater. And I don't think London has
nearly as vibrant and enthusiastic a theater culture as New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, there probably would be an instinct to embrace
many different nationalities of imported work as well as homegrown
work. In London, it's hard to work up any real buzz about anything
from our own country, let alone from anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mike Bradwell, artistic director of the small Bush
Theater in West London, imported the production of David Rabe's
``Question of Mercy'' from the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. The
drama, about a doctor's involvement in an assisted suicide for a
man dying of AIDS, received largely negative reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, in The Daily Telegraph, said, ``All the arguments about
mercy killing are duly and tediously rehearsed, in that
sanctimonious, self-congratulatory manner that characterizes
American `issue' plays.'' Bradwell said audiences amounted to less
than 20 percent of capacity. ``There's very little good will toward
American writing,'' he added. ``The response to David's play was
definitely xenophobic.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy for American writers in London, said the
playwright David Hare, who by April will have had three productions
on Broadway this season, and whose directing credits include ``The
Designated Mourner'' by the American dramatist and actor Wallace
Shawn, a longtime friend. (A revival of Shawn's 1985 play ``Aunt
Dan and Lemon'' will open at the Almeida Theater in the spring.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four name American writers,'' Hare said,
``who are on the modern syllabus whose plays will always pack
theaters and will be given a hearing. We are extremely intolerant
for the row immediately below.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why Paul Rudnick and Wendy Wasserstein have
rarely been seen beyond the Greenwich Theater in southeast London,
which has now closed. And why Donald Margulies, Jon Robin Baitz and
John Patrick Shanley, three often produced American dramatists, are
among those who barely raise a flicker of recognition in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly tell them it's unlikely they'll ever get a
production in the West End,'' said one New York agent who handles
several leading American playwrights. ``It's always a great
surprise if anyone in London shows any interest at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the two-way traffic continues. Richard Greenberg's
``Three Days of Rain,'' seen at the Manhattan Theater Club in 1997,
is now in rehearsals for a London debut on March 2 as part of a
monthlong American Imports season at the nonprofit Donmar
Warehouse. Colin Firth and Elizabeth McGovern head a starry cast.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Davies, literary manager of the Donmar and producer of the
American season, called plays like Greenberg's ``such an enormously
unmined area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real one-way traffic of our finest British plays,
particularly to New York,'' she said. ``And I've noticed a lot of
anger among young American writers and theaters that emphasize new
writing there. The chances are that a young British playwright is
going to get a play on there before a homegrown talent. We're
sending all our plays over, but we don't seem to be importing
anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial sector, it is business as usual in a city that
has 40 West End theaters to fill. ``When Pigs Fly,'' the gay
musical revue, and ``Defending the Caveman,'' Rob Becker's musings
on the battle of the sexes, both began commercial runs in London
this past week. In each case they were Anglicized to varying
degrees so as to play down any New York pedigree (both shows had
long runs in New York) _ as if, by contrast, any producer taking a
London hit to New York would deny its prior success.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Kaufman's ``Gross Indecency,'' a critical and popular hit
in New York, will make its London debut next month in what might
seem a classic case of coals-to-Newcastle: an American play about
Oscar Wilde on the West End.
</P>
<P>
   Further ahead, surely no show will make a London noise this year
comparable to that of ``The Lion King,'' which will have its local
premiere at the Lyceum Theater on Oct. 19. And there have been as
many as a dozen requests to bring to London the Off Broadway play
``Wit,'' about an English professor and Donne scholar who is dying
of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The New York producers of the play may well present it
themselves next season in London, retaining, one hopes, its current
lead, Kathleen Chalfant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like this play is not so American,'' said one of the
co-producers, Bernard Telsey, peering into his crystal ball. If
Margaret Edson's play does reach London, it will be in the same
city that two decades ago embraced _ and eventually exported _ a
far cruder deathbed drama, ``Whose Life Is It, Anyway?'' by Brian
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe because it's about life and death,'' Telsey said of
``Wit,'' ``things like nationality really don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But in England maybe they do.

MARKET PLACE: SOME DETECTED WARNING SIGNS ON DELL'S SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Niles wants to make one thing perfectly clear: his nephew
does not work at Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Niles, who follows Dell and other computer companies for
BancBoston Robertson Stephens, made a prescient call last week on
Dell's shares. That prompted a round of rumors Wednesday on Wall
Street that Niles had a nephew or other informant inside Dell, the
company that surprised most stock analysts a day earlier by
reporting revenue short of their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Niles, though, told his firm's clients Friday that Dell's sales
had slowed and that the company was unlikely to meet estimates for
growth in sales. Since last Thursday, when Dell shares closed at
$101.875, they have lost nearly 20 percent of their value.
Wednesday, the stock fell $7.1875 to close at $81.5625, as 112
million shares traded, the third-largest volume for a Nasdaq stock
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Dell had beaten analysts' predictions of
revenue and profit growth every quarter for at least two years.
Niles' suggestion that the company would fail to do so now, when
the economy is strong and everyone seems to want to connect to the
Internet, was scoffed at by several institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund managers and other financial professionals who have
reaped big profits from Dell stock did not want to hear that the
party might be over.
</P>
<P>
   But Niles says that plenty of warning signs were there to be
found for anyone who did a little digging. ``Everybody thought they
would do the usual job of beating the Street's profit estimates by
a penny and that revenues would come in a little better than the
$5.4- to $5.6-billion estimates,'' he said in an interview
Wednesday. ``I think people got lazy. They said, `We know Dell, and
they are telling us that everything is fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``doing the usual checks'' with firms that track personal
computer sales, Niles said he determined that Dell's fourth-quarter
sales would grow only to $5.2 billion, well below those estimates.
When a company does not meet sales estimates, it frequently falls
short of profit projections, as well. But Niles predicted that
would not be the case with Dell. Better expense control and good
profit margins would put the company's earnings right on target, he
told investors last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Dell reported Tuesday that it earned 31 cents a share on
$5.173 billion in sales, it was as if the company was reading
directly off Niles' research report.
</P>
<P>
   He said his ``usual checks'' were with several market-data firms
that publish estimates on quarterly shipments of personal
computers. Because Dell's fiscal fourth quarter ended in January, a
month later than most other companies in the industry, Niles said
he took the other companies' already reported results and saw that
the portion of the market that was left for Dell was less that what
Wall Street was predicting.
</P>
<P>
   And he insists that no one at Dell tipped him off. Since his
report came out on Friday, ``I still haven't gotten a call from
Michael Dell or Tom Meredith,'' Dell's chief financial officer, he
said. Nor, he said, has he been contacted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission or other market regulators charged with making
sure that corporate earnings information is disseminated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, as is its common practice, would neither confirm or
deny that it had looked into the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Niles was not the only Wall Street analyst to foreshadow some
disappointment in Dell's results. Richard Gardner of Salomon Smith
Barney also made cautionary comments Friday, saying that Compaq
Computer was cutting into Dell's business.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Niles who nailed many of the details _ including that
Dell's stock would probably fall to about $80 in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Even after its big decline Wednesday, Dell remains the
best-performing issue in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
since the beginning of the 1990s, with a gain of 71,000 percent _
twice that of the next-best performer, EMC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The key question for analysts and investors is whether its
profit will continue to grow at a rate that will justify what
remains a high stock price. Dell stock is trading at 55 times what
analysts expect the company to earn this year, more than double the
overall market's valuation. It reached its closing high Feb. 2, at
$108.625.
</P>
<P>
   Niles said that ``Dell may head lower than I originally
thought.'' Part of the problem, he said, is that Dell has warned
that it will put new emphasis on the market for computers costing
less than $1,000, a low-margin business that analysts fear will
hurt the company's rich profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Compaq and others are cutting into Dell's most
profitable lines, including big computer systems that companies use
to power their Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Niles and others continued cause to worry. Among them
is William H. Miller III, who oversees the Legg Mason Value Trust
and whose holdings of Dell since 1996 have helped his fund beat the
S&AMP;P 500 several years running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell's P/E is on a slow glide path down,'' Miller said
Wednesday. He said the company still had a competitive advantage
that could last as long as 10 years, during which its returns on
capital and earnings growth could be above average. The trouble,
Miller added, is that investors had been expecting that advantage
to last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dell's stock here in the low '80s, it looks fairly valued
in the near term,'' he said. And if the stock falls to the
mid-'50s, that would present an opportunity for conservative
investors to start buying again.
</P>
<P>
   Niles is unsure about the short-term outlook. ``From wherever
the stock bottoms out, it will do better than 95 percent of the
stocks on Nasdaq over the next two to three years,'' he said. ``But
that bottom could be at $80, $70, $60 or $50. Any one of those
numbers makes sense depending what price-earnings multiple you are
willing to put on the stock.''

   STOCKS ARE DRAGGED DOWN BY HIGH-TECHNOLOGY SHARES
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices Wednesday fell sharply, pulled down by software and
computer companies, which fell in the wake of weaker-than-expected
sales from Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest declines of the session were recorded by stocks in
the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 64.96 points, or 2.8

   LABOR BALANCE SHIFTING IN GERMANY
</P>
<P>
   Although labor leaders in Germany have accepted negligible wage
increases for workers over the last three years and made big
concessions on extra pay for overtime and on weekend work, the
balance of power may be shifting as the nation's biggest union
edges closer to an all-out strike against manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE SHAKE-UP SEEN AT NEC
</P>
<P>
   NEC of Japan, one of the world's largest makers of computer
chips, may be poised for a further board room shake-up less than
four months after the company forced its prominent chairman out in
the wake of a military-procurement scandal.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN AIRLINES BILLS UNION
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines presented its bill for damages to a U.S.
District Court judge in Dallas, contending that its revenues fell
$58.7 million short of projections while the airline's pilots
continued their sickout in defiance of the judge's order. The
pilots' union, which has already put $10 million on deposit with
the court, questioned the accounting and asked for three months to
analyze it. The judge gave the union until April 12.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HOMES RISES
</P>
<P>
   New-home construction starts rose in January at the fastest pace
in 12 years, bolstered by strong gains in the South and West, and
factory production increased for the fourth month, federal reports
showed.
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY CENTRAL CHOOSES NEW CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Ending a closely watched talent search, the Comedy Central cable
channel has decided to name Larry Divney, an advertising executive
at the channel, as president and chief executive, people close to
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will move more than 200 of its employees, including most of
its top management, from New York to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ODD ALLIANCE AT MICROSOFT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive of Microsoft, Brad Chase, reported in federal
court that America Online had, at least for now, renewed its
contract to equip its users with Microsoft's browser _ even though
it is buying Netscape Communications, Microsoft's main competitor
in the browser field. Chase added that he thought that America
Online had chosen to stick with Microsoft for the time being in
part because the company wanted to influence the outcome of the
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft executive denied that the company had both
threatened its main rival in the Internet software business and
made it an illegal offer to divide the market.

   BP AMOCO TO SPEED COST-CUTTING
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco said that it would accelerate its cost-cutting plan and

EDWARDS' INJURY KEEPS AFC EAST IN THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the off-season for professional football, but
the AFC East, the division that sent four teams to the playoffs
last season, continues to make news.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development comes out of New England, where the
Patriots seem doomed to continue to feel the aftereffects of Bill
Parcells' defection to the Jets two years ago. But in this
instance, Parcells did not even do anything.
</P>
<P>
   But he did a year ago, when Parcells lured away Curtis Martin,
the Patriots' outstanding running back, with a big free-agent
offer. The Patriots responded by drafting Robert Edwards as their
No. 1 pick in the 1998 draft, hoping the rookie out of Georgia
could replace Martin.
</P>
<P>
   And to a considerable extent, he did, gaining 1,115 yards on 291
carries and scoring nine touchdowns. But now he is lost for 1999,
and perhaps for good because of a freakish knee injury incurred
during a rookie flag-football game on the beach at Waikiki during
Pro Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   After four hours of surgery on Tuesday, when surgeons discovered
he had injuries to all four ligaments in his left knee as well as
nerve damage, the Patriots' orthopedist, Bertram Zarins, said he
was ``pessimistic'' that Edwards would play again.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' lawyer and agent, Allan J. Wade, did not quite agree
with that assessment, saying Wednesday that after speaking with
Zarins he had the impression that the serious nerve damage in the
lower leg _ which now prevents feeling _ can heal over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerve was not severed,'' Wade said, ``and that's a good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Patriots will have to do without Edwards. And right
now, their No. 2 runner is Sedric Shaw, who carried all of 48 times
last season.
</P>
<P>
   An official with knowledge of the league's workings suggested
that the Patriots may demand an extra draft choice from the NFL to
compensate for losing Edwards. The beach game was sponsored by the
league's properties division.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Patriots get that extra pick or not, the Patriots,
who were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, will
obviously have to go shopping for another running back. And
interestingly, they happen to have an extra first-round pick in
this year's draft, the last draft choice remaining from the
compensation package the Jets had to give the Patriots when
Parcells switched sides.
</P>
<P>
   So New England will have its own first-round pick (No. 20) as
well as the Jets' No. 28. With those picks they will not get anyone
like running back Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from
Texas. But they could get lucky and find someone as good as
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The contractual ramifications of Edwards' injury remain unclear.
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Wednesday ordered the league to
begin a review of the complicated affair, including a look at the
event that caused the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Players in the actual Pro Bowl game are protected in case of
injury; they receive the next season's salary if they cannot play
as a result of being hurt in the game. But the flag-football game
for rookies, Wade said, ``is a hybrid.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade contended that the Patriots are responsible for paying
Edwards because he was fulfilling the terms of his contract by
``promoting football.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards originally signed a five-year, $5.75 million contract
with the Patriots that included a $2 million bonus. He received $1
million of that bonus up front and will receive the other half
regardless of whether he plays again, said Robert Kraft, the
Patriots' owner.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether the Patriots would be willing to pay
anything beyond that to Edwards, whose contract, like almost all
other players, is not guaranteed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wade said that contrary to published reports, he was not aware
of any private insurance policy that Edwards has that would pay his
salary while he was out with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the injury to Edwards is one more unusual
development in a division that last season saw Vinny Testaverde and
Doug Flutie surprisingly emerge as top quarterbacks with the Jets
and the Buffalo Bills, and saw Miami's Jimmy Johnson add to all the
intense feelings within the division by stomping on a Flutie Flakes
cereal box after the Dolphins just held off the Bills in a
first-round playoff game.

   Johnson and Flutie will go at it twice next season. And so will
Parcells and the Patriots, who will not have Edwards in the
backfield.  &QL;

PHARMANEX VICTORIOUS IN FIGHT OVER SUPPLEMENT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- In a major win for the nutritional
supplements industry, a federal judge has ruled in favor of
supplements maker Pharmanex Inc. in its two-year legal battle with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmanex case centered on whether a cholesterol-lowering
substance that the Simi Valley company markets under the name
Cholestin is a drug or a dietary supplement. Because it contains
the same active ingredient as a prescription medicine sold by drug
giant Merck &AMP; Co., the FDA argued it is a drug, subject to strict
government approval and regulation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Pharmanex attorneys argued that because the substance is
naturally occurring -- Cholestin is harvested from a red yeast
found on certain kinds of rice -- it is merely a supplement, a
product category virtually unregulated by the FDA under the 1994
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling late Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Dale
Kimball agreed with Pharmanex, permanently lifting a ban ordered by
the FDA last May on Pharmanex imports of Cholestin ingredients from
its Chinese supplier. Kimball said Cholestin clearly meets the
dietary-supplement definition as a product other than tobacco
intended to supplement the diet.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling allows Pharmanex to continue importing the
red yeast rice to its Farmington, Utah, factory where it produces
90,000 capsules of Cholestin a day. Pharmanex was purchased last
October by Nu Skin Enterprises, based in Provo, Utah, one of the
nation's largest direct marketers of health and beauty aids.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the case will have broad implications for the $5
billion-per-year nutritional supplements industry, which
increasingly markets products to consumers for conditions, ranging
from high cholesterol to impotence, previously considered the sole
domain of prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is highly significant because it reconfirms that
naturally occurring substances sold off the shelf are not drugs,''
said analyst Patricia Negron at Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill Inc.
``Companies like Merck and other large pharmaceutical entities with
longstanding relationships with the FDA are threatened by these
kinds of products and have used their muscle to prevent them being
sold. This is a very important milestone for the (supplements)
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Negron predicted the ruling will further motivate drug companies
to establish their own supplement lines to augment their
prescription drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmanex President Bill McGlashin said the company was pleased
with the judge's ruling, adding that intense study by Pharmanex or
another dietary supplements maker, to identify the key ingredient
of a naturally occurring product, does not ``transform (the
product) into a drug.''

JUDGE'S LIVE-ACTION `OFFICE SPACE' LOOKS A BIT VACANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 STARS 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cross the sardonic workplace of ``Dilbert'' with
the good-ol'-boy sensibility of ``King of the Hill,'' and you've
got ``Office Space,'' animator Mike Judge's debut as a live-action
feature writer and director. It sounds promising enough, but
unfortunately this sporadically funny film has about as much plot
as a three-panel ``Dilbert'' cartoon strip and runs long even at
its scant 89 minutes. It does contain a ``cornhole'' reference
though, which should at least satisfy Judge's ``Beavis and
Butt-head'' fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' begins promisingly enough with several inspired
sketches that wickedly spoof cubicle culture. We follow Peter
Gibbons (Ron Livingston) slowly inching along the freeway, not even
able to keep pace with an old man using a walker. Nothing improves
once he arrives. His smarmy boss (a pitch-perfect creature from
hell as played by Gary Cole) is obsessed with memos and meetings
but not with inspiring the troops. And Peter needs inspiration in
the worst way.
</P>
<P>
   Recoiling from his grim, gray workplace, Peter visits a
hypnotherapist who induces a state of blissed-out nirvana and then
keels over before he can snap Peter out of it.
</P>
<P>
   So while co-workers Michael Bolton (David Herman, playing a
character who is not the singer, but Judge gets plenty of mileage
out of the name) and Samir (Ajay Naidu) obsess at their computer
workstations, Peter sleeps late, arrives for work when he feels
like it and ends up getting promoted for his defiance by a couple
of know-nothing consultants. (``He's got `upper management' written
all over him,'' one of them notes.)
</P>
<P>
   Judge, known best for creating ``Beavis and Butt-head,'' has a
sharp eye for the minor annoyances of the everyday work world. But
he doesn't really have enough material for a movie here. At the
halfway point, ``Office Space'' turns into a clunky caper movie and
wobbles to a predictable finale involving a disgruntled office
worker (Stephen Root) that you can see coming from the moment the
character is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is likable enough as Peter, but it's the supporting
actors _ Cole and Root _ who register most strongly. Diedrich Bader
also has some funny moments as Peter's redneck neighbor, the kind
of guy who, when asked what he would do with $1 million, answers:
``Two chicks at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of chicks, Jennifer Aniston shows up in a few scenes as
a waitress working at a TGI Friday-style restaurant (she's required
to wear at least 15 pieces of ``flair,'' which includes mostly
oversize buttons). It's a thinly drawn role, good mostly for its
visual gags. As such, it's indicative of ``Office Space'' as a
whole _ lots of flair, little substance.

<P>
   BERLIN _ Israeli guards opened fire on Wednesday on dozens of
Kurds trying to occupy the Israeli Consulate here, killing three
people and wounding 16 in the worst violence since Europewide
protests erupted over the capture of a rebel Kurdish leader on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shooting began after about 55 Kurds tried to
enter the consulate in a tranquil Berlin suburb. The Kurds
apparently chose their target in response to rumors that the
Israeli secret service, Mossad, had played a role in Turkey's
capture of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in Tel Aviv
on Wednesday that the guards had fired in self-defense after Kurds
brandishing hammers and clubs entered the Berlin consulate. He
denied any Israeli role in Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not cooperate with any element in Ocalan's capture,''
Netanyahu said. ``We have to make this clear and emphasize this
because this is the reality and this is the truth.'' Israel, which
has a security cooperation agreement with Turkey, was the object of
``false accusations,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the shootings, blood from the wounded lay
spattered on freshly fallen snow in a wide area around the Israeli
consulate. Police officers had encircled two groups of shivering
Kurds, numbering about 30 in all, and refused to let reporters
speak to them on the grounds that they were ``under arrest.'' The
entire area was cordoned off, and helicopters circled over the
four-story consulate building near the Grunewald, a forest in the
western part of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The consul, Miriam Shomrat, was not in the building, but another
Israeli woman was briefly held by the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, whose followers have waged a long separatist war in
southeastern Turkey in which more than 30,000 people have died, was
seized in Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday in circumstances that remain
murky. Turkish security agents then flew him to Turkey where he
faces a possible death sentence on charges including treason and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of protests, embassies and consulates in
London, Zurich and Bern remained occupied by Kurds, and new
demonstrations sprang up in places that included a U.N. office in
Geneva and offices in Canada and Australia. Protests initially
focused on Kenyan and Greek missions in Europe because Ocalan was
arrested after leaving the Greek embassy in Nairobi, which
apparently led many to believe he had been betrayed by the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey did not dispel or confirm
any rumors. ``In the interest of not disturbing those parties who
took part in this operation,'' he told one interviewer, ``I will
use a local expression and say, `Let us eat the grape and not ask
where it came from.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television showed film on Wednesday of Ocalan being led
onto a small plane, handcuffed and blindfolded. After being
handcuffed to a seat, his blindfold was removed, revealing his
sweat-drenched face. Later an unsteady and apparently drowsy Ocalan
was shown being led to a bed as commandos jubilantly congratulated
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The swift violence of the Israeli response stood in sharp
contrast to the restraint of other embassies. ``Our people have
standing orders to prevent, with force if necessary, including by
opening fire, any attempt to take hostages and to defend
themselves,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   Avigdor Kahlani, the Israeli minister of public security, said
there were three Israeli guards at the consulate and accused German
authorities of exposing them through incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were supposed to do the work from Germany didn't do
their job,'' he said. ``The guards fired first in the air and then
fired to hit in order to save themselves and defend the
consulate.''
</P>
<P>
   A German police spokesman, Norbert Gunckel, said there were two
German police officers outside the consulate at the time the
protest began. He did not explain why protection was so light or
comment on the response of the two officers. ``There was a clash,
and several shots were fired,'' Gunckel said, but he declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   All Israeli embassies in Europe were ordered closed for the day,
and the United States urged Americans abroad to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the Kurdish protesters had no guns. Lukas
Billinski, who was walking his dog in the area, said he heard nine
shots inside the consulate building, followed by five more a little
later.
</P>
<P>
   There is intense debate in Germany over the large number of
foreigners here, and the violence on Thursday seemed certain to
feed a growing uneasiness. Gerhard Schroeder, the chancellor, said
after the shooting that Kurds who did not respect the law would be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those living here do not respect the law, they will have to
leave the country,'' Schroeder, a Social Democrat, said in a
statement reminiscent of the position of the Christian Democratic
government he replaced three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several German cities _ including Bonn, Leipzig, Stuttgart,
Frankfurt and Cologne _ were hit by Kurdish protests on Tuesday.
These incidents abated on Wednesday, but about 15 Kurds broke into
the offices of the Social Democratic Party in Hamburg, taking a
staff member hostage. A mosque and a Turkish restaurant in Hamburg
were also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No constitutional state can just wait and watch a civil war
being implanted into its midst by a foreign minority,'' declared an
editorial in the conservative newspaper Die Welt. ``This experience
comes in time to give us a lesson in the political naivete of an
undifferentiated citizenship law.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500,000 Kurds and more than 2 million Turks live in
Germany, by far the largest such populations in Europe. Schroeder
has proposed new legislation that would make it easier for them and
other foreigners to become German citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, most of the protests against more than 20
Greek and Kenyan missions ended. But in London, Kurds inside the
Greek embassy said they were on hunger strike and would set
themselves on fire if the police stormed the building.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, about 60 protesters continued to hold a
policeman at the Greek Consulate in Zurich, and the Greek Embassy
in Bern remained occupied by Kurds. In Sydney and Melbourne,
Australia, demonstrators and police officers clashed and 65 Kurds
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 Kurds today forced their way into the Geneva
headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
and left about three hours later after a spokesman for the agency
read a statement saying that the United Nations should send a
mission to examine the plight of the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa about 200 Kurdish protesters rushed a police barricade
in front of the Turkish Embassy, hurling rocks, snowballs, ice and
homemade gasoline bombs and burning Greek and United States flags.
The police retaliated with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20 million Kurds worldwide, and many of
those living in Turkey and neighboring countries have suffered
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan has used violent guerrilla methods over the last 14 years
to pursue a goal of Kurdish self-rule and civil rights in Turkey.
He has been met with a violent Turkish response, including
documented torture of Kurdish guerrilla suspects and secret trials
by state security courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bulent Ecevit, the Turkish prime minister, said on Wednesday
that Ocalan, who was being held in a prison on Imraili island in
the Sea of Marmara, would be given a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups, including Amnesty International,
expressed concerns over Ocalan's fate, and Ocalan's lawyers were
not allowed to enter Turkey on Wednesday after traveling from the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ocalan was first arrested in Italy last year, European
governments have been at a loss as to what to do, torn between
their rejection of the Kurdish movement's methods and their
abhorrence of the Turkish government's frequent flouting of human
rights in fighting the Kurds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

   nn
</P>
<P>
   The result has been confusion and buck passing. ``The reality is
that the Kurds are a nation, the Kurdish Workers Party is a party,
and the European Union is neither one nor the other,'' wrote Boris
Bianchieri, a former Italian diplomat, in the Turin daily La
Stampa. ``Maybe the Kurdish problem is insoluble. But Europe has
neither the courage to face up to it nor to deny its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurds are not recognized as a minority in Turkey, a status that
would give them the right to teach in their own language. Turkish
sensitivity to the issue is extreme. One factor in the discussion
of possible independence for the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo has
been the fear of opening a Pandora's box in which Kurdish demands
for a state would figure prominently, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the United States had expressed quiet
support for Ocalan's arrest and his handover to Turkey, a pivotal
NATO ally and an important base for American air patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish daily Yeni Yuzyil said on Thursday that Washington
had helped the Turkish government seize Ocalan in return for its
rejection of Iraqi demands to end American use of Turkish bases for
air missions over Iraq. But the Clinton administration has denied
any direct involvement in his arrest in Kenya.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The early, balmy days of spring training are
supposed to be about hopes and dreams, especially for a team that
won 125 games and a World Series championship last year. The
same-look Yankees have obvious reasons to believe they can win the
Series once again. More than any team, New York's prospects are
more realistic than they are hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   But Darryl Strawberry descended upon this relaxed atmosphere
Wednesday and stoically reminded everyone that not even baseball
can hide the gloomy aspects of life. Strawberry was here six days
earlier than he had to be to meet with doctors and schedule his
weekly chemotherapy sessions while he is trying to resume his
baseball career. He is still fighting colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So as a robust Strawberry stood inside the clubhouse at the
minor-league complex, with minor-leaguers peeking at this real,
live Yankee, he initially spoke hopefully and then spoke honestly
about an uncertain future. Strawberry has been around cancer
patients for four months, and he has seen what the disease does. He
called himself lucky, but not cured.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 minutes that seemed like 15 hours, Strawberry spoke about
how cancer can demoralize people and make them feel lifeless. He
talked about winning the open left-field job with the Yankees, but
he also turned somber while discussing the possibility that he
could someday die from cancer. It was not the sort of emotional
outpouring normally associated with this serene baseball setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what is said and no matter what the percentages are,
I look it as a day-to-day thing that I'm surviving,'' Strawberry
said. ``As a survivor, so far to this point, I can carry the
message to others who are suffering from the disease and give them
hope. You can't give up. Giving up is the easy way out. I've seen
many patients who suffered with what I've suffered with and have no
hope. If I walked around with no hope, it wouldn't encourage
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, minutes later, Strawberry veered from encouraging to
eye-opening. While finishing a rambling answer about what doctors
have said about his progress, Strawberry speculated about what
might happen if the cancer went into remission and returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cancer came back, I'd be able to handle it much better
than I probably ever would because I've been through it before,''
Strawberry said. ``It won't be a surprise. It will be like, `Well,
if it's terminal and I'm going to die from it, I'm going to fight
it until the end.' That's the only way I'm going to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, whose weight is up to 222 from a low of 185 and who
flashed biceps that looked like bowling pins, said doctors told him
he has made great strides and should be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who is expected to continue treatments until the end
of April, did not discuss the fact that the cancer had spread to 1
of 36 lymph nodes removed from his abdomen during surgery last Oct.
3.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer experts not associated with Strawberry's case said the
finding reduced the prospects of a five-year cure from the roughly
90 percent that could have been anticipated if the cancer had not
spread. These experts said the odds of long-term survival seemed to
be in Strawberry's favor, but they gave disparate figures, ranging
from 35 percent to 75 percent, for the prospect of the 36-year-old
being cured in five years. The figures were based on studies of
patients with colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us make it, some don't,'' Strawberry said. ``But the
majority of us don't make it. That's why it's so important that we
find a cure, because if we don't, more people are going to die than
survive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With a condition that will cause him to have two types of
chemotherapy pumped intravenously into him for 45 minutes every
Friday for the next 10 weeks, can Strawberry play baseball?
Strawberry said he has had no side effects from chemotherapy. With
Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer pushing for time in left
field, can Strawberry, even if he is healthy, make the opening day
roster?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying yes,'' said Joe Torre, who also called Strawberry
the biggest question mark on the team. ``He's very enthusiastic
about it. He feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever an optimist, Strawberry said: ``I don't have any concerns
about my health and ability to play. It might be a concern to
others. I don't think any of them can judge me until they see me
perform and see where I'm at mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as Strawberry spoke about mental toughness on the
eve of what would be his 16th season in a turbulent career, he
stressed that conquering cancer is tougher than conquering
substance abuse, which he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot, but I've never felt so bad as when I
was cut open right down the middle of my gut,'' Strawberry said.
``Having to have surgery where they go in, you have a tumor pulled
out of you and they just have to move everything inside of you.
It's a week and a half before things start to work inside you.
That's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Strawberry discussed his cancer, baseball seemed like a
far-away notion. Still, Strawberry was feisty enough to declare
that he does not care if the Yankees bring in 10 left fielders to
compete against him and, although his preference is to remain with
them, he considers the spring a showcase if New York no longer
wants him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what I've been through, I can't do nothing but have
fun,'' Strawberry said. ``I was in the hospital in New York. I
could barely walk. I couldn't eat. I went home and started chemo
and had another surgery in January. So this is gravy, just being
able to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Between visiting with some of his teammates, setting his
chemotherapy schedule and insisting that he will be able to play in
two months, Strawberry, a born-again Christian, mostly talked like
a man who expects to defeat cancer. But he also talked like a man
who realizes the serious battle is not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, we're all going to die,'' Strawberry said. ``We just
don't know what it's going to be from. I hate to say this, but
cancer is not a way for anybody to die. But it is a common thing
that people die from every day. Just hope you don't have to suffer
long if you're going to die from it because it's deadly.''

HIGH SCHOOL SATIRE NIPS RATHER THAN BITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No film genre needs a black comic lampoon like the
high school movie does. Superficial, prom-obsessed pictures are a
drug on the market right now. They can be made cheaply, and don't
require much talent either, to profitably pander to young audiences
that apparently can't get enough idealized representations of
themselves, no matter how lame or unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker,'' sad to say, is not the vicious swat of a satire
this cycle deserves. It's spirit is in the right, mean place, but
the movie's exaggerated teen archetypes are as transparent as the
sweeter films' straight-A quarterbacks and Cinderella shy girls.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that newly minted writer-director Darren Stein
(whose first movie, ``Sparkler,'' is scheduled for release next
month) has a sense of satire that veers more toward the outre than
the outrageous. Many of the apparent jokes here are kind of
interesting, but only because they make you wonder why somebody
thought they'd be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Take the main idea, if you will. Three of the most popular girls
at Ronald Reagan High School kidnap a fourth as a birthday prank,
toss her into the trunk of a car and drive to a Denny's, where
they'll presumably perform the humiliating ritual of making her eat
pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the buddies gagged their victim with a jawbreaker
and duct tape, the big ball of candy slipped down her windpipe, and
when the trunk is opened, she's dead. Courtney, the sadistic leader
of the clique (played with lip-smacking amorality by the future
Mrs. Marilyn Manson, Rose McGowan), quickly hatches an elaborate
scheme to paint the dead girl as a rough-sex addict who was
murdered by some sleazy pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Of Courtney's compatriots, Marcie (Julie Benz) will go along
with anything to stay in the power group, while Julie (``Urban
Legend's'' Rebecca Gayheart) gets pangs of conscience. Unattractive
dweeb girl Fern (Judy Evans Greer), who worshiped the dead girl
from afar, stumbles onto the conspiracy but is bought off by
Courtney's promise/threat to make her over into a teen queen if she
keeps her mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of Detective, um, Vera Cruz (Pam
Greer), Courtney's little deception moves along swimmingly. But
then that traitor Julie conspires to embarrass her ex-friend at the
prom ... Which, if successful, would of course be a fate worse than
death.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly ``Heathers,'' but mighty derivative of it, ``Jawbreaker''
gets whatever juice it can claim from McGowan. The girl doesn't
flinch from the vilest, cattiest, pettiest behavior. Indeed, she
revels in cartoon wickedness; her sheer glee at exploring just how
perverse she can get in what is, in the end, a mainstream youth
comedy is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Stein gussies things up in bright candy colors, fun fashion
atrocities, quirky pop-thrash music and fringe culture cameos (Hey,
isn't that the guy from ``Taxi'' no one remembers? Wow, Marilyn
Manson looks like a chemistry major without his makeup!). None of
it gives the movie narrative energy or a consistent comic tone. If
anything, it plays like a disjointed, hyper-real fever dream of
what bad girls are like but really aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' is not as dumb as your average high school movie.
But it's still bubble gum noir, an awkward blend if there ever was
one.!end! &QL;

DOROTHEA ZACK HANLE, EDITOR AND WRITER ABOUT FINE COOKING, DIES AT
83 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   N.J., Pa., Texas)   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothea Zack Hanle, a longtime editor at Bon Appetit, a
cookbook writer and one of the founders of Les Dames d'Escoffier,
an international women's organization that promotes fine dining and
wine, died Tuesday at the home of her son, Alan, in North
Brunswick, N.J. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan and Ship Bottom,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanle was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Ship Bottom,
where her father, Richard A. Zachariae, was a real estate agent.
Throughout her life, she was called Zack.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., and Barnard
College, she was hired by Mademoiselle, where she wrote on a wide
range of subjects. Dell Publishing took note of her flair for
dispensing useful advice and hired her as editor in chief of its
special-projects division. At Dell, she wrote and edited more than
65 pocket-size how-to handbooks, and in 1964, under the name
Dorothea Zack Hanle, wrote the book ``The Hairdo Handbook: A
Complete Guide to Hair Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, CBS Publications wooed her to edit a new publication,
Epicure, but she remained at Dell, editing the first issue of
Epicure under the pen name Carter Chase. She then left Dell and
edited Epicure for two years under her own name, and later edited
another CBS magazine, Everywoman's, which competed with Family
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 she joined the staff of Bon Appetit, where she created
several columns and features, including ``The Bon Vivant,''
``Entertaining With . . .'' and ``Profiles in Cooking.'' According
to Tanya W. Steel, a senior editor for the magazine, her byline
appeared more often than that of any other writer.
</P>
<P>
   She was Bon Appetit's New York editor until 1990, when she was
named an editor at large. From 1997 until her death she was a
consultant to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Her books include ``The Surfer's Handbook'' (1968), ``Cooking
With Flowers'' (1971) and ``Cooking Wild Game'' (1974). With Martin
Herz, she wrote a children's cookbook, ``The Golden Ladle'' (1945).
She also wrote books on gardening, diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Ms. Hanle was honored by the James Beard Foundation at
its first annual Editor's Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her son; a daughter, Jennifer Malahowski of
Austin, Texas, and three grandchildren.

GARY JENNINGS, AUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLER `AZTEC'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.J., Texas, Miss., Mexico)  By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Jennings, a prolific writer whose books included the
best-selling novel ``Aztec,'' about the Aztec war against the
Spanish conquistadors, died on Saturday at his home in Pompton
Lakes, N.J. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his brother, Hiram.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' novels were mostly sprawling historical works,
sometimes reaching 500,000 words, packed with research, violence,
braggadocio and vivid sex scenes. They usually revolved around a
picaresque central character who comes of age at a crucial historic
moment. In addition to his nine novels, most of them for adults,
one written under the pseudonym Gabriel Quyth, he explored
linguistics in ``The World of Words: The Personalities of
Language,'' and wrote 10 nonfiction books for younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1928 in Buena Vista, Va., the son of a printer.
For all his love of research, Jennings was self-taught and never
went to college. He studied at the Art Students League in New York
and worked as a commercial artist and as a newspaper reporter. He
was also managing editor of two men's magazines, Dude and Gent.
During the Korean War, he served as a war correspondent for the
Army, and was awarded a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings married and divorced three times. In addition to his
brother, of Flora, Miss., he is survived by a son from his first
marriage, Jesse, of Spring, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   His first big publishing success came with ``Aztec,'' published
in 1980. The novel is narrated by Mixtli, or Dark Cloud, an Aztec
Indian referred to as ``an Aeolus with an inexhaustible bag of
wind'' who reminisces about his life as a merchant, warrior and
diplomat during the time of Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   To write the book, Jennings lived for 12 years in Mexico. ``I
learned to interpret the ancient pictograph codices and read
Nahuatl, the Aztec language,'' he told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In his review in The Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called
``Aztec'' ``a dazzling and hypnotic historical novel.'' In one
scene, Jennings described a glorious Aztec city, Tenochtitlan, and
its buildings: ``Yellow, white, red, jacinth, all the various
colors of flame _ here and there a green or blue one, where some
temple's altar fire had been sprinkled with salt or copper filings.
Every one of those shining beads and clusters and bands of light
shone twice, each having its brilliant reflection in the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City was built on Tenochtitlan's ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, when it came to describing his characters,
critics felt that Jennings fell short. Gerald Jonas, reviewing
``Aztec'' in The New York Times Book Review, said that Jennings'
``vacillating Motecuzoma,'' or Montezuma, as the conquering
Spaniards called him, had ``all the tragic dimensions of a losing
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings took pride in the accuracy of his historical research
on everything from Marco Polo's journeys for his novel ``The
Journeyer'' (1984), to 19th-century circus life in the novel
``Spangle'' (1987), for which he traveled with nine different
circuses. In ``Raptor'' (1992), he described a Goth's adventures
during the days of the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   His last novel, ``Aztec Autumn'' (1997), was a sequel to
``Aztec.'' At the time of his death, said Jennings' literary agent,
Gene Winick, he was working on a historical novel set in Babylon,
and, with his nephew Marc, on an opera based on the life of the
labor organizer Joe Hill.

WILLIAM KESSEN, 74, A PROFESSOR   AND EXPERT ON CHILD PSYCHOLOGY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mo., Mass., Md., Fla.)  By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William Kessen, a developmental psychologist whose research,
theoretical contributions and teaching at Yale University helped
shape the thinking of a generation of child psychologists, died on
Saturday at a hospital in New Haven. He was 74 and lived in
Branford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, Kessen conducted classic studies on
visual perception, activity level and other aspects of the first
years of life, and made fundamental contributions to the
understanding of how infants perceive and make sense of the world.
Later in his career he did research in many other areas of child
development, including problem solving, and studied the later
19th-century emergence of professional psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He was also influential as a theorist. In ``The Language of
Psychology'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1959), a book he edited with the
psychologist Dr. George Mandler, Kessen addressed fundamental
problems in psychology that are still central 40 years later, his
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote or edited several other books on child psychology and
at his death was completing ``The Baby Book: 75 Years of Infant
Care.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kessen was born in Key West, Fla.; received his
bachelor's degree from the University of Florida in 1948, his
master's from Brown University in 1950 and his doctorate from Yale
in 1952. In the same year, he began a postdoctoral fellowship at
the Child Study Center at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1980, Kessen was chairman of the psychology
department at Yale, and was named as the Eugene Higgins Professor
of Psychology in 1976. He was also a professor of pediatrics,
retiring in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Kessen led one of the first American
delegations to China after the United States re-established
diplomatic relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and a trustee of Barnard College and was to receive the
Distinguished Contributions to Education in Child Development Award
from the Society for Research and Child Development in April.
</P>
<P>
   Many leading developmental psychologists are former students of
Kessen. ``The question you ask about someone like him is, `Were
your students so inspired that they went on and became eminent
themselves?''' said Dr. Jerome Kagan, a professor of psychology at
Harvard University who attended graduate school with Kessen. ``Bill
had a high batting average.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marion Lord Kessen; three daughters,
Judith Crawford of Millersville, Md., Deborah Trofatter of
Branford, and Anne Lowell of St. Louis; three sons, Peter C., of
Branford, and Andrew L. and John M., both of Boston, and six
grandchildren.

PAUL ESSERMAN,   DOCTOR AND TEACHER , DIES AT 72

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Paul R. Esserman, an internist who juggled the
multiple lives of teacher, corporate physician, private
practitioner and occasional medical diplomat, died Saturday at New
York University Medical Center. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Esserman, a Brooklyn native who entered New York University at
16 and received his medical degree there at 22, taught for half a
century at the New York University School of Medicine while
maintaining a private practice that he continued after his academic
retirement. He also found time for a number of medical sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as staff physician at The New York Times in the
early 1970s, Esserman, a man who knew how to get the most out of
his summer vacations, visited Africa and set up a medical exchange
program between Ethiopia and NYU. In 1975, after two years as
physician to the Chinese Mission to the United Nations, he was
invited to China and set up a similar exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Esserman, whose wife, June, died in 1982, is survived by his
companion, Dr. Irene Shapiro; a son, Dean, of Stamford, Conn.; a
daughter, Lauren, of Portland, Ore.; two brothers, Howard, of
Florida, and Jay, of Maryland, and three grandchildren.

LONGTIME NEW YORK UNION CHIEF QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Hill retired Wednesday from his longtime
position as the executive director of District Council 37, the
umbrella union representing 120,000 New York City municipal
employees, 11 weeks after his parent union forced him to take an
unpaid leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   The parent union pressured Hill into taking a leave in December
because District Council 37 had fallen into crisis as the Manhattan
district attorney investigated allegations of embezzlement,
kickbacks and vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the parent union, said Wednesday
that Hill, 62, had told him last week that he had concluded that it
would be best for his family and for the union if he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's retirement ends the union career of one of the city's
most powerful and visible labor leaders, someone who bargained
contracts that often set the pattern for all city employees. Hill
was elected head of District Council 37 in 1986 and became
controversial as a union leader for allying himself with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and for negotiating a five-year contract that
contained an unpopular two-year pay freeze _ as well as three years
of job security.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee said he had little idea who would run District Council
37 after the parent union ends its trusteeship over the council,
which encompasses 56 union locals, representing accountants to
zookeepers. Since December, the council has been run by Lee
Saunders, a trustee named by the parent union, who says that after
the trusteeship ends he wants to return to his union post in
Washington, rather than become permanent executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Dewart Bell, a District Council spokesman, said Hill
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, whose salary was $252,800, will receive a pension of
$107,000 a year. In addition, he received $70,000 in deferred
compensation, $73,500 for unused vacation and a $100,000 lump-sum
payment for serving as executive director.

100 ABUSE CLAIMS FILED AT L.I. JAIL BEFORE DEATH 
 (DW) 
 BY DAVID M. HALBFINGER  
 
</HEADLINE>
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ In the eight years before Thomas Pizzuto
was fatally beaten while serving a 90-day sentence at the Nassau
County jail, more than 100 inmates filed notices of claims telling
horrifying tales of abuse at the hands of guards there, according
to documents obtained from county lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But officials have refused to disclose how much the county has
paid out to inmates in damage awards or legal settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pizzuto died on Jan. 13, many former inmates have come
forward with accounts of beatings by guards, and federal
prosecutors have opened a broad investigation into possible civil
rights violations there. The federal government has also taken over
the criminal investigation into Pizzuto's death.
</P>
<P>
   But jail officials and leaders of the correction officers' union
have denied that abuse was commonplace at the jail.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the new documents, which were obtained by The New York
Times under the Freedom of Information Law, support both arguments.
They show that, long before the publicity surrounding Pizzuto's
death, similar stories were frequently being recounted by inmates _
often, according to inmates and their lawyers, despite the
perception that they would be punished merely for making the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Undersheriff Ernest C. Weber said that the 106 claims
filed from 1991 to 1998 represented only about 1 in 1,000 inmates
who passed through the jail during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 106 notices do not represent all allegations against
the jail. Such a notice must be filed by an inmate within 90 days
of an attack for the inmate to be able to sue, up to a year later,
in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawsuits do not require such preliminary filings, and
many inmates sue under federal civil rights statutes, which experts
say are more favorable to plaintiffs and which allow successful
plaintiffs to recover their legal fees. Moreover, it is not clear
that every notice of claim filed against the Nassau jail led to a
lawsuit in any court.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Nassau County, Owen Walsh, also provided the
names of more than 150 inmates who had filed lawsuits since 1994
over incidents at the county jail, including allegations of abuse,
medical malpractice, and of guards allowing inmates to be assaulted
by other prisoners. But Walsh gave no indication of whether they
were still pending or how they had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases were inexplicably absent from the list, such as that
of Thomas Donovan Jr., a retarded man who sued in 1996, saying he
had been beaten by a guard wielding a frying pan. His federal civil
rights trial against the county is set to begin Thursday. .
</P>
<P>
   Many other inmates who say they have been assaulted by guards
never make it to filing a notice of claim, let alone a lawsuit.
Some lodge their complaints through the jail's Internal Affairs
Unit or directly with prosecutors. But many others are discouraged
from ever complaining anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Muraskin, president of the Legal Aid Society of Nassau
County, which represents indigent criminal defendants, said that
his lawyers warn clients who say they were beaten by jail guards of
possible retribution if they formally complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit them down and tell them what might happen,'' he said.
``An assault charge might be laid against you, claiming that the
inmate actually beat the guard up. Then it's your word against the
correction officer's word. And it's another felony. And your plea
negotiations might be adversely impacted upon, because you're not
cooperating, you're making a complaint. Besides, you've already
been beaten up, so you know that there might be more intimidation
and retribution inside the jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 106 notices are several that describe such
retribution. Henry Jackson filed a complaint in 1997, naming three
guards whom he said had kicked and punched him in the stomach while
he was recovering from abdominal surgery. Once it was clear he
needed medical attention, Jackson said, the guards conspired to
charge him with assaulting them.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury considered the charges, but another inmate,
Christopher Barnes, came forward, and Jackson was not indicted.
Barnes said that he himself later had his nose broken by one of the
same guards who had attacked Jackson. Neither Barnes nor Jackson
has yet filed a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, who oversees day-to-day operations at the jail, said that
when allegations of abuse are made only in notices of claims, not
through inmate grievance procedures, they are examined by defense
lawyers for the jail, not by internal affairs officers. If any
wrongdoing is uncovered, an internal affairs inquiry should begin,
he said, but that has never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the 106 claims notices are three in which
Joseph Bergen, now a corporal, is accused of assault. Bergen's
lawyer, Louis Agresta, has said that Bergen was one of four guards
placed on restricted duty at the jail in connection with the
investigation into the attack on Pizzuto. Agresta could not be
reached Wednesday.

NO SHORTAGE OF POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NJ-LAUTENBERG-RETIRE, EDIT-SENATE-LAUTENBERG) 
 (nk) 
 By   JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The decision by Sen. Frank Lautenberg to retire
next year gives New Jersey's younger elected officials an
opportunity to move in from the sidelines and some of the state's
veterans a chance for a new political life.
</P>
<P>
   With Lautenberg's unexpected announcement Wednesday, politicians
from former Gov. Jim Florio to Gov. Christie Whitman to Susan Bass
Levin, mayor of Cherry Hill, said that they were considering making
a bid. And as the day progressed, the list grew, swelling to at
least eight Democrats and seven Republicans by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a whole new political dynamic,'' said Thomas P.
Giblin, chairman of New Jersey's Democratic State Committee. ``On
our side, there are a lot of names out there. There is no shortage
of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, analysts say that Rep. Bob Menendez, a
four-term congressman, is a party favorite and has built a
considerable war chest in the last two years, raising $1.5 million
in anticipation of Lautenberg's retirement. But Menendez, in the
interest of party unity, pulled back last fall when Lautenberg
announced that he planned to run for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said all along that I would support the senator if he
ran, and that I would consider running if he did not,'' Menendez
said. ``I will probably make a decision about running by early next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Whitman, who is limited to two terms as
governor, said Wednesday that she was ``seriously considering all
of my options.'' When asked in the past, Whitman always quickly
pointed out that she was happy in her role as governor, and that
she did not have a campaign apparatus or fund-raising operation in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, when pressed by reporters as she attended the
opening of a new train station in Hamilton Township, her words
seemed to be more carefully chosen, as if she was more open to the
prospect of a Senate campaign. Her aides said privately that she
was giving it some serious thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a personal determination and what I think
will be best for the state,'' said Whitman, who made a strong
challenge to former Sen. Bill Bradley in 1990. ``I have always been
interested. I ran back in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   If Whitman runs, Lautenberg's announcement could alter the
playing field not only for next year's Senate race but also for the
gubernatorial contest in 2001. That is because the Senate
president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican who is planning to
run for governor in 2001, will step into Whitman's job to finish
her term if she wins the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Haytaian, chairman of New Jersey's Republican State
Committee, said that if Whitman decided to pursue a Senate
campaign, other Republican contenders would likely step aside.
Among those Republicans who expressed interest Wednesday were state
Sen. William L. Gormley; Essex County Executive James Treffinger;
Reps. Marge S. Roukema and Frank LoBiondo; former Rep. Richard A.
Zimmer, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1996; and Murray
Sabrin, a college professor who ran for governor as a member of the
Libertarian Party in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Florio, Menendez and Ms. Levin, the list of
Democrats who said Wednesday that they were considering a bid
included Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. and Steven R. Rothman; B. Thomas
Byrne Jr., a former state party chairman; and Assemblymen Robert G.
Smith and Neil M. Cohen.

<P>
   Florio, a former congressman who served one term as governor
before being ousted by Whitman in 1993, said he was giving a run
serious thought in part because he worked on many of the same
transportation and environmental issues as Lautenberg when he was
in Congress, and would like to continue that work.
</P>
<P>
   But party leaders said privately that the prospect of a rematch
between Whitman and Florio was unlikely because they would like to
use this open seat to promote new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg declined to say whom he preferred to succeed him, but
said: ``I would like to see someone who is going to carry on the
agenda that we, the Democrats, are presently working with. Anyone
who will take that agenda and work hard.''

EX-GIRLFRIEND PLACES SUSPECT IN PICKUP USED IN JASPER DRAGGING
DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The ex-girlfriend of white supremacist and
capital murder defendant John W. ``Bill'' King testified Wednesday
that she saw King get into a pickup with two friends and drive
toward Martin Luther King Boulevard the night a black man was
picked up there and later dragged to his death.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, and those two friends _ Shawn Allen Berry, 24, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31 _ are now accused of kidnapping
James Byrd Jr., chaining him to the pickup, dragging him three
miles and depositing his dismembered corpse outside a rural black
cemetery. If convicted in the June 7, 1998, killing, all three
white men could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Keisha Adkins, 21, also told jurors that while visiting her
ex-con ex-boyfriend at his apartment, she saw a Zippo cigarette
lighter engraved with King's prison nickname, ``Possum,'' on a
counter. Prosecutors believe it was the same lighter found at the
crime scene. King claimed he had lost the lighter the week before
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   But while some of her testimony appeared to link King to the
crime, Adkins waffled on her previous statement to investigators
that she also had seen King wearing a pair of sandals when he said
good-bye to her that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wearing them earlier that night,'' she said, visibly
nervous on the witness stand. ``But I just don't know if I saw him
wearing them when he got into the pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe the sandals are stained with Byrd's blood,
and say they will present DNA evidence to prove it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins was among five witnesses who took the stand Wednesday,
the second day of testimony in King's trial. Much of the day was
devoted to investigators testifying as to how they collected the
physical evidence, both at the crime scene and at King's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Jasper police Detective Rich Ford explained the
meaning of King's numerous tattoos, as well as the tattoos of his
co-defendants, as prosecutors flashed slides of the skin art on a
screen above the jury box.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoos, which the jury of 11 whites and one black saw for
the first time Wednesday, include a Satanic image of the Virgin
Mary holding a horned baby Jesus, Nazi and racist prison gang
insignia, Ku Klux Klan symbols and the figure of a lynched black
man.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. and Brack Jones
Jr., methodically objected as evidence was presented, and on
cross-examination attempted to challenge the investigators'
evidence-gathering techniques, suggesting the evidence could easily
have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   They challenged the tattoos on constitutional grounds, saying
their client's beliefs are protected under the First Amendment's
guarantee of free speech and free association.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about the cigarette lighter Adkins saw at King's
apartment, Jones said, ``She said she saw A cigarette lighter with
the word Possum on it,'' indicating there could have been more than
one lighter.
</P>
<P>
   King himself discussed the lighter in a statement to the media
last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's verifiable that the lighter found with ``Possum''
inscribed on it, is indeed my property,'' he wrote in a statement
his father released to The Dallas Morning News. ``The
aforementioned cigarette lighter had been misplaced a week or so
prior to these fraudulent charges that have been brought against
Russell Brewer and me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Byrd family, who filled the first two rows of the courtroom,
said the testimony was a little easier to take Wednesday. The day
before, several members were overcome with emotion and left the
courtroom in tears as investigators described the horrific
condition of Byrd's corpse and showed the jury his underwear and
other clothing.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, Ronald, who had cried and moaned quietly through
much of Tuesday's testimony, did not return to the courtroom
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston black activist Quanell X and one of his followers
observed the trial for a little over an hour Wednesday afternoon,
complying with state District Judge Joe Bob Golden's request that
they refrain from wearing the group's military-style uniform of
black fatigues and that they not disrupt the proceedings. An FBI
agent sat next to them in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the judge's court order barring demonstrations on the
courthouse square, Golden relented and allowed a few uniformed
members of the group to stand on the lawn briefly so they could be
seen by the media.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of Byrd's funeral, militant black and white groups,
some of them armed, marched through the streets of the East Texas
city of 7,600 residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to send a message of hate to anyone,'' Quanell
X, head of the National Black Muslims in Houston, said as he
entered the courthouse. ``But we are here to let our brothers and
sisters know that we care. We support them, we love them, and if
they need us, we'll be here again.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the courthouse he said the death was not a murder,
but more precisely, a lynching.
</P>
<P>
   The activist also urged the death penalty for King, as did
several local African-Americans who arrived outside the courthouse
just in time to see officers escort King from the building into a
waiting car. Several complained that King was allowed to wear
street clothes to the trial and was transported between the
courthouse and jail in a private car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me mad as hell,'' said Ethel Parks of Jasper. ``When
they arrest us for shoplifting, they handcuff us and put us in the
back of a patrol car and dress us in orange pants. Then they bring
this dog up here in a luxury car? After what he did?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karolyn Lewis, who lives near Huff Creek Road, where Byrd was
dragged, showed up at the courthouse with her five children, saying
she wanted to ``show them that life is not always fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show them what justice is supposed to be about in
Jasper, Texas,'' she said. ``I hope and I pray that he gets the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that she has little faith in the nearly all-white
jury. ``I think they put all the whites on there so they can award
him life in prison,'' she said.

JUDGE GIVES HOPE TO MAN HELD FOR DEPORTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ An immigration court judge closed testimony
Wednesday in what he called the ``unusual and difficult''
deportation case of a Palestinian man who has been linked by secret
evidence to terrorist organizations and the World Trade Center
bombing, and said he would now consider a request that the man be
released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Daniel Meisner, gave new hope to the man, Hany
Kiareldeen, 31, who has been detained for nearly a year. Meisner
had denied three earlier bail motions.
</P>
<P>
   An expert on terrorism challenged the secret evidence of the FBI
in testimony on Tuesday, saying the accusations contradicted the
federal government's own case against the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's lawyers, Houeida Saad and Regis Fernandez, said
Wednesday that Meisner's invitation to seek bail was an encouraging
sign that their evidence was beginning to undermine the Immigration
and Naturalization Service's case.
</P>
<P>
   The expert witness, Laurie Mylroie, is the co-author of the 1991
best seller ``Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf'' and was
an analyst and consultant on the bombing case for ABC and Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   In declassified summaries of still-secret evidence against
Kiareldeen, informers say he was a member of an unnamed terrorist
organization, Ms. Mylroie said. This contradicts the government's
theory in the World Trade Center case _ that the 1993 bombing was
the work of ``independent radical terrorists'' unconnected with
organized groups, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   The summaries, prepared for Kiareldeen's lawyers by the FBI,
also say he met with Nidal A. Ayyad, one of the convicted
co-conspirators in the bombing, a week before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mylroie said she had analyzed transcripts from the bombing
trials and examined the telephone logs of the co-conspirators, and
Kiareldeen's telephone number and name did not appear in any of
those logs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearings, Kiareldeen and his lawyers have
maintained that his former wife, Amal Mohamed, was the source of
the terrorism accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to get Ms. Mohamed on the stand to testify last fall
ended abruptly when she acknowledged talking to FBI agents but
refused to give details of those talks, saying she feared for her
life. Since then, the INS and the U.S. attorney for New Jersey have
blocked efforts to compel her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mylroie said Kiareldeen did not fit the profile of the
near-ascetic terrorist obsessed with Mideastern politics. This
contention was echoed by friends of Kiareldeen's, who testified on
Tuesday that he was like many young American men.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not political or religious, and he went to go-go bars
and liked to drink and dance,'' said Mansour Saqfelhait, one of the
friends.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The startling ``jeans alibi'' scandal unfolding in
Italy and Helmut Lang's bold fall collection, were just the jolts
needed to remind one during show week that fashion will not allow
itself to be dismissed as merely two sleeves and a collar.
</P>
<P>
   First, the scandal. An Italian court in its wisdom has ruled
that a woman cannot be raped if she is wearing jeans, because they
cannot be removed without her help. (Obviously, these judges have
never slipped into a pair of ultra-baggy rapper or raver jeans.)
However ridiculous the ruling, it reminds one of fashion's
possibilities for broad political statement and cultural
significance _ as does Lang.
</P>
<P>
   There are three things one should know about Lang. He's
Austrian. He combs his long hair back like a European rock star.
And he possesses a dry wit. (His fashion show invitation suggested
black tie _ a bit of humor, it turned out, not a requirement for
attendance.)
</P>
<P>
   His clothes reflect all three influences. Imagine a spacecraft
returning to Earth, releasing a pod that delicately opens. Out
steps a traveler, moving in cadence to music from the ``Star Wars''
trilogy and ``Pomp and Circumstance'' March No. 2, dressed for a
new century of both innocence and urban aggression.
</P>
<P>
   For Lang, this is his millennial collection: flight suits in
gossamer white organza, stark evening gowns and black leather
motocross trousers with multiple zippers running vertically down
the leg _ like astronauts' or pilots' flight suits.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't think John Glenn. Lang's clothes, notoriously
unforgiving, are for men who are young and slim, and for ``boys
with breasts,'' as Tom Wolfe calls fit, angular women in his latest
novel, ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang captured precisely the foreboding and wide-eyed optimism
that a culture feels greeting a new century. Insightfully, he drew
parallels between astronauts exploring new frontiers and graduating
students, palms sweaty but hearts racing to music that mixes
pageantry and nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   What was brazen about Lang's vision is that these are designs he
has given us before, just further evolved. He was positing his past
work as modern enough for the future. No argument here; everything
he showed looked ready for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the jackets slung from the back with straps like a
knapsack. Here, too, were his cashmere sweaters slit at the elbow
but skinnier and more refined, and here were coats with inner
straps dangling, or inexplicably strapped to one leg.
</P>
<P>
   But we've never seen a neck pillow on a runway before as part of
an outfit. That's new.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren is another man who has seen the future. And it is
in double-faced wool. The very premise of his show, a millennial
collection in double-faced wool, unduly taxes the brain, so
conventional is this fabric.
</P>
<P>
   There are three things one should know about Ralph Lauren. He is
Ralph Lauren. He is Ralph Lauren. And he is Ralph Lauren _ a man
very serious about his image.
</P>
<P>
   It must be hard to focus on design at Polo Ralph Lauren right
now, what with the layoffs of 250 employees, store closings and the
T.H. problem. When asked last week about the bite that Tommy
Hilfiger has taken out of his business by appropriating his
country-club esthetic, Lauren appeared unfazed. But perhaps the
sign of Lauren's concern was on the runway Wednesday, where he
presented an about-face from last season's relaxed bravura.
</P>
<P>
   Felt, which Lauren called ``the essence of the collection'' in
his program notes, turned up in chilly ivory jackets and skirts,
and then in black jackets and circle skirts. It all looked stiff,
the models stalking along in a bloodless trance. Felt gives clothes
a precise, sculptured look, and the medium got the better of the
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful cashmere turtlenecks cropped just below the bosom were
drowned out by double-faced wool jackets in screaming yellow, or by
pants and coats in harsh red or deep coral, typical of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when Hillary Rodham Clinton's popularity is at an
all-time high as she stands by her man, the '80s are over, the
moment seems to demand clothes that are softer, prettier and more
introspective.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s, of course, were the age of irony, a mood recalled in
shows by Rebecca Danenberg and Maja. Ms. Danenberg's woman wore
sexy sweaters slit down the side, sweaters with curved hems and
long jackets over slim dresses. But she accessorized with belts
that resembled ammunition belts pulled tight around the waist, or
slung low on the hips. These are clothes for a woman who insists on
having her femininity tempered with a butch edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Maja line was the Danenberg collection's alter ego. It was a
romp among girlfriends in a tableau created by Ellen von Unwerth, a
photographer known for raw, sexual imagery. Don't ask Ms. von
Unwerth to decorate if your tastes do not run toward wall-to-wall
red, plastic foliage and leopard-print sofas. Dancing and
frolicking in staged debauchery, models wore little fox-trim
sweaters and tight shiny skirts, and shimmery bra tops and panties.
</P>
<P>
   Maja will no doubt find its way into the wardrobes of
Hollywood's young and restless, and numerous club kids. Bawdiness
can be fun. But so can propriety, and Michael Kors' winning
collection was the picture of it. The men's line, in its third
season, was little more than luxury Gap, but the women's was more
nuanced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by horse country, they had an old-money hautiness to
them. The secret to Kors' success in evoking a style of living
irrelevant to most is that nothing is literal. What was called a
``barn jacket'' was not the commodious, rough-hewn garment one
expected, but a sleek, short leather piece with whipstitching.
Lean, sexy trousers in cashmere and wool coolly flared over
knife-sharp stilettos or pony-skin boots.
</P>
<P>
   Riding skirts in taffeta were unappealing and awkward. Taffeta
sometimes has a mind of its own. But a bone dress with a zip-front
and the shorter godet at the back suggesting a riding habit was an
arresting gown. Kors may or may not live the country manor life,
but he's surrounded by customers who do.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller, on the other hand, created a line in her image _
a very good one _ as sexy, offhand and urban as she is. Almost a
decade ago, Donna Karan and Jean Paul Gaultier began using
neoprene. Now, Ms. Miller, with a more populist sensibility, has
interpreted it for a broad audience. Her black neoprene jackets
with Velcro closures are attractive and understandable to all.
Imbuing the old with the new, she also showed pale pink blouses
that closed with hook and eyes, and simple skirts made interesting
with fabrics like crinkled taffeta resembling crushed aluminum
foil.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller gave thought to how her designs may flatter a woman's
body and reflect her beauty. But neither idea seems to have crossed
Mark Eisen's mind. If Eisen continues to show painfully contorted
avant-garde clothes, as he did on Tuesday, he may not be on the
fashion world's list of must-see shows much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither clever nor accomplished, the collection consisted of
long, dense jackets in manly shapes, dresses with a sad flap of
fabric wilting down the front, and a gray felted dress with a big
belt. Eisen appeared to be unacquainted with Static Guard, or with
the fabrics or drapes that ensure a skirt falls gracefully. His
skirts in cashmere or taffeta bunched horribly around and between
models' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tyler's presentations have been in a lull, too, but for
different reasons, since Tyler most certainly knows his way around
a drape and a cut. This season, similar to last, he showed only 20
looks, and they were not jewels in a crown. There were nice, short
dresses including one for daytime _ a lush white wrap _ and another
one, party-girl cute with ruby-colored sequins and a veiled
midriff.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Boss floundered, introducing its women's collection with
its men's wear for the first time. For women, there were
knee-length skirts with accordian-pleated borders at the hem, and
droopy tunics over similarly lackluster trousers. For men, a few
corduroy jackets and ombre jeans. No word on whether the jeans were
rape proof.

VENEZUELAN LEADER SEEKS EMERGENCY CONTROL OVER ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Venezuela's new president said
Wednesday that he would seek special authority from Congress to
impose tax and spending changes by emergency decree.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech, President Hugo Chavez said the 15-page
package of ``enabling laws'' was necessary ``to take on and
overcome the extremely difficult situation that Venezuela is
confronting.'' His agenda calls for a reduction in government
spending, changes in the sales tax and a delay in some foreign debt
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez took office two weeks ago, inheriting an economy in
shambles from President Rafael Caldera. The government's budget
deficit is equivalent to 9 percent of the entire economy, and more
than 30 percent of the national budget goes for foreign debt
payments this year. And with the price of oil, the country's
biggest export, at a 25-year low, Venezuela has little cause for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's announcement amounted to his first policy statement on
the economy, and it suggested that the new president would not
allow spending cuts to bog down in congressional wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes against the backdrop of a brewing clash,
pitting the president against Congress and the judiciary. Chavez,
who made an unsuccessful attempt to seize power in a coup d'etat in
1992, has placed a proposal to rewrite the constitution at the top
of his agenda. He has scheduled a referendum for May 2, proposing
that Venezuelans convene a constitutional assembly and grant him
broad powers to select its members.
</P>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court weighing the legality of the referendum,
the president appeared to make an attempt at intimidation, saying
he would call on Venezuelans to protest in the streets if the court
acted to block the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Political and economic analysts in Venezuela said Wednesday that
the president's economic project suggested that he wants to avoid
having the country's financial problems become a bargaining chip
with congressional opponents. Some of the measures, like
streamlining government, would appeal to orthodox economists, while
others, like seeking the grace period on foreign debt, are likely
to win support among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the president appeared determined to tackle the country's
dire economic troubles head on, rather than to win popularity.
``This is the first time that he's actually addressing Congress on
fundamental matters of national importance, and he's doing so fully
within the established rules of the democratic process,'' Eric
Eckvall, a Caracas-based political consultant, said in a telephone
interview. ``It shows that these are issues of such major
importance that he doesn't feel that he's in a position to play
politics with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The enabling legislation includes measures to reduce a wholesale
tax by one percentage point, to 15.5 percent, but to broaden it as
a value-added tax; and a proposal for a one-year tax of five-tenths
of a percentage point on financial transactions. Under his proposed
law, the government would begin collecting income tax on a monthly
basis, rather than once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said his package includes ``payment deferrals'' on
foreign debt to reduce the fiscal deficit. He said he would seek to
negotiate a ``grace period'' on foreign debt that had not already
been restructured.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said the package would also include measures to
protect foreign and domestic investments, and to boost Venezuela's
credibility in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Such executive decrees are not uncommon in South America.
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has used such decrees
_ which, in Brazil, require renewed congressional authorization
every 30 days _ hundreds of times over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez canceled a planned trip to Washington next week, during
which he was to have met with officials at the International
Monetary Fund, but he denied that the change in plans had anything
to do with his economic proposals for debt restructuring. He said,
rather, that he canceled when he discovered that President Clinton
would not be in Washington then.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trip to the United States was pretty much dependent on
having the opportunity to meet with Clinton, and when I found out
he wasn't going to be there I decided to attend to our own domestic
issues,'' the Venezuelan president said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how opposition parties, which enjoy a
two-thirds majority in congress, would treat the president's
request. Some of their members told reporters in Caracas that they
would only know after studying the measures individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez's economic package is only going to bring more misery
to Venezuela,'' Alberto Franceschi, an opposition deputy of the
Proyecto Venezuela party, was quoted as saying during a debate in
Congress.

TWO REPORTS CRITICIZE PRISONS ON HIV POLICY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wash., Calif., Vt., Miss.)  By LYNDA RICHARDSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a decade of scathing reports and government audits, the
New York State Department of Correctional Services has failed to
provide adequate HIV prevention and health services, including
condoms to all inmates, according to two new reports.
</P>
<P>
   The state's AIDS Advisory Council, in one report, has concluded
that prison health services, particularly for inmates with HIV, are
so seriously deficient that authority for inmate health care should
be transferred from the correction agency to the state's Department
of Health. The panel report cited uneven, uncoordinated health
services in many prisons, major shortages of health care staff and
inadequate training.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Wednesday, advocates for prisoners and
people with AIDS intensified their call for condoms to be made
available to all inmates. The advocates, led by the Latino
Commission on AIDS, said a survey of 108 former inmates indicated
that high levels of unsafe sex in prison posed a public health
risk. More than 60 percent of the respondents said they had
witnessed inmates having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 70,000 inmates in the state's 73 prisons, about 8,000 are
estimated to be infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The
state prison system has the highest rate of HIV infection of any
system in the country, about 1 percent of all HIV-infected
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the New York Department of Correctional
Services, James B. Flateau, said that a sharp drop in AIDS-related
deaths in the prisons over the last four years attested to the
quality of care received by inmates. Flateau said the AIDS care
budget in state prisons had increased by 66 percent since 1995,
when Gov. George E. Pataki took office contributing to an 85
percent decline in AIDS deaths during that time.
</P>
<P>
   New York state prisons do not make condoms available except for
conjugal visits. Advocates said that New York City and several
other cities and states, including Washington, San Francisco,
Vermont and Mississippi, have rules that ban sex in prisons, yet
allow the distribution of condoms to inmates. The authorities at
Rikers Island in New York City distributed 200,000 condoms last
year, advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been willing to accept the paradox that they can
distribute condoms at the same time as keeping sexual activity
illegal,'' said Steven Nesselroth, the director of the AIDS in
Prison program for the Osborne Association, a group that focuses on
criminal justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Flateau said he did not anticipate a change in the condom
prohibition. ``We're not going to do that,'' he said, adding that
condoms are a security threat because inmates and visitors can hide
drugs and other contraband inside the condoms and in their body
cavities.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency did acknowledge that some inmates have sex in
prison. ``We've never said they weren't, and those inmates risk
giving themselves a death sentence and we have told them that,''
Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, prison health services have been found
inadequate by various groups and government agencies, including the
New York City Bar Association, the Correctional Association of New
York and the State Health Department, which twice has audited the
corrections department.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member State AIDS Advisory Council first addressed the
issue in 1989. The latest report was unanimously endorsed earlier
this month by the council, which consists of appointees of the
governor and the Legislature. The panel includes doctors, lawyers,
advocates and community service providers.

MOTHER OF SLAIN TEACHER FAULTS JURY FOR ACQUITTING ACCUSED MAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A week after a Brooklyn man was acquitted of all
charges in the slaying of her son, Carol Levin said Wednesday that
the jury was wrong to free the man, Montoun T. Hart, and that she
has concluded that Hart participated in the torture and killing of
her son, Jonathan M. Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in her first interview since Hart's acquittal last
Thursday, Ms. Levin told a small group of reporters Wednesday that
Hart's testimony that he played no role in the killing initially
``turned my life upside down,'' but now, she said, she believes a
confession he had made earlier.
</P>
<P>
   She criticized the jurors' decision to disregard the confession
after Hart testified that the police coerced him into making false
statements while he was drunk and high on marijuana. Jurors said he
appeared ``wasted'' in police photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's naive to think that you could look good after
six hours of questioning,'' Ms. Levin said. ``It wasn't quite right
to disregard those statements entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said that she agreed with prosecutors that the murder
was carried out by Hart and Corey Arthur, a former student of
Levin's at Taft High School in the Bronx, who prosecutors said shot
his former teacher in the head after torturing him to learn the
access code for his bank card.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, who has refused to say who was with him in the teacher's
apartment, was convicted of second-degree murder in November and is
serving 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said she wondered whether the recent police shooting
of an African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, in the Bronx might have
affected the jury's view of the police in her son's case. But
jurors, who spoke on condition of anonymity last week, said that
the shooting of Diallo played no role in their verdict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jurors said that race was never an issue during deliberations.
The Manhattan panel consisted of seven whites, four blacks and one
Asian. Levin is white, Hart is black. One detective who Hart said
coerced him was Hispanic, the other is white.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers accused the police of a ``rush to judgment'' in
the slaying of Levin, the son of the Time Warner chairman, Gerald
M. Levin. David Stern, Hart's lawyer, criticized detectives for
failing to videotape the confession. And Anthony Ricco, one of
Arthur's lawyers, repeated his argument Wednesday that Arthur was
in the teacher's apartment the day of the murder, but ``two to
three'' others who were present are still at large.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Levin dismissed the defense arguments. She said she
believed only Hart and Arthur were involved, adding that law
enforcement officials told her they did not videotape Hart's
confession because his lawyer called and ordered the questioning
halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't know with 100 percent certainty,'' she said. ``But in
order to calm myself down, I have to believe it was them.''

FBI EXAMINES SITE IN BRONX WHERE POLICE FATALLY SHOT UNARMED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sign that the federal government has deepened
its involvement in the investigation of the fatal police shooting
of an unarmed West African immigrant, Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents spent hours Wednesday taking measurements of
the bullet-riddled building entrance where Amadou Diallo was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, escorted by New York City police officers, spent
about four hours examining the many bullet holes and photographing
the ground-floor hallway behind the vestibule where four undercover
officers confronted and shot Diallo two weeks ago. Their efforts
Wednesday coincided with yet another protest and a commemoration of
Diallo in Brooklyn, and the continued investigation by a Bronx
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents, using yellow measuring tape and more advanced
instruments, took precise measurements of virtually every object in
the immediate area of the vestibule, down to the building's red
bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the work would help
federal officials reconstruct the shooting. ``The FBI is doing a
re-enactment of the shooting,'' he said. Last week, Mary Jo White,
the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said her office had begun a
forensic analysis of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Joseph A. Valiquette, a spokesman for the FBI,
confirmed that agents had visited Diallo's apartment building, on
Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx, but he
declined to explain the nature of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle B. Watters, a lawyer representing Diallo's family, said he
was encouraged by the FBI's involvement in the investigation. But
he criticized the amount of information he said was leaking from
the Police Department as the Bronx grand jury gathers testimony
from people who were near the scene of Diallo's shooting on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department is leaking so much about the
investigation that the integrity of the investigation is being
affected,'' Watters said. ``Clearly, they have a motivation to help
their fellow officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury continued to hear testimony Wednesday, including
accounts from one of Diallo's roommates and from the paramedics who
arrived after the shooting, a source involved in the legal
proceedings said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigative work by the police and FBI was just one
indication that Diallo's death _ in a torrent of 41 bullets _ is
likely to remain under intense scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, more protesters met to denounce a number of police
shootings. And in a 90-minute prayer service for Diallo, 22, who
had worked as a street vendor, an interfaith group of religious
leaders labeled Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's ``zero-tolerance'' brand
of police enforcement as a catalyst to police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has called for a zero tolerance,'' Benjamin E.
Muhammad, a representative of Louis Farrakhan, minister of the
Nation of Islam, said to about 125 people inside the House of the
Lord Church. ``Well, we must have a zero tolerance for racist,
killer police officers that come into our community and victimize
our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the six speakers urged people not to allow their sense
of urgency surrounding his death to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brothers and sisters, we have to stand up for our rights
and we must fight until justice is served,'' said Mamadou Conde,
Diallo's cousin, to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's killing also echoed Wednesday outside the offices of
the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, where 100 protesters
gathered to denounce the slow pace of an inquiry into another fatal
shooting involving Officer Kenneth Boss, one of the four officers
who shot at Diallo. In that case, in October 1997, Boss and other
officers shot Patrick Bailey, 20, who was carrying an unloaded,
inoperable shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   As religious and community leaders vowed to keep pressure on
city officials, calls for justice for Diallo spread to Washington.
In a letter Wednesday, Hugh B. Price, the president of the National
Urban League, implored President Clinton to ``address the festering
issue of police abuse of minorities,'' and to attend the funeral of
the next victim of a questionable police slaying.

JASPER JURY SHOWN RACIST, SATANIC TATTOOS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See JASPER-TRIAL) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William ``Bill'' King is a walking gallery
of skin art _ prison-made tattoos ranging from reminders of time in
a particular prison to a demonic Woody Woodpecker peeking from
under a Klan hood and pointing to a black figure hanging from a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Police Detective Rich Ford took the jury for a
photographic tour Wednesday of the tattoos of King and the other
two white men charged with dragging a black man, James Byrd Jr., to
death.
</P>
<P>
   There was little reaction in the courtroom other than an
occasional gasp as the racist and satanic tattoos were displayed.
</P>
<P>
   As defense attorneys lodged continuing protests, Ford used a
laser pointer to guide the jury through giant projected blow-ups of
the three men's tattoos _ mainly King's.
</P>
<P>
   King is festooned with figures, including an upside-down
pentagram on the back of his head. His arms are a melange of
figures, unintelligible except in close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   There are demonic figures, reproductions of Church of Satan
founder Anton LaVey preaching and goat heads. A Madonna holds what
looks like a baby Jesus with horns. Valentine hearts are turned
upside down _ a symbol of hate, Ford testified.
</P>
<P>
   There are several allusions to ``peckerwoods,'' a name Ford said
stands for white men in prison. One tattoo says ``100 percent loco
wood,'' and another reads ``PWCCA,'' standing for Peckerwood
Confederate Coalition of America, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   On one arm is the wild-eyed, demonic-looking, hooded woodpecker
pointing to one of the smallest drawings in the nightmare mixture
of ink. It is a tiny figure of a black man hanging from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   One tattoo may predict King's future if the jury convicts him of
capital murder _ it is of playing cards showing aces and eights,
the traditional dead man's poker hand.
</P>
<P>
   Another tells of his past _ it is a dragon emblazoned with
``Beto I'' _ the Texas prison unit where he got most of the tattoos
while incarcerated there from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagrams _ a five-pointed star inside a circle _ itself a sign
of evil, and its upside-down and even worse version, the bathomet,
is found on the back of his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray introduced a
life-sized photograph of King holding his left arm up, displaying a
bathomet in his left armpit.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the tattoos show that the men _ especially King and
former prison buddy Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., were racists and
were in a frame of mind to kill a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Both King and Brewer have large crests symbolizing the
Confederate Knights of America _ a Klan-related prison group they
both belonged to. On Tuesday, prosecutors introduced King's
writings found in his apartment that showed he was forming a
Klan-type group called Texas Rebel Soldiers, an offshoot of the
Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   Their tattooed shields include Confederate-style stars and bars,
blazing crosses, Nazi-style ``SS'' lightning bolts and the slogan,
``Aryan Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer has almost as many tattoos, including one that looks like
a pirate, a patch over one eye, his lips sewn shut and a rope
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of white supremacy time line winds around one arm, with
Norsemen giving way to pirates, then cowboys and modern-day bikers,
Ford explained.
</P>
<P>
   One tattoo reads ``CKA,'' meaning Confederate Knights of America
and ``Death before dishonor.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the other two, Shawn Allen Berry's tattoos are mild.
</P>
<P>
   He has a death's head in a three-horned helmet, emblazoned with
the slogan, ``Brotherhood.'' He also has a grim reaper, but no
tattoos that indicated Klan-like sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Among items introduced Wednesday was a King mimic of the 23rd
Psalm that he called ``The Psalm of Tattoos.'' It began:
</P>
<P>
   King Tattoo is my shepard, (sic) I shall always want
</P>
<P>
   He maketh me be stung by the needle
</P>
<P>
   He coloreth me with the evil waters
</P>
<P>
   He remaketh my soul
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys said the tattoos were protected by their
client's first-amendment right to free expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think just the tattoos themselves make him a racist,''
said King's attorney, C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr.

A NEW STORM THREATENS RESCUED SAILOR AND HER SAVIOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a harrowing rescue at sea, Isabelle Autissier is savoring
her good fortune safe inside a friend's race boat on the way to
Punta del Este, Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very relieved,'' Autissier, a French solo sailor, said
Wednesday night in a satellite phone interview a day after being
fetched from her overturned yacht in the South Pacific by the
Italian Giovanni Soldini. ``I was very concerned about everybody
else in the race because they would try to find me. But I knew
someone would be coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling of relief could be short-lived for Autissier,
Soldini and the rest of the fleet racing in the Around Alone
round-the-world race. Another storm is expected to strike Friday in
an area of the South Pacific Ocean where the 10 competitors are
making their way toward South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about the new storm,'' Autissier said. ``I
thought that maybe a piece of my boat's mast, which was still
attached to the hull by a halyard, might break off and put a hole
in my boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The predicted storm carries with it 60-knot winds and 30-foot
seas. While perhaps not as frightening as waiting for help from the
innards of a capsized yacht, it is still potentially as serious.
</P>
<P>
   The gale is expected to cut through the Around Alone fleet,
which is spread out over 2,000 miles, like a thresher through
wheat. The worst of it is likely to hit Autissier and Soldini,
aboard Soldini's 60-foot sailboat, Fila, as they head toward Cape
Horn at the tip of South America, a distance as of late Wednesday
of about 1,600 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Soldini, who saved his friend and fellow-competitor after an
all-night search doesn't fear another storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at it,'' the 32-year-old Soldini said Wednesday
night in the ship-to-shore phone interview. ``Maybe we will get
some of the wind. But probably the worst part will be around boats
in the back of the fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may be hard to get excited about wind when you're
trying to harness the breeze to win a race.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Campbell, a weather forecaster for the Around Alone, put it
in perspective Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not viewing this as life-threatening,'' Campbell said.
``They're viewing it as advantageous. Storms like this are not
terribly unusual where they are. It's a stormy part of the world.
But that's part of the ball game _ 30 to 40 knots makes their boats
move fast. You've got to realize these people are in powerful
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he added, ``But sometimes, machines break.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Autissier, however, is still raw from her experience. It was
only three days ago that her life was nearly snuffed out as PRB,
the 60-foot race boat, lost control. She was second in a fleet at
the time, on course 1,900 miles from Cape Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier has surmised that the yacht's self-steering gear may
have gone haywire. By changing course unexpectedly, the autopilot
made Autissier's big, flat-bottomed sailboat rear up like a wounded
bull. The 17,000-pound vessel fell over on its side as if a
toreador had stuck a sword in its back.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to control the million-dollar yacht, Autissier had no
choice but to dive for cover below deck, and shut the hatch behind
her. She could hear the yacht's towering mast break up as it hung
suspended in the void of water beneath her.
</P>
<P>
   She waited inside the dark, wet hull for nearly 22 hours, not
knowing if it might sink before rescue came. ``My worries were
about the little leaks in the deck, and maybe my boat very slowly
filling with water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew someone would come, but I did not know when,'' she
said. ``I thought that if the storm came first, I might have to
wait for a few days. I could do nothing but get my safety gear
ready in the back of the boat, and some food and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Autissier said that she will have to wait to talk with her
yacht's designers, Groupe Finot of France, to determine exactly
what went wrong. But she does know that she was fortunate to have
lived through the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been in the back of the boat, I would have fallen
overboard,'' she said. ``The boat would have fallen on top of me.
But it was over on its side so quickly, I could not even go in the
cockpit. I'm really very surprised by what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She was reminded at the time of her friend, Gerry Roufs, a
Canadian solo sailor who was lost at sea during a race for solo
sailors two years ago. He disappeared in that very same expanse of
open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   When Soldini pulled along side her stricken yacht at dawn
Tuesday, Autissier had fallen asleep inside the cavernous hull. He
screamed for her, ``Isabelle, Isabelle!'' But it wasn't until he
threw a hammer on its hard surface that she awoke. She grabbed her
life raft, inflated it and slipped out of the catacomb of PRB. It
was then that Soldini nuzzled up alongside PRB, and helped his
bedraggled friend scramble to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trauma of what happened, Autissier said she doesn't
plan to give up solo sailing. Still, she may retire from racing.
``I will not say I am going to stop because I was afraid to die,''
she said matter-of-factly. ``If I stop, it will be because I have
been doing this for 10 years, and now maybe it is time to do
something else.'' &QL;

AIRLINE SAYS SICKOUT COST $58.7 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ American Airlines said Wednesday that its pilots union,
in prolonging a sickout last week after a federal judge ordered
members back to work, cost the carrier at least $58.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Allied Pilots Association asked for time to review those
claims, and U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall recessed the hearing
until April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall found the pilots in contempt of court Saturday for
ignoring his back-to-work order and hammered them for bargaining
tactics that he compared to a mob shakedown. On Tuesday, the court
collected a $10 million down payment from the union toward the
fines and damages Kendall intends to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said the negotiations over the underlying issue _ the
integration of Reno Air pilots into the American system _ were
stalled Wednesday. And the sticking point is the same as it was on
Feb. 5, when the union launched its sickout.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents 9,300 pilots, has demanded that
Reno's 300 pilots be paid on American's higher pay scale
retroactive to Dec. 23, the day American gained financial control
of Reno. The union is also demanding that American first officers
who will be promoted to captain because of the Reno deal be paid
captain's wages retractive to Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   This week, management offered to raise Reno pilots' pay as much
as 56 percent immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But citing industry precedents, American doesn't want to pay
Reno pilots on the still-higher scale until they are assigned to
their new jobs at American. Nor does the company want to give a
raise to its own pilots who will be promoted as a result of the
acquisition until they are assigned to their new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Union President Rich LaVoy said the talks ``are going
backwards.'' He called the demand that all pilots affected by the
Reno merger receive their pay raises retroactive to Dec. 23 a
``core principle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot set a precedent of American Airlines, even
for a day, controlling a low-paid carrier, after we've really
fought and bargained so hard to bring back what we had lost in the
early '80s,'' LaVoy said.
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman Chris Chiames said management is just as
adamant about not granting raises retroactively, even though the
airline's financial loss from the sickout is more than retroactive
pay would have cost.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the airline does not want to set a precedent
that would make future mergers too expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Wednesday, Doug Herring, American's vice
president and controller, said the company lost at least $150
million during the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall issued his back-to-work order Feb. 10, five days after
the sickout began, but the number of pilots on the sick list grew
through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Herring said American lost at least $58.7 million from Feb. 10
through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After Kendall's ruling Saturday morning, the union stepped up
its efforts to persuade pilots to return to work. As a result,
American's operations began returning to normal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the first day since Feb. 5 that American reported
no flight cancellations because of crew shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Union lawyers are expected to argue that the period when the
union was in contempt was much shorter, perhaps as little as 21
hours, until LaVoy taped a new phone message for the pilots hot
line.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its contention that union leaders encouraged pilots
to ignore the back-to-work order, American introduced into evidence
a series of e-mail messages from union board members in New York
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The messages, all logged between Feb. 6 and 4:22 p.m. on Feb.
10, warned pilots that a federal judge would probably issue a
temporary restraining order against the union. They advised members
that such an order would be binding only on the union's leadership
and not on rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
   A similar statement by LaVoy on the union's telephone hot line
after Kendall had issued his back-to-work order was one reasons the
judge cited for his contempt ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messages also advised pilots that no judge could make
them fly if they declared themselves unfit under federal aviation
regulations. And they warned pilots that the judge might force
union leaders to ``sanitize'' their official communications with
members.
</P>
<P>
   One such e-mail message, composed by Randy Trommer, a union
board member representing pilots in San Francisco, said:
``Depending on what legal orders are received, our direct
communication ability may be impaired. Talk to each other! ... We
will do our best to communicate with you. Realize, however, that
our abilities will be hampered.''
</P>
<P>
   American apparently was given copies of those e-mail messages by
a pilot with access to the union's private Web site. The copies of
the e-mail entered into the record were edited to conceal the
identity of the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Kelly, American's lawyer, also gave Kendall a copy of an
e-mail message that he said was ``unfit to read'' in public and
which contained a specific threat against the judge. Kelly, who
declined to make copies of the message public, said he had turned
it over to the U.S. Marshals Service for investigation. Kendall
took no public action, and the marshals office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy said he regretted that the message was transmitted via the
union's Web site.

GUARD PAYS PRICE FOR GONZAGA SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORAGA _ Gonzaga junior guard Matt Santangelo stared into the
cold rain outside the St. Mary's gym after a recent victory and
described his bittersweet season. He is 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds,
with dark, straight hair, hard features and the sullen look of
someone who has taken one for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it's been very frustrating,'' he said. ``I know
people are looking at me and wondering, `What's going on with
Santangelo?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The player and the team have emerged as two of the best stories
of the college season, but for reasons as disparate as victory and
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo is the Bulldogs' best player. In fact, he and Boise
State's Roberto Bergersen are the best unknown players in the West.
Although he has been compared to former Gonzaga guard John Stockton
_ a smart, shooting point guard with deceptive quickness and superb
instincts _ a more apt comparison is ex-Santa Clara and current
Dallas Mavericks guard Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who play at Pepperdine on Friday night, are the
West Coast Conference's best team. Thanks to a 21-5 record and
tough nonconference schedule _ losses to Kansas, Purdue and Texas
Christian; a victory over Washington _ they may earn an NCAA
at-large bid if they don't win the WCC tournament next week.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the paths cross: Gonzaga has played well because
Santangelo has not.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for 5-8 senior guard Quentin Hall, Bulldogs coach
Dan Monson asked Santangelo before the season to move from point
guard, his natural position, to shooting guard. Reluctantly,
Santangelo agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sacrificed a lot,'' Monson said. ``At the beginning of
the season, he was not his usual self and his confidence wasn't
like it was last year, because he didn't have the ball in his
hands. But it has helped him become a more complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo doesn't argue that point. On the wing, he has learned
to move without the ball, use screens and defend bigger players
while improving his rebounding. He remains Gonzaga's leader, both
on the court and in the locker room, and when needed he can take
over a game.
</P>
<P>
   But his production has plummeted. Last year, Santangelo shot
43.5 percent from the field, 43.3 percent from 3-point range and
averaged 16.2 points. This year, he's shooting 36 percent from the
field, 34 percent from 3-point range and averaging 11.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my former life, I was a shooter,'' he said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gonzaga's success has made the switch tolerable,
Santangelo can't help but wonder about his future _ about the
impact of the position change on his NBA potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's selfish, but it's also natural to think about
it,'' he said, staring into the rain. ``I do want to play at the
next level, and this year has really been a sacrifice. Hopefully,
I'll be back at point guard next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning bubble: As Selection Sunday approaches, a few things
to watch:
</P>
<P>
   How will middle-tier teams in the major conferences fare in the
final weeks? Nebraska, Oklahoma State, Mississippi State, Arkansas,
Georgia, Florida State, California, Minnesota and Northwestern are
in tenuous positions. Not even Kansas is assured an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   How will the top mid-major teams perform in their conference
tournaments? Miami-Ohio (Mid-American), Southwest Missouri State
(Missouri Valley) and Gonzaga have strong power ratings and may get
at-large invitations if they don't win their league tournaments. If
so, they'd suck bids away from the Pacific-10, ACC, Big Ten and
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   What of the Big Ten? Eight bids seem unlikely, but it may get
seven. Michigan State, Ohio State, Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana are
in. Minnesota, Purdue and Northwestern are questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford situation. The Cardinal has lost its grip on a No.
1 seed and may not win the Pac-10. That would clear a path for
Arizona to stay in the West, where the regionals are scheduled for
America West Arena in Phoenix, its home-away-from-home.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mexico situation. Despite 20 wins and a No. 24 ranking,
the Lobos DO NOT deserve an at-large bid. They are 2-5 on the road,
they played a pathetic nonconference schedule, they lost at home to
Utah by 18 points, and they are No. 103 in the latest Ratings
Percentage Index rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: From the ``Bad behavior is not relegated to
UCLA'' file: Five Arizona freshmen were late to a film session and
forced to run extra laps around McKale Center after a recent game.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Oregon won its first home conference game on Feb. 11. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State has two non-Division I victories, Chaminade and
Alaska-Anchorage. That could crush the Sun Devils on Selection
Sunday, even with a strong finish. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Comment: USC coach Henry Bobby says, ``There were a lot of
expectations on us to be a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Response: From whom? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stanford coach Mike Montgomery confirmed Tuesday that reserve
guard Ryan Mendez will not return this season from a stress
reaction in his knee. He has not practiced in months. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Pac-10 teams in the latest RPI rankings: 3.
Stanford, 16. Arizona, 18. Washington, 19. UCLA. &QL;

PHARMANEX VICTORIOUS IN FIGHT OVER SUPPLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- In a major win for the nutritional
supplements industry, a federal judge has ruled in favor of
supplements maker Pharmanex Inc. in its two-year legal battle with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmanex case centered on whether a cholesterol-lowering
substance that the Simi Valley company markets under the name
Cholestin is a drug or a dietary supplement. Because it contains
the same active ingredient as a prescription medicine sold by drug
giant Merck &AMP; Co., the FDA argued it is a drug, subject to strict
government approval and regulation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Pharmanex attorneys argued that because the substance is
naturally occurring -- Cholestin is harvested from a red yeast
found on certain kinds of rice -- it is merely a supplement, a
product category virtually unregulated by the FDA under the 1994
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling late Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Dale
Kimball agreed with Pharmanex, permanently lifting a ban ordered by
the FDA last May on Pharmanex imports of Cholestin ingredients from
its Chinese supplier. Kimball said Cholestin clearly meets the
dietary-supplement definition as a product other than tobacco
intended to supplement the diet.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling allows Pharmanex to continue importing the
red yeast rice to its Farmington, Utah, factory where it produces
90,000 capsules of Cholestin a day. Pharmanex was purchased last
October by Nu Skin Enterprises, based in Provo, Utah, one of the
nation's largest direct marketers of health and beauty aids.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the case will have broad implications for the $5
billion-per-year nutritional supplements industry, which
increasingly markets products to consumers for conditions, ranging
from high cholesterol to impotence, previously considered the sole
domain of prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is highly significant because it reconfirms that
naturally occurring substances sold off the shelf are not drugs,''
said analyst Patricia Negron at Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill Inc.
``Companies like Merck and other large pharmaceutical entities with
longstanding relationships with the FDA are threatened by these
kinds of products and have used their muscle to prevent them being
sold. This is a very important milestone for the (supplements)
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Negron predicted the ruling will further motivate drug companies
to establish their own supplement lines to augment their
prescription drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmanex President Bill McGlashin said the company was pleased
with the judge's ruling, adding that intense study by Pharmanex or
another dietary supplements maker, to identify the key ingredient
of a naturally occurring product, does not ``transform (the
product) into a drug.''

GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY CHALLENGES COMPAQ EXECUTIVE AT MICROSOFT TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government attorney in the Microsoft Corp.
antitrust trial assailed a Compaq Computer Corp. witness' assertion
the software giant did not improperly attempt to coerce his company
into scrapping plans to install a Web browser made by Microsoft
rival Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Senior Vice President John Rose testified Wednesday he
and several other company executives reached a ``verbal'' agreement
with Microsoft during a conference call Aug. 8, 1995, promising the
Houston-based computer maker would not modify the kits used to load
Microsoft's popular Windows operating system into Compaq's Presario
line of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   That oral agreement, Rose said, meant Compaq could not remove
the icons for Microsoft's Web browser _ Internet Explorer _ or for
Microsoft's online service _ Microsoft Network _ from the Windows
95 default desktop.
</P>
<P>
   But little more than two weeks later, on Aug. 23, 1995, Compaq
officials signed a written agreement with the Dulles, Va.-based
online service provider America Online that would have done just
that.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL deal would have removed the Internet Explorer icon and
replaced it with AOL's featured Web browser, Netscape's Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq officials had failed to get the word out about the
Microsoft agreement, Rose argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we had a communications breakdown,'' Rose said,
adding ``the person that signed the agreement did not get the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   That person was Compaq Vice President Celeste Dunn. And in a
deposition taken last October, Rose identified Dunn as one of the
Compaq executives who had participated in the Microsoft conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft officials produced a document that suggested Rose
had confused Dunn with another woman executive at the company.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department and attorneys general from 19 states
have accused Microsoft of using its virtual monopoly power over
computer operating systems to thwart Netscape's efforts to market
its Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's testimony was designed to counter the testimony of
Netscape President James Barksdale, the government's lead-off
witness in the four-month-old trial, who had accused Microsoft of
threatening Compaq for featuring the Navigator icon on the Windows
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, Compaq announced plans to team up with
Netscape on a project involving computer servers. The computer
maker also began using Netscape for some internal communications.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a company executive sent an e-mail warning: ``Microsoft
was upset with our announcement and our internal use of Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, Microsoft sent a letter threatening to terminate
Compaq's license to use Windows, noting that Compaq had removed the
Microsoft Network icon from the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Rose testified that it was not until Compaq received that letter
that he learned about the terms of the AOL agreement. Compaq
officials then went back to AOL and renegotiated their deal.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq then agreed to reinstate the icons for Internet Explorer
and Microsoft Network but told Microsoft it was adding icons for
AOL and Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and confident through much of his testimony, Rose told
the court he is sometimes referred to as the ``father of the
Presario.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rose was taken aback when the government's lead attorney,
David Boies, produced an internal Compaq document from Nov. 10,
1998, in which an unspecified Compaq employee described Microsoft's
business terms for manufacturers as ``what one would expect from a
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he was not familiar with the document and did not
agree with the ``monopoly'' description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ever had executive-level visibility,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Dan Rosen, Microsoft's general manager for new
technology, disputed a critical government claim that Microsoft
officials offered to carve up the browser market with Netscape
during a June 21, 1995, meeting with Netscape's Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no proposed `market division''' Rosen said.
Barksdale has said he was ``stunned'' by the proposal, but Rosen
said he did not sense from any of the participants in the meeting
that they had regarded the proposals being discussed as ``illegal
or improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen also attacked Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen's notes
of the session, noting: ``Throughout most of the meeting, Mr.
Andreessen did not appear to be paying attention ... .''

 &HT;    Texas graduate students to receive tax break
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas universities and graduate students who
help teach and do research will get a tax break totaling millions
of dollars, but when they'll see the money is in dispute, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut is the result of a federal law, passed in October,
that put Texas on par with 47 other states that exempt the earnings
of working graduate students and their schools from Social Security
taxes. For every dollar a Texas student earns, 7.65 cents is
withheld, and the university pays the same amount in payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching parity with other states has been an issue for
University of Texas graduate students and administrators because
the tax, coupled with inadequate pay for working graduate students,
has caused UT to lose top-notch students to better-paying schools,
said Teresa Sullivan, dean of graduate studies at UT. The average
graduate student who teaches at UT earns about $10,500 for a
nine-month school year.
</P>
<P>
   For Kim Nixon, a UT doctoral student in psychology and a
teaching assistant, the tax exemption will mean an extra $70 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's food,'' she said. ``That's a significant amount.''
</P>
<P>
   For the UT System, the tax break means $4.3 million a year in
income to 15,868 students and another $4.3 million in payroll tax
savings to the system's universities, said UT System Chancellor
William Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Across Texas, the savings work out to $13 million for all
graduate students and $13 million for all of the public
universities, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who sought the tax-exemption law, and U.S. Sen. Phil
Gramm, the Texas Republican who got it passed, briefed UT students
and faculty about the law on Wednesday. Cunningham and Gramm said
they would like to see the students' paychecks reflect the increase
by May.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Stewart, state Social Security administrator for the
Employees Retirement System of Texas, said he was told Texas should
not expect the increases until after June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security Administration indicates that the
legislation doesn't allow an earlier time frame,'' Stewart said.
``Of course, I'm hearing Senator Gramm wants to move more quickly
than that, and, obviously, we think it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that can happen remains to be seen, Stewart said.

TEXAS DUE 500 MORE INS AGENTS ALONG BORDER 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas will get 500 more Border Patrol agents, half
the number of new agents hired this fiscal year by the INS, to
bolster a 19-month-old operation along the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris
Meissner said Wednesday she plans to hire 1,000 new agents as part
of the agency's $3.9 billion in spending for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new agents deployed in Texas will work on Operation
Rio Grande, Meissner said, an intensive Border Patrol operation
that began in July 1997. The new agents represent a 15 percent
increase over the 3,433 patrol agents now on the Texas-Mexico
border. Arizona will get 395 new agents.
</P>
<P>
   The INS and the Department of Justice began five years ago to
target specific corridors of illegal immigration along the United
States' southwestern border, flooding those areas with manpower and
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 new Texas hires, 250 agents will be sent to the
McAllen sector, an area through which illegal immigrants attempt to
reach Houston, said Mark Reed, director of the INS' Central Region.
Del Rio will get 80 more agents and Laredo will get 120. The El
Paso and Marfa sectors will get 25 each.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the INS plans to spend $20.9 million to construct
new Border Patrol facilities in Hebbronville, Falfurrias, Sierra
Blanca, Brownsville and the Del Rio Presidio station. Road and
lighting improvements will be made in the Del Rio, Laredo and Marfa
sectors at a cost of $939,000.
</P>
<P>
   INS also will spend $1 million to add 90 jobs in its detention
and deportation operations and to place 400 new beds in facilities
in Port Isabel. Each of the INS's 11 regions will get a new
juvenile coordinator to oversee development of 126 additional
juvenile beds.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has been under fire over detentions since reports
earlier this month the agency was considering the release of
illegal immigrants being held for criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress wrote letters of protest after INS
memos were made public that detailed a plan to release aliens being
held on charges ranging from assault and burglary to manslaughter
and sexual molestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to state emphatically that INS is not releasing any
detainees, nor do we plan to,'' Meissner said. She is exploring
other options that will relieve INS detention centers of crowding,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, who heads the House
immigration subcommittee, still is not satisfied, said his
spokesman, Allen Kay.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not rule out the possibility of INS releasing
criminals into your neighborhood in the future, and that is a point
the congressman remains concerned about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Meissner declined to comment specifically on options
INS was considering to relieve crowding, she said there has been an
ongoing discussion about what kinds of offenders are being
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Detainees range from those who are breaking civil immigration
laws to convicted felons, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing even nonviolent offenders may cause problems, Kay
said. Justice Department statistics show that 90 percent of
non-criminal illegal aliens who are detained are never deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, to any extent, INS is going to release non-criminal
aliens, they're saying they're giving up on trying to deport
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said detention facilities in El Paso and Port Isabel still
can handle the load, but they need to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   INS also contracts with several county jails and facilities in
Houston, he said, mostly because the city is convenient to a number
of consulates, attorneys for immigrants and major airports that
provide direct flights out of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with crowding have been magnified since INS decided not
to immediately deport illegal aliens from Central America because
of devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua, Honduras,
Guatemala and El Salvador, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with that problem, INS has requested an $80 million
supplemental budget.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond funding for enforcement, Houston will receive 10 of 200
temporary adjudicators hired to reduce the backlog of
naturalization applications in eight cities.
</P>
<P>
   Among other items included in the INS budget are 100 new
immigration inspectors in 13 major airports in the United States,
Aruba and Ireland; 100 immigration information officers in INS
service centers throughout the country; 36 management positions to
oversee construction projects; and 10 positions for the Office of
Internal Audit.

IS SHE OR ISN'T SHE? 
BLOCKING `OKLAHOMA!' 
IT'S NOT ALWAYS WHO YOU KNOW
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many is-she-or-isn't-she questions, so few facts.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton may or may not be running for the U.S.
Senate. She may or may not be buying a certain apartment on the
Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   She has not weighed in. But it seems as if everyone else has.
Her chances against Republicans like Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and her
chances with Manhattan's notoriously fickle co-op boards have been
dissected with unusual care this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monica stuff is over, and people are looking for something
to gossip about,'' said one Democrat who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``The lack of information makes it even more
titillating.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation continued Wednesday with more talk about Mrs.
Clinton's supposed interest in a cooperative apartment at 290 West
End Ave. that has been on the market for $1.295 million. Never mind
that the doormen and the managing agent say that Mrs. Clinton has
not even stopped by for a look-see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest thing about the real estate community is,
everybody's talking about what they've read in the papers,'' said
one real estate agent who has been showing the apartment. ``There's
absolutely no true corroboration available.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is about what Harold Ickes, a former White House official
who has discussed the Senate race with Mrs. Clinton, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing about an apartment, nothing whatsoever,'' he
said. ``This stuff is wildfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mrs. Clinton has compartmentalized her life, separating
her apartment-hunting from her campaign decision-making to the
point of keeping an insider like Ickes out of the real estate loop.
Or maybe she has realized what those who already live in New York
know only too well: It is an expensive place, and the Clintons have
never been wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can form a committee to pay legal bills, you can form a
committee to set up a library,'' Ickes said. ``You cannot form a
committee to raise money for everyday living in New York or else
we'd all have committees.''
</P>
<P>
   Would renting be more affordable, as some Democrats noted?
William Rudin, the president of a large family-run real estate firm
whose roster of tenants has included VIPs like former Mayor David
Dinkins, answered the question with a question: ``Hillary who?''
</P>
<P>
   Wild West End
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trevor Nunn's ``Oklahoma!'' is not OK with Actors'
Equity, at least not the way he wanted to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn wanted to import the entire British company of
``Oklahoma!'' _ perhaps the quintessential American musical, with
spirited cowboys and farm girls singing about the land they love _
to Broadway. He said his schedule was too tight to rehearse a new
cast here.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's governing council turned down the request
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed,'' said Bert Fink, a spokesman for the
Rodgers and Hammerstein estate. ``It means `Oklahoma!' is, at the
very least, indefinitely postponed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unconnected
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1991, when Kevin Baker was working as the chief
historical researcher for what became Harold Evans' 720-page book
``The American Century,'' he finished a novel he had been writing
in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   He submitted it to Random House, which rejected it, even though
Evans was the president and publisher of Random House's trade group
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't read it himself,'' Baker said. ``It was about
baseball and Ty Cobb, which isn't his area of expertise, and it was
turned down there. I thought, what kind of career do I have here?
I'm on good terms with the president of the company and it doesn't
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Crown published that book, and Baker began another,
``Dreamland.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Evans was no help. ``He had just left Random
House by the time I got this in shape to send out,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   So HarperCollins is publishing ``Dreamland.'' For the record,
Knopf, a Random House imprint, published ``The American Century.''

ONCE, RACISM MEANT LEAVING HARLEM ALONE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fall of 1963, a rookie patrolman named David
Durk reported for duty to the 28th precinct in Harlem. Durk, who
would later achieve fame for fighting police corruption, recalled
listening with other new officers as the sergeant read a primer
about Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant quoted Adam Clayton Powell Jr. on Harlem's arrest
rate, which was eight times the city average _ and, to Powell,
proof of police racism. The sergeant kept reading the primer,
according to an account of the scene in Durk's biography,
``Crusader,'' by James Lardner:
</P>
<P>
   `` `This is a vibrant, vital community,' the sergeant read,
without much conviction. He put down the clipboard and looked his
men in the eye: ``All right. I'll skip the rest of this
[expletive). I want you to go out there. Don't lose sight of your
partner, don't go down any block alone, don't go into any
buildings, and no arrests unless you're personally assaulted.'''
</P>
<P>
   Durk and his partner, a fellow white officer, were assigned a
beat on Lenox Avenue, where men were gambling on the sidewalk. The
patrolmen, according to the biography, politely let the game go on.
They and many other officers spent the evening at a theater
watching a Tarzan movie.
</P>
<P>
   Well, some might say today, at least those officers weren't out
killing unarmed black men. But other people were. The next year the
number of homicides in New York rose above 600 for the first time.
By 1968, as the toll neared 1,000 (it eventually exceeded 2,000 in
1990), the front page of The New York Times carried a headline:
``NAACP Deplores Harlem Terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The article described a report from the New York branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which
expressed shock at the number of criminals ``who are permitted to
roam the streets and hallways without hindrance.'' It demanded
tougher jail sentences, armed guards in housing projects and more
police officers in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not police brutality that makes people afraid to walk
the streets at night,'' one of the report's authors, Vincent Baker,
said at the time, explaining that the chief problem for blacks was
``criminal brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   His words may sound odd today, as ministers and politicians from
the Bronx to West Africa are protesting overly aggressive policing,
but the worst form of police racism used to consist of doing
nothing about crimes involving only blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere in Southern Negro communities, I have met the
complaint from law-abiding Negroes that they are left practically
without police protection,'' Gunnar Myrdal wrote in his classic
1944 treatise on race, ``An American Dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever mistakes were made by the white members of the street
crimes unit who fired at Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4, they were not
guilty of ignoring black-on-black crime. They were searching for a
black serial rapist who had been attacking women in black and
Hispanic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time, a special police squad like that would have
been hunting for jewel thieves on the Upper East Side instead of a
rapist in a poor neighborhood,'' said Thomas A. Reppetto, president
of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. ``Certain
ghettos were written off by police as areas where nothing could be
done about crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are many alternatives to doing nothing. The
police could still combat crime in the Bronx without stopping as
many young black and Hispanic men as they have been doing. It can
be argued that many of these encounters are ill advised because
they're too risky and arouse too much resentment in the innocent
people who are stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters already demanding jail terms for the officers
who shot Diallo might consider who will be hurt if the police turn
more passive. Blacks suffer disproportionately from violence, and
it's not usually from whites in the police force or anywhere else.
Most black victims, like most white victims, are attacked by
members of their own race. (In the case of interracial crimes of
violence, a great majority of victims nationwide are white.)
</P>
<P>
   So if the police are searching less aggressively for that serial
rapist, who is believed to have struck again on Sunday, the chief
victims will probably be black and Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a rise in the number of homicides _ which are down
to the level of the early 1960s _ the victims would be mainly black
and Hispanic men. The police would do just fine if they stopped
bothering strangers at night. They'd be much safer watching a
Tarzan movie.

STRIKE BY BIGGEST GERMAN UNION IS AVERTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; total rewrite.)  (lh) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Germany's largest union reached an
agreement with employers early Thursday, averting what would have
been the nation's first strike in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The union, IG Metall, which represents 3.5 million
metal-industry workers and others, agreed with big employers on pay
raises totaling 3.2 percent, to be paid over 14 months beginning
March 1. They also agreed to a 1 percent bonus not linked to
company profit. The union strongly opposed profit-linked bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   IG Metall had been holding out for raises of more than 4
percent, plus a significant one-time payment to each worker. The
employers, which include DaimlerChrysler and big producers of
machine tools and other factory equipment, had offered a 2.3
percent raise and a maximum one-time payment of five-tenths of a
percent of a worker's salary.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came more than two hours after a midnight strike
authorization deadline for workers in the state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to most of the country's auto industry. A
strike in the state could have slowed production at
DaimlerChrysler, Porsche AG, Volkswagen AG's Audi unit and Robert
Bosch GmbH.
</P>
<P>
   The union originally set a deadline for talks on Feb. 11. When
both sides refused to budge, the government offered to mediate.
Union leaders agreed to resume talks on Tuesday in Stuttgart,
setting the new deadline of midnight Wednesday. Barring success,
the union said, its members would vote to strike on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation was bitter and came at a difficult time.
German workers are among the highest paid in the world, but
unemployment in this country remains above 10 percent, and the
economy has slowed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   IG Metall has been hammered by the loss of nearly a million
industrial jobs since 1990, and union leaders have settled for
negligible wage increases for the last three years. They have made
big concessions on extra pay for overtime and on weekend work. And
they have watched as many companies in eastern Germany refused to
negotiate with them at all. But this time the union, proclaiming
``an end to modesty,'' pressed its most aggressive wage demands in
years.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute posed a hard challenge for Germany's new Social
Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who made unemployment the
central issue of his election campaign last fall. A major strike
would almost certainly have ruined Schroeder's plans to create jobs
through his ``Alliance for Jobs'' _ a series of round-table talks
between industry, unions and the government. Yet Schroeder could
not afford to alienate unions, which have enormous power in his
Social Democratic Party. Indeed, the new labor minister, Walter
Riester, is the former vice chairman of IG Metall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   German factory workers earn an average of $30.20 an hour,
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in Paris. That makes them the highest paid in the world
and well ahead of their American counterparts, with an average of
$23.60 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the average take-home pay of German workers has been
stagnant for the last three years, after accounting for inflation
and new tax increases. At the same time, productivity for each
worker has soared because of wage restraint and streamlining in
factories. The government estimates that productivity in
manufacturing industries has climbed 7 percent annually over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders argued that their members were overdue for a
significant raise. ``The industry is earning record profits and
their stocks have increased enormously,'' said Juergen Peters, vice
president of IG Metall. ``The workers have to take part in that, as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin America has
slowed the economy. Most experts think that growth will not exceed
2 percent this year, down from 2.8 percent in 1998, and that
unemployment will remain around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The last strike by IG Metall was in 1995, when workers in
Bavaria remained off the job for two weeks. Before that, the last
truly big strike lasted seven weeks in 1984 in the states of
Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hesse, which led to a reduction in the
workweek to 35 hours from 37.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, had argued that
workers were overdue for a raise because wages have lagged well
behind increases in productivity. ``The workers have to receive a
fair share of what they have produced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists argue that a surge in labor costs would
aggravate unemployment. ``The moderate wage policies in recent
years have brought about an improvement, and they should be
continued,'' said Harmen Lehment of the Institute for World
Economics at the University of Kiel. ``What we don't want to see is
a repeat of 1995, when we had strikes in Bavaria and big wage
increases followed by rising unemployment. The moderate wage
policies in recent years should be continued.''

TRINIDAD: TALE OF THE TAPE OR BATTLE OF THE BULGE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was speculation during last week's World Boxing Council
welterweight showdown between Oscar De La Hoya and Ike Quartey that
Felix Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion, weighed as much as 156 pounds with less than two weeks to
go before he climbed into the ring against Pernell Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, before a news conference to publicize the
fight, Trinidad's father, manager and trainer, Felix Sr., frowned
at the assertion that his son is having trouble making the weight
for Saturday's bout at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official weigh-in is going to be Friday,'' he said. ``If
he goes on the scale, he will weigh in at 147 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, 26, is coming off a 10-month layoff. When he started
training camp for the Whitaker fight two months ago, he weighed 162
pounds. He is definitely outgrowing the division, but he is trying
to hang in there for the big-money fights.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that Trinidad (33-0) fought in Madison Square
Garden, he weighed 154 pounds, but that was the prescribed weight
for his bout against Troy Waters on Aug. 23, 1997. Trinidad was
supposed to fight Terry Norris for his IBF superwelterweight title.
But Norris backed out of the bout, hoping to get a more lucrative
shot at De La Hoya. Trinidad scored a first-round technical
knockout over Waters. Norris later lost his title to Keith Mullings
and saw his payday against De La Hoya go up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Trinidad is positioning himself for a lucrative bout
against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Don King, Trinidad's promoter, attended Wednesday's news
conference after giving a deposition in Mike Tyson's lawsuit
against him.
</P>
<P>
   King issued a challenge to De La Hoya for the winner of the
Whitaker-Trinidad bout. ``We're talking about Oscar De La Hoya's
talent, we're talking about his guts, we're talking about his
machismo,'' King said. ``The man cannot live with himself if he
doesn't meet this challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   A fight with De La Hoya would hold no intrigue for Whitaker,
because he has already faced De La Hoya. Whitaker lost his WBC
title to De La Hoya in a controversial 12-round decision in 1997.
Whitaker still believes he won the fight, and it's difficult to
find anyone who disagrees with him.
</P>
<P>
   But for Trinidad, it would be a golden opportunity to
demonstrate his skills as a boxer and a puncher. His 88 percent
knockout rate (29 knockouts in 33 fights) is one of the highest in
boxing. Trinidad has been insisting upon parity in pay if he meets
De La Hoya, but it's a tough sell, because he can't drive the
promotion. De La Hoya is vastly more popular.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to understand why Trinidad is not a more popular
fighter in the United States. He has held his title longer than any
of the current welterweight champions, winning it in 1993 by
knocking out Maurice Blocker in the second round. And his skills
are matchless. But he speaks little English and lives with his
family and spends much of his time at his home in Cupey Alto,
Puerto Rico, where he raises horses. And he hasn't been marketed
the way De La Hoya has.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trinidad has not been the focus of King's attention. But that
could change now that a potentially lucrative match against De La
Hoya lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Trinidad grew frustrated with King, because he didn't
believe King was interested in getting him big fights. So, he filed
a lawsuit against King to get out of his contract and signed a new
deal with Main Events. He was supposed to fight Quartey last
November. But U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna ruled against
Trinidad, and the fighter ended up signing a new deal with King.
It's a $49.9 million contract that has a three-fight, four-year
term, but realistically will last as long as Trinidad can fight.
The Whitaker fight is the first under the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker is a crafty fighter, who makes his opponents look bad.
Plus, he's a left-hander. Trinidad said he has fought left-handers
before and will be looking to end it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fighter wants to end a fight in the quickest way,''
Trinidad said. ``If I hit him with the first punch then I'll try to
end the fight.''

   TANNERSVILLE, Pa. _ Until recently, the two accepted ways of
getting down a mountain have been either to strap two long, thin
boards to one's boots and slide down, or to firmly attach one's
feet to a single board and do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's skiboarding, a gleeful mix of skiing, snowboarding,
ice skating and in-line skating that could well be the next big
thing. Also called snowblades, ski blades, mini-skis, microskis and
in-line skis, skiboards are twin-tipped boards about half as long
and twice as wide as regular skis that attach to regular ski boots
(or hard-shell snowboard boots) with a fixed, nonreleasable
binding.
</P>
<P>
   Skiboards can spin like skates, and go backward and forward,
carve and get big air like snowboards, but unlike snowboards, the
two-footed design wipes out the long learning curve for the sport.
Likewise, the short length (usually from 70-90 centimeters _ about
28-36 inches) eliminates the crossed tips and face plants that
often frustrate novice skiers and drive them off the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting a lot of calls about skiboards from people
who are tired of trying to get good on skis,'' said Doc Roberts,
49, a skiboard dealer from Boulder, Colo. ``Skiboards are not much
longer than snowshoes and we've seen not only skiers but
snowboarders and skaters converting as well. They're just plain
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At Camelback Mountain recently, a team of skiers and riders
ranging in age from 12 to 47 years old tested three different makes
of skiboards _ the Kosmos Comp ($349), which look like mini
snowboards for your feet; the original Salomon SnowBlade ($249),
which is widely available for rent at ski areas, and the Gauer
Blades ($250), which are intended for snow dancing and tricks. The
testing took place on Camelback's many wide novice and intermediate
cruising trails and on some of the more challenging trails in the
Poconos as well.
</P>
<P>
   The overall verdict?
</P>
<P>
   With its 10-second learning curve, skiboarding offered virtually
instant fun for everyone. All three products were pronounced cool
by the younger skiers and riders, who enjoyed the feeling of skiing
while being able to do tricks as if they were on in-line skates or
go off hits as if they were on a snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   The older testers, who ranged in ability from terminal
intermediate to professional ski instructor, also gave the
skiboards a thumbs up, particularly the Kosmos Comp, which seemed
more like an actual piece of equipment rather than just a snow toy.
At 77 centimeters (about 32 inches) long, even the intermediates
skiboarders were able to carve like pros and handle Camelback's
tougher terrain with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-centimeter (about 36 inches) Gauer Blade, manufactured in
Italy for its designer, the snow dancer Richard Gauer of Sparta,
N.J., looks more like a cut-down ski than a skiboard. Like a figure
skate, the boards are actually curved upward from the center, which
makes spins and tricks very easy and made them popular with the
younger testers.
</P>
<P>
   The original Salomon SnowBlades, which this year are called
Buzz, handled more like an in-line skate or even an ice skate.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon was the first big company to market skiboards (K2 has
since come out with the Fatty while Dynastar is promoting its Twin)
and its SnowBlades are available for rent at many resorts,
including Camelback. The one drawback is the height limitation _
users must be over 5 feet tall and weigh more than 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Line is one of the companies that has jumped into this gap with
its Kicker 76, a 76-centimeter (about 30 inches) model for
skiboarders under 5 feet. It was tested at Okemo recently and was
highly rated by the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original Big Foot, made by KD Sports, came out more
than a decade ago, skiboarding did not exist as a sport until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Line Skiboards, the industry leader, is holding demo days on
Feb. 27-28 at Stratton Mountain and on March 6-7 at Mount Snow;
their products, including the junior skiboard for those under 5
feet tall, are available for rent at Sports Odyssey, both at Mount
Snow in Maine and in Ludlow, Vt. (802-228-2001).
</P>
<P>
   The Dynastar Twin is available for demo at Sugarbush and
Stratton in Vermont and Sunday River in Maine and other resorts
through the country, while Okemo Mountain is offering free Salomon
SnowBlade Demo Days on Friday, March 5 and March 19. &QL;

HARTFORD'S NEW SCHOOL CHIEF PLEDGES TO PUT A LAPTOP IN EVERY
BACKPACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The Hartford school system, so troubled that
it has spent the last two years under state control, hired one of
New York City's most innovative educators Wednesday as its eighth
superintendent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new school chief, Anthony S. Amato, has spent the last 12
years as superintendent of District 6 in upper Manhattan, where he
won a reputation for persuading parents and corporations to help
rescue a poor and crowded district. When he takes office on April
1, he will head a system that has consistently ranked last in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Like a motivational speaker with Santa's pack on his back, Amato
immediately took the stage Wednesday in the gymnasium at Hartford
High School, which was stripped of its accreditation two years ago,
and pledged to help put a laptop in every backpack, a free Internet
connection in every pupil's home, and a school in each quadrant of
the city that will offer dental, legal and medical services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you as I stand here: Hartford will not be last at
this time next year,'' Amato said to a burst of applause. ``And we
will never be last again.'' Promising a busy summer of planning,
purchasing and training, he added: ``You're not going to have to
wait too long. I'm not about waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   In another setting, the many promises and the can-do brashness
might have seemed overbearing, but the words were welcome in a city
where the schools have produced little but embarrassment. ``We
can't aim for No. 1,'' said Ana V. Ortiz, the principal of Betances
Elementary School. ``But we need to aim to get closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Amato, 51, who moves from a district with 28,000 pupils to a
citywide system with 4,000 fewer, is known for his emphasis on
basics, updated with a heavy dollop of technology. When Bill Gates,
the chairman of Microsoft, was looking for a school to visit as he
sought to polish his image last year, he chose a sixth-grade class
at Mott Hall School, in Amato's district.
</P>
<P>
   When Amato arrived in District 6 in 1987, it ranked last in
reading out of New York's 32 local school districts and 23rd in
mathematics. Last year, it had risen to 19th in reading and 13th in
math. Among schools with similar poverty levels, the district
ranked among the top three in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He imposed a uniform curriculum on all schools in the district,
and established leadership teams of parents and teachers well in
advance of a citywide deadline to do so. And he helped set up six
schools that stay open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., providing medical
and educational services not just to students but to their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Amato said he planned to bring to Hartford his plan
that provided laptop computers to 3,000 pupils, paid for partly by
their parents and partly by the school district and Microsoft. He
also promised free Internet access to every school family in
Hartford, to allow e-mail between parents and teachers, and the
fetching of research materials online.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas Amato said he planned to import from New York
were a six-week summer training program for parents and instruction
in child care that begins ``even before conception.'' In addition,
he said he wanted to help parents with their own educations, from
literacy through master's degree programs.

GERMANY, CLINTON JOIN DRIVE TO STOP EXECUTION OF 2 BROTHERS IN
ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From President Clinton to Gov. Jane Hull, the German
government is putting on a full court press to try to save the
lives of two brothers scheduled to be executed for a grisly 1982
murder.
</P>
<P>
   German citizens Karl and Walter LaGrand, who were born in
Germany and raised in southern Arizona, are scheduled to go to the
gas chamber at the Arizona State Prison in Florence, Karl next
Wednesday and Walter on March 3, for the 1982 murder of Marana bank
manager Kenneth Hartsock.
</P>
<P>
   That the brothers chose gas for death, given the country's Nazi
Holocaust past, isn't the only thing unusual. Four of the five
German nationals on death rows in U.S. prisons are in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone back decades and decades looking for other German
nationals executed in the U.S. and haven't found any,'' said Jean
Pierre Rollin, Germany's deputy counsel general in Los Angeles.
``Now, we possibly have two in Arizona in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange. It certainly has raised a lot of attention
in Germany and throughout Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two Germans, brothers Rudi and Michael Apelt, are on
death row at Florence for the 1988 killing of Michael Apelt's
U.S.-born wife in hopes of cashing in on a $400,000 insurance
policy. The only other German death-row inmate is in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   German officials are hoping for the same results as Mexican
diplomats, who were instrumental in getting the death sentence of
double murderer Ramon Martinez-Villareal stayed by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1997. Efforts by the Honduran government to save the life
of citizen Jose Roberto Villafuerte last April were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Hull met for 30 minutes with Germany's top two diplomats in the
U.S. on Tuesday about the cases. Top German government officials in
Bonn also have contacted President Clinton, Attorney General Janet
Reno and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, pleading for
clemency. German representatives of Amnesty International are
planning to file an appeal in the World Court.
</P>
<P>
   A large contingent of German officials and media are expected to
attend Karl LaGrand's hearing before the State Board of Executive
Clemency next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From Munich to Hamburg, the media have been saturated in recent
weeks with death-row feature stories about the LaGrand brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Hull listened to all of their concerns,'' said Francie
Noyes, the governor's spokeswoman. ``But one thing in her mind
always is the victim and family members of the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, 35-year-old Karl LaGrand was the
third of three illegitimate children from different GI fathers born
to their German mother, Emma, in the small Bavarian city of
Augsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother then married a U.S. Army soldier, who adopted the
children, and the family moved to this country in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was a troubled child who first got in trouble with the law
at age 9 when he stole $9.69 from a store in Sierra Vista and a
pair of shoes from another store two months later. Emma LaGrand
said that Karl and Walter also set fire to a golf course, which did
$20,000 damage, while the family lived at a military post in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Karl bounced between home, programs for troubled youths and
juvenile centers until he and Walter were convicted of the armed
robbery of three Tucson supermarkets in a six-day period in 1981.
They both were imprisoned at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl never wanted to learn. He always got F's in school,''
Emma LaGrand told Pima County probation workers. ``They (Karl and
Walter) liked to run around like dogs. They should be treated like
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   After their release, the brothers wanted a quick fix for their
money woes.
</P>
<P>
   So, they drove north on Interstate 10 to the Valley National
Bank in Marana at dawn on the morning of Jan. 7, 1982, waiting for
bank personnel to come to work. They brought a briefcase with a
steak knife, bandanas, electrical tape, police radio scanner and
toy gun inside.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsock, the bank manager, showed up a few minutes later and
brought the U.S. and Arizona flags outside to be raised for the
day. Karl pulled the toy gun and ordered him inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old female teller pulled up a few minutes later. The
two told the LaGrand brothers that they only knew half of the
combination to the safe and that they would have to wait for a
third bank employee to report to work before it could be opened.
Hartsock and the woman were then bound and gagged.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands became increasingly anxious as the other employee
failed to show up. Hartsock, believing that Karl LaGrand was about
to attack the woman, kicked him in the shins. A savage response
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsock's throat was slashed and he suffered 23 other knife
wounds, at least six of which could have been fatal, investigators
said. The woman also was stabbed seven times in the head, side and
shoulder but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Ryan, Karl LaGrand's Tucson attorney, said she thinks she
has ``a good shot'' at getting his death sentence commuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing planned. It was just part of a terrible
accident,'' Ryan said. ``When the victim kicked Karl in the leg, he
grabbed a letter opener and just freaked out. They had been about
to give up and leave at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also said she hopes the clemency board will consider the
prolonged suffering that inmate Donald Eugene Harding suffered when
he was executed by the use of gas in 1992. Lethal injection has
been used in other executions since that time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, German press accounts have focused on the veritable
German colony of death-row inmates that has come about at the
Florence prison, noting that the Apelt brothers are only a couple
of cells removed from the LaGrands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, everybody goes nuts time and again,'' Karl LaGrand told
one German reporter. &QL;

ISLANDERS STOP PENGUINS' 10-VICTORY STREAK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Jaromir Jagr and the Pittsburgh Penguins came
to Long Island having won 10 consecutive games, a span that
stretched over 20 days. And it is probably safe to say that no
Penguin fan figured the winning streak, second-longest in the
league this season, would come to an end against the downtrodden
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened Wednesday night as an inspired
Islanders team outplayed the Penguins on both ends, contained Jagr,
the league's leading scorer, and skated away with an improbable 3-1
victory before 10,148 fans at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders controlled the game from the opening minutes
through the final buzzer, playing a physical, defensively
responsible game anchored by Kenny Jonsson and Rich Pilon. Tommy
Salo, the Islander goalie, was solid with 20 saves and just missed
earning his sixth shutout of the season. But perhaps, most
important for Islander fans, the offense managed to score timely
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reichel scored the Islanders' first goal in the second
period off a rebound, and then Mark Lawrence and Trevor Linden
scored in the third period to secure the victory by the
second-worst team in the Eastern Conference over the third-best
team.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Miller scored the Penguin goal with only 2 minutes 6 seconds
left in the game. Jagr got an assist on the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's goal came on a redirection of a centering pass off
Jiri Slegr's leg and past Peter Skudra, the Penguin goaltender.
Linden put the game out of the Penguins' reach midway in the third
period, also off a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders matched the Penguins' effort and intensity early
in the game and were rewarded. After a scoreless opening period,
the Islanders cranked it up a notch and scored the only goal in the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel chipped in a rebound at 12:24 to give the Islanders a
1-0 lead. Zigmund Palffy took the first shot, and Reichel was in
front of Skudra to backhand the puck underneath the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders kept Jagr and the rest of the Penguins'
league-leading offense under wraps through two periods. Jagr, who
leads the National Hockey League in scoring, has 27 goals and 59
assists in 53 games and is favored to win his third league scoring
title in five seasons. During the Penguins' streak, Jagr had 26
points, with 6 games of 3 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr gave the Penguins a scare in the second period when he got
up grimacing after he was slashed on the hand by Pilon. Jagr
immediately shook off his glove and skated to the bench. He
returned to the game a few minutes later.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jagr said recently he and other elite players who rely on speed
and finesse were benefiting from the league's crackdown this season
on holding, clutching and grabbing. For years, those tactics have
allowed marginally talented players to pull down the quality of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr's leadership has also been more of a factor this season.
Having succeeded Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain, he is more
vocal in the locker room and on the bench. And many of his
teammates say that his leadership has rallied the team.
</P>
<P>
   He may have the most points, but Jagr is not the only player
behind the Penguins' success. Since moving to Jagr's line, Miller
has 11 goals and 18 points in the last 12 games. Martin Straka,
another former Islander, has 24 goals and 33 assists and made the
All-Star team this season. And Aleksei Kovalev, who was traded from
the Rangers for Petr Nedved two and a half months ago, has 18 goals
since joining the Penguins.

CLOCK BEGINS TICKING TO AVERT STRIKE AGAINST AMERICA WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON AND PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With America West jets taking off every few minutes in
the background, the airline's flight attendants on Wednesday
started a countdown to a strike that would ground flights at a few
minutes' notice.
</P>
<P>
   The clock on the federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period
between management and the Association of Flight Attendants union
has started ticking and officially ends at 10 p.m. Arizona time on
March 19, a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a contract agreement is reached by then _ something both
sides say they will strive for in stepped-up talks over pay issues
_ the union will start its long-threatened CHAOS campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to a total walkout, CHAOS stands for Create Havoc
Around our System and involves intermittent walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can design it any way we want to,'' Bill McGlashen,
president of the AFA Council 66 at America West, said in announcing
the strike countdown at Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be one-hour strikes here and there. It could be strikes
on flights headed to the East Coast, or flights heading to the West
Coast. A two-day shutdown. A four-day shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   America West won't know what's on tap until it gets a call from
a union official saying that flight attendants won't be staffing
certain flights, McGlashen said. That could occur as little as 15
minutes before takeoff, he said. Flight attendants will not walk
off any flights after they have boarded, however, because that
would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   America West, Sky Harbor's busiest carrier, with 214 daily
departures, could opt to shut down entirely to avoid a string of
last-minute surprises for customers.
</P>
<P>
   CHAOS ``may require AWA to shut down its operations and furlough
many of its employees in order to protect our customers from
service disruptions,'' Richard Goodmanson, president and chief
operating officer, said in a memo to employees last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The notice about possible layoffs, which the airline said could
occur as early as March 15, is required by the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act.
</P>
<P>
   A strike, which would hit in the peak of the Valley's tourist
season, would come after four years of often tense negotiations
between the two sides. A tentative contract was overwhelmingly
rejected by the flight attendants in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other offers have been bandied about, but union leaders say
America West's offer is $16.5 million less than what they are
seeking for the 2,400 America West flight attendants. Over a
five-year contract, that amounts to $3.3 million a year in salary
that divides the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants to increase top salaries from about $22,000
annually to $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   America West says on average its flight attendants are paid
$22,856 annually for about 29 hours per week of work, which does
not include their time for layovers or overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here because we want to get rich and we have dollar
signs in our eyes,'' McGlashen said. ``We're here because we want a
fair, reasonable agreement. That's what the union has on the table.
What the company has on the table . . . doesn't recognize the
sacrifices that employees have made'' since the carrier's
bankruptcy reorganization in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers will hear plenty from the flight attendants in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday at the Camelback Esplanade in Phoenix, the
union will hand out pamphlets warning of the strike and the union's
position. The campaign will continue with meetings with companies
that book a lot of travel on America West, as well as students
planning spring break trips.
</P>
<P>
   The union is calling it an educational campaign, but the intent
is clear: Get the public to put more pressure on America West
management to settle.
</P>
<P>
   No negotiations are now scheduled, McGlashen said, but the plan
is to have non-stop talks to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   America West concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Number One goal is to reach a fair and responsible
agreement with the flight attendants and avoid any disruption of
service to our customers,'' Greg Garger, vice president of labor
relations, said in a statement. ``We are hopeful we will achieve
that over the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would be welcome news to the Valley's tourist
industry and the throngs of travelers who live here and help make
America West the top airline at Sky Harbor International Airport,
with about 42 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The strike would start the weekend that the NCAA West Regional
mens basketball tournament is to be played at America West Arena.
Games are scheduled March 18 and March 20. Also that weekend is the
LPGA Standard Register Ping golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There would be 10 days of spring training baseball games left, a
couple of big conventions, and countless vacations scheduled at the
Valley's resorts and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For local travelers, it could disrupt spring break plans,
business trips and, possibly, Easter vacations. &QL;

U.S. LOOKS AT RACIAL PROFILING IN N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Federal civil rights officials disclosed
Wednesday that they have been investigating the New Jersey State
Police for more than two years to determine whether troopers
illegally target black motorists on state highways.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from defense lawyers, black leaders and
even some troopers, Justice Department officials acknowledged that
they have been conducting a ``pattern and practice'' investigation
focusing on so-called racial profiling _ the tactic of stopping
motorists not because they are breaking the law, but solely because
of the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was apparently spawned by a 1996 court case in which
a state judge ruled that troopers in southern New Jersey had indeed
targeted motorists using race-based profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for a federal investigation grew last year after state
troopers patrolling the New Jersey Turnpike shot at a van carrying
three black men and one Hispanic man, wounding three of them, but
federal officials never publicly acknowledged that such an inquiry
was already under way.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Justice Department's civil rights
division have reviewed troopers' arrest reports, court testimony
about tactics used on the force, statistical breakdowns of police
activity and a variety of training and procedural manuals,
according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal pattern and practice law, if Justice
Department attorneys find convincing evidence that troopers engaged
in discriminatory behavior, the government can file a suit against
the State Police and ask a judge to order reforms. But Christine
DiBartolo, a spokeswoman for the civil rights division, said it was
still unclear when the Justice Department would decide whether to
pursue a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we've been looking at this department for
some time now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman has denounced racial profiling as illegal,
and vowed that she would not tolerate such tactics. Faced with
rising complaints, this month she ordered state Attorney General
Peter Verniero to review the force's practices, but as recently as
Tuesday she spoke of a federal investigation as only a possibility,
rather than as a process already well under way.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero expressed surprise Wednesday that federal officials had
described their actions as an investigation, because he had
considered his dealings with the Justice Department to be part of a
routine, cooperative assessment, he said. ``If this is an
investigation, I'd like to know when we'll find out the results,''
he said. ``But whether or not the Justice Department ratchets this
up to an investigation, I have an obligation to carry out my own
review.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected to finish his assessment within four months.
</P>
<P>
   But many defense lawyers and civil rights advocates objected to
the choice of Verniero to assess the state police agency because
his office is defending the state police in an appeal of the 1996
court decision, which found that some troopers routinely practiced
racial profiling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The political and legal controversy over racial profiling was
rekindled after the shootings in April. Troopers fired 11 shots at
the four unarmed men inside the van.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, three current and former troopers have filed
lawsuits alleging that they were forced to target black motorists
in an effort to raise their arrest and gun seizure statistics and
the agency's as well. Early this month, The Star-Ledger of Newark
reported that during the first two months of 1997, blacks made up
75 percent of the people arrested by troopers on the N.J. Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a group of influential black ministers and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People asked
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to intervene, saying they did not
trust the state to investigate its own police force. The ministers
also called for the dismissal of Col. Carl A. Williams, the state
police superintendent, saying he could not correct the problem
because he has refused to acknowledge mounting evidence that racial
profiling has been encouraged or tolerated by troopers for years.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has steadfastly denied that troopers engage in
profiling, said he had no intention of resigning. He said he was
already directing a variety of policy changes to improve relations
with members of N.J.'s minority groups and to recruit more blacks
and Hispanic people to the force.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey Wintner, the public defender who won the 1996 ruling
that first established the existence of racial profiling, said he
was surprised that federal authorities had not already taken
action. Wintner was contacted by investigators from the Justice
Department's civil rights division in late 1996 and has provided
them with information on several subsequent occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been sitting there for years, out in the open, in
public,'' he said. ``Something has to be done.''

BUY OR RENT? SKIERS MUST DECIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART BENTLEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. _ To buy or not to buy? It would perplex
even Hamlet if he were weighing the options of buying or renting a
pair of skis.
</P>
<P>
   Given the changes in the past three years in shape, length and
design of boards, especially those in the high-performance
categories favored by advanced skiers that can exceed $700 a pair,
it's a fair question. And it becomes even more relevant to a skier
who logs no more than a few days on the mountain a year but
appreciates and wants to use the latest top-of-the-line equipment.
</P>
<P>
   There are sound economic reasons for renting premium ``demo''
skis for a few outings a year. At Bear Mountain, for example, such
a pair will cost $28 per day. Nearby ski shops charge up to $30.
</P>
<P>
   Similar rates prevail at other resorts and customers without
skies of their own willingly pay them. Simple arithmetic reveals
that five days on skis at $28 a day will cost $140; 10 days, $280.
</P>
<P>
   And skiers can experiment with a different set every day,
experiencing the effects of variable sidecuts, lengths, widths and
flex patterns. These characteristics determine how a ski performs _
whether it makes long-radius turns, for example, or short, tight
arcs. How readily it carves when tipped on edge. Whether it's
responsive, snappy and precise underfoot, or quick from edge to
edge, or floats in powder or blasts through crud. Or whether it's
stable or erratic at speed.
</P>
<P>
   If a skier spends $140 per year on demo skis, it would take five
years to eat up the cash needed to purchase that $700 pair he was
eyeing. At the rate technology and design have been changing
recently, that new pair could have long since become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bollingmo, owner of Alpine Sports Center in Big Bear Lake,
sees ``a bit of a trend'' toward renting instead of buying high-end
skis. However, he does not consider it a threat to the financial
health of his store, which, like most similar enterprises, is
primarily in business to sell equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody who skis five times a year can ski on the latest and
greatest and never have to own,'' Bollingmo said. ``It's a concern
but it's not something that's been a huge alarm to me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Demo skis, as the term suggests, are intended to demonstrate a
ski's attributes and help renters decide what boards to buy.
Typically, shops will deduct some of the rental charges from the
purchase price. Sports Limited in Woodland Hills, for instance,
which charges $30 for the day to rent demos and $10 per day
thereafter, will knock $40 off the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But some shop personnel maintain there also is a significant
disadvantage to relying exclusive on a variety of rentals. They
contend that skiers who choose this course never find a ski upon
which they're comfortable because it takes time to become fully
accustomed to a ski's traits _ a comfort level that usually comes
with the purchase of a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's a convenience factor. Many people ski at very busy
times _ weekends and holidays _ when there is a greater risk the
ski they prefer is unavailable. Or they have to wait for it to be
returned. If the waiting is done at the hill, that cuts into ski
time, which does not come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Rosenberg at Sports Limited has a word of caution for
those who expect skis to change significantly in design.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is that skis are not going to change
that much more in shape because it costs the industry so much to
keep putting new designs out there,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few would argue the value of trying before buying _ and ski
resorts try to make it easy. At Snow Summit, skiers can step into
as many Rossignol models as they wish during a two-hour period for
$5. Bear Mountain offers the same terms on Dynastar skis during a
four-hour period for $15.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Blevins, proprietor of Skyline Ski and Sports in Big Bear
Lake, offers a sound suggestion for those planning to compare the
performance of different skis: Use only one pair of boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you want is one variable, and that should be the skis,''
he said.

 &HT;    Lawmakers: Big budget increase for UT unlikely
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some key Texas lawmakers, citing lavish athletic
spending and other budget priorities, say the University of Texas
System stands little chance of getting the $85 million in
additional state aid it is seeking for staff pay raises and
recruitment programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will happen,'' said Rep. Rob Junell (D-San
Angelo), chairman of the budget-writing House Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they generate much outside support for their
cause,'' Junell said Wednesday. ``What (the public) sees is the
football stadium, the football coach and some of the excesses that
occur on the college campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Junell's sentiment was echoed this week by several lawmakers
reviewing UT's budget request, which is six times more than the $14
million increase that budget writers recommended in state aid for
the 2000-01 budget years.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, lawmakers allocated $600 million in new state aid
to Texas public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, UT's all-out pitch for more money by its top
brass _ including UT System Chancellor William Cunningham and
UT-Austin President Larry Faulkner _ is being heavily scrutinized
by lawmakers, who are questioning whether the university should
divert some of its athletic gate receipts to academic programs
instead of relying so heavily on state aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You depend on the state dollars for recruiting students when
you have access to millions,'' said Sen. Carlos Truan (D-Corpus
Christi). ``Why can't you use the dollars from the ticket sales of
the football games? Is there a constitutional clause that prevents
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Limiting UT's budget increase to $14 million would hit the
university hard, said Faulkner. He told lawmakers UT needs at least
$66 million over the two-year budget cycle to provide pay raises
for graduate assistants, staff and faculty. He also wants to
finance recruitment programs and other ``essential needs,''
including hiring new faculty to help reduce student-to-faculty
ratios to about 23 students to one instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Legislative Budget Board's proposed $14 million
in additional state aid, UT-Austin would gain another $12 million
from tuition increases, for a total of $26 million from state and
tuition sources. But Faulkner said if the current budget proposal
were adopted, UT would be $40 million in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortfall, Faulkner said UT would finance $56
million in pay raises, including a 10 percent hike for graduate
assistants, 6 percent for staff and 4 percent for faculty. The
shortfall would be covered by ``freezing or severely limiting
hiring,'' a move that would drive up class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to fund them,'' he said of the pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries of about 12,000 nonteaching staff at UT _ everyone from
janitors to student advisers and research technicians _ have been
an issue for years. The UT University Staff Association plans to
protest pay scales at the Capitol today.
</P>
<P>
   Reports last year said nine of 10 UT staff members were paid
below the Austin market average. Some full-time workers make as
little as $14,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the recommended budget, UT is not the only university that
would feel the pinch. The Legislative Budget Board is recommending
that the public university system receive $4.1 billion for the
upcoming two-year budget cycle. That is about $1.2 billion less
than university leaders want.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and five other university chancellors cited data that
showed Texas will enroll about 9,000 new students annually in
colleges and universities. The $1.2 billion, which includes about
$200 million for scholarships and grants, is needed to help bring
Texas up to the national average in enrolling students in and
graduating them from college.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are asking is to reach the national average,''
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of getting $1.2 billion? ``None,'' replied Junell.
</P>
<P>
   Pleas for money are being drowned out by more pressing budget
priorities, including tax cuts and new money for public education
proposed by Gov. George W. Bush. Bush has pledged to cut property
taxes by $2 billion, other taxes by about $500,000, and to increase
funding for public schools by $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
said it will be difficult to provide significant increases to
higher education in light of those priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think higher education is on the bubble, meaning that
they're funding competes directly with tax cuts,'' said Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said UT-Austin would fall farther behind other
flagships, such as the University of California at Berkeley, in
attracting quality faculty and reducing class sizes if UT-Austin
does not receive significantly more than budget writers recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Truan and some other lawmakers questioned UT's commitment to
recruiting African-American and Hispanic students who are not
involved in collegiate athletics, and the school's need for the
money in light of spending on coaches salaries and athletic
facilities. Junell said enrollment has remained flat at UT for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Figures provided by Junell show UT's enrollment declined, from
50,245 students in 1990 to 48,917 this fall. Meanwhile, full-time
employees rose from 12,310 to 13,092 during that same period. At
the same time, state aid rose from about $250 million in 1990 to
about about $317 million in 1999.

MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ELUDE MANY WOULD-BE CITIZENS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mikhail Kholchanskiy turned 80 this month, an age
that few men like him, soldiers and laborers of the former Soviet
Union, ever reach.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives sent cards and presents, but they could not give him
the one gift he craved: becoming a citizen of the United States,
the country that accepted him as a refugee when he fled Ukraine in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   He has tried but, weak and often befuddled since suffering a
stroke and then a heart attack after his arrival in Brooklyn,
Kholchanskiy says he learns a bit of English during the day only to
forget it in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to show how proud I am to be in this country,''
he said in Russian. ``I would like to stand up in front of my
grandchildren and show them that I am a citizen like them.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Kholchanskiy interviewed with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service during his application for citizenship, his
daughter, Lyubov Mikityanskaya, said an INS officer told her that
her father ``didn't deserve anything in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other immigrants whose physical and mental
disabilities are supposed to exempt them from passing the English
proficiency and civics parts of the citizenship exam, Kholchanskiy
was refused a waiver from the INS.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 law requires the INS to accommodate immigrants disabled
by conditions like Alzheimer's disease, mental retardation and
neurological damage from strokes, and whose doctors attest that
they can not retain information sufficiently to pass the language
and civics tests.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from its inception, however, the disability waiver has
been a source of tension and dispute between immigrants and the
INS. It is a benefit, INS officials in Washington acknowledge, that
the agency is still deciding how to best administer and that field
employees sometimes misinterpret in their zeal to detect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, stories like Kholchanskiy's are common. In a case
recounted by lawyers for the New York Immigration Coalition, an INS
officer scolded a 78-year-old Spanish-speaking applicant, saying:
``In this country we speak English. There are always some of you
who try to get the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another INS officer recently rejected a Russian woman's request
for a waiver, telling her to ``find a real doctor, not a Russian,''
according to a lawyer who was present.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the agency's treatment of disabled applicants has
prompted several lawsuits. The latest, a class-action suit brought
by immigrants in southern Florida last fall, accused the INS of
arbitrarily rejecting waiver applications and rejecting out-of-hand
any that mention age-related illnesses like senile dementia and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Miami has denied an INS motion to dismiss the
case and has issued a preliminary injunction to two of the
plaintiffs who faced a second, and final, rejection of their
citizenship applications. A hearing is to be held later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, immigration lawyers are preparing a formal and
unusual collective protest letter about what they call ``multiple
persistent problems'' in the way the regional INS office treats
disabled applicants for citizenship, and in INS guidelines that,
for the first time, appear to demand that immigrants submit copies
of detailed medical records and related diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers for nonprofit groups in New York said they were
also assembling cases in which disabled immigrants had been
arbitrarily denied their rights to a waiver, in hopes of filing a
class-action suit like the one in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Besides verbal abuse, the immigrants' complaints in the New York
area include allegations that INS officers reject disability waiver
requests with no explanation, mislead immigrants on how to proceed
with applications, refuse to accommodate people with speech
impediments or other physical frailties and, above all, routinely
second-guess doctors' diagnoses in direct violation of their own
internal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Washington said that they were aware of the
complaints and that they began to train field employees several
months ago about the rights of the disabled and to help them
determine when doctors had adequately made the medical connection
necessary to obtain a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very useful and very good provision that allows us to
show some humanity and discretion in adjudicating these cases,''
said William R. Yates, acting head of naturalization. ``It is
difficult, however, because our officers do not get medical
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates said the INS had no statistics, either nationally or for
the New York region, on how many disability waivers had been
requested, rejected and granted in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Immigration Coalition, an umbrella organization
for about 200 advocacy groups in the city, said its own informal
survey indicated that out of 300 to 400 applications submitted in
September, only 1 to 2 percent were approved. The figures include
only those disability waiver requests from immigrants represented
by lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants try on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 37-year-old Hispanic woman, whose doctor attested
that she was mentally retarded and could not write even in her
native Spanish, went to the INS with her waiver request and was not
allowed to bring a family member with her to the interview, said
Lauren Dreilinger, a lawyer with the New York Association for New
Americans, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, the field employee emerged and told her
family that he had rejected the waiver and had administered the
English proficiency test. The woman, he said, failed. At a second
naturalization interview a few months later, Ms. Dreilinger said,
the field employee again shrugged off the waiver request and told
her, ``You don't look mentally retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kholchanskiy went for his first interview with the INS, the
field employee asked him questions in English, his daughter said.
He did not understand them, and the officer announced that he had
failed the citizenship test.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said that the second time Kholchanskiy was called
for an interview, in December, an INS supervisor said his waiver
application was insufficient, but refused to say why.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in New York said they did not have information
about the specific incidents, but said that if applicants were
treated rudely, it would be a violation of agency policy.
</P>
<P>
   Until Dec. 30, when field employees received guidelines, there
was not even a form for rejecting a disability waiver or informing
immigrants what was lacking on their application. In New York,
immigration lawyers said, the INS simply told immigrants they had
failed the English test. If an applicant fails the test three
times, naturalization is denied.
</P>
<P>
   To become a citizen, an applicant must have lived in the United
States for five years, be at least 18 years old and of good moral
character, pass a civics test and English test, and take an oath of
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The disability waiver was part of an overhaul of immigration
laws in 1994. Two years later, sweeping changes in the federal
welfare laws eliminated social benefits for noncitizens, triggering
a vast increase in citizenship applications in general.
</P>
<P>
   But it took the INS until the spring of 1997 to issue
administrative regulations for the disability waivers.
</P>
<P>
   By then, one class-action lawsuit accusing the agency of
arbitrarily rejecting applications had been filed by immigrants in
Northern California _ a federal judge eventually dismissed it when
the INS regulations were published _ and complaints from disabled
immigrants seeking to become naturalized were mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Rosenbaum, the plaintiffs' lawyer in the California
suit and now a staff lawyer at Protection and Advocacy, a nonprofit
advocacy group for the disabled in Berkeley, Calif., has filed
three civil rights complaints in the last year with the Justice
Department against the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials say the main problem in administering the
disability waiver program, at least as it is now conceived, is that
field employees are asked to make judgments about medical or
developmental issues that are rarely clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the field employees also have a law enforcement
background and are naturally cautious when reviewing immigrants'
applications, said Gerri Ratliff, the head of the division that is
revising guidelines for the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Matiychenko, a lawyer with the New York Legal Assistance
Group, said she represented a client who had had a stroke, was
confined to a wheelchair and could not speak. The woman submitted
her doctors' diagnosis and copies of an MRI and CAT scans.
</P>
<P>
   A public health service officer who was working as a consultant
to the INS rejected all of it. The officer said he would conduct
his own neurological test, Mrs. Matiychenko recalled, and he asked
the applicant to squeeze his hands. When she did, he declared her
fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now is that an absolute stranger, who knows
nothing about the patient, is making a medical determination,''
Mrs. Matiychenko said.

EVERYBODY GETS INTO THE ACT FOR THE DEVILS

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As the minutes ticked down Wednesday
night, the Devils continued to score goals as if they were in a
practice drill, the game with the Tampa Bay Lightning reduced to a
series of celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils could forget the woes that have been plaguing them on
home ice as they rolled to a 7-1 triumph at Continental Arena. That
a lot of teams get healthy on the Lightning, the worst team in the
National Hockey League, could neither diminish the moment nor sour
the mood. For one night, the Devils could forget the way their
longest homestand of the season began and just enjoy the ending.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Brendan Morrison and Jay Pandolfo in the final four
minutes capped a game in which seven Devils scored in their most
lopsided victory of the season. The outburst gave New Jersey 16
goals in its last three games, two victories and a tie. But even
the Devils know that those numbers may not be enough to send the
team into the post-season intact.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease of Wednesday night's victory, the Devils
struggled to a 2-3-1 record on the homestand. But they improved
their record at home against Tampa Bay to 14-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils scored three times in the first period against former
Devil goaltender Corey Schwab. Schwab, who was 0-3-0 with the
Devils, fell to 0-6-0 against them.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin started the scoring for the Devils just 1 minute
16 seconds into the game, slipping a shot from the right circle
past Schwab. Denis Pederson and Jason Arnott scored within 51
seconds of each other later in the period.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lightning pulled Schwab and replaced him with Bill
Ranford to start the second period, Tampa Bay quickly got a lift,
scoring on a steal and breakaway by Benoit Hogue at 1:05.
</P>
<P>
   But Petr Sykora answered with a goal at 4:26 on a blast from
just inside the blue line, and Scott Niedermayer scored on a pretty
feed from Brylin at 9:21 to give the Devils a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There has been conjecture that the Devils will try to make a
deal before the March 23 trading deadline to bolster their offense
for the stretch run. They have made that kind of move in previous
seasons, acquiring Neal Broten, Doug Gilmour and Dave Andreychuk,
all within a month of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   What the Devils could be searching for _ a veteran offensive
talent _ may be right under their noses and ready to join them in
the form of Andreychuk, a 35-year-old left wing.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day hospital stay to be treated for an infection
that resulted from surgery on his fractured right ankle, Andreychuk
returned to the ice Wednesday for the morning workout. Andreychuk
hopes to make a surprisingly quick return to the lineup. He
fractured the ankle on Jan. 5 and underwent surgery three days
later to have seven pins inserted.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk missed his 20th game Wednesday night, but he is
hoping that the ankle does not swell so he can practice on Thursday
and return to the lineup either Friday in Detroit or Saturday at
home against the Islanders. The original prognosis called for him
to miss as many as 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better than I did before I went in the
hospital,'' Andreychuk said. ``But I did lose some days skating, so
I'm going to need a couple more days of skating. As far as I know,
I'm going to Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Andreychuk will give the ankle its next test in Thursday's
practice, he could have taken the ice Wednesday night and got a
workout no rougher than what assistant coach Vyacheslav Fetisov put
him through in the morning as he skated with a few teammates and
Coach Robbie Ftorek's 14-year-old son, Casey.

TIMING, MONEY ATTRACT STARS TO NISSAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Nissan Open begins today at Riviera Country
Club with a $2.8 million purse and the best field in the 73-year
history of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players ranked in the current world top-10, headed by the
dynamic 1-2 duo of Tiger Woods and David Duval, are on hand.
Twenty-eight others who will join those seven in next week's 64-man
World Match Play Championship at La Costa also are entered.
</P>
<P>
   Many in those two groups have contributed to this year's Nissan
being able to field 22 major winners _ including reigning titlists
Lee Janzen (U.S. Open) and Vijay Singh (PGA Championship).
</P>
<P>
   The best measure of the '99 Nissan depth might be that it could
absorb the late loss of two recent British Open champions _ Tom
Lehman and John Daly withdrew on Monday _ and still have so much
star power remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That depth is partly the result of timing and money _ with a
combined $7.8 million available this week and next, $1.5 million
just to the winners. But one of golf's most-respected players
thinks the quality of this field also has much to do with history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good field and, to me, it's a compliment to the
golf course,'' Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different place, a unique place. It's meant a lot to
our tour, a lot to our golf history. There's been a great legacy
left behind here by Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson, Lloyd Mangrum. . . .
Everybody that has been a great player on tour has played here and
in Los Angeles. A lot of people would love to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's favorites have to include Woods, 23, and Duval, 27,
whose brilliant play is bringing back memories of the Jack
Nicklaus-Arnold Palmer rivalry of the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither has played as many as five full seasons (Duval
joined the tour in '95, Woods late in '96), the two already have
combined for 17 wins, nine by Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Woods broke out of an 11-month victory drought last week at the
Buick Invitational in San Diego, but he had been playing well much
of that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hadn't won,'' said the world's top-ranked player, who
started his career with six wins in less than his first full year,
including a record 12-stroke victory at the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the progress I'd made. I just needed
to be patient. That's just part of the game. It's just a matter of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent names this week include defending champion Billy
Mayfair, who edged Woods in a playoff in last year's Nissan at
Valencia Country Club, and recent champions Corey Pavin, Craig
Stadler and Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   What that latter trio has in common besides Nissan trophies is a
long time on tour _ something that comes into play often in the
winner's circle at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   Pavin, 39, one of only four players _ with MacDonald Smith, Ben
Hogan and Palmer _ to win consecutive Nissans (1994-95), benefited
from course knowledge gained playing Riviera in his UCLA days.
</P>
<P>
   Course familiarity also paid off for 1996 Nissan champ Stadler,
45. The well-aging Walrus from USC who was third at Pebble Beach
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played (Riviera) a zillion times,'' Stadler said at last
week's Buick Invitational, where he included a round of 65 in a
26th-place finish. ``I know it pretty well and always seem to play
well there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old guys, you see them doing well,'' said Bob Burns, the
30-year-old former Cal State Northridge star back on tour after
winning last year's Nike Tour Championship and money title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a traditional old course and there are guys that have
been coming out here for 20 years. Freddie likes this course.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, hardly old but no longer one of the young whiz kids
despite his youthful appearance (the 1992 Masters champ will turn
40 in October), doubts he'll ever pass up a chance to play at
Riviera if he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best courses we play on tour,'' said the man
who won the Nissan at Riviera in 1990 and '92 and finished second
twice there in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Couples likes the way the course suits his left-to-right game,
he loves the small greens and he really appreciates the way the
fans support him _ boisterous roars of ``Boom-Boom'' echoing
through the eucalyptus trees are an annual rite of winter at the
wind-buffeted Pacific Palisades course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't veer too far away from events where I play well,''
Couples said, ``and I don't know how you can get a better course
for a PGA Tour event.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, who has been coming to Riviera almost annually every
year since 1974, agrees with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great part of our tour,'' he said. ``This course
is a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week, it seems, Riviera has a field equipped for the
challenge.

HARD TO JUSTIFY STIPEND FOR PGA PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES _ Starting today, Ben E. Fits is guaranteed
two trips around one of Southern California's loveliest layouts. A
clubhouse buffet, a courtesy car and four clubhouse badges come
with this E-ticket (can you say elitist?) ride through Riviera
Country Club, the course that George C. Thomas designed and Ben
Hogan deified.
</P>
<P>
   Housing doesn't have to be a hassle. There are plenty of people
in Brentwood and Beverly Hills willing to swing open their doors to
Ben E. Fits for nothing more than a couple of tournament badges
and/or the pleasure of his company. Well, that and a few chipping
tips.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets hungry for a sumptuous feast, Ben E. Fits can cover a
week's worth of dinner tabs at the Hotel Bel-Air simply by agreeing
to swing some manufacturer's club or tee up its ball.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing Ben E. Fits can't summon with the snap of
his fingers is a paycheck. He has to earn that by shooting a
36-hole score that's lower than roughly half the 144-man Nissan
Open field. As far as performance curves go, that sure beats Mr.
Johnson's 12th-grade calculus class.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Ben E. Fits has it a whole lot better than a lot of
working stiffs. That would include his caddy, who works dawn to
dusk all week as a greens guru/golden retriever/scapegoat and is
guaranteed only about $800 for his toil and trouble; more if his
man makes the weekend cut.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a victory to raise Ben E. Fits' standard of
living. Goodness gracious, no. In 1998, Bruce Lietzke played in 10
tournaments and earned $377,188. Next to his schedule, commercial
airline pilots, with their 15-hour work weeks and six-figure
salaries, do have room to gripe.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Doug Martin, who mustered one top-10 finish (a tie
for seventh) in 33 events last year and earned $301,718. Think
that's incredible? Consider this: There were 101 golfers who made
more than Martin and seven of them surpassed the $1 million mark
without the benefits of a win.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows there's a lot more gold where that pot came from.
Tournament prize money on the PGA Tour has risen from $96 million
in 1998 to $134 million this year. There are people (accountants
and personal managers, mostly) bracing right now for the
possibility that David Duval or Tiger Woods will surpass the $4
million mark, which is a few thousand dollars more than Arnold
Palmer has earned in official prize money in 45 years as a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Fantasy Island for those equipped to swim with the
sharks. For those who aren't, there's Ben E. Fits' bail-out plan,
as championed by at least four dozen PGA Tour professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Ben E. Fits and Co. think the PGA Tour ought to throw a lifeline
to those golfers who miss the cut every week to help them tread
water until their ship comes in. A $2,000 stipend has been
suggested for those who are victimized by their own missed putts,
scattershot drives and/or leaden iron shots.
</P>
<P>
   If Ben E. Fits had any say in it, Chip Beck would have earned
$68,866 in 1998. As it was, Beck, a former U.S. Ryder Cup team
member, took home $10,866 after making two cuts in 29 tournaments.
That was better than the $10,653 he earned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said Wednesday that Beck deserves to be compensated for
his time and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good enough to earn his card,'' he pointed out. ``He
just happened to go through a dry spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the drought, Beck's career had been marked by El Nino
conditions. In his first 18 years on the Tour, Beck earned more
than $5.9 million. If two arid seasons have parched Beck's savings,
he doesn't need financial compensation, he needs new financial
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   What Ben E. Fits and his cohorts are conveniently forgetting is
that a large part of the appeal of the PGA Tour to its sponsors is
its overt capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Because they can't get the guaranteed contracts that turn a lot
of hungry baseball, football and basketball players into complacent
multimillionaires, golfers are looked upon kindly by Corporate
America. They're viewed as characters straight out of a Horatio
Alger story, starting every year with nothing and gaining success
through their own goodness and courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tattered Tom (Byrum)'', anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about ``Ragged Dick (Mast)''?
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw, the captain of this year's U.S. Ryder Cup team,
has been on the PGA Tour since 1973, long enough to remember
``rabbit'' qualifying on Mondays and $185,000 tournament purses.
</P>
<P>
   For any of their colleagues to call for the deconstruction of a
framework that so many PGA Tour veterans worked tooth and nail to
hammer out, ``is a lot for players who have played so long to
swallow,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, those same players must have choked on
Stiles Mitchell's words. Mitchell, a Nike Tour player whose length
off the tee is John Daly-esque, recently ripped the disparity
between the purses in the Nike and PGA Tours.
</P>
<P>
   If Mitchell thinks a $75,000 gain at the year's end is unworthy
of his talents, perhaps he should pursue a club pro's position
(there are over 300 courses in California alone). Then let us see
if he's so quick to pop off. &QL;

SOUTH TEXAS WOULD BE FINE HOME FOR SPRING TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sultry breezes of South Florida beckon. It's a siren song
I've happily answered every spring for almost a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd trade that Jimmy Buffet melody in an Okeechobee minute
for a new spring-training frontier in South Texas, and it's time
for Rangers president Tom Schieffer to quit tantalizing us with the
prospect and make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer is guilty of two very large mistakes, and we're not
going to let him forget them.
</P>
<P>
   First, he showed what a can-do guy he is by overseeing the
architectural development and construction of The Ballpark in
Arlington, arguably the finest facility of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he happened to mention maybe three years ago that he
could someday envision South Texas as a new spring-training mecca
for major-league teams who are discovering that Florida and Arizona
are not the ideal situations they once were, now that baseball has
located teams in Miami and Tampa-St. Pete and another in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   I say he's a visionary. I say it's time to turn his fantasy
island into reality. And I'm more than willing to play the little
guy that runs around screaming, ``De plane, Boss! De plane!'' to
Schieffer's Mr. Roarke.
</P>
<P>
   Just do it, Tom. And quit wasting time.
</P>
<P>
   If owner Tom Hicks was smart _ and if he was any smarter he'd be
running this country (another idea that might need developing) _
he'd snap his fingers, tell Schieffer to pack his golf clubs and
head due south, and don't come back until he has a concrete plan in
place for developing a new spring-training venue right here in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   I guarantee you, Schieffer can and would get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on it, and I'm not sure we don't need to get
something started,'' Schieffer said with the Rangers'
spring-training camp in Port Charlotte opening today. ``I would
like to do it. It makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes all the sense in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With the Devil Rays and Marlins in Florida and the Diamondbacks
in Phoenix, the magic of spring training has lost some of its
allure to fans in Florida and Arizona. Many are retirees on fixed
incomes. If they're going to see baseball, they reason, why not
save their money for games that really mean something?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, baseball is in danger of overexposure in those two
states. That's why South Texas makes so much sense, especially for
the Rangers and Astros, who can further develop fans and an
intrastate rivalry by sharing spring-training headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, to make it work, it would take at least six teams
committing to the plan,'' Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   So start lining them up. South Texas is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidaglo and Cameron County have gone together to form a sports
authority under the auspices of the Brimer Bill,'' said Cullen
Looney, an Edinburg attorney who once served in the legislature
with Schieffer. ``We have the structure to work with, and that
board has been appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of having a feasibility study done. That's
kind of the next step we're going through, and I think it's going
to come back with a recommendation to move forward and pointing out
ways to get it done. We have a meeting scheduled next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer envisions three spring-training ballparks, complete
with practice facilities for major- and minor-league teams, being
built in the Brownsville-Harlingen-Weslaco-McAllen-Edinburg-Mission
geographical area. The furthest distance, from Brownsville to
Mission, is about 70 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about, by the year 2000, having 1 million
people in a four-county area,'' Looney said, ``and that doesn't
count Mexico. There are probably 2 \Rmillion\S to 3 million people
right across the border, and Monterrey's only about 150 miles
south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this would be a great industry for the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   One major roadblock, a familiar one, stands in the way: Who's
going to pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take some kind of public-private partnership,''
Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   We know that euphemism by now. That means the taxpayer pays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support from the community is very strong for it,'' Looney
said. ``Now, I don't know how much public support there'll be if
you ask people to tax themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems under the Brimer Bill is that we don't
have any room to generate any sales tax money. About the only thing
we've got that could generate any money would be hotel-motel tax,
or automobile rental tax, which would generate some money but won't
generate enough in the big scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The funding of three separate spring-training facilities is no
small challenge, but if anyone can make it work ... well, it's
you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some creativity, something like
\RSchieffer\S was able to put together there in Arlington,'' Looney
said, ``and I think people are open to discuss that.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as I've enjoyed heading to Florida all these years, a
condo on the beach at South Padre sounds even more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Schieffer to don Mr. Roarke's white tropical suit
and make all our fantasies come true.
</P>
<P>
   De plane, Boss. De company plane.

RANGERS ARE AILING, AND THE RESULTS SHOW IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Neil Smith, president and general manager of the
Rangers, attends most home games, but he did not witness Wednesday
night's debacle at Madison Square Garden. Smith was out of town on
a scouting mission, hoping to build a better future for his team.
Had he stayed around, he might have been tempted to boo, hoot or
leave early the way many customers did.
</P>
<P>
   At present, things are bad for the Blue Shirts and getting
worse. In losing 6-3 to the Montreal Canadiens, the Rangers
squandered another chance to move up in the Eastern Conference
playoff race. They lost their fourth game in their last five and
their 10th game in their last 14. At home, they are 1-7 in their
last eight.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Their first-string goalie, Mike Richter, failed to
survive the first period for his second consecutive start. Their
second-best goal scorer, John MacLean, went home early with a nerve
injury in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Want excuses? Sure, there are many. Besides MacLean, the Rangers
played without two other key players, also injured, both
defensemen. They were playing their fourth game in six nights,
never a good thing for a team that depends far too much on veterans
in their 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Want to stress the positive? Mike Knuble of the Rangers broke
out of a 14-game slump without a goal by scoring twice. And Petr
Nedved, slumping with one goal in his previous 13 games, scored a
power-play goal that briefly cut the Montreal lead to two goals
late in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Need a little cockeyed optimism? Depending on the Florida-Dallas
result _ the game Smith was scouting _ the Rangers are only 5, 6 or
7 points behind the Panthers, who hold the eighth and final playoff
berth in the East. With three games in four nights, beginning
Friday, the Rangers could fall out of the race. But a hot streak
could put them right back into contention.
</P>
<P>
   The result gave Montreal a 4-0 record over the Rangers this
season. They won't meet again unless it is in the playoffs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for Rangers and injuries, Wednesday night it was MacLean, who
has 20 goals, leaving in the first period with a ``burner'' in the
neck area. Eric Lacroix, recently acquired in a trade with Los
Angeles, opened a gash on his forehead when he was shoved from
behind into the Montreal crossbar by Turner Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   The officials gave Stevenson a five-minute major penalty and the
Rangers scored a goal during the advantage to cut the Montreal
lead, briefly, to 3-1. Earlier, Stevenson had collided with MacLean
moments before MacLean left the game, but it was not clear if that
check caused the injury.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean left the Garden, but Lacroix returned for the third
period after taking 15 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Already missing for the Rangers were two big defensemen, Jeff
Beukeboom and Peter Popovic. Beukeboom is recovering from his
second concussion of the season and Popovic has blood in his eye
from being hit with a puck. It is not known if MacLean, Beukeboom
or Popovic will be able to play on Friday night at the Garden
against Pittsburgh. Rich Brennan, who was called up from the
Hartford Wolf Pack, was making his Rangers debut as a defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Richter gave up three goals on nine shots and left the game
after 5 minutes 32 seconds. It was the second consecutive game in
which he was pulled after giving up three early goals. It also
happened on Sunday in a 4-2 loss to Detroit at the Garden. Dan
Cloutier played in Nashville on Monday night, a 7-4 victory over
the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Rucinsky gave Montreal a 1-0 lead at 4:25 after a
clearing pass by Adam Graves was intercepted in the Rangers' zone.
Jonas Hoglund made it 2-0 at 4:43 by putting his own rebound past
Richter. The Canadiens got the puck after a turnover by defenseman
Brian Leetch. The captain lost it to Sergei Zholtok after a
miscommunication with Ulf Samuelsson.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal made it 3-0 at 5:32 on a goal by Shayne Corson, who
took the puck away from Samuelsson behind the Rangers' net and beat
Richter with a low shot on a wrap-around move.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Knuble of the Rangers cut the deficit to 3-1 by scoring on
the power play at 6:32 of the second period. Without a goal in 14
games and demoted from higher lines, Knuble got extra ice time
because of MacLean's injury. After a pass from Marc Savard, Knuble
got his 10th of the season when he one-timed a wrist shot from the
right-wing circle that beat goalie Jeff Hackett between the skates.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal went up by 4-1 at 8:40 on a goal by Vincent Damphousse,
who backhanded a shot from the slot with nobody covering him.

JUDGE WANTS NEW PLAN TO HELP PATIENTS IN FAILED HMO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J._ A state judge sternly directed New Jersey
insurance regulators Wednesday to ``go back to the drawing board''
to insure continuity of health coverage for members of the
insolvent HIP Health Plans of New Jersey as the state moves toward
closing down the company by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with your plan is that it is no plan,'' Superior
Court Judge Jack L. Lintner in Middlesex County said as he rebuked
state officials and a deputy attorney general, Josh Lichtblau, for
giving him only verbal assurances that there would be no transition
problems for HIP's 165,000 policyholders. ``You are going to be
required to give me a complete plan by this Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lintner ticked off the shortcomings he found in the State
Department of Banking and Insurance's interim plan submitted
Wednesday for HIP, the state's fourth largest health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plan did not make clear which hospitals and which
doctors would agree to continue seeing HIP members at discounted
rates, set no procedures to guarantee continuity for patients with
ongoing treatment and had no mechanism to allow for quick
certification of HIP-employed doctors who want to move to other
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the state to create an ombudsman for patients,
provide for the orderly transfer of medical records, insure
prescription coverage and assist employers faced with finding new
plan options for their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over a courtroom packed with dark-suited lawyers
representing landlords of the 23 HIP centers, doctors and hospitals
owed money by HIP, HIP employees and some unions, Lintner said that
until now, not enough attention had been paid to patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all concerned about the money you are owed, and I'm not
concerned with that at this time,'' Lintner told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week Lintner had seemed to give his blessing to the
state's plan on HIP when he refused to grant a special hearing to
consider the proposal by HIP Health Plans Inc., the New York parent
company, to keep the insurer functioning but scaled down.
</P>
<P>
   After then, the judge said, he had been deluged with motions
highlighting ``the predicament of the insured'': whether
policyholders would still be served in the transition period.

USC, UCLA GOLFERS SHOW TRUE COLORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Stadler wore his cardinal and gold as proudly as he wore
the green jacket he earned at the 1982 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   But he says ``Nope'' when asked if much USC-UCLA rivalry carries
over onto the PGA Tour _ particularly when the tour returns to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said the burly, bushy-mustached man who was a
two-time All-American honors at USC two decades ago. ``You give
everybody a little needle once in a while when you can, but it's no
big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On that point, however, the Walrus appears to be in a minority
as seven former Bruins and Trojans gather at Riviera Country Club
for this week's Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said ex-Bruin Steve Pate when asked if the
mustachioed rivalry extends beyond college. ``Some things never
change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, certainly,'' added Scott McCarron, another former
Bruin. ``Any time USC and UCLA are playing in anything, I'm always
rooting against USC, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Simpson, also a USC All-American, contends the rivalry
remains on tour, even though he calls it a ``friendly''
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get along really well,'' said Simpson, an NCAA champion
with the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey Pavin is one of my good friends, and I like Duffy
(Waldorf), and Steve Pate and Scott McCarron. They're all great
guys. We might have fun with each other, but there's no huge
rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Those four Bruins will join Stadler, Simpson and USC alum Dave
Stockton Jr. this week, and it might be difficult to pick a
favorite in the mustachioed rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bruins' side, Pavin is a two-time Nissan champion, 1995
U.S. Open champion and seems to have recovered from the hand injury
that contributed to his missing the Nissan cut at Valencia Country
Club last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pate was nipped in last month's Bob Hope Chrysler Classic by
David Duval's tour-record tying final round of 59 and is playing
well enough to qualify for next week's World Match Play
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf knows and likes the course, which sets up well for his
left-to-right game. And McCarron entered the final round of the '97
Nissan one stroke behind eventual winner Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Trojans, their old guard is holding up remarkably well.
Stadler won the '96 Nissan at age 42, finishing a stroke ahead of
Simpson _ who finished seventh last week in a strong title defense
at the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, Jr. brings USC golfing blue blood to Riviera's table.
The sixth-year tour player is the son of former Trojans
All-American Dave Stockton, who won the Nissan (then Los Angeles
Open) in '74 and won two PGA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever school's pennant flys figuratively highest in the
Riviera locker room come Sunday afternoon, it seems a good bet the
preceding days will produce their share of jibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Pate, the Bruins' 1983 Pac-10 champion who
resides in Agoura Hills. ``But now that UCLA's a football school,
it seems they (Trojans) don't want to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening, on the other hand, is sometimes unavoidable:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm constantly reminded about our eight-game losing streak in
football,'' said Simpson. He has come to terms with sports'
shifting sands, thanks to USC coach Mike Gillespie's defending
College World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I talk about baseball,'' Simpson said.

INTEL DEBUTS NEW PENTIUM III CHIP, PROCESSOR BUILT FOR HIGH
GRAPHICS   
</HEADLINE>
 III-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Watch a movie on your computer and you get to
pick the ending. Or surf the Web and see 3-D images. Or tour a
model home that hasn't been built.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. gave a preview Wednesday of some 200 applications
that use the strengths of its new Pentium III, the world's fastest
desktop processor.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker says the Pentium III and its
applications will add new life to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is very good and could be groundbreaking in
terms of graphics,'' said Scott Hudson, senior analyst for PC
technology at Scottsdale-based Cahners In-Stat Group.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others say the glitzy new features will be a tough
sell to business users who may balk at the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that people will be very impressed with this, but
most people will say, `That's nice, but I'd just as soon pass,' ''
Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate graphics, video and sound quality typically don't
prompt most businesses to plunk down big bucks for a new computer,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III begins rolling out of Intel's U.S. manufacturing
plants in Chandler and Albuquerque on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Software optimized for the new processor promises improvements
in voice recognition and in video streaming and 3-D animation for
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Pentium III will have a clock speed of 500 Mhz.
Intel is expected to release a 550 Mhz version in the second
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   With a background of bouncy swing music, Intel launched a $300
million marketing campaign for Pentium III, its largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz, including commercials promising that the Pentium III
will make the Internet ``a whole lot more fun,'' is more than just
an effort to sell the processor. It may also be a fight to curb the
trend of people prefering cheaper computers, said Van Baker, an
analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a pretty important campaign for Intel,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in computing, including Microsoft and
IBM, came out for Wednesday's preview in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image was there, showing off its Web site with 3-D
drawings of 25 products that users can move and turn around.
</P>
<P>
   If you have unique products, customers need to be able to see
what they are like, said Richard Thalheimer, The Sharper Image's
chairman and founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much more fun for the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Excite also showed its 3-D Web search engine, called
Excitextreme, that lets users pick where they want to go from a
rotating carousel of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the right way for people to navigate the Web,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   A space-age, 3-D, shoot-'em-up game by British-based Rage Games
Ltd. showed flowing water, cracks in the ground and other details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It added another level of realism,'' Rage sales director
Philip Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Several business applications were also on display, including
speech dictation products with greater accuracy, speed and
vocabulary. Pentium III-powered computers can learn a new user's
voice in about five minutes, while other machines typically take
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy concerns have overshadowed the processor's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Each chip comes with an identifying serial number intended to
enhance e-commerce security and help corporations track computers.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights groups were furious and demanded that Intel
change the signature setup, saying it would allow companies to
build detailed consumer profiles that could be sold. Intel
responded by changing the identifying system so that it can be
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The processor also comes with 70 new multimedia instructions
that improve graphics and video performance.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip will compete with Intel's own Pentium II, a 450 Mhz
processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively minor enhancement over the Pentium II,''
said Peter Glaskowsky, a senior analyst with ``The Microprocessor
Report,'' a newsletter published in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Pentium III does not make the Pentium II obsolete,
Intel argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Pentium II) is still a great machine,`` spokesman Tom
Waldrop said. ``This is the march of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel won't announce the processor's cost until it begins
shipping them. Typically, Intel starts its new processors at around
$800. That price results in a complete computer for about $2,000.
The processor price generally drops by half in about nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the Pentium III could start much lower than $800, as
competition among top-speed processor manufacturers drives prices
down.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is battling to prevent rivals such as Advanced Micro
Devices from stealing market share. Intel remains the world's
largest chipmaker, with $26.2 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   As prices drop, analysts expect the Pentium III to gain
popularity by the end of this year, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends on the wow factor,'' Hudson said. &QL;

 &HT;    Jasper proceedings focus on suspect's tattoos, activities
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The image of racism dominated the Jasper County
courthouse Wednesday as a jury inside viewed striking photographs
of white-supremacy tattoos, and black activists showed up outside
to denounce prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz of a police helicopter passing overhead could be heard
often inside the courtroom during the second day of testimony in
the trial of the white man accused of choreographing last summer's
dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a black man.
</P>
<P>
   John William ``Bill'' King, 24, sat stone-faced as the
prosecutor put on a slide show of his tattoos photographed at close
range: a black man hanging from a tree, a baby Jesus with horns,
the words ``Aryan Pride'' etched several inches high, an
upside-down pentagram covering his armpit, a logo for the
white-supremacy Confederate Knights of America, and neo-Nazi
lightning bolts with an ``SS'' symbol, among others.
</P>
<P>
   One spectator who sat in the courtroom for more than an hour was
Quanell X, a black activist from Houston who arrived with four
comrades dressed in black military fatigues. He said he came to
``look that no-good devil who lynched our brother in his cold eyes
and let him know that never again will you lynch our people and get
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of law enforcement officers patrolled the courthouse
square in anticipation of the black activists' appearance. Last
summer, Quanell X and his followers tried to shout out and clash
with Ku Klux Klan members demonstrating at the Jasper County
courthouse a few weeks after Byrd's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   When Quanell X left the courthouse Wednesday, he said the three
men accused of killing Byrd should be given the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray by God's grace and permission that, if they're found
not guilty by some delusionary jury, I pray that we give them hell
from the womb to the tomb, from the cradle to the damn grave,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   King, who contends he was at home when Byrd was dragged to death
on a rural road outside Jasper in the early morning hours of June
7, could receive the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Also accused of fatally pulling Byrd behind a pickup for nearly
three miles are King's friends and Jasper roommates: Shawn Allen
Berry, 24, and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31. Their trials have not
been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray on Wednesday also
showed the jury photos of the tattoos on Berry and Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who owned the pickup that allegedly dragged Byrd, has a
tattoo of a skull with devil horns and the word ``Brotherhood''
inscribed above it. Brewer has tattoos similar to King's, such as
the words ``Aryan Pride'' and the Confederate Knights of America
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Gray argues that King was a racist who orchestrated Byrd's
murder to gain recognition for a new hate group he was forming in
Jasper. King's tattoos are proof of his hatred toward blacks, Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tattoos speak for themselves,'' he said after testimony
ended Wednesday. ``It's proof _ state of mind, hate, anger _ the
kind of thing in somebody's mind it takes to commit this kind of
act.''
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys say the young man's tattoos prove nothing. ``I
don't think just the tattoos themselves make him a racist,'' said
court-appointed defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr.
</P>
<P>
   King got most of his tattoos while in state prison on a burglary
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony early in the day linked all three men to the pickup on
the night of Byrd's death and revealed that King may have occupied
himself that evening with romance and betrayal. He twice dodged his
pregnant girlfriend to have a three-hour tryst with a former lover
who was cheating on her common-law husband, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The former lover, Keisha Adkins, told a jury she spent about
three hours with King in his apartment while Brewer turned away
King's girlfriend, who had come to the apartment twice to look for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins testified that when she left the apartment about 1:45
a.m. on June 7, she saw King, Brewer and Berry drive away in
Berry's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins, her voice often wavering, also said she saw King's
cigarette lighter at his apartment the night of the dragging death.
The lighter is inscribed with his nickname, ``Possum.''
</P>
<P>
   Law officers told the jury a lighter with the word ``Possum'' on
it was found at the remote location where Byrd was allegedly beaten
before being chained to a pickup and dragged until he was beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a hint of their strategy, King's defense lawyers
challenged the manner in which detectives gathered evidence from
the dragging-death site and King's apartment. Under questioning,
detectives acknowledge they did not change gloves each time they
collected a new piece of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they have collected cigarette butts, beer
bottles, watches, the ``Possum'' lighter, shoes and other items
belonging to the three white men that link them to the bloody road
where Byrd was dragged.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the prosecutor, said the defense was trying to raise ``an
O.J. theory'' that evidence had been contaminated, a reference to
the defense strategy in O.J. Simpson's murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied there has not been any contamination,'' Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from court on Wednesday was King's father, who could be
heard moaning during some of the testimony on Tuesday. But more
than a dozen members of Byrd's family again occupied the front two
rows of the courtroom.

WU-TANG CLAN RAPPER ARRESTED IN L.A. FOR WEARING FORBIDDEN BODY
ARMOR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- One month after New York City police arrested
rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard for shooting at two officers during a
traffic stop, Los Angeles police had their own run-in with the
performer Tuesday night in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Police didn't have to dodge any bullets this time, but the
rapper -- whose real name is Russell Jones -- was ready for a
violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was arrested for wearing a bullet-resistant vest inside
his car, police said. He was charged with possessing body armor and
released after posting $18,000 in bail. The charges could carry a
prison sentence of 16 months to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the 29-year-old entertainer and convicted
violent felon, who also goes by the stage name Big Baby Jesus, from
owning or wearing any type of body armor, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police pulled over the Wu-Tang Clan rap group member at 10:45
p.m. Tuesday for driving erratically on Whitley and Yucca avenues,
one block north of Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's arrest was the latest incident involving the
controversial rapper during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Jones was arrested and accused of threatening to
kill his ex-girlfriend in Los Angeles. Two months later, he was
arrested after police said he threatened security guards at a blues
club in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City shootout occurred Jan. 15 when police pulled
Jones over for driving with his headlights off in Brooklyn. Police
arrested Jones and a passenger following a car chase, but
detectives failed to recover a gun and a grand jury cleared Jones
of attempted murder charges. Jones insisted he never fired at
police, saying the officers were scared by his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has survived two shootings, gained notoriety last
year when he rushed the stage of the Grammy Awards at Radio City
Music Hall in New York City. Seizing the microphone, he complained
about losing in the best rap album category.

POLICE PROBE RASH OF L.A.-AREA DOG POISONINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- One dog is dead and three others seriously ill in
a second rash of area dog poisonings, leaving residents on edge and
police looking for the suspects, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police investigators said someone walked through a
neighborhood in the suburban, San Fernando Valley community of
Winnetka on Monday night, throwing ground beef patties laced with
rat poison into back yards.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are identical to a series of dog poisonings in Eagle
Rock northeast of downtown Los Angeles last week, but authorities
believe the cases are unrelated, said Los Angeles police Officer
Richard Andert. In Eagle Rock, three dogs died and one was
critically injured. Police there still are looking for the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just awful. I don't have any words to describe how I feel
about this person that you could print,'' said Winnetka resident
Karen Wagner, whose dogs, Jon and Ayla, ate the tainted meat. Both
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sick and deranged. I hope they catch this person.''
</P>
<P>
   When caught, the person responsible could face felony charges of
cruelty to animals, which is punishable by imprisonment and fines.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Bernstein, president of Los Angeles' Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said she's pleased that police
are taking these reports seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who harms neighborhood animals is usually a local
resident with a problem who is afraid of dealing with it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually always people with a gripe. I know of many
cases where a person took a neighbor's cat or dog, took them to the
pound and had them euthanized,'' Bernstein said. ``There are
sometimes copycat crimes, but it's usually a person that can't deal
with a neighbor face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night Wagner thought Jon was bringing a ball into the
house about 9 p.m., but when she took a better look she realized it
was a fist-size ball of meat. The meat was partly frozen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Kurt, took a better look at the meat and found
green pellets inside. By that point, Jon was going into a seizure.
They rushed both dogs to a critical care veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pumped Jon's stomach and saved his life. We brought him
home (Wednesday) and he's resting,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's neighbor, Christina Barbato, said Wednesday that she
was planning to have a neighborhood meeting with residents, Andert
and animal control officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sick and it needs to stop. Neighbors need to be
aware,'' Barbato said.
</P>
<P>
   Andert said the best way to prevent a poisoning is to keep close
watch on your pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach residents and make them aware of the
problem,'' Andert said.

FORMER PROSECUTOR FACES FELONY DRUG CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Will Miller, a former prosecutor who put bad guys away
in New York and Seattle, now faces five felony drug charges and the
possibility of spending 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After officers battered down his front door Tuesday night, they
found syringes in an upstairs office, a little bit of
methamphetamine downstairs and Miller hiding in his attic.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning reversal for a man who seemed to have lived a
charmed life inside and outside a courtroom. He prosecuted crooks
in Brooklyn, Queens, then finally Seattle, winning promotions along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Luck seemed on his side. Eight years ago, muggers shot Miller in
the head, but he was hardly scratched. Last year, Miller walked
into the King County Courthouse in Seattle only to have security
officers discover a drug pipe and a small amount of methamphetamine
in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors didn't charge Miller. The incident did force him
to resign as a deputy prosecutor in King County and go into private
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But two months after the Washington state attorney general's
office decided that it couldn't make a case against Miller, he
allegedly began selling methamphetamine to a undercover detective.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents filed Wednesday say he sold an ounce of
suspected methamphetamine three times this year for $1,000 each to
the undercover detective three times. Subsequent tests on the
suspected drugs showed that they contained amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation culminated Tuesday night, when the detective
arranged to buy three ounces of methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Officers with the King County Sheriff's Office battered down the
front door of Miller's home in Seattle's Crown Hill neighborhood.
Officers arrested Miller in his attic and searched the house. They
found a scale, several syringes and a small amount of
methamphetamine, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old man, who court papers say was Miller's source for
drugs, also was arrested. The man has yet to be charged. But court
documents say he had gone to his car to get the drugs after the
undercover officer paid $2,400 for them.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was being held in a special unit of the King County Jail
Wednesday night. Prosecutors have asked that bail of $50,000 be
set, arguing that Miller ``is a flight risk and is a threat to the
community based on his drug trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   What proved to be Miller's undoing was a former roommate who had
been his alibi in the courthouse incident. A King County detective
who had investigated the incident left a business card with the
roommate, identified in court documents as Jeff Vinson.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson later called the detective with information about Miller,
sparking the investigation, said Jerrell Wills, a spokesman for the
King County Sheriff's Office. ``He felt somehow betrayed,'' Wills
said.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged drug buys and arrest took place in Seattle. But
county sheriff's officers rather than Seattle police handled the
investigation because the sheriff's officers had worked with Vinson
last year as they investigated the courthouse incident, Wills said.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office, which took several months
to decide not to prosecute Miller last year, acted swiftly this
week. The office, which is handling the case to avoid any conflict
of interest involving local prosecutors, filed three charges of
delivering amphetamine to the undercover detective, one charge of
trying to deliver amphetamine and one charge of possession of
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Miller faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted and a fine of
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction would be a reversal of fortune for Miller, once a
respected prosecutor in New York and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office in 1988 and
became a prosecutor specializing in sex crimes. In 1991, Miller
found himself on the wrong side of a gun, when a bullet grazed his
temple during a mugging in Brooklyn, according to the Long Island
newspaper Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow prosecutors in Seattle say Miller kept a laminated copy
of a New York Post story on the shooting in his office. It
proclaimed him a ``miracle'' prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1991, the Queens district attorney's office hired
Miller, putting him in the special victims bureau. Miller also
volunteered as a liaison to the gay and lesbian community. A year
later, Miller handled a high-profile investigation of a Korean gang
suspected of crimes such as kidnapping, robbery and rape.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the King County prosecutor's office in November 1995,
first handling juvenile cases, then moving to a so-called ``trial
team'' where he prosecuted car thefts, burglaries and assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he was known as ``D. Willas Miller.'' In Seattle,
co-workers knew him as ``Will Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   By March of last year, Miller was supervising new prosecutors
working mostly misdemeanor cases in District Court. He was on his
way to supervise the prosecution of a drunken-driving case on March
2 when the pipe and other items were found in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   That incident resulted in the possession charge that was lodged
against Miller on Wednesday. In November, Greg Canova, chief
criminal prosecutor in the state attorney general's Office, said he
couldn't file charges over the incident and expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   Miller contended at the time that he didn't know the drug pipe
and drugs were in his briefcase and that they weren't his.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, Canova said he has new evidence to support a
charge over the courthouse incident. He would not identify the new
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Vinson told investigators that the pipe and a scale
found in the briefcase were his. He had said the pipe and scale
were in a plastic box that he had lent to an acquaintance, who
might have been a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson got the box back and put it in Miller's briefcase on
March 1. The two had an argument, and Vinson left, never telling
Miller about the box.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they had little contact with Miller, who kept the
drapes closed on his little brick home.
</P>
<P>
   At least one neighbor, Gowri Shankar, suspected something
strange was going on at Miller's home. Monday at 11:15 p.m., a
young man dress in socks, pants and a T-shirt, knocked on Shankar's
door. The young man said he had been locked out of Miller's home
and asked to use the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Shankar introduced himself to Miller, who said
he had had an electrical fire. Shankar said he wondered aloud to
his wife whether the fire was the result of a methamphetamine lab
inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always something going on there _ a lot of
activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other neighbors said they saw little, until just after
supper time Tuesday night when they heard officers batter open
Miller's front door.

IOWA'S STRANGE SEASON NEARS END, OTHER NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ One way or another, it will all be over in, oh,
about six weeks. Iowa's basketball Season of Strange will come to
an end and sighs of relief will be heard across the heartland. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last April, Iowa announced that coach Tom Davis was retiring _
after this season. Lame ducks don't make good coaches; Ralph
Willard announced he was stepping down after this season at Pitt,
and the Panthers haven't won since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Davis and Iowa athletic director Bob Bowlsby denied last
April that Davis was being forced out. Davis said he was resigning,
and Bowlsby said the coach was retiring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff's one-and-done status could have far-reaching
effects. Iowa signed no players during the November early signing
period. The new coaching staff will have to start from Square One. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bowlsby said that his decision not to extend Davis' contract was
because of shortcomings in recruiting, scheduling, academics and
attendance. Bowlsby also backed up his decision with these facts:
Iowa has not advanced beyond the second round of the NCAA
Tournament since 1988 and had not won a Big Ten championship under
Davis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what Iowa basketball has been for a long time,'' senior
guard Kent McCausland said of Davis. ``For all of a sudden to say
all these things and not renew his contract, I think that's maybe a
little unfair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bowlsby's seat heated up when Hayden Fry retired as football
coach and the school was not quick enough to hire former Iowa
player Bob Stoops, who was hired by Oklahoma. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That coincided with the Hawkeyes' fast start _ they won 13 of
their first 14. Hawkeyes fans believe that Bowlsby was making a
mistake, and there were whispers of a grassroots campaign to save
Davis' job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Bowlsby appeared to be getting thin skinned when he asked
ESPN to reassign analyst Steve Yoder after Yoder made remarks that
were critical of Bowlsby's decision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The looming opening has made for a season of rumors. The mill
has ground out the following candidates: B.J. Armstrong, Fran
Fraschilla, Rick Majerus, John Calipari, Leonard Hamilton, Kevin
Stallings and Steve Alford. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, the Save Tom Davis talk has cooled along with Iowa's
winning ways. The Hawkeyes have lost six of nine, but they're still
probably in line for an NCAA Tournament bid, which would be a
fitting way for Davis to leave. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been crazy,'' junior guard Ryan Luehrsmann said
recently. ``You never know what you're going to hear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to get the most out of it _ share a moment with
him, a laugh here and there, get yelled at one last time or
whatever. I'm just thankful, and so is everybody else, to have the
chance to play for a legend like him.'' &QL; 
Spotlight &QL; 
 &QL; 
Michigan State clicking &QL; 
with healthy point guard &QL; 
 &QL; 
Now that Mateen Cleaves is healthy, Michigan State has regained its
engine, its driving force. And the 23-4 Spartans appear headed for
the Big Ten Conference title and a probable No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' well-being is crucial for Michigan State. His freshman
year, he was slowed by a back injury and extra weight. Last season
as a sophomore, Cleaves was in top shape, and he led the Spartans
to a 22-8 record and a Sweet 16 berth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This season, Cleaves was hobbled by ankle and shoulder injuries.
In the Great Eight Classic against Duke, Cleaves missed 14 shots.
Because their point guard was not on his game, the Spartans started
4-3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult for Cleaves, knowing that he was a
player-of-the-year candidate, but not being able to play at a high
level because his body wouldn't allow it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing how people are going to be aiming at you, it was hard
to get ready mentally because I knew I didn't put in the work to
play some of those early games,'' Cleaves said. ``It was killing me
because I knew I couldn't do some of the things I normally
would.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first 12 games, Cleaves averaged 11.6 points, 6.8 assists
and 4.4 turnovers. In his next seven games, he averaged 11.4
points, 6.9 assists and 3.0 turnovers. And even though his team
lost _ its last loss _ at Wisconsin in early January, Cleaves knew
he was back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw I could get to the basket, get around people and
finish,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
quick hits &QL; 
 &QL; 
Geographically challenged &QL; 
North is North and South is South and never mind that the NCAA
Tournament committee doesn't appear to know how to read a map. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two first-round sites in this year's tournament are Indianapolis
and New Orleans. The trouble is, Indianapolis is in the ``South''
Region and New Orleans is in the ``Midwest''. Logical explanation,
please. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to read a map,'' chuckled Kentucky athletic
director C.M. Newton chairman of the tournament committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marchiony, NCAA media coordinator for men's basketball, said
that after the sites were selected, a problem arose with dates and
building availability that caused the committee to ignore geography
in favor of convenience. &QL; 
Clank, clank, clank &QL; 
The gang that couldn't shoot straight resides at Arkansas-Pine
Bluff. In their first season in the Southwestern Athletic
Conference, the Golden Lions are proving that shooting accuracy is
not their strong suit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas-Pine Bluff is shooting 37.8 percent from the field,
26.5 percent from 3-point range and 58.4 percent on free throws.
That helps explain its 2-21 overall and 1-12 SWAC records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Damon Horton, though, is on a roll. The junior point guard has
made 20 of its past 47 shots. He started the season missing 50 of
his first 58 shots, so now his shooting percentage is up to 26.7
percent. &QL; 
Tournament signs &QL; 
If you believe in fate and omens, here are two reasons to believe
that Duke and Michigan State, two of the nation's hottest teams,
are serious Final Four/national championship contenders: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duke, 25-1 going into last night's game at Florida State, is off
to the best start in school history. The previous best was 24-2,
accomplished by Final Four teams in 1962-63, 1985-86 and 1991-92
(the '92 team won the national championship). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is 13-0 at Breslin Center with one remaining home
game (Sunday against Wisconsin). If the Spartans go undefeated, it
will be the second time in 100 years that a Spartans team has been
perfect at home. The other time that happened was 1978-79, Michigan
State's national championship season. &QL; 
Quotebook &QL; 
Saint Louis coach Charlie Spoonhour on his team's deliberate
style: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We control tempo. We don't like to use the word slow. Recruits
might be listening.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated in conference &QL; 
Through Tuesday's games, four teams _ Duke (Atlantic Coast),
Winthrop (Big South), College of Charleston (Southern) and Utah
(Western Athletic) _ were undefeated in conference play. A look at
teams undefeated in conference play the past five years and how
those teams fared in the NCAA Tournament: &QL;

   INDONESIA-TIMOR (Washington) _ For almost a quarter-century,
relations between Indonesia, the world's fourth most-populous
nation, and the United States _ as well as the rest of the outside
world _ have often stumbled over the fate of half of an
impoverished island so small and so remote that even many
Indonesians would have trouble finding it on a map. But with the
utterance of a few words by Indonesia's new president last week,
the territory, East Timor, suddenly appears to be on the brink of
independence. That has left the Clinton administration and other
governments puzzling over how to respond to Indonesia's turnaround.

TCU WOMEN AIM FOR FIRST WINNING DIVISION I SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Flying into Colorado Springs, Colo., a couple
of weeks ago, coach Mike Petersen passed the time by flipping
through a flight magazine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Way back, in a small article, a single line caught his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said: `Do you know what happens when you chase two
rabbits?' '' Petersen said. ``I thought that was a pretty good
thought, so when we're sitting in the team meeting, I said: `OK,
what happens if you try to chase two rabbits?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And Jill \RSutton\S says, `Oh, they both get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said: `Where did you see that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And she said: `I read the flight magazine, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A coach utters 457 phrases in a season trying to inspire
players. Petersen figures two, maybe four, actually do. But rabbits
did this time.
</P>
<P>
   Goals are no longer called goals around TCU, but rabbits. Horned
Frogs players have T-shirts, too, that read, ``Chasing one WAC-ky
wabbit at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The one rabbit that is being chased now is Nevada-Las Vegas. In
theory, the rabbits are all supposed to be equal, but they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   This one is bigger.
</P>
<P>
   If TCU defeats UNLV tonight, it will be the Frogs' 14th victory
of the season and will clinch their first winning season since
becoming an NCAA Division I program in 1982. It would also mark the
first time the Frogs have won more than 13 games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot because it's a big step for the program,''
TCU guard Amy Sutton said. ``I think we'd all like to be a part of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   They were almost there last season. TCU reached 13 victories on
Feb. 5, 1998. They never really came close to getting No. 14, going
0-7 to finish 13-15.
</P>
<P>
   Too many rabbits, not enough focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different teams. I really don't want to get into that
because I promised this team that I wouldn't,'' Petersen said. ``So
I guess the one thing I would say is: The kids who were here last
year and went through the whole tailspin that we went through are
very focused on not going through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems last year were touchy ones, and no one really much
wants to talk about what they were like.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to describe it might be by describing how they are
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost like an eighth-grade slumber party,'' Amy Sutton
said. ``You know how you sometimes hear teams say: `We're all
friends on this team.' Only, it's not fake, and it doesn't end when
practice ends. We really are friends, well, until ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Until, it's ``room-war'' time.
</P>
<P>
   On TCU's last trip, it was twins Jill and Amy Sutton against
Karen Clayton and Sally Spencer. The rest of the players acted as
spies and room guards and instigators.
</P>
<P>
   The pranks and laughs were straight out of an all-girls,
sleep-over camp, including toilet-papering and short-sheeting and
key-changing.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen had to call a peace summit for fear his players would
be up all night giggling and be unprepared against Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs defeated Wyoming for victory No. 13, bringing about
the rabbit with the No. 14 on its back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we had never talked about it,'' Petersen said.
``When we sat down at the start of the season, we talked about here
is a number of goals and the first one after `we're going to get
better every day' was 14 wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't want to downplay it, but at the same time, if our
only goal is to win 14 games what are we going to do in those last
four games?''
</P>
<P>
   Three regular-season games remain after tonight and then, at
least, one more in the Western Athletic Conference tournament. The
Frogs have already beaten three of the four remaining teams on
their regular-season schedule, including UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   So the way Petersen has it figured, the Frogs could be looking
at 17 victories and then maybe a shot at a bid to the Women's
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It's a thought that was so ludicrous a couple of years ago that
Petersen, the perpetual optimist, is even a little nervous in
saying it.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs had gone 91-287 in 14 seasons in Division I
before Petersen arrived for the 1996-97 season. SMU coach Rhonda
Rompola witnessed some of the lean years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day,'' Rompola said. ``It's a team that
when they step on the floor, no matter who they're playing, they
think they can win. You didn't get that feeling from their teams a
couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Frogs step on the floor tonight, it will be with the
knowledge they can make history and the belief that this isn't the
last rabbit out there waiting to be chased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen is just one of the many things we're hoping to do,''
Amy Sutton said. ``I think we're ready to finish this season
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   One WAC-ky wabbit at a time.

PANEL: LOS ANGELES SCHOOL BOARD MUST CHANGE ITS WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Laying blame for Los Angeles' battered
educational system squarely on the school board, a group of
high-profile civic leaders will issue a long-awaited report today
challenging the members to fundamentally change the way they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture and operations of the board, as a whole, are
dysfunctional and undermine the efforts of even highly capable
people,'' reads the report by the Committee on Effective School
Governance.
</P>
<P>
   The board must cease micromanaging schools Superintendent Ruben
Zacarias, a persistent problem that undercuts his authority, spawns
endless meetings and distracts board members from more serious
issues, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The board should craft with Zacarias a cohesive, long-term plan
to raise student achievement, approve it by the end of the summer
and then let the superintendent implement it without interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the power to the CEO and get out of his way,'' said
committee member Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel
of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be released at a news conference this morning.
Committee members presented it Wednesday to Daily News editors and
reporters on the condition that they not discuss it with board
members or others before the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The report marks the high-powered committee's entrance into the
fray of local education reform.
</P>
<P>
   With members drawn from some of the city's most prominent civic,
business and educational institutions -- including the Urban
League, Salomon Smith Barney and USC -- the committee was formed in
the fall to push for change in the mammoth Los Angeles Unified
School District but has taken no firm positions until now.
</P>
<P>
   Even before it announced its intentions, the group had the
attention of Board of Education members, who already were facing
efforts to break up the school district and Mayor Richard Riordan's
initiative to elect a new board majority. School board members
noted their close relationships with many people on the committee
and hoped the new group would become an ally rather than another
foe.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report takes pains to avoid attacking individual
board members, saying that all seem well-intentioned. Committee
members said Wednesday that the district has made some progress in
improving education, with student test scores slowly rising.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also pointedly declined to back specific
candidates for the April school board elections, an idea discussed
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the report still gives a bruising assessment of the board's
performance, saying it operates without a clear mission or
understanding of its role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school board does not have an overall plan for student
achievement,'' said committee Co-Chairman Harold Williams,
president emeritus of the J. Paul Getty Trust. ``Its activities
aren't coherent, and it gets into things it shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report says, the board second-guesses the
superintendent, interfering with his ability to run the district's
operations. Board members routinely intercede in such personnel
matters as transfers and promotions that should be handled by
Zacarias, it says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear it throughout the system -- you hear about
individuals being protected by school board members,'' Williams
said. ``That undermines accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps the most glaring example of micromanagement, the
report criticizes the board's decision to reopen contract
negotiations with the district's unions over Zacarias' strong
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Board members also waste time, the report says, by reviewing any
construction expense greater than $50,000, a tiny fraction of the
district's $6.6 billion budget. Instead, the board should leave
such projects to district staffers and create a reliable,
independent auditing procedure to make sure they don't run awry.
</P>
<P>
   Although committee members praise the board for trying to
implement reforms, they say the board seems to make many
commitments without coordinating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a strategic plan to guide priorities, schools are
often asked to pursue conflicting goals, such as expanding
libraries, labs, and parent centers, and implementing
state-mandated class-size reductions -- which require the same,
limited available space,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the situation, the district needs a broad, three- to
five-year plan concentrating on a few achievable, measurable goals,
the report says. The board must give its superintendent the power
needed to implement that plan, including authority over collective
bargaining agreements and the ability to reconstitute failing
schools, the committee argues.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said Wednesday that they wanted the school
board to begin work on such a plan in July -- after any new board
members elected in April join the panel -- and approve it within 60
days. The committee also will call on all school board candidates
to pledge to implement the report's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever is elected come July, we're going to be asking, Where
is the plan?'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the committee will host a series of meetings with
parents, teachers and other community members seeking input on its
report. A final copy will be presented to the board in July.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he did not know what the committee would do should
the school board ignore or fail to act on its recommendations. But
in light of growing public frustration over the state of Los
Angeles' schools, he hoped board members would see the need for
such radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Board members have to realize, this may be their last
chance,'' he said.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   a week since I got the hot ``tip'' about discrimination against
students at Shadow Mountain High School, and the young man on the
telephone wanted to know why I hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was officially sanctioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he's told. ``I spoke to the principal about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's racism! Doesn't that bother you, man?'' he said, his
anguished voice rising in hope of unearthing some shred of human
decency and fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents also called. And other students.
</P>
<P>
   It was bigotry, they all said, the kind of blatant bias based on
skin color that people like me are supposed to expose, to hold up
for public ridicule and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would write about it if the situation were reversed,'' one
parent told me. ``And the TV people would be all over it, too. It
would be a BIG story all over the country. Can you imagine?''
</P>
<P>
   If the situation were reversed, the story would go something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   White students at Shadow Mountain High School were invited to
listen to a speech by a successful White man in connection with an
ongoing series of school-sanctioned programs celebrating White
History Month. Pizza was served at the event. No Black students
were invited.
</P>
<P>
   And, yeah, every hack in town, me included, would have jumped
it.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   It involved Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at overwhelmingly White Shadow Mountain arranged
for a principal at another high school, a successful
African-American man, to speak to Black students at the Shadow
Mountain. About 50 attended, Principal Connie Liddle told me. Free
pizza was served.
</P>
<P>
   The event was followed, almost immediately, by whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me it would be taken that way,'' said
Principal Liddle. ``It was really very much of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal's office took complaints. The newspaper. Talk
radio stations. From behind the high walls of their red-tiled
enclaves in north Phoenix, lily-white crusaders stormed forth,
armed with the swords of self-righteousness and the shields of
moral indignation.
</P>
<P>
   They believed the attention to Black History Month had gone too
far. It was political correctness in the extreme, they said, and
they were determined to fight it _ with even MORE political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be silly if it weren't so unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   For most kids, I'd guess the only thing worse than being
excluded from a Black History Month lecture _ or any speech about
history _ is being ``invited'' to such a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had calls from parents because the kids went home and said
it was unfair,'' Principal Liddle said. ``I've said to those
parents, `Apparently, I made a mistake.' Sometimes you do.
Sometimes you misjudge. If I erred, then I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Will administrators face the same problem on Cinco De Mayo? And
Columbus Day? And St. Patrick's Day?
</P>
<P>
   Will there be an uproar when non-members of the track team or
marching band or chess club aren't invited to a group meeting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly will think twice before I do anything like that
again,'' Liddle said. ``All we can do is to try to enjoy each
other's differences, and to develop awareness as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a longtime White man, I might be able to provide
some insight into the expressed outrage.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, we're a fair-minded, fair-skinned people. We
accept and even encourage minority groups who want to celebrate
their uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   We've adapted to changes in public policy and personal conduct.
We've adjusted to alterations in language and lifestyles. But, even
we can be pushed too far, and in this case, I believe we we were.
</P>
<P>
   You can deny us our own special minority status, our own special
lingo, our own special history month. You can deny us access to any
lecture you want.
</P>
<P>
   But, when you start denying us free pizza . . . &QL;
